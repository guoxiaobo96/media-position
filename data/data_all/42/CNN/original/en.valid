(cnn) in recent years and especially since the death of george floyd, high school and college students have been using social media to expose everyday racism they confront at school. a r ecent story in the new york times about two high school graduates from virginia was particularly dramatic.\n\naccording to the times, one student, jimmy galligan, shared in june 2020 a three-second snapchat video of his classmate, mimi groves, using a racial slur. groves had first sent the video message to a friend in 2016 when she was 15 and had just gotten her learner's permit. in the video, she looks into the camera and says, i can drive, [racial slur].\n\nsomeone shared it with galligan a few years later, when both he and groves were seniors. galligan kept the video and after groves had chosen a college, he posted the video publicly. as he later described it to the times, the video taught someone a lesson.\n\nshortly after galligan posted the video, groves' acceptance to the university of tennessee's cheer team was revoked. according to the times, under pressure from their students, alumni and the public, the university encouraged groves to withdraw, which she did.\n\ngroves told the times that the clip began as a private message and that she is disgusted that such a word came out of her mouth. at the time, she said, i didn't understand the severity of the word, or the history and context behind it, because i was so young.\n\ngalligan has said he does not regret his actions. their story has drawn an uproar of commentary in response, especially on social media, and among other media outlets, some referring to galligan as vindictive for his lack of regret about the consequences groves has faced. the times has also come under criticism for amplifying the story.\n\nthis story comes at a time when many schools, like other public institutions, are struggling to address their failures to address systemic racism. and while a very public outing and shaming of a few students here and there might offer some sense of justice, it, unfortunately, lets too many students, parents and educators -- really the whole community -- off the hook.\n\ntoo often, finding offenders and outing them becomes the focus, instead of how the adults -- the educators and parents -- can support black, indigenous and students of color and give all students a thoughtful education. it allows too many communities to smugly point fingers and not to look at themselves.\n\none problem with making someone like groves emblematic of broader racism harbored within an institution is that it risks absolving others of examining their own behaviors. it makes her the exception, instead of recognizing what she said as a symptom of the prevailing climate at her school and in her school district.\n\nwhen galligan posted the video on social media, in june 2020, both he and groves were seniors and had spent four years steeped in the culture of heritage high school in leesburg, virginia, which students of color there say was, as the times described it , rife with racial insensitivity, including casual uses of slurs.\n\nthe loudoun county school district -- one of the wealthiest counties in the country -- commissioned a report , presented to the superintendent in june 2019, which showed a pattern of students and teachers using racial slurs widely and disproportionate disciplinary measures meted out to white and black students, who spoke of their growing sense of despair that racist events, large and small, are ignored and school leaders do not believe their reports of mistreatment.\n\njust watched activist: i'm genuinely exhausted as a young black woman replay more videos ... must watch activist: i'm genuinely exhausted as a young black woman 19:12\n\nafter the report published, the district released a plan to fight systemic racism and issued a formal apology for the district's history of segregation. in june 2020, the school board also put out a statement following the death of george floyd affirming their commitment to a safe, empathetic, respectful, and supporting learning environment for every student, acknowledging that loudoun county is not immune from the effects of systemic racism and noting that even as we work for positive change, we recognize that harm is done by racist and hate-filled statements and acts.\n\nheritage high school officials did not respond to the times' requests for interviews.\n\ngalligan, whose mother is black and father is white, told the new york times that he and other students had endured years of racist harassment. when students like galligan and classmate muna barry (also quoted in the times sharing her experiences as a black student) are in the position where reporting racism doesn't bring about real change, educators have failed.\n\nloudoun county may be notable for the previous failures of some of their educators to lead by example. unfortunately, they are not alone. too many high schools are unsafe environments where students who are targeted for their racial identity are left to fend for themselves. it should surprise no one to see young people wielding their skills on social media as a weapon or a shield when they have been otherwise ignored.\n\nstudents at many predominantly white private high schools and colleges across the united states, and at some public schools, have shared on instagram examples of racism from other students as well as their teachers. many of these conversations focus on students and alumni supporting one another, and validating the difficult experiences they have gone through.\n\nschool leaders who have not already done so should take a long hard look at these instagram accounts, which detail painful experiences of social exclusion, overt racism and academic discrimination. real change requires more than just discipline for the offenders. schools need to proactively teach anti-racism without doing more harm -- which means they need training in the best methods to do so.\n\nin addition to incorporating anti-racist teaching into the curriculum, schools must hold young people accountable for racist actions in the immediate setting where they occur and later offer a thoughtfully planned restorative process that offers a chance for students to learn, heal and understand the impact of their actions.\n\nit is especially important for students who have been targeted to be heard and to be able to participate in the restorative process in a way that prioritizes their safety.\n\nfinding the student who is imprudent about using a slur on social media focuses all the anger on that student. what about the student who anonymously leaves a note in a locker? what about the student who keeps other kids off the team? what about the kids who quietly make it so uncomfortable for outsiders that some extracurricular activity is completely closed to kids of a certain ethnic group, religion or gender? what about a school counselor who systematically counsels black students away from ap or honors classes?\n\nanother challenge with canceling someone for racial ignorance, particularly in a case like groves, who expressed deep regret for her behavior, is where do they go? how do they move forward? as the times story points out, groves posted in support of black lives matter as a senior and yet had used the n-word as a 9th grader. (a black friend of groves told the times groves had apologized about the offensive post long before it went viral. the friend defended groves in a snapchat post: we're supposed to educate people, not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.)\n\na true education in racial inequity would help any young teen understand how the word and the system that produced it have destroyed black lives before things ever got to this point and help them reckon with the both the reality of white privilege and their role in it.\n\ncollege can be a time for kids with white privilege to ask hard questions about how we live and the history of housing discrimination that produced environments like loudoun county and countless other communities in america. and about the ways that racism stokes fears that can put their black classmates' lives at risk\n\na lot of the reaction to the times story has focused on the cost to groves for something she did at 15: admission to her dream college and sports goals she'd pursued for years.\n\nof course, community college, which groves now attends, can offer a chance to learn about white privilege, too. but it might have been a great learning opportunity for groves to leave home and to live somewhere else for a bit. when i taught first year students at depaul university, i witnessed and encouraged this process with students in a new environment, reckoning with what they thought they knew, firsthand.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nthe university of tennessee told local media that groves withdrew voluntarily. her lawyer (who is also a cnn legal analyst) contested that characterization, saying she was forced to withdraw or her offer of admission would be rescinded. the case does nothing to change the wider culture of racism on college campuses. that change will take a lot more work than singling out one student.\n\neducators and parents need to focus on character over consequences. when a very few kids receive an outsized consequence and many others escape notice, the message can all too easily become a smug see we got that racist over there -- or, worse don't get caught -- instead of examine your bias and do the right thing.\n\na previous version of this op-ed listed an incorrect month and year for when jimmy galligan posted the video of mimi groves. it was posted in june 2020.
editor's note — follow anthony bourdain parts unknown on twitter and facebook\n\n(cnn) — with a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-north-face-off in the andes, peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain, nevado huascaran.\n\nthere's pisco. there's ceviche. and, yes, there's that famous trail. don't worry, we'll get to all of those. first, some things you may not already know:\n\n1. lima is worth seeing\n\nwhile most international travelers land in peru's current capital, many immediately continue on to the country's former capital, cuzco, in their rush to get to machu picchu.\n\nthat's a mistake.\n\nlima is peru's largest city by far. it's home to more than a quarter of peru's roughly 30 million people, has wonderful food, the beautiful miraflores district (where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye-catching patterns each time the tide rolls out) and excellent museums.\n\nthe museo larco and its erotic gallery is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms. reproductions of these works pop up all over peru, notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood.\n\nmuseo larco (larco museum), bolivar 1515, lima; +51 1 461 1312\n\n2. you're gonna love the ceviche\n\nfresh, raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue-tingling spices, ceviche is peru's most popular dish, a must-try for any visitor.\n\nin lima, internationally famed la mar is a great place to try it, but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country, from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants.\n\nla mar , 770 av. la mar, lima; +51 1 421 3365\n\n3. there's more to peru than incas\n\nmost tourists come to peru to see machu picchu or other inca ruins, with maybe a few catholic churches thrown in for balance. this makes it easy to conclude, there were the incas, then the spanish came, which brings us to where we are now.\n\nin fact, the inca were a bit like mitt romney's bain capital: they had a knack for taking control of long-established things and making them their own. the incan state didn't emerge until the 1200s. it became an empire in the 1400s, and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533, officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day.\n\nthat said, the norte chico people of peru built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures, such as the paracas and the moche.\n\nwas the incan era a highlight of peruvian history? unquestionably. but when peruvian museums boast artifacts from before christ, focusing exclusively on atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the gutenberg press.\n\n4. pisco rules\n\nwatch out for this stuff -- pisco goes fast. sean cunningham\n\nperu's beverage of choice is pisco, a brandy made from grapes. it's also adored in chile, inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace.\n\navailable in numerous brands at varying prices, pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form, meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances, which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to pisco's blowtorch nuances.\n\nthe most famous cocktail is the pisco sour, consisting of lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, ice and angostura bitters. there are assorted variations, such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness.\n\nif you'd rather just have a beer, you're in luck -- the local brews are good, with cusqueña being a particularly refreshing option.\n\n5. cash is king, ideally in small bills\n\ntravelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that won't take mastercard or visa, much less american express. peru offers an extra twist: occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them.\n\nin general, peruvians like their soles (the currency is the nuevo sol) in small denominations: a fifty (roughly $20) is ok, but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change.\n\nthat noted, peruvians tend to put great stock in u.s. dollars, so even if an establishment doesn't take credit cards and you don't see an atm, you may still be able to buy dinner or souvenirs. make sure your u.s. and other foreign currency is in pristine shape -- many merchants and hotels will reject torn or overly worn bills.\n\n6. altitude adjustment amounts to common sense\n\nperu is a mountainous land, and you have to handle heights if you're going to cuzco, machu picchu and other landmarks of incan culture.\n\nhow to prepare? the easiest method is drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you'll be fine. you can also consume stimulating coca leafs, whether in tea or by chewing them.\n\n7. the plumbing requires some tlc\n\nmachu picchu leaves visitors breathless. cris bouroncle/afp/getty images\n\nexpect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet.\n\nwhile peruvian plumbing handles your waste, it doesn't do toilet paper, which must be put in the bin next to the bowl. some bathrooms have signs stating this rule, others assume you know: remember and spare yourself begging for a plunger in broken spanish.\n\n8. the inca trail is genuinely difficult\n\nalong the famed trail you'll often be reminded of the peruvian proverb: when the road is long, even slippers feel tight.\n\nthe inca trail largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs weren't meant to be covered by mortals. the result is that the steps feel quite high for those who don't answer to kobe or lebron.\n\nif just reading this makes your knees swell, you may be in trouble. in addition, while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated, there'll come a moment when you're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you.\n\nthrow in the chance of heavy rains -- test your waterproof gear pretrek to make sure it's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp.\n\n9. there are ways to ease your inca pain\n\ndepending on the company guiding you on the trail, it's possible to get porters to carry your tent, sleeping bag, food and ... well, they'll essentially carry everything, including you, should your body completely fall to pieces.\n\nporters race ahead to the night's camp and assemble everything before parties arrive, then cook and serve multiple-course meals, in certain cases on white linen table clothes. the result after a hard day's walk is that you feel like you've stepped out of deliverance and into howard's end. speaking of porters ...\n\n10. porters are the toughest guys in the country\n\nmachu picchu porters are even tougher than the trail. sean cunningham\n\nwhether you're on your own or traveling like an english lord in the colonies, you'll encounter porters on the inca trail. these men tend to be farmers or laborers looking to earn extra money.\n\nthey carry up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear -- the weight limit is a recent development, they used to handle positively spine-shattering loads -- and they carry it fast. some actually run along the trail, somehow avoiding shredded ankles as they navigate uneven, wet stones just to ensure all's ready before the tourists stagger into camp.\n\nif you feel like racing your fellow hikers, great. do not test the porters: they're pros, and you're at best a promising amateur.
wanted: $6 million in missing gaming chips. last seen: the lavish wynn casino in macau.\n\npolice are hunting for millions of dollars in casino chips after they were stolen -- allegedly by one of wynn's own croupiers -- raising security concerns in the world's biggest gambling hub.\n\nthe heist happened tuesday at the wynn macau (wynmf), one of the marquee destinations in a chinese territory whose gambling revenues dwarf those of las vegas.\n\nmacau police told cnnmoney that a dealer at the wynn macau and a potential accomplice have been arrested and that they are not currently looking for other suspects. they declined to identify the two people by name.\n\nrelated: macau's best casinos: a 2018 guide\n\npolice didn't say how the stolen chips were taken past casino security. but local media reported that the suspect allegedly stuffed them into a bag in a vip room and simply carried them out.\n\nto turn the chips into hard cash, the thieves or their associates would eventually need to bring them back into the casino.\n\nwynn macau is controlled by wynn resorts (wynn), the las vegas casino firm founded by billionaire mogul steve wynn. wynn macau didn't respond to requests for comment friday.\n\ncasino operators could face pressure from authorities to tighten up oversight of gaming rooms following the theft, according to vitaly umansky, an analyst at investment firm sanford bernstein.\n\nrules around gambling in macau are more relaxed than in las vegas, he said. most of the high-stakes action in macau takes place in so-called vip rooms, which aren't run by the casinos themselves but by separate junket operators from mainland china.\n\nthat makes it difficult for casinos to manage exactly what goes on inside.\n\nthe junkets get a lot of leeway inside the rooms in terms of how money changes hands and how chips change hands. that's something that may need to get evaluated, umansky said.\n\nbig heists in the city's casinos are rare, but they do happen. in 2015, a junket operator said it had been scammed out of more than $30 million. that incident also happened at a wynn casino.\n\nrelated: china jails top casino exec over gambling crimes\n\ngambling is a big business in macau, a former portuguese colony.\n\nthe city's revenues from games like baccarat and blackjack are about five times bigger than those generated on the las vegas strip.\n\nmacau's casinos raked in just over $33 billion last year, an increase of about 20% from the year before.\n\nthat snapped a multi-year losing streak for the gambling industry in the city. macau is popular with visitors from mainland china, where gambling is illegal.\n\nrevenues began falling in 2014, hurt by a far-reaching crackdown on corruption by chinese president xi jinping. that deterred some big spenders from visiting macau's vip rooms.\n\n-- qiaoqiao yu contributed to this report.

(cnn) —\n\nimpeachment is the fever dream of democrats and progressives whose engagement brought democrats into the house majority.\n\nthat's why one congressman pledged to re-introduce articles of impeachment as soon as possible, and another said she promised her son of the president, we're going to impeach the motherf****r.\n\nit's a topic that's been on democrats' tongues since trump took office. but newly elected house speaker nancy pelosi and other democratic leaders have argued against serious consideration of that option.\n\ncontrolling the urge to impeach could be pelosi's most difficult challenge in her first months back in the speaker's office.\n\ndemocrats really want to impeach trump, but the country doesn't\n\n01:37 - source: cnn listen to rep. tlaib's controversial comments\n\nin a cnn poll conducted by ssrs in december, 80% of democrats said they thought the president should be impeached and removed from office. that's a strong tide for pelosi to fight.\n\nbut the reason she'll fight it is expressed in the same poll, where just 36% of independents and 7% of republicans said trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\njust 43% of the respondents at large said he should be impeached and half – 50% – said he should not.\n\ndemocrats want it. the country does not.\n\nimpeaching trump is different than removing him from office\n\ngetting rid of a president using impeachment is a two-step process. the house investigates the president for high crimes and misdemeanors and votes to impeach. but it's the job of the senate to hold a public trial and remove the president from office. and while democrats seized control of the house and the power to impeach trump, they actually lost a net of two seats in the senate. it would take 67 senators to vote to remove a president from office in the senate. there are 47 democrats and two independents who usually vote with them. unless and until a large number – 20! – of republican senators are willing to vote to remove trump from office, impeaching him in the house would only accomplish making impeachment the cause celebre of trump and his supporters.\n\npelosi noted this in an interview with usa today when she said any impeachment effort should be heavily bipartisan.\n\nif there's to be grounds for impeachment of president trump – and i'm not seeking those grounds – that would have to be so clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it before i think we should go down any impeachment path, she said.\n\ntrump's approval rating is not at impeachment levels\n\nthat 43% support for trump being impeached is nothing to sniff at – it's on par with the 43% who said richard nixon should be impeached in march of 1974, not long before he resigned to avoid impeachment. but trump's approval rating is much higher than nixon's at that time.\n\ngranted, trump's approval rating is much lower than bill clinton's at the time of clinton's impeachment. but the clinton lesson is one pelosi probably remembers very well. republicans' impeachment effort against clinton backfired and his popularity actually grew as the process wore on. he also survived the trial in the senate.\n\nthe real prize for democrats would be winning in 2020\n\ndemocrats won't have a chance to strengthen their hand in the senate until the next election in 2020, which also happens to be when trump is up for re-election. beating him and putting a democrat in office is probably a much more tantalizing idea to someone like nancy pelosi than impeaching trump. her most recent comments on impeachment, made to nbc news just before she was sworn in as speaker, were interesting on this point, when she said no decision should be made until special counsel robert mueller delivers his report on the russian election interference investigation.\n\nwe shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason and we shouldn't avoid it for a political reason, she said.\n\nimpeachment takes a long time\n\nif democrats do ultimately move to impeach trump, the process would be all-consuming and take a long time. the starr report was released on september 11, 1998. the house voted to impeach bill clinton three months later on december 19, 1998. the senate didn't acquit him until february of 1999.\n\nnixon resigned rather than be impeached, but the process was taking even longer. impeachment hearings against nixon began in the house judiciary committee in may of 1974 and nixon didn't resign until early august of 1974.\n\nit would be very hard for democrats to find oxygen for any other political platform during that time.\n\nmueller could change everything you've just read\n\nthe important caveat in what pelosi has said this week about impeachment is that mueller has not yet completed his investigation or issued any kind of report. key former trump aides are still cooperating with the russia investigation. whatever mueller finds could change the impeachment equation immediately and dramatically. or not. that's why it's important to wait and see what he finds. there are plenty of democrats who think there are already grounds to impeach trump right now. but they are not, as described above, in the majority.\n\nwhat mueller's report, if and when it comes, won't change is the date of the next general election. and while pelosi said democrats shouldn't avoid impeachment for political reasons, the fact remains that if or until republicans turn en masse against the president, it is probably a less attractive option for democrats to pursue than making a political argument to voters.

are his own. view more opinion articles on cnn.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nchina started out the year by doing something that no nation has done before: it landed a spacecraft and an accompanying rover on the far side of the moon with an ambitious scientific payload package and an exciting mission ahead to study the interior structure of the moon with the help of ground-penetrating radar, among other things.\n\nalmost equally impressive from a technical standpoint, china successfully placed a communication relay satellite into a lunar halo orbit to enable the command of, and communication with, both the spacecraft and rover, which do not have line-of-sight views of earth for direct radio contact.\n\nleroy chiao\n\ni had mixed feelings about these events.\n\ni was born in the united states, but my parents were both born in china, before they made their way to taiwan and immigrated to america in the 1950s. on the one hand, i am proud of my heritage and what china has accomplished. on the other, my family is american, and we take pride in us accomplishments. and because the apollo moon landing in 1969 was what inspired me to become an astronaut, i strongly believe the us can and should maintain a leading role in space exploration.\n\nchina has surpassed all other nations with a new achievement. though not exactly poised to take the united states' spot, china has fired a warning shot. the us must now step up its game to maintain its place as the leader.\n\nwhile china is preparing its space station, with plans to start sending parts up in 2020, america is planning to exit the international space station – the collaborative effort of 15 nations – in 2024-2025. according to an internal nasa document obtained by the washington post in early 2018, the plan is based on the unrealistic idea that we can transition management of the facility to a commercial entity.\n\nthe iss was never designed to be operated profitably. mission control centers in houston and moscow must be permanently staffed to support it, and launch and landing costs would be prohibitive to any commercial entity.\n\nmeanwhile, china could land astronauts on the moon as early as the 2030s, leapfrogging nasa in their lunar capabilities.\n\nbut perhaps the us should have seen this coming. in 1965, at the height of the apollo program, nasa had 5.3% of the federal budget. today, even though the budget is a slightly higher than it has been in recent years, it sits at around just 0.4%.\n\nwith those measly funds, nasa's ambitions are inevitably limited. this doesn't seem likely to change, with the white house seemingly more intent on creating the so-called space force, a new military branch, than investing in a real space exploration program.\n\nto be fair, we are still doing some amazing things in space. very recently, the new horizons spacecraft, after making groundbreaking discoveries and images of pluto, went on to image ultima thule – by far the most distant object ever imaged – at about 4 billion miles from earth. the osiris rex spacecraft established orbit around the 500 meter-diameter asteroid bennu, some 100 million km from earth. it will bring back a sample of the asteroid for analysis. the parker solar probe is performing ground-breaking measurements of our sun. the mars insight spacecraft just landed on mars to do studies that have never been done before, like seismic studies.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthese great missions notwithstanding, our space program could be on the verge of being outdone. it is a classic case of the tortoise and the hare. we have been so used to being on top for so long that our politicians have gotten complacent.\n\nindeed, the failure to prioritize our space capabilities is nothing new. president barack obama proclaimed that america would go to mars by the 2030s but did not sufficiently prioritize funding the program.\n\nnow we have come to the moment of china's ascendency in space exploration. we must face the reality that it has, in a small but significant way, shown the world that it can be the first to accomplish things in space, too. we had better realize this soon, or we may very well wake up to find that we are no longer top dog in the space business. and if we don't learn from our complacency in space, we could end up losing our edge in other areas as well.\n\ncorrection: this piece originally misstated how far bennu is from earth. it has been updated to reflect the correct distance.

why has he suddenly – and surprisingly – resigned? the clue is in the key section of his lengthy resignation email to his staff:\n\nserious multilateral negotiating experience is in short supply in whitehall, and that is not the case in the commission or in the council.\n\nthe government will only achieve the best for the country if it harnesses the best experience we have - a large proportion of which is concentrated in ukrep - and negotiates resolutely.\n\nsenior ministers, who will decide on our positions, issue by issue, also need from you detailed, unvarnished - even where this is uncomfortable - and nuanced understanding of the views, interests and incentives of the other 27.\n\nthe structure of the uk's negotiating team and the allocation of roles and responsibilities to support that team, needs rapid resolution.\n\nblunt and to the point. theresa may and brexit secretary david davis need unvarnished and uncomfortable advice. and they need to resource properly the machine that can deliver this advice.\n\nsir ivan did not suffer fools gladly. that is the best kind of person to work with if you are a politician who wants to know the facts – the full facts – so that you can craft a full and effective strategy.\n\nbut the current uk government seems intent on centralizing power and only hearing good news. for sir ivan rogers, the politics of brexit – and the future of his country – was too important to play along with this.\n\nin his email he carefully puts the word brexit in quotation marks, preferring to use the word exit about the uk's future. in similar fashion he talks about invoking article 50 rather than triggering it.\n\nthe more passive tone will have infuriated no. 10, because it reflects a horrible truth: that the uk is in a weak negotiating position. no amount of bluster from the pm or david davis can change that. what they can change – and what they have changed – is who leads for the uk in negotiations. but by forcing rogers out they have revealed how weak the current no. 10 operation is. as he says:\n\nwe do not yet know what the government will set as negotiating objectives for the uk's relationship with the eu after exit.\n\nthat is undoubtedly a question he has repeatedly internally. rather than answer it, no. 10 has made it clear that he is not needed. the broader signal is clear too: civil servants have to toe the government line and hide uncomfortable facts and challenging questions from ministers.\n\nthat is never a good idea. intellectual challenge leads to good policy and – in the end – good policy is good politics. when you face a negotiation which will determine the uk's prosperity for the coming decades, it is a dereliction of duty and leadership for no. 10 to want to close down internal debate.\n\nnegotiating brexit successfully with 27 different countries requires skills and deep relationships. one of the central relationships – between the government and the permanent civil service – has just been trashed and it will ultimately be to britain's cost when it comes to dealing with brussels.
(cnn) in a year of despair and a world full of hate, one fast food manager is doing what she can to spread a message of love.\n\napril didonna told a customer that she loved him after he ordered at the wendy's drive-thru where she works in oak harbor, washington. three months later, she's told thousands of people i love you.\n\nto know that the little three words could mean so much to so many people, it's overwhelming my heart with so much more love, didonna told cnn. i truly believe that if we just love each other, the world would be better.\n\nthe love routine kept going and didonna started tallying how many people have said i love you back. about 2,700 customers have reciprocated the message since she began counting on october 3, as of friday before her shift.\n\neach time a customer completes an order, the assistant manager sprinkles in her love message.\n\ni love you. you are loved. you matter. you do you. i love you, she says. that's what i say.\n\ndavid antis, senior vice president of operations for wtc ventures, the company that operates the wendy's franchise, said he's proud of didonna for spreading a positive message.\n\napril is a valued team member at our wendy's restaurant in oak harbor, washington. her kindness and positivity inspire us all, and we are grateful for the joy that she brings to our customers and restaurant team, he said.\n\nsometimes people are a little weirded out by hearing her message through a drive-thru speaker, didonna said.\n\nsometimes people are unsure, the 35-year-old said. then i kind of just explain it. if people can hate for no reason, why can't i love?\n\nusually, people see her point and many of them say i love you too, she said.\n\nher message can change someone's day\n\nother times, the positive message changes a person's day more than anyone would know, didonna said.\n\none time an elderly woman asked to speak with the voice behind the message. when didonna went to the window, she saw the woman crying.\n\nwhen didonna said she asked the woman if she was ok and what was wrong, the woman simply thanked her.\n\nthank you for telling me that you loved me, didonna said the woman told her.\n\nthe customer told didonna that her husband had passed away and her brother had recently died. i don't have anyone to tell me that they love me anymore and there is no one there to give me a hug, didonna said the woman said.\n\ndidonna, a widow herself and a mother of three boys, asked the woman to pull forward to the store's door. she asked if she could open the car door and then she hugged the woman.\n\nwhen i gave this woman a hug, she just melted in my arms and she just started crying, didonna said. i told her that if she needs to be told that she's loved to come back, and i'd give her a hug anytime she wanted.\n\ndidonna told the woman her name was april and the woman said her name was peggy.\n\nsince hugging her on october 2, didonna said peggy has been back to the wendy's about five times. more hugs have been shared.\n\nshe found the light after a time of darkness\n\npeggy's story was echoed in the facebook comments on the story first reported by local newspaper whidbey news-times\n\nwe love stopping through there when we're up on the north end and she makes us smile every time! a woman commented on the paper's facebook page . love you too april! you're the best!\n\nthere was a time, however, when didonna was in a dark place, she said. her husband died in 2019 and her life just turned upside down, she said.\n\ni was lost for a long time, didonna said. i was sad for a long time, but not anymore. there's so much light and i'm going to keep shining bright.\n\nthese days didonna tries to share her message of love with strangers daily, whether it's at the wendy's, when she is walking down the street or when she's at a store in town, she said.\n\nnowadays, some customers tell didonna they love her before they even order, she said.\n\ni love the people that i see every day, she said. there's just so much love now that i have that it's overflowing from me onto others.\n\nfor anyone left scarred by the many woes of 2020, didonna has a message of light.\n\n2021 is going to be a great year, didonna said. the universe is changing. everything's aligning.
washington (cnn) a second round of stimulus payments are on the way and many eligible families are expected to receive the money this month.\n\nthe first payments started going out on december 29 and will continue to be sent through january 15 . but anyone eligible who isn't automatically sent the money by then will have to claim it on their 2020 tax return, according to the internal revenue service.\n\ncongress included the $600 payments in a sweeping pandemic aid bill passed just before christmas. president donald trump stalled the bill, calling for $2,000 payments though he had largely left negotiations up to lawmakers and his treasury secretary steven mnuchin, then ultimately signed it into law after a week-long delay.\n\nthe money comes nearly eight months after the first round of stimulus payments, worth up to $1,200 per person, were sent as part of a larger coronavirus relief package passed last march. many of the same people will receive the money again, but there are some small eligibility differences.\n\nwhen and how will the money be sent?\n\nrecipients may have seen a direct deposit pending in their bank account as early as december 29, but the funds became officially available january 4.\n\npaper checks or debit cards will be sent to those who don't already have a bank account on file with the internal revenue service. checks also began going out last week.\n\nsome people may not receive the money the same way as in the first round. if you received a preloaded debit card last year, the payment will not be added to that card. you'll either receive a new card in the mail or a paper check.\n\nthe law requires the internal revenue service to stop issuing the payments after january 15. those not issued a payment by then will have wait to claim it on their 2020 tax return. the money will either increase your refund or reduce the taxes you owe. if the payment was sent to an old bank account, you will also have to wait to file your taxes in order to receive the money\n\npeople can check the status of both their first and second payments by using the internal revenue service's get my payment online tool\n\nwho is eligible?\n\neligibility is largely based on income. individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. they will receive $600 per child under the age of 17, which is $100 more than in the first round.\n\nthe payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. some people who received the first payment may be phased out of the second round because the payments are smaller.\n\nthey will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the tax foundation\n\nundocumented immigrants who don't have social security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. but in a change from the first round, their spouses and children are now eligible as long as they have social security numbers.\n\nthose who are claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, like some college students, remain ineligible.\n\nlost your job? you may be able to claim more money\n\nboth the first and second round payments are based on 2019 adjust gross incomes. that means that someone who saw their income drastically fall in 2020 may be eligible for more money than they first received.\n\nif that's the case, they may claim a recovery rebate credit on their 2020 tax return. the credit eligibility and the credit amount will be based on the 2020 tax year income, according to the internal revenue service.\n\nthose who may have earned more in 2020 than 2019 are not required to pay back money they have already received.
conan o'brien's late night variety show conan is, contrary to reports, remaining nightly instead of going weekly. but it may not stay that way for long.\n\n[conan] has a very full plate in things that we're going to be going the next step on in the next six months, and that led him to ask me, 'well, how do we balance this with the talk show?' turner entertainment chief creative officer kevin reilly told variety thursday. he's going to have a show on tbs for many years to come. right now what form that takes in relation to these other endeavors is in flux. is going to once a week a possibility? it is. that's going to come from him when he's ready to get his hands around that.\n\nthe wrap reported earlier thursday that tbs is planning to retool... 'conan' to a weekly format instead of a nightly one. john martin, the ceo of turner -- which owns both tbs and cnn -- reportedly told the wrap that the move would be made, in part, due to an over-saturated late night lineup across tv.\n\nbut tbs put out a statement from reilly which suggested that if a move to a weekly format does happen, it won't be right now.\n\nas the media landscape continues to evolve, conan will continue to lead the evolution of what a talk show will be in the digital age. at this time, we have no plans to change the format or frequency of his popular tbs show, the statement said. in addition to conan's daily responsibilities to his talk show, we continue to have very ambitious plans that will further broaden and evolve our relationship with conan.\n\nreilly told the hollywood reporter that o'brien will continue to have a daily relationship with an audience. but, he said, i don't know whether that will be on a number of different services, including tbs. that's the part we're trying to figure out; how does that all work together?\n\nthe weekly format has worked for o'brien's talk show counterpart on tbs, samantha bee, whose full frontal stood out during the election.\n\no'brien's show currently ranks last among the major late night shows on broadcast and cable, averaging 597,000 viewers so far this season.\n\nconan premiered on tbs in 2010 following his short but much discussed stint as host of nbc's the tonight show.
michael moore: 'we're going to have the best chance with clark'\n\nmoore is the author of a book critical of president bush titled, dude, where's my country?\n\n(cnn) -- filmmaker and author michael moore, one of america's most outspoken liberals, has announced his choice for the democratic presidential nomination: retired gen. wesley clark.\n\nclark has been accused of being a republican in disguise. so what gets moore excited about clark? he discussed it with cnn anchor wolf blitzer.\n\nblitzer: i've got to tell you, michael, i was pretty surprised. why do you like wesley clark?\n\nmoore: first of all, i like him as a human being. i think he's a very decent and honorable person. i trust him. he seems very down to earth. and i like where he comes from. and, most of all, i think, as the new york times pointed out last week, he's actually slightly to the left of dean.\n\nand this is something i think a lot of people don't realize, especially probably a lot of young people. women, african-americans, labor people, should really take a close look at this guy, because i did and i really liked what i saw.\n\nblitzer: i read the article that you posted on your web site. i got the sense, though, that, for practical political reasons, the main reason you like wesley clark is that you think he can beat george w. bush more than the other democratic candidates.\n\nmoore: well, that is a very good reason. i think certainly you have the best chance with him.\n\nas you know, and you've pointed out many times, wolf, this election is going to really come down to 15 states and a few percentage points [in] those states. and you have to ask yourself, who has the best chance of winning these states, florida, west virginia, arizona, nevada, ohio, missouri? when you put it like that, i think he definitely has the best chance.\n\nbut it's not just a matter of strategy for me, because, honestly, i think, you know, other candidates could also beat bush. i think bush is beatable. that's my main position. and i'll support whoever the candidate is.\n\nmoore: but i think we're going to have the best chance with clark.\n\nbut my reasons for supporting him are the things that he stands for. he's going to end this war. he's going to change the tax rate, so that families of four who make under $50,000 a year are not going to have to pay federal income tax. and the rich are going to have to pay an extra 5 percent.\n\nblitzer: i also noticed in the article that you wrote, you -- explaining why you like wesley clark so much, you said this, he is clearly not from park avenue. well, we all know howard dean was born on park avenue. was that a swipe at howard dean? what do you have against howard dean?\n\nmoore: nothing.\n\nit was more what i have against park avenue. it was not meant to be a swipe at dean. look, i think dean's a good guy. what's really been decent about wesley clark is that he's not participated in this kind of mud-slinging that the other candidates have.\n\nand i think i'd like to participate in that tone and not throw mud at dean and not bring up things that i think -- look, you could say so many things about any of the candidates, how -- positions they've taken that i don't like or haven't liked in the past, how they've changed their minds, things they've been involved in.\n\nwhen i hear dean say that he won't cut a dime out of the pentagon budget, that's inexcusable. but i also believe he's the kind of person you could possibly move along some day to a better position. so...\n\nblitzer: i want you to clarify another thing you said that was intriguing to me in the piece. you said, i will work enthusiastically for any of the non-lieberman eight who might get the nomination.\n\nmoore: yes.\n\nblitzer: now, what exactly does that mean?\n\nmoore: well, for a long time, i've been in the anyone-but-lieberman camp. and i think a lot of people are in that same camp.\n\nthe point being is that the other candidates -- of course, now with moseley braun out, it's now the non-lieberman seven -- all the democrats running, you could say something good about all of them. they all have good position on many of the issues. we're very fortunate this year to have this crop of candidates.\n\ni just happen to think clark is the best among them, best on the issues, best for the working people of this country, best to end this war, and the best to communicate this message to where i come from, in middle america.\n\nthis is a gift that the democratic party has been given. we have a four-star general, top of his class at west point, a rhodes scholar. and he's going to go out there and tell middle america what we need to do in terms of cutting the pentagon budget, of standing up for the rights of working people, affirmative action, nondiscrimination against gays and lesbians.\n\nmoore: go down the whole list, he's extremely strong on these issues.\n\nblitzer: i assume if lieberman for some reason were to get the nomination, you would support him, though, over bush, is that right?\n\nmoore: it would take a lot of medication, wolf.\n\nblitzer: what do you have against joe lieberman?\n\nmoore: well, he's running in the wrong party. lieberman is kind of like a liberal to moderate republican. you know, he's bush-light. and god bless him, but he just doesn't really belong in this party.\n\nblitzer: all right, michael moore explaining why he likes wesley clark so much. thanks for joining us.\n\nmoore: thank you for having me on.\n\nblitzer: you and madonna now are in the same camp.\n\nmoore: hey, just to hear those two names in the same sentence, you've made my day, wolf.\n\nblitzer: michael moore and madonna both support wesley clark.
katherine klein is the edward h. bowman professor of management at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania. shoshana schwartz is a doctoral candidate in the management department at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania. sandra maro hunt is a senior director at the wharton social impact initiative.\n\ncbs' former chief executive les moonves is out. charged with sexual misconduct and a failure to cooperate with investigators, he has been terminated for cause and denied his $120 million severance.\n\ngiven the steady drumbeat of #metoo stories over the past year, the news from cbs is depressingly familiar. so, it's not surprising that a growing number of investors are interested in screening companies on their treatment of the women they employ.\n\nfor many, the goal is not just to avoid investing in companies that are bad for women. they'd like to invest in companies that are actually good for women.\n\nbut finding these companies is a challenge — not because they don't exist, but because investors too often rely on inadequate metrics.\n\nyou can't identify companies that are good employers for women simply by counting the number of women on a company's board or in its c-suite.\n\nsome studies find that when women hold positions of power, they foster positive working conditions — better pay, more promotions — for women lower in the company. but other equally rigorous studies find no evidence for this claim.\n\nyou can't identify companies that are good employers for women simply by counting the number of women on a company's board or in its c-suite. katherine klein, shoshana schwartz, sandra maro hunt\n\nwe reviewed hundreds of academic studies to identify the markers that distinguish the best employers for women. here's what we learned: to determine if a company is really a good employer for women, take a hard look at the representation, pay, health and satisfaction of the women who work there.\n\ncompanies that get these four fundamentals right are not just trying to be good employers for women, they're succeeding. and they are not just good employers for women, they're good employers for men, too.\n\nthe four fundamentals aren't difficult to measure. the problem is that very few companies share the information necessary to do so. but, if investors start asking for this information, that could change.\n\nrepresentation\n\na company can't be a good employer for women if it employs few or no women. it's not that such a company is necessarily a bad place for women to work. but, at best, it's a company with a limited record of hiring, retaining and promoting women. if you're looking to invest in companies that are good for women, it makes sense to invest in companies that employ a large percentage of women.\n\nit's not enough, though, for a company to employ a large percentage of women if women work exclusively at the lowest levels of the company or in a few silos. when this is the case, as it often is, women are denied the influence, opportunities and resources available to employees in more prestigious and diverse roles in the company.\n\namong the s&p 500 companies , nearly 45% of employees are women. but, women represent just 37% of first and middle-level managers, 27% of executives and senior-level managers, and 5% of ceos.\n\nand though women hold 52% of management, professional and related jobs in the united states, that number masks considerable gender-based occupational segregation. women represent 85% of meeting, convention and event planners and 72% of human resource managers, but just 19% of software developers and 9% of mechanical engineers. you can guess which roles come with more power, prestige and pay.\n\nto measure women's representation, compare the percentage of men and women in every quartile of the company's pay. the larger the percentage of women in every quartile — especially the upper quartiles, where women are most often underrepresented — the more likely the company is to be a good employer for women.\n\npay\n\nwomen in the united states are poorer than men. last year, 9.4% of men and 13% of women fell below the poverty level . and poverty takes a toll: it increases one's likelihood of disease, reduces life expectancy, and increases one's exposure to violence.\n\nso, pay matters — a lot.\n\na good employer pays its employees at least enough to live above the poverty line, and ideally much more. and of course, a good employer pays women and men equally for equal work. it's the law and it's only fair.\n\nstill, a company can pay men and women equally for equal work but pay women — on average — a lot less than men. that happens when women are underrepresented at the top.\n\nif you really want to understand how well a company pays women, look at the gender pay gap: the difference between a company's average compensation for men and for women.\n\nus employers aren't required to report their gender pay gap publicly, and few do. but, the uk government requires employers with 250 employees or more to report these numbers.\n\nof the more than 10,000 uk employers that reported their gender pay gaps in 2018, a whopping 78% had a median gender pay gap favoring men . it's safe to guess that the numbers in the united states would be similar.\n\nhealth\n\ngood employers for women provide paid maternity leave. but unlike the other 35 countries in the organisation for economic co-operation and development, the united states does not require that employers provide paid maternity leave. in 2016, only 13% of employees who worked in private industry in the united states had access to paid family leave.\n\ngood employers for women also limit employees' exposure to stress and sexual harassment. workplace stressors — layoffs, long and unpredictable work hours, micromanagement and excessive job demands — increase employees' risk of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and death.\n\nsexual harassment has much the same effect. the greater the sexual harassment a women experiences on the job, the more likely she is to suffer declines in job satisfaction, work performance and mental and physical health. anonymous surveys that assess employees' experiences of sexual harassment behaviors provide the most valid metric around how common it is.\n\nsatisfaction\n\nwe spend about a fifth of our waking lives at work. those hours should be a source of satisfaction — not stress, boredom and frustration.\n\nstudies show that when employees report their job satisfaction, they reflect on the aspects of the job that are most important to them — their work, boss, coworkers, stress, pay and more. this makes a company's average job satisfaction — what some people call employee morale — a simple and valuable metric to assess, in broad terms, what it's like to work at the company.

and alex and cleta mitchell — who is not the attorney of record but has been involved — myself and then the president. so mr. president, i'll turn it over to you.\n\ntrump: ok, thank you very much. hello brad and ryan and everybody. we appreciate the time and the call. so we've spent a lot of time on this and if we could just go over some of the numbers, i think it's pretty clear that we won. we won very substantially in georgia. you even see it by rally size, frankly. we'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally and the competition would get less than 100 people. and it never made sense.\n\nbut we have a number of things. we have at least 2 or 3 — anywhere from 250-300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. much of that had to do with fulton county, which hasn't been checked. we think that if you check the signatures — a real check of the signatures going back in fulton county you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. and we are quite sure that's going to happen.\n\nanother tremendous number. we're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. but an accurate number but its in the 50s of thousands— and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. and it's a very sad thing. they walked out complaining. but the number's large. we'll have it for you. but it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's — the current margin is only 11,779. brad, i think you agree with that, right? that's something i think everyone — at least that's' a number that everyone agrees on.\n\nbut that's the difference in the votes. but we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. you don't need much of a number because the number that in theory i lost by, the margin would be 11,779. but you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands who went to the voting place on november 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. and you know that's very, very, very, very sad.\n\nwe had, i believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted but they weren't on the voter registration roll which they had to be. you had 18,325 vacant address voters. the address was vacant and they're not allowed to be counted. that's 18,325.\n\nsmaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a p.o. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number and that's not allowed. we had at least 18,000 — that's on tape we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. she's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. that was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you me and everybody else.\n\nwhere they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported they said there was a major water main break. everybody fled the area. and then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. there were no republican poll watchers. actually, there were no democrat poll watchers, i guess they were them. but there were no democrats, either and there was no law enforcement. late in the morning, they went early in the morning they went to the table with the black robe, the black shield and they pulled out the votes. those votes were put there a number of hours before the table was put there. i think it was, brad you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before and then it was stuffed with votes.\n\nthey weren't in an official voter box, but they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases but they weren't in voter boxes. the minimum number it could be because we watched it and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it but slow motion and it was magnified many times over and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for biden.\n\nyou had out-of-state voters. they voted in georgia but they were from out of state, of 4,925. you had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. they had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326.\n\nand you had drop boxes, which is very bad. you had drop boxes that were picked up. we have photographs and we have affidavits from many people.\n\ni don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have drop boxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. so all sorts of things could have happened to that box including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. so there were many infractions and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast i mean the state is in turmoil over this.\n\nand i know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although i saw you on television today and you said that you found nothing wrong. i mean, you know, and i didn't lose the state, brad. people have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. there was no way. a lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. and they beat me. they beat me in the ... as you know, every single state ... we won every state. we one every statehouse in the country. we held the senate which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days.\n\nand we won the house, but we won every single statehouse and we won congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, i think 16 or 17 or something. i think there's a now difference of five. there was supposed to be a difference substantially more. but politicians in every state, but politicians in georgia have given affidavits or are going to that, that there was no way that they beat me in the election that the people came out, in fact, they were expecting to lose and then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. and they said there's no way that they've done many polls prior to the election. there was no way that they won.\n\nballots were dropped in massive numbers. and we're trying to get to those numbers and we will have them.\n\nthey'll take a period of time. certified. but but they're massive numbers. and far greater than the 11,779.\n\nthe other thing, dead people. so dead people voted and i think the number is close to 5,000 people. and they went to obituaries. they went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.\n\nthe bottom line is when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. then the other thing they said is in fulton county and other areas. and this may or may not ... because this just came up this morning that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. they're changing the equipment on the dominion machines and, you know, that's not legal.\n\nand they supposedly shredded i think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. and that just came to us as a report today. and it is a very sad situation.\n\nbut brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779 and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified but they are certified. and those are numbers that are there that exist. and that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, i mean by a lot and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil.\n\ni mean there's turmoil in georgia and other places. you're not the only one i mean we have other states that i believe will be flipping to us very shortly. and this is something that — you know, as an example, i think it in detroit, i think there's a section a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. but in detroit, we had, i think it was, 139% of the people voted. that's not too good.\n\nin pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. and uh that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is republican, is extremely activist and angry. i mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. but, uh, they had as an example, in michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. i think it was i think, mark, it was 18,000. some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category.\n\nand that was checked out laboriously by going through, by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers.\n\nso i guess with all of it being said, brad, the bottom line and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots, but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. these are great people.\n\nand, you know, they were shellshocked. i don't know if you call that provisional ballots. in some states we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on november 3 and they were already voted for.\n\nso that's it. i mean, we have many many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. and we won the state and we won it very substantially and easily and we're getting, we have, much of this is a very, you know they're certified, far more certified than we need. but we're getting additional numbers certified, too. and we're getting pictures of dropboxes being delivered and delivered late. delivered three days later, in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect.\n\nmeadows: so mr. president, if i might be able to jump in and i'll give brad a chance. mr. secretary, obviously there is, there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted and that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office.\n\nwhat i'm hopeful for is there some way that we can we can find some kind of agreement to look at this a little bit more fully. you know the president mentioned fulton county.\n\nbut in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead, and so mr. secretary, i was hopeful that, you know, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?\n\nraffensperger: well, i listened to what the president has just said. president trump, we've had several lawsuits and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. um, we don't agree that you have won. and we don't — i didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you'd mentioned. and i can go through that point by point.\n\nwhat we have done is we gave our state senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue and then on the state house, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time, going back point by point on all the issues of contention. and then just a few days ago we met with our u.s. congressmen, republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. going back, primarily what you've talked about here focused in on primarily, i believe, is the absentee ballot process. i don't believe that you're really questioning the dominion machines. because we did a hand retally, a 100% retally of all the ballots and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. so i guess we can probably take that off the table.\n\ni don't think there's an issue about that. what you--\n\ntrump: well, brad. not that there's not an issue, because we have a big issue with dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. but we haven't felt we needed to go there. and just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what mark is saying, mark meadows, uh, yeah we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. we have all the votes we need.\n\nyou know, we won the state. if you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that i gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out of state voters 4,925. you know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number. so we could go through, we have not gone through your dominion. so we can't give them blessing. i mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with dominion machines but we'll have to see.\n\nbut we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. so with that being said, with just what we have, with just what we have we're giving you minimal, minimal numbers. we're doing the most conservative numbers possible, we're many times, many, many times above the margin. and so we don't really have to, mark, i don't think we have to go through ...\n\nmeadows: right\n\ntrump: because, what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. i think i probably did win it by half a million. you know, one of the things that happened brad, is we have other people coming in now from alabama and from south carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost georgia. we won. you know in alabama, we set a record, got the highest vote ever. in georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. and they say it's not possible to have lost georgia.\n\nand i could tell you by our rallies. i could tell you by the rally i'm having on monday night, the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. it's just not possible to have lost georgia. it's not possible. when i heard it was close i said there's no way. but they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. you know that, brad. and that's what we are working on very, very stringently. but regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes and we have many more votes already calculated and certified, too.\n\nand so i just don't know, you know, mark, i don't know what's the purpose. i won't give dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. but we don't need dominion or anything else. we have won this election in georgia based on all of this. and there's nothing wrong with saying that, brad. you know i mean, having the correct — the people of georgia are angry. and these numbers are going to be repeated on monday night. along with others that we're going to have by that time which are much more substantial even. and the people of georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. and there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated. because the 2,236 in absentee ballots. i mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms law firms, etc. and even if you cut 'em in half, cut 'em in half and cut 'em in half, again, it's more votes than we need.\n\nraffensperger: well mr. president, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong. we talked to the congressmen and they were surprised.\n\nbut they — i guess there was a person mr. braynard who came to these meetings and presented data and he said that there was dead people, i believe it was upward of 5,000. the actual number were two. two. two people that were dead that voted. so that's wrong. there were two.\n\ntrump: well cleta, how do you respond to that? maybe you tell me?\n\nmitchell: well, i would say mr. secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, if you look, if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years and we had certain information available to us. we have asked from your office for records that only you have and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died.\n\nbut we don't have the records that you have. and one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary —\n\ntrump: but cleta, even before you do that, and not even including that, that's why hardly even included that number, although in one state we have a tremendous amount of dead people. so i don't know — i'm sure we do in georgia, too. i'm sure we do in georgia too.\n\nbut, um, we're so far ahead. we're so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of [name], known scammer. you know the internet? you know what was trending on the internet? where's [name]? because they thought she'd be in jail. where's [name]? it's crazy, it's crazy. that was. the minimum number is 18,000 for [name], but they think it's probably about 56,000, but the minimum number is 18,000 on the [name] night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed, she stuffed the ballot boxes. let's face it, brad, i mean. they did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? she stuffed the ballot boxes. they were stuffed like nobody had ever seen them stuffed before.\n\nso there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. she stuffed the ballot — each ballot went three times they were showing: here's ballot no 1. here it is second time, third time, next ballot.\n\ni mean, look. brad. we have a new tape that we're going to release. it's devastating. and by the way, that one event, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. it's uh, you know. that one event was a disaster. and it's just, you know, but it was, it was something, it can't be disputed. and again we have a version that you haven't seen but it's magnified. it's magnified and you can see everything. for some reason they put it in three times, each ballot, and i don't know why. i don't know why three times. why not five times, right? go ahead.\n\nraffensperger: you're talking about the state farm video. and i think it's extremely unfortunate that rudy giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. the next day we brought in wsb-tv and we let them show, see the full run of tape and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know —\n\ntrump: but where were the poll watchers, brad? there were no poll watchers there. there were no democrats or republicans. there was no security there.\n\nit was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. where were the poll watchers and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? they said they left. they ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. there was nothing. there was no break. there was no water main break. but we're, if you take out everything, where were the republican poll watchers, even where were the democrat poll watchers, because there were none.\n\nand then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. these people left their station.\n\nwhen they came back, they didn't go to their station. they went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. and then they took those. they went back to a different station. so if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station and they would have continued to work. but they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no republican poll watchers. and remember, her reputation is deva — she's known all over the internet, brad. she's known all over.\n\ni'm telling you, where's [name] was one of the hot items ...[name] they knew her. where's [name]? so brad, there can be no justification for that. and i you know, i give everybody the benefit of the doubt. but that was — and brad, why did they put the votes in three times? you know, they put 'em in three times.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, they did not put that. we did an audit of that and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.\n\ntrump: where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? where was everybody? where were the republicans? where were the security guards? where were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. how come we had no security in the room? why did they run to the bottom of the table? why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes? i mean, brad. and they were sitting there, i think for five hours or something like that, the votes. but they just all happened to run back and go, you know, brad...\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, we'll send you the link from wsb.\n\ntrump: i don't care about the link. i don't need it. brad, i have a much better link —\n\nmitchell: i will tell you. i've seen the tape. the full tape. so has alex. we've watched it. and what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that. they made everybody leave, we have sworn affidavits saying that. and then they began to process ballots. and our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. we don't know that. if you know that ...\n\ntrump: it was 18,000 ballots but they used each one three times.\n\nmitchell: well, i don't know about that.\n\ntrump: i do think because we had ours magnified out. each one magnified out is 18 times three\n\nmitchell: i've watched the entire tape.\n\ntrump: nobody can make a case for that, brad. nobody. i mean, look, you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. just a child. i mean you have your never trumper...\n\nmitchell: how many ballots, mr. secretary, are you saying were processed then?\n\nraffensperger: we had gbi ... investigate that.\n\ngermany: we had our — this is ryan germany. we had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was who was there after that event came to light. gbi was with them as well as fbi agents.\n\ntrump: well, there's no way they could — then they're incompetent. they're either dishonest or incompetent, okay?\n\nmitchell: well, what did they find?\n\ntrump: there's only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. there's just no way. look. there's no way. and on the other thing, i said too, there is no way. i mean, there's no way that these things could have been you know, you have all these different people that voted but they don't live in georgia anymore. what was that number, cleta? that was a pretty good number too.\n\nmitchell: the number who have registered out of state after they moved from georgia. and so they had a date when they moved from georgia, they registered to vote out of state. and then it's like 4,500, i don't have that number right in front of me.\n\ntrump: and then they came back in and they voted.\n\nmitchell: and voted. yeah.\n\ntrump: i thought that was a large number, though. it was in the 20s. the point is...\n\ngermany: we've been going through each of those as well and those numbers that we got that ms. mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. every one we've been through, are people that lived in georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to georgia legitimately. and in many cases\n\ntrump: how many people do that? they moved out and then they said, ah, to hell with it i'll move back. you know, it doesn't sound like a very normal ... you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? it's crazy.\n\ngermany: this is they moved back in years ago. this was not like something just before the election. so there's something about that data that, it's just not accurate.\n\ntrump: well, i don't know, all i know is that it is certified. and they moved out of georgia and they voted. it didn't say they moved back in cleta, did it?\n\nmitchell: no, but i mean, we're looking at the voter registration. again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. you just keep saying you investigated the allegations.\n\ntrump: but, cleta, a lot of it you don't need to be shared. i mean, to be honest, they should share it. they should share it because you want to get to an honest election.\n\ni won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. there's no way i lost georgia. there's no way. we won by hundreds of thousands of votes. i'm just going by small numbers when you add them up they're many times the 11,000. but i won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes.\n\ndo you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in fulton county? because that's what the rumor is. and also that dominion took out machines. that dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery.\n\ndo you know anything about that? because that's illegal, right?\n\ngermany: this is ryan germany. no, dominion has not moved any machinery out of fulton county.\n\ntrump: but have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?\n\ngermany: no.\n\ntrump: are you sure, ryan?\n\ngermany: i'm sure. i'm sure, mr. president.\n\ntrump: what about, what about the ballots. the shredding of the ballots. have they been shredding ballots?\n\ngermany: the only investigation that we have into that — they have not been shredding any ballots. there was an issue in cobb county where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. but this is stuff from, you know, from you know past elections.\n\ntrump: i don't know. it doesn't pass the smell test because we hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots and now what they're saying, oh, we're just cleaning up the office. so i don't think they're cleaning.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything.\n\ntrump: oh this isn't social media. this is trump media. it's not social media. it's really not it's not social media. i don't care about social media. i couldn't care less. social media is big tech. big tech is on your side. i don't even know why you have a side, because you should want to have an accurate election. and you're a republican.\n\nraffensperger: we believe that we do have an accurate election.\n\ntrump: no, no you don't. no, no you don't. you don't have. not even close. you're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. and just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — okay. so you sent us into cobb county for signature verification, right? you sent us into cobb county, which we didn't want to go into. and you said it would be open to the public. and we could have our - so we had our experts there they weren't allowed into the room. but we didn't want cobb county. we wanted fulton county. and you wouldn't give it to us. now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public?\n\nand why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything? they don't want to find, you know, they don't want to find anything. someday you'll tell me the reason why, because i don't understand your reasoning, but someday you'll tell me the reason why. but why don't you want to find?\n\ngermany: mr. president, we chose cobb county —\n\ntrump: why don't you want to find ... what?\n\ngermany: sorry, go ahead.\n\ntrump: so why did you do cobb county? we didn't even request — we requested fulton county, not cobb county. go ahead, please. go ahead.\n\ngermany: we chose cobb county because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done.\n\ntrump: no, but i told you. we're not, we're not saying that.\n\nmitchell: we did say that.\n\ntrump: fulton county. look. stacey, in my opinion, stacey is as dishonest as they come. she has outplayed you ... at everything. she got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. you can't check signatures. i can't imagine you're allowed to do harvesting, i guess, in that agreement. that agreement is a disaster for this country. but she got you somehow to sign that thing and she has outsmarted you at every step.\n\nand i hate to imagine what's going to happen on monday or tuesday, but it's very scary to people. you know, where the ballots flow in out of nowhere. it's very scary to people. that consent decree is a disaster. it's a disaster. a very good lawyer who examined it said they've never seen anything like it.\n\nraffensperger: harvesting is still illegal in the state of georgia. and that settlement agreement did not change that one iota.\n\ntrump: it's not a settlement agreement, it's a consent decree. it even says consent decree on it, doesn't it? it uses the term consent decree. it doesn't say settlement agree. it's a consent decree. it's a disaster.\n\nraffensperger: it's a settlement agreement.\n\ntrump: what's written on top of it?\n\nraffensperger: ryan?\n\ngermany: i don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court, it's not a court order.\n\ntrump: but ryan, it's called a consent decree, is that right? on the paper. is that right?\n\ngermany: i don't. i don't. i don't believe so, but i don't have it in front of me.\n\ntrump: ok, whatever, it's a disaster. it's a disaster. look. here's the problem. we can go through signature verification and we'll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. and the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. but you didn't do that in cobb county. you just looked at one page compared to another. the only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on november whatever. recently. and compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you know, or even one. and you'll find that you have many different signatures. but in fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed and you have many that are forgeries.\n\nok, you know that. you know that. you have no doubt about that. and you will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes, because fulton county is totally corrupt and so is she, totally corrupt.\n\nand they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, brad, whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you and you've taken a state that's a republican state, and you've made it almost impossible for a republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody's ever cheated before. and i don't care how long it takes me, you know, we're going to have other states coming forward — pretty good.\n\nbut i won't ... this is never ... this is ... we have some incredible talent said they've never seen anything ... now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. but they're very substantial numbers. but i think you're going to find that they — by the way, a little information, i think you're going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. the ballots are corrupt, and they're brand new and they don't have a seal and there's the whole thing with the ballots. but the ballots are corrupt.\n\nand you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal, it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know what they did and you're not reporting it. that's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. and you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan, your lawyer. and that's a big risk. but they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what i've heard. and they are removing machinery and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. and you can't let it happen and you are letting it happen. you know, i mean, i'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. so look. all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\n\nand flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, cause you know, this is — it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. if it was a mistake, i don't know. a lot of people think it wasn't a mistake. it was much more criminal than that. but it's a big problem in georgia and it's not a problem that's going away. i mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away.\n\ngermany: mr president, this is ryan. we're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned.\n\ntrump: good. but if you find it you've got to say it, ryan.\n\ngermany: ... let me tell you what we are seeing. what we're seeing is not at all what you're describing, these are investigators from our office, these are investigators from\n\ngbi, and they're looking and they're good. and that's not what they're seeing. and we'll keep looking, at all these things.\n\ntrump: well, you better check the ballots because they are shredding ballots, ryan. i'm just telling you, ryan. they're shredding ballots. and you should look at that very carefully. because that's so illegal. you know, you may not even believe it because it's so bad. but they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get ... because we'll eventually get into fulton. in my opinion it's never too late. ... so, that's the story. look, we need only 11,000 votes. we have are far more than that as it stands now. we'll have more and more. and. do you have provisional ballots at all, brad? provisional ballots?\n\nraffensperger: provisional ballots are allowed by state law.\n\ntrump: sure, but i mean, are they counted or did you just hold them back because they, you know, in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?\n\nraffensperger: we'll get you that number.\n\ntrump: because most of them are made out to the name trump. because these are people that were scammed when they came in. and we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify when they came in they were probably going to vote on november 3. and they were told i'm sorry, you've already been voted for, you've already voted. the women, men started screaming, no. i proudly voted til november 3. they said, i'm sorry, but you've already been voted for and you have a ballot and these people are beside themselves. so they went out and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name trump on it.\n\nand what about that batch of military ballots that came in. and even though i won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent trump. i mean 100 percent biden. do you know about that? a large group of ballots came in. i think it was to fulton county and they just happened to be 100 percent for trump — for biden, even though trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. but these ballots were 100 percent for biden. and, do you know about that? a very substantial number came in, all for biden. does anybody know about it?\n\nmitchell: i know about it, but —\n\ntrump: ok, cleta, i'm not asking you cleta, honestly. i'm asking brad. do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, i mean 100 percent for biden. do you know about that?\n\ngermany: i don't know about that, i do know that we have when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. the military part of that does generally go republican. the overseas citizen part of it generally goes very democrat. this was a mix of 'em.\n\ntrump: no, but this was. that's ok. but i got like 78 percent in the military. these ballots were all for ... they didn't tell me overseas. could be overseas too, but i get votes overseas too, ryan, you know in all fairness. no they came in, a large batch came in and it was, quote, 100 percent for biden. and that is criminal. you know, that's criminal. ok. that's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here.\n\noh, i don't know, look brad. i got to get ... i have to find 12,000 votes and i have them times a lot. and therefore, i won the state. that's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. you know, and i watched you this morning and you said, uh, well, there was no criminality.\n\nbut i mean, all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. when you talk about no criminality, i think it's very dangerous for you to say that.\n\ni just, i just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. like even you when you went and did that check. and i was surprised because, you know ...the check... and we found a few thousand votes that were against me. i was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing is you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up and you still found 3,000 that were bad. so that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five i don't know. still a lot of votes. but you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. and if you check with fulton county, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into fulton county and the other county next to it.\n\nso what are we going to do here folks? i only need 11,000 votes. fellas, i need 11,000 votes. give me a break. you know, we have that in spades already. or we can keep it going but that's not fair to the voters of georgia because they're going to see what happened and they're going to see what happened. i mean, i'll, i'll take on to anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, i'm sure. but, but [name] ... i will take on anybody you want. and the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots but they used them three times. so that's, you know, a lot of votes. ...and that one event... and they were all to biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. you know, [name] , the one thing i forgot to say which was the most important. you know that every single ballot she did went to biden. you know that, right? do you know that, by the way, brad?\n\nevery single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning, went to biden. did you know that, ryan?\n\ngermany: that's not accurate, mr. president.\n\ntrump: huh. what is accurate?\n\ngermany: the numbers that we are showing are accurate.\n\ntrump: no, about [name] . about early in the morning, ryan. when the woman took, you know, when the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? do you know, do you know who those ballots, who they were made out to, do you know who they were voting for?\n\ngermany: no, not specifically.\n\ntrump: did you ever check?\n\ngermany: we did what i described to you earlier —\n\ntrump: no no no — did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by [name] , a known political operative and balloteer. did ever check who those votes were for?\n\ngermany: we looked into that situation that you described.\n\ntrump: no, they were 100 percent for biden. 100 percent. there wasn't a trump vote in the whole group. why don't you want to find this, ryan? what's wrong with you? i heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but i'm sure you're a good lawyer. you have a nice last name.\n\nbut, but i'm just curious why wouldn't, why do you keep fighting this thing? it just doesn't make sense. we're way over the 17,779, right? we're way over that number and just if you took just [name] , we're over that number by five, five or six times when you multiply that times three.\n\nand every single ballot went to biden, and you didn't know that, but, now you know it. so tell me, brad, what are we going to do? we won the election and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. and it's going to be very costly in many ways. and i think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers. for instance, i'm hearing ryan that he's probably, i'm sure a great lawyer and everything. but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. but he's making them with such — he did make them with surety. but now i think he's less sure because the answer is they all went to biden and that alone wins us the election by a lot. you know, so.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, you have people that submit information and we have our people that submit information. and then it comes before the court and the court then has to make a determination. we have to stand by our numbers. we believe our numbers are right.\n\ntrump: why do you say that? i don't know. i mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that? first of all they don't even assign us a judge. they don't even assign us a judge. but why wouldn't you — hey brad, why wouldn't you want to check out [name] ? and why wouldn't you want to say, hey, if in fact, president trump is right about that, then he wins the state of georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. you just say, you stick by, i mean i've been watching you, you know, you don't care about anything. your numbers are right. but your numbers aren't right. they're really wrong and they're really wrong, brad. and i know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — look ultimately, i win, okay?\n\nmitchell: mr. secretary...\n\ntrump: because you guys are so wrong. and you treated this. you treated the population of georgia so badly. you, between you and your governor, who was down at 21, he was down 21 points. and like a schmuck, i endorsed him and he got elected, but i will tell you, he is a disaster.\n\nand he knows, i can't imagine that people are so angry in georgia, i can't imagine he's ever getting elected again i'll tell you that much right now. but why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? cause those numbers are so wrong?\n\nmitchell: mr. secretary, mr. president, one of the things that we have been, alex can talk about this, we talked about it, and i don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but i think what the president is saying, and what we've been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. they haven't even assigned a judge. but the people of georgia and the people of america have a right to know the answers. and you have data and records that we don't have access to. and you keep telling us and making public statements that you investigated this and nothing to see here. but we don't know about that. all we know is what you tell us. what i don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers, you know, if you say, because - to try to be able to get to the truth because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us. you tell us that you had an investigation at the state farm arena. i don't have any report. i've never seen a report of investigation. i don't know that is. i've been pretty involved in this and i don't know. and that's just one of like , 25 categories. and it doesn't even, and as i, as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the dominion issue. that's not part of our case. it's not part of our, we just didn't feel as though we had any way to be able to develop —\n\ntrump: no, we do have a way but i don't want to get into it. we found a way in other states excuse me, but we don't need it because we're only down 11,000 votes so we don't even need it. i personally think they're corrupt as hell. but we don't need that. because all we have to do cleta is find 11,000-plus votes. so we don't need that. i'm not looking to shake up the whole world. we won georgia easily. we won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but if you go by basic simple numbers, we won it easily, easily. so we're not giving dominion a pass on the record. we just, we don't need dominion, because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have.\n\nhilbert: mr. president and cleta, this is kurt hilbert, if i might interject for a moment. um ryan, i would like to suggest just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. that in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. we would like to sit down with your office and we can do it through purposes of compromise and just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. and if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. however, we believe that they are accurate. we've had now three to four separate experts looking at these numbers.\n\ntrump: certified accountants looked at them.\n\nhilbert: correct. and this is just based on usps data and your own secretary of state's data. so that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlements proceeding and actually go through the registered voter ids and registrations. and if you can convince us that that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. but we tend to believe that is, you know, obviously more than 11,779. that's sufficient to change the results entirely in of itself. so what would you say to that, mr. germany?\n\ngermany: kurt, um i'm happy to get with our lawyers and we'll set that up. that number is not accurate. and i think we can show you, for all the ones we've looked at, why it's not. and so if that would be helpful, i'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys.\n\ntrump: well, let me ask you, kurt, you think that is an accurate number. that was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right?\n\nhilbert: that is correct. that information is the minimum most conservative data based upon the usps data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. we do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. yet, we have asked for it six times. i sent a letter over to mr... several times requesting this information, and it's been rebuffed every single time. so it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there's something to hide. that's the problem that we have.\n\ngermany: well, that's not the case sir. there are things that you guys are entitled to get. and there's things that under the law, we are not allowed to give out.\n\ntrump: well, you have to. well, under the law you're not allowed to give faulty election results, ok? you're not allowed to do that. and that's what you done. this is a faulty election result. and honestly, this should go very fast. you should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of georgia know that this was a scam. and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote and a lot of republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. okay? they hate it. and they're going to vote. and you would be respected. really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. you have a big election coming up on tuesday. and therefore i think that it is really important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers. because i know brad that if you think we're right, i think you're going to say, and i'm not looking to blame anybody. i'm just saying you know, and, you know, under new counts, and under uh, new views, of the election results, we won the election. you know? it's very simple. we won the election. as the governors of major states and the surrounding states said, there is no way you lost georgia, as the georgia politicians say, there is no way, you lost georgia. nobody. everyone knows i won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but i'll tell you it's going to have a big impact on tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast.\n\nmeadows: mr. president. this is mark. it sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at these areas ands i assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. is that correct?\n\ngermany: no, that's not what i said. i'm happy to have our lawyers sit down with kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to my him, here's, based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong.\n\nmeadows: so what you're saying, ryan, let me let me make sure ... so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. you just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?\n\ngermany: i don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. but we can sit down with them and say —\n\ntrump: but you're allowed to have a phony election? you're allowed to have a phony election right?\n\ngermany: no sir.\n\ntrump: when are you going to do signature counts, when are you going to do signature verification on fulton county, which you said you were going to do, and now all of a sudden you're not doing it. when are you doing that?\n\ngermany: we are going to do that. we've announced —\n\nhilbert: to get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information and private information without you having any kind of violation?\n\ntrump: well, i don't want to know who it is. you guys can do it very confidentially. you can sign a confidentiality agreement. that's ok. i don't need to know names. but we go the information on this stuff that we're talking about. we got all that information from the secretary of state.\n\nmeadows: yeah. so let me let me recommend, ryan, if you and kurt would get together, you know, when we get off of this phone call, if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can we can actually look at the data. for example, mr. secretary, i can tell you say they were only two dead people who would vote. i can promise you there were more than that. and that may be what your investigation shows, but i can promise you there were more than that. but at the same time, i think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. and if that's the good next step. hopefully we can, uh we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately.\n\ntrump: well why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information. it will show the secretary of state, and you don't even have to look at any names. we don't want names. we don't care. but we got that information from you. and stacey abrams is laughing about you know she's going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. what she's done to this party is unbelievable, i tell ya. and i only ran against her once. and that was with a guy named brian kemp and i beat her. and if i didn't run, brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. he was dead, dead as a doornail. he never thought he had a shot at either one of them. what a schmuck i was. but that's the way it is. that's the way it is. i would like you ... for the attorneys ... i'd like you to perhaps meet with ryan ideally tomorrow, because i think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. otherwise you're going to have people just not voting. they don't want to vote. they hate the state, they hate the governor and they hate the secretary of state. i will tell you that right now. the only people like you are people that will never vote for you. you know that brad, right? they like you know, they like you. they can't believe what they found. they want people like you. so, look, can you get together tomorrow? and brad. we just want the truth. it's simple. and everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. it's ok. it takes a little while but let the truth come out. and the real truth is i won by 400,000 votes. at least. that's the real truth. but we don't need 400,000. we need less than 2,000 votes. and are you guys able to meet tomorrow ryan?\n\ngermany: um, i'll get with chris, the lawyer representing us and the case, and see when he can get together with kurt.\n\nraffensperger: ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, mr. meadows. thank you president trump for your time.\n\ntrump: ok, thank you, brad. thank you, ryan. thank you. thank you, everybody. thank you very much. bye.
(cnn) as the clocks struck midnight on tuesday, dozens of same-sex couples tied the knot in australia, marking the first legal ceremonies of their kind in the country.\n\nalthough australia passed a law l egalizing same-sex marriage last month, tuesday was the first day such couples could legally marry without applying for a special exception.\n\nthe law was passed in australia's parliament after a national postal survey found that a majority of people supported marriage equality in december.\n\naustralia is the 26th country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, according to pew research . the measure was widely lauded as a victory for worldwide lgbti+ groups -- a term that refers collectively to people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or intersex or other sexual minorities.\n\nhere's how some of the country's newest newlyweds celebrated on tuesday.\n\namong the first to wed were athletes craig burns (r) and luke sullivan, whose ceremony took place just after midnight at an estate in new south wales on tuesday.\n\nthe two runners quickly organized the wedding in the month since the law was passed, cnn affiliate seven network reported. all australian couples must provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married.\n\nin the port city of perth in western australia, gillian brady (l) and lisa goldsmith signed their marriage certificate at a ceremony at the court hotel.\n\nin sydney, local bakeries prepared commemorative cakes for the sydney festival's event in hyde park. in celebration of the historic event, festival organizers threw a public rainbow wedding reception in the park's meriton festival village complete with music, cake, champagne and pink swimming pools.\n\nwives rebecca hickson (l) and sarah turnbull exchanged in a ceremony in newcastle, new south wales.\n\nin melbourne, activists antony mcmanus (r) and ron van houwelingen were married at the david williamson theater, where they met 30 years earlier as students.\n\ntheir wedding cake was topped with a symbol of their love.\n\ni suppose it's been a wedding planned for 30 years but we've had really a month to get things together, ron van houwelingen, 50, told cnn's australian affiliate seven network.\n\nit's been quite hectic trying to organise that in such a short amount of time, he said.\n\nmost countries that have opted for marriage equality are in europe and the americas. in 2001, the netherlands was the first nation to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nireland was the first country to legalize the measure through popular vote in 2013, and in 2015 the united states supreme court ruled that same-sex couples could marry nationwide.
(cnn) — sleeping on a bus doesn't sound glamorous -- but california-based cabin is here to change your preconceptions.\n\nthis san francisco start-up has created a luxury hotel on wheels.\n\ninspired by the old time romance of mid-twentieth-century trains and ocean liners, cabin's guests to go to sleep in one city and wake somewhere else entirely.\n\nforget awkward sleep postures on planes, or slumping in the back of the car, cabin is kitted out with memory foam beds, leather seats and high-quality service.\n\n'an experience akin to teleportation'\n\ncozy but luxurious accommodation on board cabin. courtesy cabin\n\nit's an experience akin to teleportation -- you basically fall asleep and wake up somewhere new, says cabin ceo and co-founder tom currier.\n\nthis futuristic element is reflected in the state-of-the-art facilities on board -- cabin prides itself on using the same sheets as the ritz carlton.\n\nbut the real selling point is that cabin will get you from a to b, safely and smoothly -- although not as quickly as an airplane.\n\npassengers can sleep on memory foam beds. courtesy cabin\n\nnevertheless, the creators think the appeal is in the experience -- not the speed.\n\ndrivers opt for smoother, slower driving to ensure guests get a good night's sleep.\n\nin fact, drivers are trained via an ipad app that rates journeys based on smoothness.\n\ncalifornia here we come\n\ncabin is a double-decker bus with a difference. courtesy cabin\n\ncurrently cabin's sole route is between san francisco and santa monica.\n\nthis takes about eight hours, perfect for getting a good night's sleep.\n\ncabin's co-founders tom currier and gaetano crupi think they've created the future of travel. courtesy cabin\n\nsuitable refreshments are on hand -- guests are served camomile tea at night and espresso in the morning.\n\ntime will tell whether the initiative takes on -- but cabin plans to expand.
(cnn) wednesday started with a rump group of house and senate republicans preparing to object to the electoral college results to demonstrate their utter fealty. it ended with many of those same republicans retreating from their deeply held beliefs about election fraud, tails between their legs.\n\nit only took a violent seizure of the us capitol building by violent rioters -- the first time the capitol had been breached since 1814 during the war of 1812 -- to change their minds.\n\ni did think that today changed things drastically, indiana sen. mike braun, one of the 13 senators who had signaled he would object to the results, said in the wake of the storming of the capitol. yeah, whatever point you made before that should suffice. get this ugly day behind us.\n\nobviously the commission we have asked for is not going to happen at this point, said oklahoma sen. james lankford , another previous backer of the electoral college objection. i understand that. and we are headed tonight toward the certification of joe biden as president of the united states.\n\nin each episode of his weekly youtube show, chris cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. click to subscribe!\n\nditto montana sen. steve daines . and georgia sen. kelly loeffler. and washington rep. cathy mcmorris-rodgers . and likely many of the other republicans who started wednesday so gung-ho on challenging the results.\n\nwhat the rapid change of heart indicates is that there never -- really -- was much of a principle at stake here for the republicans who objected to the electoral college results. it was solely a political calculation -- a way of appealing to trump (and his base of voters) while not really having to worry about the election being overturned.\n\neven before the rioters stormed the capitol, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had sniffed out the ploy. i will not pretend such a vote would be a harmless protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing, he said on the senate floor in a not-so-subtle attack on his colleagues backing trump's attempts to overturn an election without any proof of wrongdoing.\n\nthis was a political stunt. except that the thousands of donald trump backers who, at the urging of the president took their unhappiness into the capitol itself, didn't know that. they believed that the election really was rigged and stolen. because trump and his complicit media told them so -- and the vast majority of republicans sat on their hands (and held their tongues) for fear of angering the president.\n\nit should not take an open insurrection in the heart of our government for these republican elected officials to realize that their words (or silence) have an impact that goes well beyond their own narrow political interests. that words matter. and that humoring trump and his election fantasies have real-world consequences. and, as we saw on wednesday, dangerous ones.\n\nrepublicans who needed to see the capitol seized by insurrectionists to realize what their actions had wrought should not be applauded or congratulated. the writing has been on the wall for a very long time. they just chose to put their heads in the sand.

33-year old senior policy adviser, is rumored to have written a good bit of the speech that the president delivered last night from the oval office. taken by itself, the speech and its horror-heavy rhetoric would suggest that the trump administration and miller take issue only with illegal immigration to the united states, the sort they believe authorities could stem with a physical barrier.\n\nthis is not true. for stephen miller, advocating for the border wall and railing against illegal immigrants is but one part of the transformation he envisions for the united states and its immigration system. the other parts have to do with legal immigrants and crippling the programs that allow them to come into the country.\n\nmiller, whose antipathy for immigration dates back to his high school years (when he wrote editorials critical of hispanic students while blasting bilingual high school announcements) and is himself descended from immigrants, has gone so far as to associate immigration, as he said in a june 2016 trump rally, with heartbreak, heartache and needless death. in august of 2018, miller's uncle denounced him as an architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family's life in this country. a former national security council official told politico in november that miller said at one meeting: we must save americans from these immigrant criminals! despite evidence showing that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born americans, miller's persona and policy objectives make it clear that, to him, a fixed immigration system is one in which as few immigrants as possible cross america's borders, illegally or otherwise.\n\nin the first two years of the trump administration, miller, taking care not to leave a paper trail, has hacked away at america's legal immigration system using what one senior senate staffer described to vanity fair as the termite method: letting legal immigration programs erode from neglect and in some cases intentionally pulverizing them.\n\nwith pernicious regularity, miller – considered trump's most influential immigration adviser – has inserted himself into the construction of one executive order which bans travelers from seven countries, another that exhorts american employers to hire american, forced the state department to reject research that discounted a connection between refugees and terrorism, and inserted himself into high-level nsc meetings leading at least one official to label him president of immigration.\n\nthe details of how so many programs that enable legal migration to the united states have been debilitated are damning. the h-1b program, long the best way for highly skilled workers to migrate to the united states, will now be harder to access. according to data obtained by the national foundation for american policy, united states citizenship and immigration service (uscis) has begun to issue more visa denials and requests for evidence than it did before, with nearly 69% of applicants getting an rfe in the last quarter of 2017. the onerous requirement delays visa processing further and, along with new forms demanded from employers, contributes to costly delays, potentially suggesting a deliberate effort to deter employers from hiring foreign workers altogether.\n\nwhere all immigrant workers are concerned, statistics released by immigration and customs enforcement (ice) last month showed a 750% increase in the number of worksite investigations, administrative proceedings and raids over the previous year. ironically, the government shutdown has also led to the unavailability of the e-verify system that allows employers to check the immigration status of workers before they hire them, thwarting the administration's own concern with worker legality.\n\nh-1b applicants who get requests for evidence are actually the luckier bunch among all visa applicants. a new policy directive issued by uscis last summer permits the agency to summarily deny visa applications for immigrant visas, for green cards and for adjustments of status without first issuing a request for evidence or a notice to appear as they used to. instead, the agency can, at their discretion, deny the visa and immediately label the applicant illegal and deportable, without giving them an option to depart voluntarily. the real consequence of the policy change is to make many more people ineligible for re-entry into the united states, because they have been deemed deportable. in cases of immigrant visas, applicants appearing for green card interviews have been rejected and then immediately detained because, under this new policy directive, they had been declared illegal.\n\nthe virulence of miller's views toward international students also came through last fall when he argued that chinese students should be banned from us universities because of the possibility that they could be engaging in espionage for the chinese government, and because (in miller's view) such a ban would punish elite universities who have been critical of mr. trump. thirty percent of international students are chinese and most pay full price at american universities, subsidizing costs for american students. around the midterm elections, it was reported that further restrictions on all international students and student exchange programs would also be forthcoming.\n\nmiller has also been successful in arguing for a lower cap on the number of refugees coming to the united states, restricting the number to a record low of only 45,000 for 2018. in 2018, he turned his attention to asylum-seekers, championing a new rule that would disqualify those entering the country anywhere except a legal port of entry from claiming asylum. the law was struck down, but appeals are in progress. in late 2018, miller pushed for yet another proposal to force asylum applicants on the southern border to wait in mexico while their cases were processed.\n\ndestroying or disabling work, student, immigrant, asylee and refugee programs is apparently not enough to sate the nativist sentiment that undergirds this miller-led transformation of the us immigration system. early in 2018, the trump administration set about dividing real native-born citizens from naturalized citizens, inaugurating the denaturalization task force, whose operation janus and operation second look are pursuing denaturalization proceedings and screening old naturalization applications for fraud. no public guidelines exist for whom they may investigate or for how long. furthermore, naturalized citizens, along with all other visa holders, are being monitored by the government through their social media accounts, and the information is being stored in files known as a-files that are kept and maintained by uscis. a naturalized citizen, it seems, in the trump administration's view, is not entitled to the fourth and fifth amendment protections the constitution provides against just such surveillance.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthe current furor may be over the shutdown and the border wall, but regardless of how the cataclysm of the moment turns out, stephen miller will likely continue his campaign to deter, defeat and demonize immigrants to the united states. in the case of highly skilled workers, international students, refugees and naturalized citizens, he has already been successful. the much-touted wall may not be necessary after all – as the barriers, made up of policy briefs and administrative regulations and executive orders and task forces, have already been erected.

an outbreak of new coronavirus has sickened about 1,400 people worldwide and killed at least 41 in mainland china, while spreading to countries around the world.\n\nits emergence has fueled fears of a deadly epidemic as hundreds of millions of people travel in china, or around the asian region, during the lunar new year holiday.\n\nwhat is the virus?\n\ncoronavirus is a large family of viruses, which include severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers).\n\ncommon symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, and possibly a headache. those who have a weakened immune system, particularly the young and the elderly, are at risk of the virus turning into a more serious respiratory tract illness.\n\nauthorities said the wuhan coronavirus was passed from animals to humans; can be spread from person to person; and appears to cause pneumonia in people who have weakened immune systems.\n\nit is thought to be milder that sars and mers and take longer to develop symptoms. patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit a hospital.\n\nexperts are now trying to understand how it is being transmitted, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community.\n\nin one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient -- who was not known to be carrying the virus -- were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily.\n\nwhere is this happening?\n\nwhere it started: ground zero\n\nthe outbreak emerged last month in the largest city in central china, wuhan, a city of 11 million people in hubei province.\n\nofficials linked it to huanan seafood wholesale market, saying wild animals sold there are the likely source of the virus. the market has been closed since january 1 for disinfection and officials are scrambling to discover its animal source.\n\nsnakes -- the chinese krait and the chinese cobra -- may be responsible for transmitting coronavirus to humans.\n\nscientists in china say that the virus might have jumped from bats to snakes, which were sold in the local seafood market in wuhan, and then to humans.\n\nhowever, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery, and further tests are necessary to determine the source animal.\n\nat least 30 people died in the province, many of them elderly and suffering from pre-existing conditions.\n\nas deaths mount in the city, officials imposed a number of new measures including the postponement of new year celebrations in wuhan, a ban on tour agencies from bringing groups of people out of the city and thermal monitors and screening in public spaces.\n\nregional spread\n\nfrom the first reported case in december, in hubei province, the virus has spread to almost all of china's administrative regions this week.\n\nthe country has adopted prevention and control measures that are typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. this means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients.\n\nwuhan temporarily closed its airport and railway stations on thursday for departing passengers, and all public transport services are suspended until further notice.\n\nthe city's coronavirus task force also announced the closure of highways out of the city.\n\nmeanwhile, the city made it mandatory for everyone to wear face masks in public places after confirmed coronavirus cases passed the 500 mark.\n\nunprecedented lockdown\n\nauthorities in china have imposed indefinite travel restrictions in 15 cities in hubei province, the most affected area in the country, impacting an estimated 32 million people.\n\nwuhan, a city of 11 million, is under effective lockdown, with all public transport in and out of the city closed.\n\nother cities across the province are under less severe travel restrictions.\n\na global threat: confirmed cases around the world\n\nthe virus has spread well beyond mainland china, so far to 13 places including hong kong, macau, taiwan, singapore, south korea, thailand, japan, vietnam, australia and the united states.\n\nairports around the world have increased health screenings and implemented new quarantine procedures as officials race to slow the spread of the virus.\n\ninternational flights from wuhan\n\nwuhan is a major transportation hub.\n\nnot only is the city a center for china's high-speed rail network, it has flights going to more than 60 international destinations from tianhe international airport.\n\non thursday, as confirmed cases ramped up across the country, government officials announced the temporary closure of wuhan's airport and railway stations.\n\nall train tickets in and out of wuhan have also been suspended, while multiple international airlines have canceled flights to the city.\n\nchina has encouraged passengers traveling to and from wuhan to change their travel plans during the busy lunar new year holiday period, by exempting them from service charges for refunds for all modes of transport.\n\nhow does this compare to the sars virus?\n\nscientists say the infectiousness of the virus is not as strong as sars, but have added that the number of people infected is climbing.\n\na study by researchers in the uk estimated that the number of infections in wuhan is still grossly underestimated, with the real number closer to 4,000 as of january 18, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time.\n\nsars infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through asia in 2002 and 2003.\n\non thursday, david heymann, the chairman of a world health organization committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought.\n\nbut there is still much that is not known about the virus and, as the above graphic shows, its death rate is far smaller than that seen during the sars outbreak.
(cnn) the discovery of important new coronavirus variants in the uk and south africa began with a bet of a bottle of wine.\n\nin mid-november, tulio de oliveira, who leads a genetics lab in south africa, began receiving anxious phone calls from physicians in the eastern cape province who were seeing an explosive growth in covid-19 patients. hospitals were quickly becoming overrun. the increase had seemingly come out of nowhere.\n\nit was shocking, said de oliveira, a professor at the university of kwazulu-natal in durban.\n\nde oliveira immediately asked for samples of the virus from patients' noses so he could genetically sequence them.\n\nin less than a week, he sequenced 16 samples. all 16 had similar mutations -- and an unusually high number of mutations.\n\ni said to myself, 'there's something very strange here,'  de oliveira said.\n\nde oliveira, a prominent virus hunter, had discovered a new variant of the coronavirus.\n\nthe 16 samples were hundreds of kilometers apart from each other in the eastern cape and kwazulu-natal provinces, so he had a hunch the variant was spreading quickly.\n\nto add to the concerns, some of the mutations were in the genes related to the spikes that sit atop the virus. tests to detect the virus, as well as covid-19 drugs and vaccines, have targeted those spikes. the concern is that if the spikes change, it's possible that tests, drugs and vaccines might not work as well.\n\nin the next step of his virus hunt, de oliveira reached out to labs in the network for genomic surveillance in south africa, asking them to send samples of viruses from their covid-19 patients from far and wide.\n\none of the labs was in stellenbosch, a town that's home to south africa's famed wineries.\n\nde oliveira said susan engelbrecht, the senior scientist at the stellenbosch lab, told him she'd be shocked if the new variant had reached her area, since it's more than 700 kilometers away from nelson mandela bay, where the spread of the variant was first spotted.\n\ni made a bet with her, that if we found the variant in more than 50% of the samples from stellenbosch, she would give me a bottle of wine, de oliveira said. she said not only would she give me bottle of wine, she would eat her hat, too.\n\nof the 67 samples from stellenbosch, 58 were the same variant found in nelson mandela bay.\n\nde oliveira is considering which stellenbosch wine he'll choose -- but he knows it will be an expensive one.\n\n\n\ntulio de oliveira, a professor at the university of kwazulu-natal in south africa, and his team identified a coronavirus variant there.\n\na few days later, on december 4, de oliveira sent an urgent email to the world health organization official who runs the agency's sars-cov-2 virus evolution working group.\n\ni would like to request an urgent addition to the agenda today - to raise an alert of some preliminary findings from south africa, de oliveira wrote.\n\npermission was granted, and de oliveira alerted the other scientists on the call, who hailed from around the world, about this strange new variant he was seeing in south africa. he noted that it included a mutation in a position of the spike protein called n501y, and he encouraged his colleagues to look for similar mutations in their countries.\n\nandrew rambaut, a professor at the university of edinburgh, took up the task. he and his colleagues looked in the uk's genomic database and found a variant containing the n501y mutation, which was spreading quickly in parts of southeast england. they published their findings on december 20.\n\nthat day, rambaut tweeted : the hint to look for n501y came from @tuliodna who was tracking this mutation in south africa.\n\ni think the fact that the mutation was identified first and then linked to a growing cluster rather than the other way round alters the likelihood that the variant is the cause of the cluster rather than just a randomly picked variant that happened to be present in the region. — andrew rambaut 🦠🧬🌲🔮🤦‍♂️ (@arambaut) december 20, 2020\n\nmaria van kerkhove, the technical lead for the who's coronavirus response, said de oliveira's discovery definitely triggered [british scientists] to look at the different type of variants.\n\ni'm just so grateful that we have this [international] collaboration, she said.\n\n'we're playing a very dangerous game with this virus'\n\nif a virus changes its genetics in just the right way, tests might not be able to detect it as easily, and vaccines might not work as well.\n\nwe're playing a very dangerous game with this virus right now, van kerkhove said, given the explosive growth in the united states and other countries. what worries us is that the longer this spreads, the more opportunities it has to change.\n\nthese variants were found in south africa and the uk, but it's not clear where they began. so far, it appears that both spread more quickly, but they are not more deadly. vaccine makers and other scientists are studying whether the variants pose a challenge to the vaccines.\n\nkeeping an eye on the virus -- genetically sequencing samples from large numbers of people -- is a fundamental aspect of controlling the virus and an important way to understand your enemy, van kerkhove said.\n\ntrevor bedford, a genomic epidemiologist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center, gives the example of how genetic sequencing this summer helped link 59 covid-19 cases in various parts of ireland back to one flight. knowing the passengers caught it on the plane helped with contact tracing and control activities.\n\nthe sequencing really kind of clinched it, bedford said.\n\nsequencing the coronavirus in the us\n\non december 20, the day the british scientists published their findings, a slack group for us virus hunters lit up.\n\nperhaps the uk and south africa variants or other worrisome mutations existed in the united states, too.\n\nthat kind of definitely lit a fire under people, said bedford, who's a member of a slack group for spheres , a new us consortium to coordinate coronavirus genetic sequencing led by the us centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nso far in the pandemic, us genomic sequencing has lagged behind other countries. for example, the uk has sequenced virus samples from about 146,000 people, and the us has sequenced samples from only 58,000 people, according to the gisaid database, even though the us had far more covid-19 cases.\n\nwatching other countries, like the uk and south africa, excel at genomic sequencing can be hard, bedford said.\n\nof course, it's frustrating, he said.\n\nin south africa, once de oliveira got the tip from physicians that case numbers were growing, it took him and his colleagues only about two weeks to identify the new variant. once british researchers got the tip from de oliveira, it took them less than three weeks to find their own variant and publish their study.\n\nthings don't move that quickly in the us, bedford said.\n\nin the united states, the labs that have coronavirus samples from patients often don't work directly with the scientists who will sequence those samples. that means the scientists have to identify those labs, ask them to save samples, and then make legal agreements for sharing the samples.\n\npart of the reason that we're doing such a bad job is we have [these] structural issues, bedford said.\n\nsouth africa and the uk, on the other hand, have national health services, so the labs that do covid-19 testing and the experts that do sequencing typically work for the same entity.\n\nthey've got a single national health system and a single national microbiology service, which makes coordinating things a lot easier, said dr. gregory armstrong, director of the office of advanced molecular detection at the cdc's national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases. we don't have a system that's anywhere near as robust as the uk system.\n\nget cnn health's weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr. sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team.\n\nanother reason the us lags behind is that the uk has invested huge sums of money in genomic sequencing.\n\nthe system in the uk is really the gold standard for how to do genomic surveillance, armstrong said. i don't think we're ever going to be able to get up to that level.\n\nthe cdc is trying to shore up the us surveillance system, with recent grants of millions of dollars to state and university labs.\n\nthe cdc's goal is to more than double the number of coronavirus genomes sequenced in the us, armstrong said. the sequencing is done in labs at the cdc, state health departments, universities and private companies.\n\nthe us is now sequencing about 3,000 samples a week, and the cdc hopes in the next two weeks to more than double that to about 6,500 per week, he said.\n\nscientists around the world are eager to see the change.\n\ni'm optimistic that this is going to get better quickly, van kerkhove said.

harris said.\n\nit was blatant. it was blatant. talking about african-americans and latinos, don't want this stuff happening, harris added, mocking trump's tone to laughter from the audience. what was that supposed to be about? tell me that – if not inserting race in a way that was intended to create fear and division.\n\nthat's not what a leader does and that's certainly not what the leader of the united states is supposed to do, she said.\n\nin her memoir, harris wrote about how her mother taught her to trust her gut instincts.\n\non wednesday night, she was questioned by the event's moderator jonathan capehart, a writer for the washington post, about how she would compare her instincts to trump's gut.\n\ni would actually say that assumes facts, not evidence that he has a gut, she said.\n\nin the interview, the democratic senator spoke about how her heritage as the daughter of immigrants from india and jamaica has shaped her outlook on the plight of immigrants under the policies of the trump administration.\n\nin her new memoir, the truths we hold, harris described her anger watching her mother become a target because she was brown-skinned and how that has driven her efforts to enhance the legal and humanitarian protections over immigrants coming into the us.\n\nharris said she was blessed with a nurturing, happy, healthy childhood, but has been dismayed by trump's vilification of immigrants.\n\nwhen we talk about the immigration debate, i think there is no question that there are powerful forces, including this president, that are attempting to vilify immigrants because they were born in another country, harris said, and suggest that they are therefore any different in terms of their fundamental values or beliefs, or priorities.\n\ni think all of us as americans should all be insulted by that suggestion, the democratic senator said, knowing that all of us are just a few generations, if not one generation away from immigrants who arrived in this country with the same hopes and dreams that we each have for our children.\n\nthe former california attorney general also expressed regret that she was not informed by her staff that her former top aide in that previous office was accused of gender harassment, a lawsuit that the attorney general'soffice settled for nearly $400,000 after she had moved on to the us senate.\n\nharris said that as a leader of the #metoo movement, it was a very painful experience to know that something could happen in one's office of almost 5,000 people, granted, but that i didn't know about it.\n\nthat being said, i take full responsibility for anything that has happened in my office, she said. i always do, and i always will. the buck stops with me.\n\neven in the office of someone who has been an advocate for women's rights, and all people's rights, there is no office that is immune from this kind of behavior, and that's something that we are also going to have to deal with. that's a sad statement, she added.\n\nlarry wallace, who headed the bureau of law enforcement at the california attorney general's office, was accused by his former assistant of forcing her to change the paper or the ink in a printer under his desk every day and refused to move the printer.\n\nwallace worked closely with harris for many years, and she praised his efforts to help root out racial bias in the attorney general's office in her recent memoir.
it seems like barnes & noble has been on its final chapter for years.\n\nslumping sales, closing stores, and a big swing and a miss on digital have hurt the book chain. the holidays were particularly miserable for barnes & noble (bks): sales fell more than 6%, while other retailers had a surprisingly merry christmas.\n\nbut barnes & noble may have life left in its story.\n\nthe company is taking measures to bring people into stores. it launched new concept stores with restaurants that serve avocado toast, kale salad and wine (among other things). it hosts in-store readings and community events.\n\nit's efforts may have been enough to keep barnes & noble afloat so far, said barbara kahn, a marketing professor at wharton. but it's going to have to do some work to turn things around.\n\nthe main problem is that barnes & noble doesn't seem to have a very clear proposition, said neil saunders, managing director of globaldata retail. in order for the company to survive, it needs to convince customers that they should shop at barnes & nobles, he argues.\n\nhere are steps barnes & noble can take to turn itself around.\n\ndownsize and curate\n\nin order to cut down on losses, barnes & noble could both decrease the size of its stores and shut down some locations, said saunders.\n\nsmaller stores could make for a better shopping experience, added kahn.\n\nkahn noted that amazon's bookstores are much smaller than barnes & noble's, focusing on a curated collection of recommended items.\n\nit makes the shopping very easy to do, she said.\n\nbarnes & noble can start by losing its most outdated products -- cds and dvds -- and doing a better job of curating the toys, journals and other non-book items it sells. right now, saunders said, shoppers face a random assortment of products, most of which can be found at stores like target (tgt) and walmart (wmt).\n\nrelated: barnes & noble losses: blame it on harry potter\n\nthe company may plan on making some of these changes. in its annual report for 2017, the company said it is hopeful that improving navigation and discovery throughout the store, including a customer friendly and more intuitive organization of books and improved signage for easier browsing, will help sales. and the brand is testing out smaller stores, and cutting back on gifts that don't sell.\n\nditch starbucks\n\nit's possible that barnes & noble's decades-old partnership with starbucks (sbux) has run its course, said kahn. people may pop into a barnes & noble to get a cup of coffee, but that doesn't mean they're going to buy anything else.\n\ni'm not sure the synergy works both ways, she said.\n\nsaunders doesn't think a coffee shop is a bad idea. but rather than partnering with a national chain, he suggested joining forces with a local cafe in order to distinguish a barnes & noble's coffee shop from one you can find on any corner.\n\nwe believe a differentiated experience is a must in today's retail landscape, added david schick, managing partner and lead retail analyst with consumer edge research. in this case that means merchandise and food / beverage offerings.\n\nthe companies have not disclosed the details of their partnership. starbucks did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nbarnes & noble cafes did have slightly positive results last quarter, thanks to buy-one-get-one and other deals, said ceo demos parneros when discussing second-quarter earnings.\n\nbuild a community\n\nbarnes & noble rides the waves on bestsellers like harry potter or hit records like adele's 25. that's a dangerous strategy, said saunders.\n\nif you're so reliant [on trends], your business doesn't work, he explained.\n\ninstead, barnes & noble could build a community by appealing to fans of those books and artists throughout the year.\n\nbarnes & noble was able to do that with university book stores, said kahn. students and alumni looking for college swag have a clear reason to walk into a university-affiliated barnes & noble over another store.\n\nbut barnes & noble spun off that part of its business into a separate entity called barnes & noble education, so it'll have to find a different way to keep customers coming back, whether by hosting more compelling events throughout the year or selling more merchandise and gifts for dedicated fans.\n\nrelated: barnes & noble surges on takeover rumors\n\ndouble down on home goods\n\nbarnes & noble could take a page from indigo, canada's largest book, gift and specialty toy retailer.\n\nindigo is doing well. sales are climbing thanks in particular to its home goods and toy businesses (indigo sells books, but it also sells cookware, furniture and home decor). the company has its own proprietary gift and merchandise, and recently launched concept stores to reflect its change from a bookstore to a cultural department store for booklovers, a distinction which seems to be working.\n\noften books are decorative accessories, said saunders.\n\neven people who prefer to read books on an e-reader might still want to buy coffee table books.\n\nindigo, saunders noted, is thinking of coming to the united states -- so barnes had better act fast, before a strong competitor makes a bad situation worse.\n\nkill nook\n\nnook, barnes & noble's digital arm, has long been a thorn in the book seller's side.\n\nin its 2017 annual report, barnes & noble noted that from april 2016 to april 2017, sales of nook devices and accessories plummeted by 34.9%. and digital content sales fell 18.1% in that period.\n\nstill, barnes & noble thinks it can turn nook around. the company said in the 2017 report that by outsourcing certain operations and making other changes, nook can stave off further losses.\n\nsaunders suggested that rather than try to salvage nook, barnes & noble should focus on bringing people into its brick-and-mortar locations. the company's many physical locations -- it owns more than 600 bookstores -- set it apart from online retailers like amazon. meanwhile, nook has failed as a competitor to the kindle and tablets -- so barnes & noble's energy would be better spent on revamping its stores.

(cnn) -- jennifer muzquiz was goth in high school. she had, and still has, multicolored hair, a face full of piercings, and an all-black wardrobe, even though she no longer identifies with the goth subculture. and while her style had always earned her her fair share of strange glances, she says everything changed for the worse after the columbine school shootings on april 20, 1999.\n\njennifer muzquiz, in all black, decided to study at home after feeling shunned as a goth after columbine.\n\nit was on that day that eric harris and dylan klebold killed 12 students and teachers in a shooting spree at columbine high school in littleton, colorado.\n\nthe massacre was one of the deadliest school shootings in history, and it had a profound effect on students and teachers across the country. as the media and the public groped for meaning behind the incident, there were plenty of theories about the motive behind the massacre.\n\none of these was that harris and klebold were members of the goth subculture, or trench-coat mafia as they were known at columbine, and thus had been outcasts.\n\nthis theory has been widely refuted, but for goth students around the country, the damage was done.\n\nas a result [of columbine], the public were afraid of the 'goths' and 'punks' and 'metalheads' at school, says muzquiz, who was a high school senior at the time.\n\nparents, often successfully, lobbied to get trench coats and all-black attire banned in their local schools. school administrators started considering these groups to be gangs and harassment of students was rampant, with unwarranted backpack searches, detainment in the hallways by security guards, and being called into the administrative offices for questioning.\n\nrumors ran rampant about kids who looked like they were going to bring a gun to school, and muzquiz says her classmates quickly learned if they wanted to cause trouble for a student, all they had to do was report that student had a list of enemies.\n\nthey could simply report to administrators that the person had an 'enemies list' and the school would quickly swoop in to rectify the situation, even when it wasn't the truth. ... the accused would forever be known as 'the kid with the list' and ostracized, she says.\n\nbecause of this and the new dress code restrictions, her goth friends were afraid to go to school. muzquiz herself caught so much flak for her appearance that she went into home studies. and though she was no longer in school, discrimination couldn't be avoided. people in town would cross to the other side of the street to avoid her and her friends, she says. ireport.com: 'sadly, teens still tend to shun those who are different than they are'\n\nmuzquiz was even interviewed by the national media about her experiences after columbine. at first she regretted it and feared backlash. i had already gotten enough crap since columbine about wearing all black, she says. but she was glad she did it after receiving e-mails from other students who identified with her and thanked her for the interviews, including one girl who was suicidal until reading an article about her.\n\none girl even had e-mailed me and said [she] was coming home to write a suicide note ... and kill herself after school. she read the article about me and it made her think twice, says muzquiz. in the article, i said it's not worth letting these people get to you. it's not up to them to tell you that you're wrong. she thanked me.\n\n[to have] a 14-year-old e-mail me ... it was just, like, whoa, i don't care who says anything bad ... i helped someone, says muzquiz. to this day that just sticks with me. anything i do in my life -- nothing's going to measure to that, the fact that i helped someone realize that there's more to life.\n\nthings changed for teachers after columbine, too. many say they realized they weren't just responsible for their students' knowledge, but for their overall well-being.\n\nlife was never the same after that day, says barbara rademacher, a veteran teacher from rogers, arkansas. schools across the country instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks and metal detectors, and teachers were trained to deal with violent behavior. but more than that, says rademacher, teachers and students are always just a little afraid.\n\nwhat columbine said to me as an educator was that we in the education community hold people's lives in our hands. ... we as educators have a much higher duty, a much higher call, than just to teach our subject areas. ... columbine was to education what 9/11 was to the united states: a shattering wake-up call, a disaster so profound, it permanently changed our world view. ireport.com: 'education is literally a matter of life and death'\n\nkym godwin remembers a similar wake-up call after the shooting. she was a first-year teacher in ilwaco, washington, at the time.\n\ni think most people who go into teaching have the desire to go out there and change the world and enlighten kids and bring them to this great level of knowledge, she says. i remember when it happened, all of a sudden, it was like: 'how can i give them all of this knowledge if i can't keep them safe?' i realized at that moment that my job wasn't just giving them academic learning, it was also about protecting them and making them feel like they're in a safe place.\n\nthis realization hit home for her when her school had a lockdown. teenagers from another part of town had entered the school, allegedly looking for a student there. a school security guard apprehended them right outside the door to godwin's classroom.\n\ni remember thinking, what would happen if somebody actually walked in the door? ... and that's when it hit me, that the kids have to be able to trust me as their teacher to protect them regardless of who walks through that door. i told the kids, this is real, and i am the one in control and i will protect you. ... and i found out afterward that virtually every teacher in the building did the exact same thing. the kids looked to us and knew we were there to keep them safe.\n\ngodwin also means safe in a different way. it includes protecting her students from physical harm, yes, but also protecting them from bullying or social stigmas that could potentially lead to violent behavior. some investigators have said

(cnn) —\n\npsychological and emotional abuse in intimate relationships is now a crime in ireland.\n\nthe domestic violence act 2018 went into effect on tuesday and provides new protections for victims of coercive control, a type of emotional and psychological abuse aimed at stripping a person of their self-worth and agency.\n\nalthough psychological and emotional abuse – including controlling behavior, isolation, and threats of violence – can be more difficult to recognize than physical violence, it can be just as damaging, experts say.\n\nireland's minister of justice and equality charlie flanagan said in a statement wednesday that the new law recognizes that the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship.\n\nthis new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he added.\n\nin a 2014 european union agency for fundamental rights (fra) pan-european survey on violence against women, almost a third of irish women (31%) said they had experienced psychological abuse by a partner. a further 23% of respondents said they had experienced controlling behavior, 24% said they had experienced abusive behavior, and 12% said they had experienced stalking (including online stalking).\n\nwomen's aid, ireland's national domestic violence support organization, said that while it welcomed the new law, in order for it to be effective, it must be properly resourced.\n\nit must be positive, it must be practical and it must make them and their children safer from abuse. what is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence. we are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence, margaret martin, women's aid director, said in a statement on monday.\n\nwomen must feel change quickly, she added.\n\nthe group, who runs the country's only free, national, domestic violence 24 hour helpline, reported that in 2017 there were 15,833 disclosures of domestic abuse, including 10,281 reports of emotional abuse. male intimate partners accounted for 83% of those abusers, women's aid reported.\n\nireland is one of only a few countries that have criminalized psychological or emotional abuse.\n\nin 2010, the french government criminalized psychological violence in intimate relationships, with the punishable offense carrying a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a €45,000 fine (approximately us $51,345). in england and wales, coercive control in intimate relationships became a criminal offense in 2015. last year, scotland also adopted a similar measure.\n\nthe new irish law has included additional measures to combat gender-based violence, including criminalizing forced marriages, repealing legislation that previously allowed underage couples to marry, and allowing for victims of domestic abuse to apply for safety protection orders – regardless of whether or not they live with their abuser.
washington (cnn) top us national security officials continue to defend the trump administration's claim that it killed iranian military commander qasem soleimani in response to an impending threat to american lives, but the lack of evidence provided to lawmakers and the public has fueled lingering skepticism about whether the strike was justified.\n\npresident donald trump, secretary of state mike pompeo and top military officials have offered similar explanations for targeting soleimani, citing an imminent threat from his plans to carry out what chairman of the joint chiefs mark milley called a significant campaign of violence against the us in the coming days, weeks or months.\n\nif you're an american in the region, days and weeks, this is not something that's relevant, pompeo told cnn's jake tapper on state of the union sunday, dodging a question on the imminence of such iranian attacks. we have to prepare, we have to be ready, and we took a bad guy off the battlefield.\n\nbut questions have continued to swirl in recent days over the timing, whether the administration fully considered the fallout from such a strike against soleimani, and if an appropriate legal basis was established for the presidential authorization of lethal force.\n\na republican congressional source familiar with the administration's decision to strike soleimani acknowledged that in the past the president has been reluctant to take military action. in this case, the killing of an american contractor , the wounding of others, and the subsequent embassy protests crossed his line. his advisers also pointed out to the president that if he didn't respond now, they (iran) will continue to cross it.\n\ni am very confident he was not reluctant, said the source. when trump finally gets ready to act, they added, you can't out escalate him.\n\ncnn has previously reported that there was internal debate over the decision and work behind the scenes to develop a legal argument before the operation was carried out.\n\nafter a meeting sunday in mar-a-lago where president donald trump was briefed by senior members of his national security team on options regarding iran, some officials emerged surprised the president chose to target soleimani, according to a source familiar with the briefing.\n\nthe officials who briefed trump included defense secretary mark esper, pompeo, national security adviser robert o'brien and milley.\n\nthe source said that some aides expected trump to pick a less risky option, but once presented with the choice of targeting soleimani he remained intent on going forward.\n\nfailure to connect the dots\n\nsince that time, the us has provided few details about those specific threats posed by soleimani and failed to clearly outline the legal underpinnings\n\nthe administration has failed to connect the dots in a way that provides a clear picture of an imminent threat and that argument has been obscured by inconsistent messaging from us officials.\n\none thing that has become relatively clear is that the operation to take out soleimani did not hinge on some kind of golden opportunity to target the quds force commander, unlike the missions that killed osama bin laden and isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi.\n\nsome information has surfaced.\n\na source briefed on the latest intelligence told cnn that before the strike, specific information showed iranian surface to air missiles and other military weaponry that the us had been watching, were moving in on at least two us air bases, as well as us embassies in the region.\n\nadditionally, the source said that the situation was different because the us had advanced notice of his plans to kill americans and that the previous reason not to kill him has gone away -- fear that it could cause the irgc to specifically target americans.\n\no'brien made the case friday that the strike was prompted by intelligence related to soleimani's movements coupled with ongoing attacks that he was planning against us diplomats and military personnel.\n\nsoleimani was in the middle east, in iraq, and traveling around the middle east. he had just come from damascus, where he was planning attacks on american soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors, and against our diplomats. so this strike was aimed at disrupting ongoing attacks that were being planned by soleimani, and deterring future iranian attacks, through their proxies or through the irgc quds force directly, against americans. as president trump said today, this action was taken to stop a war, not to start a war, he said.\n\nwhen asked by a reporter if the threat was imminent, milley responded friday saying, absolutely, but defined the time frame as days and maybe weeks.\n\nhe also warned that attacks could still happen, meaning the threat was not eliminated by killing soleimani.\n\none republican congressional source, when asked about whether there was intelligence that attacks were imminent, said there was no doubt he was there to plan attacks against the us, referring to soleimani.\n\nsoleimani was under frequent surveillance by the us intelligence community, according to a senior administration official.\n\ncapturing intel from this guy would be a top priority, the official said. counterintelligence officials were routinely monitoring his movements, gathering information on who he was meeting with and what he was doing as he moved around the region. the official said he was definitely not in a secure undisclosed location like bin laden and baghdadi.\n\nthat kind of visibility gave the intelligence community a multitude of options for taking out soleimani. this factor would obviously be of great use to the intelligence community were soleimani determined to be moving toward an imminent attack on us interests.\n\nthis official, however, could not confirm whether that was the case prior to the soleimani operation.\n\nlawmaker doubts\n\nsome lawmakers have said that the information provided in classified settings last week painted an incomplete picture, prompting more questions about whether the threats cited by the administration meet the legal standard of imminent.\n\none democratic source who was briefed friday by administration officials said the information offered was absolutely unconvincing as far as proving there was an imminent threat and democratic lawmakers have raised similar concerns.\n\nin an interview with cnn friday, democratic sen. tom udall of new mexico said more than once that he does not believe an attack on the united states was imminent as president donald trump and other top administration officials have said.\n\nmy staff was briefed by a number of people representing a variety of agencies in the united states government and they came away with no feeling that there was evidence of an imminent attack, udall said, adding he believed the president is only saying an attack was imminent to justify killing soleimani.\n\nstill, the us military remains comfortable with calling soleimani's potential plan imminent, a us defense official told cnn saturday.\n\nit all depends on what you call imminent, the official said, but we believe he was in the final stages of ordering attacks when he visited beirut and damascus in the days before he was killed.\n\nthe official added that while they continue to believe the intelligence showed soleimani was planning multiple attacks at multiple locations, they do not have absolute detailed evidence of everything he was trying to execute.\n\nseparately, a senior defense official told cnn there were multiple intelligence indicators that he was continuing to plan attacks. a significant turning point came when the us contractor was killed a week ago, the senior official said. the intelligence may be no different of him (soleimani) planning attacks as he had in the past, but this was different because an american had been killed, added the republican congressional source.\n\nanother us official hedged, saying said the threat posed by the attacks soleimani was accused of planning was pretty imminent.\n\nthe official added, when asked if soleimani was needed to be alive for these threats and plans to be executed in the same way that he planned them, that after his death things will change.\n\ntrump's assertion that the strike was meant to avoid a war and claims by administration officials that the operation was intended to de-escalate have also prompted confusion. however, a source familiar with the administration's thinking told cnn that those comments offer some insight into what the intention behind the attack was.\n\nthis source said the argument for targeting soleimani, rather than iranian assets, centers around the idea that it was a preemptive move intended to de-escalate the situation by deterring any plans to attack american embassies or bases.\n\nthe reasoning behind this, the same source told cnn, is that if iran were to fire on a us base or embassy, it would trigger a large-scale military response by the us, so by killing soleimani, the hope was that it would cause the iranians to change their behavior.\n\naim to reestablish a deterrent?\n\nbut that rationale may betray the administration's true goal of reestablishing a deterrent against iran -- a step national security officials have long said was necessary but does not necessarily provide evidence of an imminent attack as required for the president to legally authorize lethal force.\n\na separate us official raised additional questions about the motive for the strike, telling cnn it had presidential authorization at this level and they opted for a preemptive option after the previous moves of maximum pressure didn't change the iranian pattern of behavior.\n\nformer cia director david petraeus seemed to also conclude that the objective of the strike was deterrence in a recent interview with foreign policy\n\nthe reasoning seems to be to show in the most significant way possible that the us is just not going to allow the continued violence—the rocketing of our bases, the killing of an american contractor, the attacks on shipping, on unarmed drones—without a very significant response, he said.\n\nmany people had rightly questioned whether american deterrence had eroded somewhat because of the relatively insignificant responses to the earlier actions. this clearly was of vastly greater importance. of course it also, per the defense department statement, was a defensive action given the reported planning and contingencies that soleimani was going to iraq to discuss and presumably approve, petraeus added.\n\nbut petraeus' comment noting the pentagon's assertion that the strike was defensive underscores the confusion caused by the administration's shifting legal justifications for the operation and failure to explain its definition of imminent.\n\ndemocrat sen. chris van hollen of maryland also told cnn that one of his representatives was at the friday briefing and said nothing that came out of the briefing changed my view that this was an unnecessary escalation of the situation in iraq and iran.\n\nvan hollen went on to say: while i can't tell you what was said, i can tell you, i have no additional information to support the administration's claim that this was an imminent attack on americans.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments sunday.
(cnn) — historically, travel in the american south has evoked a specific romantic image: guests in wide-brimmed hats sip mint juleps and sweet tea in white rocking chairs beneath weeping willows or among the colonnades of antebellum and georgian revival mansions.\n\nnow, that picture is changing as new chic hotels from louisiana to the carolinas are throwing tradition to the wind by embracing a contemporary aesthetic, more urban bauhaus and mid-century modern than neoclassical.\n\nthis new look -- defined by a combination of a kind of organic minimalism and nostalgic references to the not-so-distant past -- tends to feature elements such as exposed brick walls and original industrial beams and eclectic details from vintage typewriters to local contemporary artwork.\n\nthese nine hotels across the south are turning their backs on tara, disrupting preconceived notions of southern hospitality when you stay here:\n\n1. ace hotel, new orleans, louisiana\n\nwhen ace hotel arrived in new orleans in march of 2016 -- taking up residence in a converted nine-story art deco building that was barnett's furniture store from 1928 through the 1970s (the first local shop to carry scandinavian modern furniture) -- it was obvious that change had come to the big easy.\n\nmany would argue that the hipster hotelier (which rejects that label) pioneered the prevailing contemporary hotel experience, being first to emphasize what is local, authentic, minimal and even eccentric. their mandate is to build hotels as monuments to the cities they live in.\n\nthis ace, set in a warehouse district near downtown, has a live music venue, three keys, as well as an adjacent four-story addition imagined by architects eskew+domez+ripple with events spaces and local indie boutiques defend new orleans and friend. plus, the hotel's oyster bar is housed in an original creole cottage.\n\nin the lobby and restaurant, the designers preserved details such as terrazzo floors, corinthian columns and salvaged wrought-iron deco gates. trinkets, art books, turkish kilim rugs and vintage leather furniture, all sourced at local flea markets, pervade.\n\nas an additional local touch, 32 southern artists -- including 13 from new orleans -- were tapped to paint armoires in the rooms.\n\nace hotel new orleans, 600 carondelet street, new orleans, la 70130; +1 504-941-9191\n\n2. quirk hotel, richmond, virginia\n\nlike many small cities in recent years, livable richmond has attracted an influential creative class, who brought restaurants, shops and galleries.\n\nthe arrival of quirk hotel in september 2015 was emblematic of that shift: at the center of richmond's burgeoning arts & design district, among record, vintage shops and up-and-coming boutique brands like ledbury, the property is housed in an historic landmark, once the city's finest department store, jb mosby & co.

high-ranking transportation security administration official wrote monday in an internal email obtained by cnn.\n\nthe email from martin elam, the deputy federal security director overseeing five california airports, directed to all tsa personnel at palm springs international airport, exposes for the first time an acknowledgement that the partial government shutdown – now stretching into a third week – is having some impact on aviation security in at least one airport.\n\nit comes amid safety warnings from the major pilot, flight attendant and tsa employee unions.\n\ntsa has argued that security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change.\n\nbut concerns about the number of callouts in palm springs have reached the point that security operations may be impacted and employees may be disciplined for missed shifts – potential further hardship for those already going without a paycheck.\n\nrelated: tsa senior leaders discuss how to keep screeners at their posts\n\nmore than 2 million passengers passed through the airport last year, according to the city of palm springs website. los angeles international airport, by comparison, handled more than 80 million passengers.\n\npalm springs airport is a small airport that requires a full team effort, said jim gregory, tsa's deputy assistant administrator, in a statement.\n\nthe deputy fsd who is referenced in the email obtained by cnn was simply expressing that all screening employees must report to work during the current lapse in appropriations as required by federal rules. tsa is monitoring screening operations at palm springs and has not seen any adverse impacts to operations.\n\non friday, cnn first reported that hundreds of tsa officers have called out from shifts at four major us airports.\n\ntsa says security concerns are unfounded and screening times have not been impacted. agency spokesman michael bilello on monday said that 4.6% of tsa employees missed a shift on monday nationwide, compared to 3.8% on the same day in 2018. the agency has not released data dating to the beginning of the shutdown on december 21.\n\njanuary is generally a slower month for air travel, but the agency has warned that wait times could increase. it provided data on tuesday showing that nearly all travelers nationwide are waiting less than 30 minutes to be screened.\n\nin the email, elam, the deputy federal security director overseeing palm springs, lax and three other los angeles-area airports, acknowledged security staffing worries and warned of disciplinary action at palm springs airport.\n\nmanagement is appreciative and sensitive to the burden the ongoing government shutdown is placing on each one of you, elam wrote. you are an essential employee and you are required to report for work to carry out essential duties.\n\ndue to excessive unscheduled absences recently experienced at psp (palm springs international airport) that has adversely impacted security operations, if you have an unscheduled absence, you will not be placed in an intermittent furlough status, elam added. your unauthorized unscheduled absence will be coded by payroll as absent without leave (awol). at the conclusion of the government shutdown, an employee's awol status may result in progressive disciplinary action.\n\nelam referred questions to the tsa press office.\n\nunion officials have warned the shutdown places tsa officers in a difficult position, as they are not receiving paychecks to cover the costs of working, such as commuting and childcare. some are seeking temporary employment – with more reliable pay dates – to make ends meet, union officials said.\n\nhydrick thomas, president of the national tsa employee union, told cnn on friday the callouts will definitely affect the flying public.\n\nthe impacts could compound the longer the shutdown lasts, union officials say. those manning the security checkpoint can be demoralized by the lack of pay, or exhausted and less sharp from covering extra shifts, according to union officials who are also employed by tsa. with insufficient staff, managers may open fewer security lanes, causing lines to grow longer and move more slowly. new recruits cannot be hired or trained without funding.\n\nthe loss of officers, while we're already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for american travelers since we don't have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires, thomas said in a statement on monday.\n\ntsa administrator david pekoske and other senior agency officials held a conference call on monday to discuss the shutdown, two sources told cnn. among the topics addressed was the increase in call outs and how to ensure officers show up to work. pekoske also told officials on the call that security standards will not be lessened during the shutdown.\n\nit was not clear if the palm springs email was spurred by the discussion in that meeting, or was separate.\n\nthomas nolan, executive director of the palm springs airport, says he has not noticed any malfunction in how the airport is operating but added that he wouldn't have visibility on tsa staffing issues.\n\nrep. bennie thompson, a democrat who chairs the house homeland security committee, has asked tsa for additional information on the call outs and whether it has a contingency plan to address mass callouts or resignations among its workforce.\n\noffice of personnel management guidelines do specify that employees required to work during a shutdown will be considered absent without leave if they fail to show up, and that the classification can subject an employee to unspecified disciplinary action.

next ten years, he racked up seven arrests and struggled with addiction and post-traumatic stress. his life fell apart.\n\nveterans treatment court helped put it back together.\n\nin 2013, after another arrest, tim was given the chance to participate in the philadelphia veterans treatment court. instead of sitting behind bars, he was connected to intense treatment. in a courtroom surrounded by other veterans, including judge dugan, who served in iraq and afghanistan, tim started to come to terms with his experience.\n\nphoto: c/o melissa fitzgerald former west wing castmates melissa fitzgerald and dule hill attend veterans treatment court graduation in the philadelphia courtroom of judge patrick dugan.\n\nafter graduating veterans treatment court a few years ago, he reunited with his wife and children. he is committed to giving back. he's now a member of the veterans treatment court team, coordinating volunteer veteran mentors to support veterans who share the same struggles he did.\n\nwhen i heard tim's story, i had trouble reconciling it with the happy, respected person i saw in court that day. i couldn't believe how close we'd come to losing him to the system, and how much better off we are that he got a second chance.\n\ntragically, somewhere between 8-10% of those incarcerated in us jails and prisons are veterans. while veterans are incarcerated at significantly lower rates than nonveterans, those that are incarcerated have higher rates of mental health issues than nonveterans. but while it costs taxpayers around $30,000 a year to incarcerate one person, treating them actually saves money. treatment courts have been found to save up to $13,000 for every individual they serve.\n\nwe owe veterans every opportunity to heal and to lead productive lives.\n\nfor too long, this country has equated justice with punishment. by upholding the enduring, absolute value of every human, treatment courts are helping to change our national perspective on what it means to serve justice. there are more than 350 of these veteran-specific treatment courts across the united states, but that number falls far short of reaching every veteran in need.\n\nas we mark the 10th anniversary of these life-saving programs, and we commit to reducing the pain and suffering caused by the opioid crisis, we must double down on programs proven to work. programs like veterans treatment courts.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthat's why my fellow west wing cast members and i continue

source: cnn lookback: a week of protests in iran\n\nin the past, women who allowed their hijab to slip could be admonished by the religious police, but these forces have been less prominent under rouhani's regime. since his reelection last year, enforcement of the law has been somewhat relaxed.\n\nauthorities also announced that women driving with improper head coverings would no longer be arrested and would instead receive a relatively small fine.\n\nwhile the easing of enforcement has emboldened younger women to become more defiant, recent incidents in which they have removed their hijabs in protest could still lead to prison sentences.\n\nalthough rouhani does align himself with protesters from time to time … his allegiance appears to be to the system. so he has to walk a tightrope, ansary said. rouhani won because he made so many pledges to help reform many of the gender discriminatory laws. women voted for him in droves and so did the youth, but he has done very little to bring about significant change for iranian civil society.\n\nsoheila jaloodarzadeh, a female member of iranian parliament, said on wednesday during an event on women's rights that the protests were the culmination of years of restrictions, the semiofficial ilna news agency reported.\n\nwhen we restrict women, and put them under unnecessary pressure, exactly this is the reason for rebellions, jaloodarzadeh reportedly said. this is the reason … the daughters of revolution street are putting their headscarves on a stick.\n\ncnn's euan mckirdy contributed to this report.

afraid you might be behind on saving for retirement? there's one simple way to get ahead of pretty much everyone else.\n\nabout 80% of americans surveyed by voya financial said they hadn't taken the time to review or revise their retirement plan within the past year.\n\nso simply taking a look at how your 401(k) or ira performed in 2016 will mean you're already doing more than most americans.\n\nyou want to look at it at least once a year, if not quarterly, said james nichols, senior vice president at voya.\n\ncalculator: are you behind on retirement saving?\n\nbut you don't necessarily need to make changes to your game plan. here are four things to ask yourself to make sure you're on track in the new year.\n\n1. how much did i spend last year?\n\nit's hard to know how much money you'll need in retirement if you don't know how much you spend each year to support your lifestyle. experts suggest looking at a few months from the past year.\n\nmost people are blown away by their spend number, said tim mcgrath, a cfp and founding partner at riverpoint wealth management.\n\nthat's partly because they don't take into account the one-time purchases, like a new couch or furnace, that don't occur each month.\n\nthere's always something that's not in the budget that throws everything for a loop, mcgrath said.\n\n2. can i increase my future contributions?\n\ndon't think of your savings as a leftover. put it in your budget along with your expenses.\n\nmany financial planners suggest saving 15% of your gross income.\n\nwhen you're saving for a longer-term financial goal like retirement, it's prudent to save at least 15% of your income, nichols said.\n\nrelated: how much should i have saved for retirement right now?\n\nif you're not hitting that target yet, think about increasing your contribution by 1% at the start of the new year or when you get a raise.\n\nin 2017, you can defer up to $18,000 of your salary to your 401(k) and contribute as much as $5,500 to your ira -- the same amount as last year. (once you're 50 or older, those caps increase to $24,000 in a 401(k) and $6,500 in an ira.)\n\n3. did i max out my ira last year? there's still time.\n\nnew year's day has come and gone, but there's still time to play catchup on last year's savings goal. if you weren't able to contribute to your ira in 2016 (or simply forgot), but have the financial means to do so now -- you're in luck.\n\nyou get an extra three months (or until you file your 2016 taxes) to contribute up to the cap for your traditional, roth or sep ira, said megan gorman, managing partner at chequers financial management.\n\nif you've already hit the limit in 2016, you can continue to contribute to your ira and it will count toward the 2017 tax year.\n\nyou don't, however, get an extra three months to contribute up to the $18,000 max for your 401(k). any money you contribute in the new year will automatically count towards your 2017 limit.\n\n4. are my investments balanced?\n\nwhen you first set up your retirement portfolio you, hopefully, set a diversified mix of stocks and bonds that is appropriate for your age. the closer you get to retirement, the less risk you'll want to take on.\n\nchances are, you had a good year. overall, the stock market ended with gains in 2016 and the average investor made just over 5%, according to openfolio.\n\nbut sometimes your balance can get out of whack if particular stocks did better than others over the past year.\n\nnichols says a good rule of thumb is to rebalance your portfolio if any of your buckets are off by more than 5%.\n\nif, for example, you're goal was to have 25% of your portfolio in international stocks and now they take up more than 30%, you might want to make a change. to get back to your original plan, you can either contribute less of your money to international stocks this year, or sell some and buy more of whatever bucket in your portfolio fell in value last year.\n\nwhat is your biggest personal finance hurdle in the new year? share your story with katie.lobosco@cnn.com and you could be featured in an upcoming cnnmoney article.

(cnn) —\n\nchina is getting closer to equipping its warships with electromagnetic railguns, state media reports – which, if true, means its fleet could soon boast some of the most advanced weapons technology on the planet.\n\nciting cctv, the state-run global times on thursday reported the underlying railgun technology – which utilizes electrical power rather than explosives to launch projectiles – was based on fully independent intellectual property, rather than copied from other countries.\n\nunconfirmed sightings of a chinese landing ship apparently equipped with a test railgun in an undisclosed location have circulated around the internet this week.\n\nmilitary expert carl schuster, former director of operations at the us pacific command's joint intelligence center, told cnn that if the reports were accurate, the weapon was likely to be a year or two away from being operational.\n\nthey'll say it's operational – what that mean the operational evaluation has started, (and they're) testing it under more realistic conditions, he said. typically you're looking at a year before being deployed.\n\nschuster said it was significant that china appeared to be transitioning from copying foreign weapon designs to developing their own technology.\n\nit also tells you (that china) is no longer 10-15 years behind (the us)… they are now approaching parity with the west in terms of weapons development, he added.\n\ntechnological sea change\n\nrailgun technology, which uses electromagnetic force to send projectiles up to 125 miles at 7.5 times the speed of sound, is cheaper and more accurate than traditional gunpowder-based methods.\n\nusing a massive electrical pulse rather than a chemical propellant, the railgun can launch projectiles much farther than the 13-nautical-mile range of the us navy's standard 5-inch naval gun, the us office of naval research says.\n\nphoto: u.s. navy an image from the us navy showing some of the railgun tech in development.\n\nrailgun projectiles also don't need explosive warheads – they do their damage with sheer speed.\n\n(railguns) give you more firepower, more range, (and they can be better) guided, as you control acceleration in the barrel, schuster added.\n\nchina's moab?\n\nthe claim that china is a step closer to having a combat-ready railgun comes on the heels of another global times report that a chinese arms company has tested a massive bomb which, according to a chinese military analyst quoted in the story, can easily and completely wipe out fortified ground targets such as reinforced buildings, bastions and defense shelters.\n\nthe device, developed by chinese arms giant china north industries group corporation, better known as norinco, is approximately 5 to 6 meters (17 to 20 feet) long, according to wei dongxu, the quoted analyst.\n\nwhile smaller, the chinese bomb is similar in capability to the us' gbu-43/b massive ordnance air blast bomb (moab), nicknamed the mother of all bombs.\n\nmoab, the us military's most powerful non-nuclear bomb, was first used operationally in 2017, when one was dropped on isis targets in afghanistan, according to us officials.
(cnn) hoping to give back to the frontline workers who have risked their lives throughout the pandemic, a college student has created a program that offers free tutoring to their children.\n\nbrett mozarsky, a senior at haverford college in pennsylvania, experienced firsthand the isolation that students could feel as all of his classes moved online for remote learning. he understood that without access to important academic and social resources at school, students could struggle especially if their parents were unavailable to help tutor them.\n\ndetermined to make a change, mozarsky began to develop free for the frontline tutors in march as covid-19 began to spread across the country. he wanted to give students a helping hand while offering the needed support that frontline workers may not have been able to offer their own children.\n\ni felt even more concerned for the children of frontline workers, who, like their peers, might have been struggling with remote learning, but were also further disadvantaged by the fact that their parents might not have as much time as they normally would to be at home and help their children with schoolwork, mozarsky told cnn.\n\nfrontline workers have made tremendous sacrifices to keep us safe and healthy throughout this pandemic. i only wanted to give back to these amazing individuals and their families in some way for all that they have done for us.\n\nread more
laconia, new hampshire (cnn) pete buttigieg isn't known for showing emotion. but on tuesday, minutes after the first tranche of delayed iowa caucuses results gave him a narrow lead, he choked up.\n\nthe former south bend, indiana, mayor was visibly emotional here in new hampshire as he reflected on what his success in iowa -- as the first top tier gay candidate from a major american political party -- could mean to lgbtq youth across the country.\n\nthis validates the idea that we can have a message, the same message, connect in urban and rural and suburban communities, that we can reach out to democrats, and to independents, and even to some future former republicans, ready to bring change to this country, buttigieg said.\n\nthen buttigieg's voice started to shake.\n\nthis validates for a kid somewhere in a community wondering if he belongs or she belongs or they belong in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country, there is a lot backing up the belief, he said.\n\nbuttigieg was joined at the end of his town hall by husband, chasten buttigieg. the two embraced on stage to cheers.\n\nbuttigieg, in an interview with cnn in new hampshire on tuesday, struck that same tone.\n\nit's extraordinary, he said of his slim lead. it also, i hope, means something to a lot of people wondering if they fit in, people who are different, people who don't know if they belong in their community, or in their family. this is a proof you can believe in yourself and in your country.\n\nbuttigieg, who came out in an op-ed in 2015, has reluctantly embraced his unlikely role as a symbol of lgbtq progress. while he speaks about it across the country, it is not central to his candidacy, nor is it something that regularly comes up at events.\n\nstill, buttigieg's identity and his campaign have been inextricably linked. earlier in his run, the mayor often fielded questions about being gay and running for president, and some of his most notable early campaign moments focused on the historic nature of his candidacy.\n\nthe former mayor told an audience in april that, if you had shown me exactly what it was that made me gay, i would have cut it out with a knife.\n\nif you could have offered me a pill that could make me straight, he added, i would have swallowed it before you could give me a swig of water.\n\nbuttigieg also wrote in his pre-campaign memoir that he worried that his coming out would define him beyond what he had accomplished in his young life.\n\ni had strongly supported the causes from the beginning, but did not want to be defined by them, he wrote of lgbtq rights.\n\nand while his identity doesn't come up in every event, some of buttigieg's most well received lines have been about being gay and his marriage to chasten, whom he wed in 2018.\n\nsitting down to christmas dinner at the side of my husband, whose marriage to me, our family -- not its well-being, but its existence -- comes by the grace of single vote on the united states supreme court, buttigieg said in december 2018, just a month before he started exploring a presidential run.\n\nand as the iowa race came to a close, buttigieg often heralded the fact that same sex marriage was legalized in iowa in 2009.\n\ni was also not here, but watching, when iowa took a step that filled me with a lot of hope, buttigieg said. it was a step that gave me permission to believe that one day, i could wear this wedding ring, that's on my finger.\n\nthe mayor has also used his identity as a way to answer a key question to voters: how will you handle attacks from donald trump?\n\nbuttigieg, in response, often touts that he grew up gay in indiana as a proof of his mettle on the campaign trail. and the line usually gets the audience to laugh.\n\nbut this moment on tuesday is markedly different. democrats like annise parker, the head of the buttigieg-backing victory fund and the former mayor of houston, heralded the lead as a step forward.\n\npete's strong showing in iowa represents a revolution in american politics, upending traditional notions of electability and proving america is ready to elect its first openly gay president, parker, who was one of the first gay mayors of a major us city when she was elected in 2010, said. with defeating donald trump top of mind, iowa voters determined pete is the best candidate to do it, a powerful statement about our progress as a country as this primary season begins.
(cnn) — i'll just step out for a second, says aerial photographer timo lieber, before swinging out of the helicopter with his camera, just a few hundred meters over the glittering london cityscape.\n\ncnn is with the award-winning german-born and london-based photographer on one of his nighttime shoots over the uk capital, as part of his astonishing photo series lights of london.\n\ni love london and it feels like home now, he says. it is actually a quite chaotic place but it looks sensational when you are up there in the air.\n\n'fly with the right guys'\n\ngerman-born photographer takes incredible aerial photographs of the uk capital by hanging out of a helicopter just a few hundred meters above the city\n\nlieber's technique involves strapping himself into a helicopter with the seats ripped out, then hanging out of the aircraft to take his photos. the shoots over densely peopled areas require special permission, but he knows the right people.\n\nyou can basically do what you want if you fly with the right guys, he says.\n\nlieber's methods may be high adrenaline but the resulting images are serene and eerily beautiful.\n\nthe thing about aerial photography is that you are so far moved from the subject you are actually shooting, [it] allows you to play with compositions, explains lieber. you can play with colors, with textures, with geometry, so that actually keeps things very, very simple.\n\ninspired by our environment and the interaction between humans and nature, he travels around the globe to search for impressive images, from remote deserts to the arctic circle.\n\nuncommon perspective\n\nthe way i started shooting was just shooting abstract landscapes, he says. in series such as earth patterns and earth etchings, very often you wouldn't know what it is that i am shooting.\n\nnow he's turned to attention to big city life and his adopted home town. the main reason i went up there was to just really document the change that london is going through. one skyscraper is going up after the other. the aerial view is a very uncommon perspective you can take, he adds.\n\nit just shows something that looks totally unreal from above and just different [...] you can use it to tell a story.
(cnn) it is officially, finally 2021. but while everyone on earth has had enough of the year that was, americans need to gird themselves for a bit more 2020, at least to start, as a large portion of republican lawmakers put their names next to president donald trump's effort to overturn the election.\n\nthe president has brought his drama show back to washington early , perhaps realizing his time in the white house is down to days and counting. he's also hoping to pressure republican lawmakers to back his wild and inaccurate claims of fraud when the electoral votes that seal his exit are counted in what's normally an antiquated ceremony.\n\nhe will also travel to georgia for his last political rally as president, when he encourages voters there to show up for the all-important january 5 runoff and protect republicans' senate majority. there are, as of this writing, two developing complications for trump. he's spent months attacking the electoral system as fraudulent, particularly in georgia , where he lost. and one of the republican candidates, sen. david perdue, will have to quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19.\n\nthere will be a show january 6. cnn's jake tapper reported thursday that as many as 140 house republicans could vote to throw out electoral votes from swing states. that's a strong majority of the republicans in the house trying to overturn the election and swear fealty to the president.\n\nit's an easier vote in the house, where objections to the election are destined to fall against the larger number of democrats in that chamber.\n\nsenators who bit their tongues during his presidency will have a chance to find their independence.\n\nthere will be calls for sanity. nebraska sen. ben sasse criticized those who would object to the electoral votes of pennsylvania, and perhaps other states, when they're counted january 6.\n\ni have been urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy, sasse wrote in a six-part facebook post , after sen. josh hawley, a missouri republican, said he would be the senator who forced votes on the objections.\n\nit'll be an aggravating vote for those senate republicans running for reelection in 2022, when the party is defending more senate seats than democrats.\n\nthere will be a split in the gop. a vote for the objections trump wants is a vote for conspiracy theory over fact and against the democratic will of the country.\n\na vote against the objections is to accept the decision of the people but defy the grassroots of the gop and fail a fealty test to trump, likely inviting a primary challenge in the near future.\n\nfew senate republicans want to make this choice, which is why party elders had tried to shield themselves from it. but now that hawley has decided to object, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has made it clear to lawmakers he's giving them room to vote their conscience, according to a source familiar with a thursday conference call on which mcconnell asked hawley -- who was not in attendance -- to explain his rationale.\n\nstill, mcconnell went on to tell his colleagues that even with a career as long as his, the vote would mark one of the most significant, perhaps the most significant, he'd ever cast -- and that it would mark the same for each senator on the call, two people familiar with the call told cnn.\n\nbut this intraparty split will carry over to other questions. as trump weighs in, unbound by any sort of official responsibility, his sway over the party will be tested.\n\npresident trump's tweets in favor of $2,000 stimulus checks got several gop senators to endorse the idea, although mcconnell effectively killed it\n\nwhen former president trump tweets in favor of something, will republicans pay attention?\n\nthere will be a reckoning over the president's twitter account. even after he's left office, the president will have access to his twitter account. it's been his preferred mode of communication while in office. the problem for the soon-to-be former president is that he may not be given the same deference by social media companies out of office as he's been given as leader of the free world.\n\ntwitter and facebook have taken to marking as suspect the posts in which he spreads outright falsehoods about his election loss, but it may soon become difficult for those companies to justify allowing him to spread them at all.\n\naccounts have been suspended for less than what trump does on a daily basis and the social media companies will come under immediate pressure to censure trump, perhaps by suspending his account.\n\nthe effects of such a move, were it to occur, would be interesting not only to see if his power to influence is clipped without his platform, but also to hasten gop scrutiny of section 230, a provision of telecom law that separates the companies from the content users publish on their sites.\n\nthere will be a split among democrats. it's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. as president, it's unlikely biden will use those same tactics. and he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. a year from now, it will be much easier for republicans to focus on biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. vermont sen. bernie sanders won't quietly let biden take the moderate route. neither will massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez or the congressional black caucus.\n\nthe proof of these divides is already evident in the scrutiny biden has faced from progressives in the selection of his cabinet.\n\nhis ability to navigate the demands of the groups that rallied behind his campaign, and navigate around republican obstruction, will determine whether he can get anything done in the white house.\n\nthere will be a majority in the senate. we just don't know yet which party will have it. that depends on what happens in georgia's twin us senate runoffs tuesday. if the two republican incumbents -- sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler -- win, republicans will have 51 votes and control access to the senate floor. given mcconnell's expertise in obstruction and interest in the 2022 midterms, a 51-seat majority could be biden's biggest presidential headache. if the democratic challengers -- jon ossoff and raphael warnock -- win, the resulting 50-50 tie won't give democrats much wiggle room to pass legislation, but it will give them the ability to get measures on the senate floor with vice president-elect kamala harris able to break ties as president of the senate.\n\nthere will be so much more covid. the beginning of biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. the country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of americans are dying each day. he's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.\n\nthere will be something new. think back to the beginning of 2020, when covid was not yet known to be in the country, and the overriding political story was the historic impeachment of trump for pressuring foreign governments to help him taint biden.\n\none year later, those words seem like something from a different era. covid rages, impeachment feels like a footnote to history and, rather than suffer trump's sabotage, biden will soon be president.\n\nthe coming year is sure to include its own twists, and our collective view of this strange and tumultuous period will change as it's stretched through time and perspective.

And I think the idea of a tariff against Mexico is a terrible idea. I think it would hurt Mexico a lot, and I think it would hurt American consumers as well. We don't need a trade war with Mexico.\n\nThe White House has floated the idea of imposing a 20% tax on imports from Mexico, in order to pay for Trump's proposed southern border wall. However, the White House says Trump is weighing other options.\n\nMoore also said he views Trump's trade policy with China differently.\n\nPHOTO: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images UNITED STATES - AUGUST 31: Stephen Moore of The Heritage Foundation is interviewed by CQ in his Washington office, August 31, 2016.

I think he views China as an adversary, and I've come to the conclusion that they are a bit of an adversary militarily, and economically. They're playing a different game economically. They don't play by the rules. They do cheat, they do steal, and I think taking a tougher stance with China is overdue.\n\nMoore also recommended conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly's book on Harry Truman's presidency, Killing the Rising Sun to the President and listeners.\n\nI think people like Trump can learn from Harry Truman, Moore said.

(CNN) Two of President Donald Trump's Cabinet secretaries -- Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos -- are resigning over the riot Wednesday at the US Capitol.\n\nThe secretaries were among a number of administration officials who announced they were leaving in the wake of a mob of pro-Trump supporters breaching the US Capitol.\n\nIn the statement, addressed to the agency she led, Chao wrote that she will resign effective Monday and was deeply troubled by the entirely avoidable events at the Capitol building\n\nI am tremendously proud of the many accomplishments we were able to achieve together for our country and I will never forget the commitment you have for this Department and the United States of America, her statement continued.\n\nShe added that will help the Transportation Secretary designate, Pete Buttigieg, in taking on the department.\n\nIt has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the U.S. Department of Transportation, she tweeted Thursday.\n\nDeVos submitted a letter of resignation to Trump on Thursday, calling Wednesday's events unconscionable for our country.\n\nThere is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me, she wrote. Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us. I believe we each have a moral obligation to exercise good judgement and model the behavior we hope they would emulate. They must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday.\n\nDr. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, also resigned Thursday, writing in her resignation letter that she had planned to stay on until the next administration but her plans abruptly changed Wednesday evening when she saw the violent takeover of the Capitol building.\n\nI believe that this behavior was totally unacceptable and, in my own heart, I simply am not able to continue, she wrote.\n\nBecause I believe that the mental health of our people has suffered so greatly under the stresses of COVID-19, the social justice issues that have been so painful for so many, and now with the rending of our nation over questions raised about the presidential election, I cannot support language that results in incitement of violence and risks our very existence, she added.\n\nAdditionally, Anthony Ruggiero, senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense at the National Security Council, resigned on Thursday in protest of the President's incitement of protests of supporters at the Capitol, according to a person familiar. Ruggiero leads the council's North Korea policy and is a key East Asia expert.\n\nStephanie Grisham, Betsy DeVos, Elaine Chao, Elinore McCance-Katz, Sarah Matthews, Ryan Tully, Mick Mulvaney, John Costello, Matt Pottinger, Tyler Goodspeed, Rob Greenway, Anna Christina Niceta\n\nThursday's outgoing cohort followed a similar tranche of administration resignations the previous day. Trump's deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger resigned Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStephanie Grisham -- the former White House communications director and press secretary and current chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump -- and White House social secretary Anna Cristina Rickie Niceta both resigned Wednesday effective immediately, White House officials told CNN. The two were among the longest-serving Trump administration officials.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol has also triggered departures outside the administration. The chief of the Capitol Police is resigning effective January 16. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, was submitting his resignation, while Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger submitted his own resignation late Thursday, according to a statement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nChao decided to resign after taking time to absorb the insurrection on Capitol Hill and the President's response to it, a senior administration official said. The official said Chao's decision to resign on Monday -- not immediately -- was done in order to give her staff time for an orderly departure and transition.\n\nChao discussed the matter with her staff and her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, before deciding around 11 a.m. that she would resign.\n\nToday, there was a lot of soul-searching and discussion, a senior official said. It was obviously the right thing to do.\n\nBefore releasing her statement, Chao called White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to inform him of her decision, the senior official said. She has not as of yet submitted a letter of resignation to the President.\n\nChao encouraged senior officials at the Transportation Department to stay on until January 20 to ensure a smooth transition. Several of her senior staff were considering resigning as well, but were talked out of it by Chao, this official said.\n\nThe department's general counsel Steven Bradbury is next in the line of succession because there is currently no deputy secretary. He would become acting Transportation secretary unless the President names another individual to the post.\n\nA veteran of Republican administrations, Chao came into her post with a focus on reviving the nation's crumbling infrastructure.\n\nBut an overhaul package to rebuild roads, bridges and highways never came, stalled by other legislative priorities including tax cuts and health care. The administration did unveil a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan earlier in Trump's administration, but the framework has faced obstacles in Congress.\n\nA succession of White House-sponsored Infrastructure Weeks did little to advance the cause. The term has become a punch line for the administration's ability to step on its own message with unforced errors or a President prone to inflammatory tweets or remarks.\n\nChao had until now remained a dutiful foot soldier for the President, appearing at White House events and traveling the country to view administration-sponsored projects.\n\nUnlike much of the administration, Chao came to her post with years of government experience. She served in both Bush administrations, acting as labor secretary for all eight years of President George W. Bush's tenure.\n\nTrump has eyed some Bush veterans skeptically, though isn't known to have singled out Chao specifically.\n\nInstead, it is her husband that has sometimes proved the awkward component in her relationship with Trump. The President has openly sparred with the Republican leader in the Senate over legislative priorities.\n\nChao had previously navigated the spats deftly. Standing alongside Trump in August 2017 in the midst of a dispute between the President and McConnell over health care, she was asked what she thought of the rift.\n\nI stand by my man, Chao said, both of them.\n\nThis story has been updated.

And the longest government shutdown ever.\n\nAround nearly every corner, crucial question marks are looming over the business world right now.\n\nWill the US economy grow at 3% in 2019 or succumb to a recession? Will the United Kingdom be in or out of the European Union? Will the Fed raise rates twice or not at all?\n\nTaken together, these forces appear to be driving up uncertainty to elevated levels. That backdrop makes it tricky for businesses, households and investors to plan for the future.\n\nThe risk is that poor visibility causes companies to rein in spending, further delaying the investment boom that the US tax overhaul was supposed to spark.\n\nWe are in an uncertain environment on the policy front and the economic front — and that spills over into the corporate front, said Erin Browne, a managing director and portfolio manager at PIMCO.\n\nIn some ways, a murky outlook is common as economic expansions age and the next recession begins to take shape on the horizon.\n\nAs you move towards late cycle, the level of uncertainty increases. And the level of volatility around economic outcomes also increases, Browne said.\n\nOne measure of this volatility, the global economic policy uncertainty index, shot to a record high in December. The index, which goes back to January 1997, measures how often newspaper articles in 20 countries contain terms related to the economy, policy and uncertainty.\n\nThere's no shortage of questions swirling around board rooms right now. Consider the headlines from just the past few days.\n\nTrade war lingers, Brexit mess deepens\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, remain mired in a trade war. Fragile talks on reaching a trade deal have yet to produce a breakthrough.\n\nIn the meantime, economists say the tariff spat is exacerbating the sharp slowdown in China. And it's at least partially to blame for the sudden deceleration of America's manufacturing industry and an outright contraction in China's.\n\nApple (AAPL), the world's largest public company, recently said trade tensions helped lead to soft iPhone sales.\n\nIn Europe, the British parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, raising the risk that her government collapses. The vote also deepens questions over whether the UK will crash out of the EU or decide to remain or further delay a decision. A messy divorce could spark market turmoil and fuel a recession in the UK, the world's fifth-biggest economy.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's economy contracted in the third quarter and 2018 growth was the weakest in five years.\n\nThe rest of the world is clearly tugging the US downward, said Browne.\n\nVolatility in Washington, energy\n\nIn Washington, the shutdown of the federal government stretched into its 26th day on Wednesday. Each day is causing more damage to the economy — and more pain for the 800,000 federal workers going without pay.\n\nCorporate America is beginning to feel the pain as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL) estimates that fewer bookings caused by the government shutdown will cost the company about $25 million in January.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Washington on Tuesday that if the shutdown lasts for the entire quarter, it could reduce economic growth to zero.\n\nMeanwhile, the oil patch is living up to its well-worn reputation for volatility. US oil prices crashed into a bear market last fall, plunging as much as 44%. Crude has since spiked 22% in just three weeks on signs that OPEC is dialing back production.\n\nThe gyrations in the energy market won't make the budget process any easier for airlines, trucking and other businesses that rely on crude.\n\nThe oil turbulence also helped lead to the shutdown of the junk bond market in December, the first month without a US high-yield bond offering in a decade.\n\n'Wild' market swings\n\nWall Street is still mending its wounds from the worst December stock market performance since the Great Depression. Extreme volatility led to sharp trading revenue declines at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup (C).\n\nEven though US stocks have rebounded, there's always a risk that prolonged market mayhem dents consumer and business sentiment enough to impact the real economy.\n\nWe saw wild risk-off swings, John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, told reporters on Tuesday. That could have a knock-on effect to invest confidence, and maybe consumer and business confidence.\n\nFed policy remains another major mystery. Just a few months ago, Wall Street was prepared for the US central bank to raise interest rates another four times. But market stress and slowing global growth caused the Fed to hint that it may be done with rate hikes, at least for now.\n\nEven Esther George, a hawkish Fed official, said in a speech on Tuesday that it might be a good time to pause rate hikes. And George acknowledged it's unclear whether, or how much, the Fed's shrinking balance sheet is causing borrowing conditions to tighten.\n\nRecession or slowdown?\n\nEconomists and investors continue to clash over whether the American economy is headed toward a recession, or just a sharp slowdown like the one experienced in 2016.\n\nNearly half of the US CFOs surveyed by Duke University expect a 2019 recession. And 82% believe that a recession will strike by the end of 2020.\n\nBut fund managers' point of view is quite different. Just 14% of them expect a global economic recession this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey published on Tuesday.\n\nTheir diagnosis is secular stagnation, not a recession, Michael Hartnett, Bank of America's chief investment strategist, wrote in the Tuesday report.\n\nStill, the risk is that extreme uncertainty becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, speeding the arrival of the next downturn by causing business and consumer spending to dry up.\n\nIt's inevitable we will get a recession in the next few years. The question is timing, said Browne. This could pull forward the onset of the next recession.
India just got a ringing endorsement from the world's most famous investor.\n\nI think the potential for India is incredible, Warren Buffett said in an interview with Indian news channel ET Now on Monday, describing the South Asian nation as a huge, enormous market.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway chairman, also known as the Oracle of Omaha, said he'd immediately hop on a plane to India if the right investment opportunity came up.\n\nIf you tell me a wonderful company in India that might be available for sale, I'll be there tomorrow, he said.\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett says he dumped a third of his IBM stock\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to smooth the way for foreign investors such as Buffett, but there are still many hurdles standing in their way.\n\nCompanies such as Walmart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL), which both feature in Buffett's huge portfolio, have thus far failed to open their own stores in the country.\n\nBerkshire set up operations in India when Buffett visited in 2011, selling insurance online in a partnership with Indian firm Bajaj Allianz. But Buffett's firm reportedly exited that partnership two years later, citing excessive regulation.\n\nRelated: Why Walmart is interested in India's biggest online retailer\n\nBuffett mentioned those hurdles again on Monday, particularly one that prevents foreign firms from fully owning companies in India.\n\nSometimes there have been restrictive laws in terms of the percentage we can own, and that's a disadvantage, he said. We would like to own 100% of any business that we run.\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett laments missing out on Google\n\nModi has tried to make it easier to do business, but many of his big reforms -- such as a uniform national tax system that is yet to be implemented -- have fallen short of expectations.\n\nAnother famous investor, Jim Rogers, sold all his Indian shares in 2015 after getting tired of waiting for change.\n\nYou can't just invest on hope, he said in an interview with Indian newspaper Livemint at the time.\n\nBuffett says the country's huge population and rapidly growing middle class is too big to ignore.\n\nIt's a lot of people with a lot of buying power, he said. You can't have a billion people and not be important to this world.
That was exactly as wild as it seemed.\n\nThe VIX volatility index, which tracks short-term market turbulence, jumped 116% on Monday -- the highest daily percentage recorded. The index has data going back to 1990.\n\nIt's the biggest move since February 2007, when the index rose 64%.\n\nThat shows how much fear has jumped back into the market in a very short period of time, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\nMonday was the worst day for markets in recent memory.\n\nThe Dow plunged almost 1,600 points before recovering slightly. It closed down 1,175 points, the worst single-day point decline in Dow history. Its 4.6% fall was the biggest percentage decline since August 2011, during the European debt crisis.\n\nRelated: CNNMoney Fear & Greed index is in Extreme Fear\n\nThe VIX reflected that turmoil.\n\nThe index, which hit 37.32, is now the highest it's been since August 24, 2015, the last time the Dow plunged 1,000 points in a day.\n\nA big reason for the sudden surge in volatility is that stocks have been calm for months, which has kept the VIX tamped down.\n\nThe index touched an all-time intraday low of 8.56 on November 24, 2017, and was as low as 8.56 again on January 4. That relative tranquility made Monday's leap feel particularly severe.\n\nIf investors had been expecting that to change, the VIX would have been moving higher before Monday.\n\nIf anything, we should have been surprised by how low volatility was to begin with, said Andres Garcia-Amaya, CEO of wealth management firm Zoe Financial.\n\nAfter months of calm for stocks, investors could now experience some rockiness in the coming weeks.\n\nRelated: Stocks plunged. That doesn't mean the economy is in trouble\n\nOne group of investors likely to be hit hard are those who have been betting against volatility.\n\nMarket watchers are pointing to an exchange-traded security called the XIV, which is structured to go up when the VIX falls.\n\nThe XIV is down more than 82% after hours. That means investors who thought the market would continue its bull run without a sell-off could get hit.\n\nBut most people shouldn't panic, analysts say.\n\nThe market's economic underpinnings remain strong. Corporate earnings are still expected to be bolstered by tax reform, and job creation remains steady.\n\nIf you're a day trader, this is a huge deal. If you're an investor in the long term, this becomes a blip, Garcia-Amaya said.
Millions of Americans may have to wait a little longer to receive their stimulus payments from the federal government due to a glitch in distribution that is expected to be fixed soon.\n\nThe payments -- worth up to $600 per taxpayer and $600 for each of their dependents -- were part of the latest Covid relief package signed into law at the end of December.\n\nThe IRS began issuing direct deposits of those payments on December 29 and says up to 100 million have already been completed.\n\nBut, according to Intuit TurboTax spokesperson Ashley McMahon, millions of payments were sent to the wrong accounts, and some may not have received their stimulus payment.\n\nRoughly 13 million people may have been affected, according to one banking industry source.\n\nRead More

Washington (CNN) A second round of stimulus payments are on the way and many eligible families are expected to receive the money this month.\n\nThe first payments started going out on December 29 and will continue to be sent through January 15 . But anyone eligible who isn't automatically sent the money by then will have to claim it on their 2020 tax return, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nCongress included the $600 payments in a sweeping pandemic aid bill passed just before Christmas. President Donald Trump stalled the bill, calling for $2,000 payments though he had largely left negotiations up to lawmakers and his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, then ultimately signed it into law after a week-long delay.\n\nThe money comes nearly eight months after the first round of stimulus payments, worth up to $1,200 per person, were sent as part of a larger coronavirus relief package passed last March. Many of the same people will receive the money again, but there are some small eligibility differences.\n\nWhen and how will the money be sent?\n\nRecipients may have seen a direct deposit pending in their bank account as early as December 29, but the funds became officially available January 4.\n\nPaper checks or debit cards will be sent to those who don't already have a bank account on file with the Internal Revenue Service. Checks also began going out last week.\n\nSome people may not receive the money the same way as in the first round. If you received a preloaded debit card last year, the payment will not be added to that card. You'll either receive a new card in the mail or a paper check.\n\nThe law requires the Internal Revenue Service to stop issuing the payments after January 15. Those not issued a payment by then will have wait to claim it on their 2020 tax return. The money will either increase your refund or reduce the taxes you owe. If the payment was sent to an old bank account, you will also have to wait to file your taxes in order to receive the money\n\nPeople can check the status of both their first and second payments by using the Internal Revenue Service's Get My Payment online tool\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nEligibility is largely based on income. Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. Heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. They will receive $600 per child under the age of 17, which is $100 more than in the first round.\n\nThe payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. Some people who received the first payment may be phased out of the second round because the payments are smaller.\n\nThey will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. But in a change from the first round, their spouses and children are now eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers.\n\nThose who are claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, like some college students, remain ineligible.\n\nLost your job? You may be able to claim more money\n\nBoth the first and second round payments are based on 2019 adjust gross incomes. That means that someone who saw their income drastically fall in 2020 may be eligible for more money than they first received.\n\nIf that's the case, they may claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax return. The credit eligibility and the credit amount will be based on the 2020 tax year income, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThose who may have earned more in 2020 than 2019 are not required to pay back money they have already received.
Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Saturday announced new travel restrictions after confirmation of the first coronavirus death in the US, with President Donald Trump signaling a more robust response as US cases rise.\n\nTrump said additional cases in America were likely but cautioned the public not to panic.\n\nAdditional cases in the US are likely, Trump said, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover.\n\nThe President, joined by members of his administration's coronavirus task force as he made comments from the White House briefing room, aimed to calm Americans.\n\nWe respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite the panic, because there's no reason to panic at all, Trump said.\n\nThe President also offered his condolences to the first coronavirus death in America.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington, confirmed Saturday that the individual who died was male. Trump earlier described the patient, who died in Washington state, as a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s and a wonderful woman.\n\nA senior administration official blamed the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the mix up.\n\nDr. (Robert) Redfield briefed Pence and Trump after speaking with Washington State health officials that it was a woman. Washington State has since corrected, the official said.\n\nRedfield tweeted later Saturday that the CDC erroneously identified the patient as a female in a briefing earlier (Saturday) with the President and Vice President.\n\nThe Washington patient appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Redfield, who spoke alongside the President at Saturday's briefing.\n\nTravel and coronavirus\n\nPence said at the briefing that the US would be expanding travel restrictions from Iran to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days. He also said the US would heighten a travel advisory for specific regions of Italy and South Korea.\n\nWe are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy and the areas in South Korea that are most affected by the coronavirus, Pence said.\n\nPence also emphasized that the average American does not need to go out and buy a mask, and that at least 35 million more masks per month are expected to be produced for the United States.\n\nMore courses of action to increase the availability of masks to high-risk health care workers will be announced later Saturday, Pence said.\n\nTrump also said he'll be meeting with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss developing a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe President's update followed a briefing from his coronavirus task force earlier in the day, which Trump said lasted for more than two and a half hours.\n\nThe President said there are now 22 cases of the novel coronavirus in the US. This number does not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those cases have been counted separately by the CDC.\n\nThere are four instances of possible community spread transmission of coronavirus -- two in California, one in Oregon and one in Washington.\n\nThe markets will all come back, Trump said. We have one problem -- we have to get this problem brought into focus.\n\nIt's certainly not a good situation. When you lose travel that's a big part of market. But for a period of time we're going to have to do what's necessary. Safety, health -- number one. The markets will take care of themselves, he continued.\n\nThe President suggested the Federal Reserve should take measures to assist with the economic dip that has resulted from the coronavirus outbreak. He also brought up his long-anticipated middle-income tax cuts.\n\nThe President has previously appeared to downplay the effects of coronavirus, saying earlier this week that he did not think community spread of the infections disease in the country was inevitable, despite that fact that CDC officials have been assessing that they expect to see community spread within the country.\n\nTrump has rarely delivered remarks to the press from the White House briefing room, but his Saturday appearance marks his second time in the room in less than a week.\n\nThe President said at a rally in South Carolina Friday that Democrats are now politicizing the virus. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, Trump said. They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.\n\nThis is their new hoax, Trump added.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said he doesn't think coronavirus itself is a hoax, but the criticism is. Asked if he regretted calling it a hoax during Friday's rally, Trump said he didn't.\n\nHoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, the President explained. I'm not talking about what's happening here, I'm talking about what they're doing.\n\nTrump called it the continuation of the hoax, and mentioned the Russia investigation and his impeachment.\n\nI don't like it when they are criticizing these people, and I don't like it, he said. That's the hoax I'm talking about.\n\nWorldwide, the virus has killed at least 2,922 -- including 2,835 people in China -- and there have been 85,055 confirmed cases.\n\nA senior administration official told CNN on Friday that Trump's mid-March meeting with leaders of southeast Asian countries in Las Vegas had been postponed.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that the individual who died in the first reported coronavirus death in the US was male.

We've just been spoiled.\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nThe junk bond market, one of the biggest beneficiaries of easy money, has screeched to a halt.\n\nNo US high yield bonds were offered between November 30 and January 10, according to Dealogic. December marked the first month since the 2008 crisis without any junk bonds being issued, the research firm said.\n\nThe reversal of fortunes underscores how quickly sentiment can change in financial markets, especially in the riskiest pockets of Wall Street.\n\nDeep fears about the end of the economic cycle similarly led to an exodus out of momentum stocks and the oil patch. Both the Nasdaq and crude oil tumbled into bear markets.\n\nThe stock market and oil really drive the junk bond market. They were a double-barreled depressant in December, said Mark Howard, senior multi asset specialist at BNP Paribas.\n\nThe energy sector accounts for about 15% of the US high-yield market, making the junk bond market particularly sensitive to sharp swings in oil prices. The 2014-2016 oil crash sparked dozens of oil bankruptcies.\n\nThe silence of the junk bond market marks a sharp slowdown from last December, when 36 companies tapped the junk bond market to raise nearly $18 billion, according to Dealogic.\n\nThe good news is that financial markets and oil prices have been on the upswing since Christmas Eve. People are less worried, for now at least, about a recession and the US-China trade war. That could allow for a reopening of the junk bond market.\n\n'Starting to crack open'\n\nA subsidiary of Targa Resources (TRGP), an oil and natural gas pipeline company, successfully priced a high-yield offering on Thursday. In another positive sign, Targa was able to raise $1.5 billion, twice as much as the Houston-based company originally sought. Sanjay Lad, director of investor relations at Targa, told CNN Business the deal was upsized because of very strong investor demand.\n\nIt marks the first US junk bond issuance since late November.\n\nIt's starting to crack open, said Howard.\n\nThis year, US high yield bond funds posted their best start in a decade, according to UBS.\n\nStill, the boom-to-bust in junk bonds serves as another reminder of the role of easy money on financial markets.\n\nUnbelievably low interest rates from global central banks forced investors to scour for returns elsewhere. Vast sums of money were poured into high-yield debt, allowing even some companies with shoddy balance sheets to borrow at reasonable rates.\n\nBut that easy money has begun to slowly fade away, with the Federal Reserve simultaneously raising interest rates and trimming its towering balance sheet.\n\nAt the same time, Wall Street is on high alert for signs of a recession. A downturn would cause trouble for some companies that reside in the junk bond market.\n\nNot surprisingly, investors backed away from that risky market late last year. Money has flown out of high-yield bond funds in 12 of the past 13 weeks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThere is concern that the earnings cycle has peaked. The trade war is not a great help, said Mike Ning, chief investment officer at PhaseCapital, a boutique investment manager.\n\nProlonged shutdown could spark trouble\n\nNervous investors have similarly retreated from another risky corner of the debt market: leveraged loans. These distressed loans had been a favorite investment for years but concerns about higher borrowing costs and slowing growth have changed the risk-reward calculus.\n\nPrivate-equity giant KKR (KKR) on Wednesday revealed that it has slashed its overweight exposure to leveraged loans to zero.\n\nGiven the disclocations of late, we want a little more flexibility, Henry McVey, KKR's head of global macro & asset allocation, wrote in a report titled The Game Has Changed.\n\nThe fear is when the economic cycle ends, these highly leveraged companies will have trouble refinancing their debt. That could lead to a wave of bankruptcies.\n\nThe market was sharply constrained in the fourth quarter. If we saw a prolonged period, you would have companies that would start to have challenges, said Howard.\n\nRecord-high corporate debt\n\nConsider that US nonfinancial companies rated by Moody's were sitting on $5.7 trillion of debt as of the end of June 2018.\n\nThe ratio of nonfinancial corporate debt to GDP has never been higher going back to records that began in 1947, according to the Office of Financial Research, a Treasury Department bureau created after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEven if a recession strikes soon, most companies aren't facing imminent deadlines to pay back debt.\n\nMany CFOs took advantage of easy money to lock in low rates for extended periods. And record-high corporate profits, boosted by the corporate tax rate, have given companies lots of ammo to repay debt.\n\nMost companies have low refinancing risk in 2019, according to a Moody's Investors Service report published on Thursday.\n\nWhen the markets get bumpy, high-yield borrowers can sit on their hands and wait, Howard said.\n\nThat's good because December showed they could be waiting a while.
Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nElizabeth Warren is looking at a potentially weak finish in her neighbor state of New Hampshire tonight following on a disappointing third place finish in Iowa, and her campaign manager is out with a new memo that hits at what the Warren campaign sees as the fundamental weaknesses of her rivals.\n\nIt's notable that the memo, penned by Roger Lau and just sent out to Warren supporters, draws stark contrasts between Warren and her rivals even as the senator herself remains reticent to directly go after her competitors.\n\nSome of the key critiques that Lau outlines about their top rivals include saying that Bernie Sanders has a ceiling; pointing out that Joe Biden's support among even older and black voters is eroding; questioning Pete Buttigieg's ability to appeal to diverse voters; and saying Amy Klobuchar is untested and doesn't have a long-term infrastructure in place.\n\nHere are some key lines:\n\nSenator Sanders starts with a ceiling that's significantly lower than the support he had four years ago.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden entered this race as the clear frontrunner, reaching over 40% in national polling last spring. He's now polling under 30% even among older voters and African-American voters, who have been his strongest supporters, and his support among younger voters has fallen to just 6%.\n\nFormer Mayor Buttigieg's most significant challenge is yet to come, as the contest moves into states with more diverse electorates, and he still hasn't answered tough questions about his record in South Bend.\n\nSenator Klobuchar is getting a well-deserved look from voters for the first time, but hasn't been able to build out infrastructure for the long haul, and is playing catch up on a very short timeline.\n\nAs the campaign has been doing for a while, this is clearly another effort to set expectations for a long haul fight that extends through at least Super Tuesday for the Warren campaign.
Win the lottery? Welcome to the 1%. Now here comes the taxman.\n\nThe odds of winning the record $1.5 billion jackpot in Saturday night's drawing are 1 in 292 million. Anyone who beats those odds has tremendous luck, and a colossal tax bill, to look forward to.\n\nPrize money = taxable income: Lottery winnings are taxed like income, and the IRS taxes the top income bracket 39.6%. The government will withhold 25% of that before the money ever gets to the winner. The rest has to be paid at tax time.\n\nThen there are local taxes. Of the 44 U.S. states that participate in Powerball, all but a handful will take an additional cut of the money, according to lottery statistics site USA Mega.\n\nNew Jersey's rate is among the lowest at 3%, while New York's is the highest at 8.82%.\n\nA New York City resident would probably have the highest lottery tax rate anywhere in the nation, since the city also has a municipal tax -- an additional 3.9%.\n\nRelated: Powerball jackpot hits $900 million\n\nPayout options: Exactly how much a winner owes in taxes will depend on how they opt to have the prize money distributed.\n\nLottery winners can choose to take a one-time cash payout, or to receive annual payments for the next 30 years.\n\nIf the winner opts for the lump sum, Powerball will award the jackpot's cash value, which is about $930 million. That means the recipient would pay the income tax on that amount up front.\n\nYou're even less likely to win Powerball than you think\n\nSo if a resident of New York City wins and takes the lump sum, he or she will only get about $577 million. The government will withhold about $353 million, nearly 40%.\n\nPowerball winners also have the option of collecting their prize money in annual payments, or an annuity.\n\nIn that scenario, the jackpot winner will get a small slice of the $930 million up front. Powerball invests the rest and uses the interest to pay out bigger and bigger installments over the next 30 years. Eventually the total could add up to $1.5 billion...before taxes.\n\nThe same federal and state taxes still apply, but they're paid as each installment is distributed.\n\nRelated: 114 lottery millionaires are missing\n\nWhile the first chunk of prize money will be charged the current rate, future tax bills may go up or down (probably up) depending on how lawmakers change the tax code.\n\nThe bottom line: To maximize the overall value of your winnings, most financial experts advise taking the lump sum.\n\nEven after taxes, that option can net you more than $1.5 billion over 30 years if you invest it -- even in something ultra-conservative like municipal bonds (which are tax free).\n\nBut an overly aggressive [investment] portfolio or careless and outlandish spending can leave you penniless, Wells Fargo Advisors vice president of investments Scott Kaminsky said.
For decades, millions of Indians emigrated to the Middle East to make money. Now many of them are investing their profits back home, encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's overhaul of the economy.\n\nSeveral prominent businessmen in the United Arab Emirates -- home to the world's largest Indian diaspora -- have committed billions to India in the past three years. Modi's business-friendly policies are encouraging others.\n\nWe've always been hesitant to invest in India just because the bureaucracy was too much and corruption was too much, said Binay Shetty, CEO of BRS Ventures. But when the new government came in, they started changing this and we took a view that we wanted to expand, he told CNNMoney.\n\nRelated: Millions more companies are now paying tax in India\n\nShetty's father left India in 1973 for the UAE, where he first worked as a medical supplies salesman. Two years later, he launched a clinic and distribution company in Abu Dhabi, eventually building a network of hospitals across the UAE. The company, NMC Health (NMHLY), listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2012 and is now worth $8.5 billion.\n\nBRS Ventures wants to replicate that success in India. It acquired several hospitals over the past few years with 1,000 beds in total. Shetty's aim is to add at least another 4,000 beds over the next five years.\n\nThe target is to become one of the largest hospital groups in India, he said. The company is also looking towards India for other sectors it operates in, including pharmaceuticals, education and financial services. It plans to invest $300 million over the next two years.\n\nModicare: India plans free healthcare for 500 million\n\nPrime Minister Modi is guest of honor at the World Government Summit in Dubai, starting Sunday. Since taking office in 2014, he has pledged to boost India's growth and slash the country's notorious red tape.\n\nHe's had mixed results with the former, but recent moves to relax retail restrictions and overhaul the tax system have cheered foreign investors.\n\nIndia jumped 30 spots in the World Bank's ease of doing business ranking released last November. Some analysts have questioned the reliability of the ranking, but Modi and his government have touted it as a ringing endorsement of their policies.\n\nSudesh Aggarwal, a Dubai-based Indian businessman who sits on the board of the UAE Business Leaders Forum, said the World Bank's seal of approval has boosted investor sentiment.\n\nThe forum says 100 expat Indians have pooled $1 billion to invest in India.\n\nThey are open to investing in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, education, solar power and infrastructure, Aggarwal told CNNMoney, adding that the group is looking to join hands with state governments to work on specific projects.\n\nThe question is what the state governments want for their states, we work according to that, he said.\n\nSeveral other companies started by Indians based in the UAE are also expanding their footprint back home.\n\nThe Lulu Group, best known for its chain of supermarkets, already operates malls, convention centers and hotels across southern India and has several new projects in the pipeline. KEF Holdings, a construction firm that specializes in prefabricated buildings, has invested in four Indian projects worth around $180 million since 2016.\n\nAster, a Dubai-based healthcare firm, is reportedly planning an IPO on the Bombay Stock Exchange next week.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that several major UAE-based Indians are now making major investments into India, said Navdeep Singh Suri, India's ambassador to the UAE.\n\nBusiness is driven only partly by patriotism, it is principally driven by returns and by ease of doing business, Suri told CNNMoney. Along with the growth of the Indian economy, [investors] also see that it is becoming easier.\n\nRelated: Modi tells Davos globalization is under attack\n\nThe affection is mutual, and with good reason. More than 3 million Indians live in the UAE, according to the United Nations. (Only Mexicans in the United States constitute a larger immigrant population between two countries.)\n\nThe UAE accounts for the largest proportion of remittances sent to India, estimated at almost $13 billion in 2016.\n\nModi's visit in 2015 was the first by an Indian prime minister to visit the Gulf state in 34 years. The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan, has visited India twice since then.\n\nState money is flowing east, too. The UAE government has committed $75 billion towards developing Indian infrastructure, with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Dubai port operator DP World inking deals worth $1 billion and $3 billion respectively in recent months.\n\nAnd Emirates Airline just announced an agreement with Indian state Andhra Pradesh to help develop its aviation sector.\n\nThere's probably a lot more deals to come.\n\nWe've really [only] scratched the surface, said Suri. This is a very capital rich country, and as returns weaken in Western markets, India -- with its combination of growth, scale and stability -- is a very attractive opportunity.

Aired 1-2p ET\n\nAired November 19, 2019 - 13:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[13:00:00] JORDAN: -- Mr. Eisenberg had told me to take my concerns to him.\n\n\n\nThen I ask you did -- did Mr. Eisenberg tell you not to report, to go around Mr. Morrison. And you said actually he did say that I shouldn't talk to any other people. Is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, but there's a whole -- there's a period of time in there between when I spoke to him and when he circled back around. It wasn't that long a period of time but it was enough time for me to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Enough time for you to go talk to someone that you won't tell us who it is right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I've -- I've -- I've been instructed not to, Representative Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, here's what I'm getting. The lawyer told you don't talk to any other people and you interpret that as not talking to your boss but you talk to your brother, you talk to the lawyers, you talk to Secretary (inaudible), you talk to the one guy Adam Schiff won't tell you -- won't let us -- won't let you tell us who he is. Is that right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative Jordan, I did my job.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm not saying you didn't. All I'm saying is you -- your -- the instructions from the lawyer was you shouldn't talk to anybody and you interpret that as don't talk to my boss but I'm going to go talk to someone that we can't even ask you who that individual is.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is incorrect.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, I just read what you said. I shouldn't talk to any other people.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- I'm sorry, Chairman, but that sequence is not the way it played out.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm reading through (ph) the transcript Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Jordan, please let Colonel Vindman ...\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- the sequence played out where immediately afterwards I expressed my concerns. I did my coordination function, Mr. Eisenberg circled back around, told me not to talk to anybody else. In that period of time I did not manage to talk to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: So that's when it happened. That's when you talked to someone.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Heck, you are recognized. Mr. Heck.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That's right.\n\n\n\nHECK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Colonel Vindman, let's go back to that pair of meetings on July 10 in Ambassador Bolton's office and down in the war (ph) room where you witness Ambassador Sondland inform the Ukrainian officials that as a prerequisite to a White House meeting between the two presidents, quote, the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens, end quote.\n\n\n\nYou said that Ambassador Sondland was quote, calling for an investigation that didn't exist into the Bidens in Burisma, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nHECK: It's that same afternoon you went to Mr. Eisenberg, the council, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That meeting occurred in the afternoon and within, you know, a couple -- I'm sure it was within a couple hours I spoke to Mr. Eisenberg.\n\n\n\nHECK: How did he react?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He was cool, calm, and collected. He took notes and he said he would look into it.\n\n\n\nHECK: And did he not also tell you to feel free to come back if you had additional concerns.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did. He did, Congressman.\n\n\n\nHECK: Ambassador Sondland had told you that his request the Ukrainians had been coordinated with the chief of staff -- acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Did you report that to Mr. Eisenberg?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: And what was his reaction?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He -- he took notes and he said he was going to -- he'll follow up or look into it. I don't recall exactly what he said.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, you've also testified that on the July 25 call now between the two presidents, quote, there was no doubt, end quote, that President Trump asked for investigations into the 2016 election and Vice President Biden's son in return for a White House meeting. Within an hour of that call you reported back to Mr. Eisenberg, did you not?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: Went back to him just to see (inaudible) suggestion would be appropriate.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He's an assistant the president. He -- it was less a suggestion and more than -- more of an instruction.\n\n\n\nHECK: Did you tell the lawyers that President Trump asked President Zelensky to speak to Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: And the lawyers -- it was at this point, told you not to talk to anyone else.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is -- that's -- that is not correct with regards to timing. They didn't fall back -- they didn't circle back around. What ended up happening is in my coordination role I spoke to state (ph) -- I spoke to number (ph) of intelligence community and the general counsel from one of the intelligence bodies notified Mr. Eisenberg that there was -- you know that there was information on the call, on the July 25th call, as that point Mr. Eisenberg told me I shouldn't talk to anybody else about it.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, I want to go back to 2014 in Iraq. When you were blown up, I presume that given the point in your military career and what else was going on in the world that upon recovery there was the very real prospect or possibility that you might once again find yourself in harms way. Is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, Congressman, it happened in 2004, but yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: Four, excuse me, thank you. Did you consider leaving the military service at that point?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: No. Frankly, Congressman, I suffered light wounds I was fortunate compared to my counterparts in the same vehicle. And I returned to duty as, I think it may have been that same day.\n\n\n\n[13:05:00]\n\n\n\nHECK: But you could have been subjected to additional harm. You chose to continue service in uniform.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I continued to serve in combat for the remaining 10 or 11 months of the tour.\n\n\n\nHECK: You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredible painful irony that within a week of the President contrary to all advise of the Senior Military Officials he pardons those who were convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he is engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf including some here today to demean your record of service and the sacrifice and contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago the White House officially quoted out, out of context the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in (ph) your judgment.\n\n\n\nI can only conclude, sir, that what we though was just the President is the subject of our deliberations in this inquiry isn't sufficient to capture what's happening here. Indeed what subject to this inquiry and what is apparel is our constitution and the very values upon which it is based. I want to say thank you for your service. But you know thank you doesn't cut it. Please know, however, that it comes from the bottom of my heart and I know on the bottoms of the heart of countless other Americans, thank you for the service, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday the Speaker of United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States an impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an impostor. The guy, 63 million people for, the guy who won an Electoral College landslide, the Speaker calls an impostor. That's what happened to our country, to this Congress. The Speaker statement says it all. The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. Democrats don't trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit.\n\n\n\nThey don't trust that and they have tried to do everything they can to undo what the American people decided on November 8, 2016. They've been out to get the President since the day he was elected. The whistleblowers lawyer, the whistleblowers legal team said this January 30, 2017, the President had been in office about a week, coup has starter, first of many steps. Next sentence impeachment will follow ultimately. I guess we're in the final step. It started three and half years ago. Congressman Tlaib started this Congress. First day of Congress said impeach the President.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Greene said if we don't impeach him the President's going to win reelection. We got to do it. Mot importantly, most importantly five Democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened. The truth is the attacks actually started before the Inauguration even before the election. Ranking Member talked about this. Hi opening statement July 2016 FBI opens investigation so called Trump-Raja (ph) coordination collusion which was never there. Opened an investigation spied on two American citizens associated with the Presidential campaign. My guess is that's probably never happened in American History, but they did it.\n\n\n\nAnd for 10 months Jim Comey FBI investigated the President, guess what after 10 months they had nothing. And you know why we know that because when we disposed Mr. Comey last Congress he told us they didn't have a thing. No matter, Special Counsel Mueller gets appointed and they do a two year $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what they come back and they got nothing. But the Democrats don't care. So now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker and the basement of the Capital, witnesses who aren't allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. We get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no first hand knowledge biased against the President.\n\n\n\n[13:10:00]\n\n\n\nThese facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden , who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, awaited 18 days to file a complaint, 18 days to file a complaint. What did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talked with Chairman Schiff's staff. And then hired the legal team that I just talked about, one of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.\n\n\n\nThis is scary what these guys are putting our country through. It is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. And the good news is the American people see through it all, they know the facts are on the President's side as Representative Stefanik said, four facts will never change. We've got the transcript which they never thought the President would release. Shows no coordination, not conditionality, no linkage. We got the two guys on the call President Trump, President Zelensky, who have side nothing wrong no pressure no pushing here. We've got the fact that Ukrainians didn't even know aid was held up at the time of the call and most importantly we have yet to have one witness tell us that the any evidence from anyone that President Zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.\n\n\n\nThose facts will never change. The facts are on the President's side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand that. Those 63 million Americans they understand it and frankly I think a lot of other do as well. They see what this for what it is. And they know this is wrong, especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. I yield bank.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Welch.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Thank you. What this hearing is about, I think was best stated by Colonel Vindman's opening statement. The question before us is this, is it improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate the United States citizen and political opponent? It's very well stated.\n\n\n\nI just listened to Mr. Jordan, as you did as well, and I heard his criticisms in the process, nothing really happened, a lot of people are out to get the president. I didn't hear an answer to the question, as to whether it's proper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\n\n\n\nAnd to date, I haven't heard any one of my Republican colleagues address that question.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, thank you. I want to ask some questions that go through the background. What's come out during this process is that we had two Ukraine policies.\n\n\n\nOne was bipartisan and long-standing, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that's a fair characterization, Congressman.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way, a legacy of Putin's Russia, is your understanding that when their prior president, Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia into the arms of Mr. Putin, he took with him $30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Vast scale for a poor country. And is it your understanding that powerless, but motivated Ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft in theft and abuse by their president?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And that was in the Maidan -- it was called the Maidan Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And young people went into that square in downtown Kiev, and demonstrated for months, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct. And 100 died.\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six young people died, and older people died, correct? That is in -- in -- in -- between February 18, 2014 and February 22, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:15:00]\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six died, including people who were shot by snipers, kids, and Yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter, those young people. Is that your understanding?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That amounts to some of the key pillars. WELCH: That's right. And the Giuliani, Sondmand (ph), and it appears, Trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I'll take that question back, we know it.\n\n\n\nAnd you know, I'm going to say this to President Trump, you want to investigate Joe Biden, you want to investigate Hunter Biden, go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do do it. Just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That's your job, it's not his.\n\n\n\nMy goal in these hearings is two things, one is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman's question. And the second, coming out of this, is for us, as a Congress, to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support. It's not investigations, it's the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Maloney.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: thank you both for being here. You know, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, this may be one of your first Congressional hearings like this, so you may not --\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: And hopefully the last.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nMALONEY: I can't blame you for feeling that way, sir. Particularly when I've been sitting here listening to my Republican colleagues, one of the advantages of being down here at the kids table, is that you get to hear the folks above your ask their questions. And I've been listening closely to my Republican colleagues and I've heard them say just about everything except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you've both given.\n\n\n\nYou may have notices, there's been a lot of complaints and there's been a lot of insinuations and there's been a lot of suggestions maybe that -- that you're -- that you're service is somehow not -- not to be trusted.\n\n\n\nYou know, you were treated to questions about your loyalty because of some half-baked job offer, I guess, the Ukrainians made you, which you, of course, dutifully reported. I guess, Mr. Castor's implying you're -- you've got some dual loyalty, which is, of course, an old smear we've heard many times in our history, to try to demean you as though maybe you're -- you've overstated the your importance of your job.\n\n\n\nBut, of course, you were -- this -- the guy on the National Security Council responsible for directing Ukrainian policy. We've heard the air out some allocations, with no basis improve, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti, I guess, will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\n\n\n\nWe've even had a member of this Committee question -- this is my favorite, question why you would wear your dress uniform today. Even though that dress uniform includes a breastplate that has a Combat Infantry badge on it and a Purple Heart metal ribbon.\n\n\n\nSeems like if anybody gets to wear their uniform, it's somebody who's got breastplate with those accommodations on it. So, let's do it again, let's do the substance, can we do that? Because we've had a lot of -- a lot of dust kicked up.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams, you heard the call with your own ears, right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes sir.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not hear say, you heard the president speak. You heard his voice on the call?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you conclusion was what he said about investigating the Bidens was your words, unusual and inappropriate, I believe. Am I right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: That was my testimony.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And Mr. Vindman, you were treated to a July 10th meeting in the White House, where you heard Ambassador Sondland raise investigations, conditioning a White House meeting on that investigations, that you thought were unduly political, I believe that's how you described them. And you went to NSC Council and you reported, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And then later, you too, were on the White House call, am I right? You heard it with your own ears?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not from somebody else, not hear say, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You heard the president's voice on the call?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you heard him raise that subject again, that Ambassador Sondland had raised before, about investigating the Bidens, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I want to ask you, when you heard him say that, what was the first thought that went through your mind?\n\n\n\n[13:20:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Frankly, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out. And how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you went immediately and you reported it, didn't you?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Why?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Because that was my duty.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Do you still have your opening statement handy?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Read the last paragraph for me again, not the one -- the very last one, the second to last one. Would you read that one again for me? Because I think the American public deserves to hear it again.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The dad...\n\n\n\nMALONEY: That's the one.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think my dad would appreciate this one too.\n\n\n\nDad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You realize when you came forward out of sense of duty that you are putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world. Do you realize that, sir?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I knew I was assuming a lot of risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I'm struck by that word don't -- that phrase do not worry, you addressed your dad. Was your dad a warrior?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did serve. It was a different military though.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And he would have worried if you were putting yourself up against the president of the United States, is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He deeply worried about it because in his context there was -- it was the ultimate risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And why you have confidence that you can do that and tell your dad not to worry?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Thank you, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE) SCHIFF: Ms. Demings.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Ms. Williams, let me thank you for your service to our nation. It truly matters.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend. And what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation. So, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, today I say to you, there are no words that are sufficient to fully express our gratitude to you for what you have done for our nation and, amazingly, what you are still willing to do for our nation.\n\n\n\nIt is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trumps unethical demand that Ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the United States of America, national security. The president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.\n\n\n\nIn your test deposition, Colonel Vindman, you testified, and I quote, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our security interests. Could you please explain why a strong and independent Ukraine is so critical, and why it is so vital to U.S. interests?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: We sometimes refer to Ukraine as a front-line state. It's on the front-line of Europe. It's -- they have actually described to me, the Ukrainians, that that is -- it is a -- they consider themselves as a barrier between Russian aggression and Europe. And what I have heard them describe is the need for U.S. support in order to serve this role in order to protect European and Western security.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Lieutenant Colonel, this is not just a theoretical conflict between Ukraine and Russia. You have already said this morning that Russia is actively fighting to expand into Ukraine, that Ukraine is in a hot war with Russia right now, is that correct?\n\n\n\n[13:25:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: It's stable, but it's still a hot war.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And isn't it true, Lieutenant Colonel, that even if the security assistance was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed, just that fact, could signal to Russia that the bond between Ukraine and the U.S. was weakening?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That was the concern of myself and my colleagues.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And was the risk of even the appearance that the U.S.-Ukraine bond is shaky is that it could embolden Russia to act with more aggression, would you say that is correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe that was my testimony.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Just last month, during an interview, President Putin joked about interfering in our political elections. I can only guess that is what we have become to Russia and its president. I think he felt emboldened by the president's reckless actions, both attempts to hold critical military aid from Ukraine and President Trump's effort to blame Ukraine, not Russia, for election interference.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I can only say that every American, regardless of our politics, should be critically concerned about that. And let me just say this. Yes, we do trust the American people. But you know what, the American people trust us too as members of Congress to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And we intend to do just that.\n\n\n\nThank you again for your service.\n\n\n\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Krishnamoorthi.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Good afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams. Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I am concerned that your loyalty has been questioned not just because you are bringing forward evidence of wrongdoing against the president, president of United States, but because you are an immigrant. Recently FOX News host Brian Kilmeade said, he, meaning you, were born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young, he tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine. I find this statement reprehensible because it appears that your immigrant heritage is being used against you.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel, I came to this country when I was three months old. Your family fled the Soviet Union and moved to America when you are just three-and-a-half years old, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And I understand that your father worked multiple jobs while also learning English, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Your father stressed the importance of embracing what it means to be an American, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You and your family faced difficult times during your childhood, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. That's my story too. But your father went on to become an engineer, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He reestablished himself in his former profession in the United States.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. I -- I got a B.S. in engineering. Of course some people claim I practice the B.S. part now.\n\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\nYour father never gave up working hard to build his very own American dream, did he?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did not.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, your father achieved the American dream and so did you and your family. From one immigrant American to another immigrant American, I want to say to you that you and your family represent the very best of America. I assume that you are as proud to be an American as I am, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, I want to turn your attention to Yuriy Lutsenko. You called him a disruptive actor in your opening statement, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general in Ukraine has made various claims about various Americans, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You are unaware of any factual basis for his accusations against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: He also was a source for an article by John Solomon in The Hill, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you said that key elements of that article as well as his accusations are false. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Lutsenko is not a credible source, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:30:00]\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, the other side claims that there was absolutely no pressure on this July 25 phone call. I think that's what we heard earlier, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you have termed what President Trump asked in terms of investigations on that phone call as a demand. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you've pointed out the large power disparity between President Trump on the one hand and President Zelensky on the other. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: There was pressure on that phone call, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The -- the Ukranians needed the meeting. The Ukrainians subsequently when they found out about it needed the security assistance.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: So the pressure was brought to bear on them, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, Colonel Vindman, last week we heard a decorated military veteran namely Ambassador Bill Taylor come before us. You interacted regularly with Ambassador Taylor and you know him to be a man of integrity and he's a patriotic American. Isn't that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: A superb individual.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I asked Ambassador Taylor a series of questions based on his experience as an infantry commander. I asked him quote, is an officer allowed to hold up action placing his troops at risk until someone provides him a personal benefit? Ambassador Taylor responded, no sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor quote, is that because they would be betraying their responsibility to the nation? Ambassador Taylor responded, yes, sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor, quote, could that type of conduct trigger a court martial? Ambassador Taylor said yes sir. Do you agree with Ambassador Taylor Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: That concludes the member questioning. Representative Nunes, you're recognized for any concluding remarks. NUNES: Well Act 1 of today's circus is over. For those of you who have been watching at home, the democrats are no closer to impeachment then where they were three years ago. In the process they've -- the Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the I.C., the ICIG have all suffered long-term damage. The democrats can continue to put -- to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment which would be a very serious crime, high crime and misdemeanor as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.\n\n\n\nPolicy disagreements and the democrats failure to acknowledge their involvement in the 2016 election, I would say it's astonishing but that would be putting too little emphasis on their actions. With that I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: I thank the gentleman. I want to thank our witnesses today, Ms. Williams, Colonel Vindman, both of you for your service to the country, for your testimony here today and I just want to address briefly some of the evidence you presented as well as others thus far in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you Colonel Vindman for your military service and I should tell you that notwithstanding all of the questions you got on why didn't you go talk to your supervisor. Why didn't you go talk to Mr. Morrison? Why did you go to the national security lawyer as if there is something wrong with going to the national security lawyer.\n\n\n\nAre you aware that we asked Mr. Morrison whether he went to the national security lawyer right after the call and that he did.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I am.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: And are you aware also that we asked him, well if you have this problem with Colonel Vindman not going to you instead of the lawyer, naturally you must have got your supervisor in you know what his answer was? He didn't go to his supervisor, either. He went directly to the National Security Council lawyers. I hope my colleagues will give him the same hard time for not following his chain of command that he complained about with you apparently.\n\n\n\nThe president may attack you and has. Others on right-wing TV might attack you, and they have. But I thought you should know and maybe you know already that this is what the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to say about you Colonel Vindman. He is a professional, competent, patriotic and loyal officer. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the security of our nation in both peacetime and combat. I am sure your dad is proud to hear that.\n\n\n\n[13:35:00]\n\n\n\nMy colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we've heard it before that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That's our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction. The evidence points the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a U.S. political opponent.\n\n\n\nAmbassador Yovanovitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption so what does the president do? He recalls her from her post. Ambassador Yovanovitch, in fact, was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to Washington. You prepared talking points for the president's first conversation with Zelensky. He's supposed to talk about rooting out corruption. If this President had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, surely he would've brought it up in the call but of course we now know that he did not.\n\n\n\nWe then see Rudy Giuliani not fighting corruption but asking for an investigation of the Bidens and my colleagues say well maybe he was acting on his own. Even though he says he's acting as the President's lawyer, maybe he was really acting on his own but the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on July 10th at the White House, when Ambassador Sondland brings up the Bidens and Burisma of 2016, tells the Ukrainians who want that meeting at the White House, you've got to do these investigations.\n\n\n\nNow they would say Ambassador Sondland was acting on his own, but that doesn't quite work either because we have the call record from July 25th, which the President was forced to release, in which the President doesn't bring up corruption, he doesn't say how are those anti-corruption courts going or great work at the Rada. Of course not.\n\n\n\nWhat does the President say? I want you to invest the -- investigate the Bidens and this debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Vladimir Putin, that also helps me in my re-election. So much for fighting corruption.\n\n\n\nThe message to Ukraine -- the real message to Ukraine, our U.S. policy message is don't engage in political investigations. The message from the President, however, was the exact opposite -- do engage in political investigations and do it for my re-election.\n\n\n\nAnd it's also made clear they want the White House meeting and ultimately if they want $400 million in U.S. aid, this is what they have to do. The only lament I hear from my colleagues is it wasn't successful, they got caught, they didn't get the political investigations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven't gotten the White House meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the President wants to punish -- and because Congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the President was forced to lift the hold on the aid.\n\n\n\nThey argue well this makes it -- this makes it OK, that it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn't make it better, it's no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped. And we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense, as you put it, Colonel, of duty -- of duty. Not to the person of the President, but to the presidency and to the country, and we thank you for that.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last Friday, in a conversation he overheard with the President in a restaurant in Ukraine, in which the President, not Rudy Giuliani, not anyone else, the President of the United States wanted to know are they going to do the investigation? This is the day after that July 25th call -- are they going to do the investigations? And he's ensured by Ambassador Sondland they're going to do it.\n\n\n\nAnd what does Sondland relate to this foreign service officer after he hangs up that call? The President doesn't give a expletive about Ukraine, he only cares about the big things that help his personal interests. That's all you need to know.\n\n\n\nAnd it isn't just about Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine is fighting our fight against the Russians, against their expansionism. That's our fight, too -- that's our fight, too, at least we thought so on a bipartisan basis, that's our fight, too. That's why we support Ukraine with the military aid that we have.\n\n\n\n[13:40:00]\n\n\n\nWell the President may not care about it but we do. We care about our defense, we care about the defense of our allies and we darn well care about our Constitution. We are adjourned. I please ask the -- the audience to allow the witnesses and the members who have to go vote to leave first.\n\n\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: I'm Jake Tapper, live in Washington.\n\n\n\nToday's first round of the impeachment hearings for this week is in the books. We just heard from Jennifer Williams. She's a State Department aide to Vice President Mike Pence. We also heard from Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He is the National Security Council's top Ukraine advisor at the White House.\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Democrats have largely focus on the witnesses' impression of that phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25th, which both of them were listening to, while Republicans have attempted to discredit and undermine the witnesses, especially Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to an analysis, I want to play to what could be a key point of this entire investigation of this entire impeachment hearing.\n\n\n\nWhen you strip away the Democrats talking about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's patriotism, his service, his inspiring story as an immigrant to this country when he was a little boy, when you strip away Republicans trying to undermine him, questions about whether or not he followed the chain of command when it came to his concerns about the call, this is really what this hearing is about.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDANIEL GOLDMAN, COUNSEL FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS: So just to summarize in this July 25th call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that both of you ang acknowledge were for President Trump's political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much-desired White House meeting for President Zelensky.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts we just looked at in.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nGOLDMAN: Miss Williams?\n\n\n\nJENNIFER WILLIAMS, AIDE TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Yes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Jeffrey Toobin, your response?\n\n\n\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: When you strip away everything, what we have learned over the past month is one thing, which is for the first time in American history, an American president has used taxpayer dollars to persuade, bribe, extort another president for information that will help him get reelected.\n\n\n\nThat was the initial accusation. And that's what's been proven over and over again with all these witnesses.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Dana Bash?\n\n\n\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And what you haven't heard is any Republican on that day say anything other than that. No Republican has tried, even attempted to poke a hole in that fundamental question, why we are all here, why these hearings are taking place.\n\n\n\nWhat Republicans did instead is question the credibility of the witness, question the story, repeat conspiracy theories that have been debunked by the Intelligence Community.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: About whether or not Russia or Ukraine interfered in the election?\n\n\n\nBASH: Yes. And by the Trump Justice Department, which we can get to in a second. But just keeping it broad, the fact that Republicans didn't even try to go there on the substance of the allegation and what the picture of these witnesses, just like the ones last week, painted, is very, very telling. It goes to the notion of, OK, he did it. And a lot of these\n\n\n\nRepublicans have said in other forums, it wasn't the right thing to do but it's not impeachable and the process is bad.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: John King, during the hearing, President Trump didn't tweet at Lieutenant Colonel Vindman or Jennifer Williams as he has before about both of them.\n\n\n\nBut the White House official account did tweet something -- if we could put that tweet up. The White House official account, paid by your tax dollars, if you're an American watching right now, saying, Tim Morrison, Alex Vindman's former boss, said he had concerns about Vindman's judgement.\n\n\n\nNow that is factually accurate to Morrison, who is no longer on the National Security Council. Did say that he had concerns about whether or not Vindman had the right policy making chops for the job.\n\n\n\nBut it is remarkable to see taxpayer dollars being used to attack a current National Security Council official.\n\n\n\nJOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. First, you had the president do it. He's faced a lot of blowback from Republicans, saying please don't do that, please don't attack these witnesses, we're trying to do this on a different track. Now you have the taxpayer accounts, as you mentioned, doing it here.\n\n\n\nBut it's part of the Republican strategy. Number one -- and you saw some of this in the hearing as well -- Mr. Morrison did say that.\n\n\n\nIf you read the full transcript of Mr. Morrison, he said something damaging about the president. He, too, went to the National Security Council lawyer and reported his concerns about the call.\n\n\n\nThey Republicans are and this is smart politically -- it would be smart in a trial for a lawyer -- they're cherry-picking the information that they believe helps them. They're want challenging the facts. I think that is the most important part.\n\n\n\n[13:45:04]\n\n\n\nWe've now had five witnesses in public hearings, the public impeachment hearings, and the Republicans are not challenging the facts.\n\n\n\nThe facts are being billed that everyone involved, whether they're in Ukraine or the State Department or today inside the West Wing of the White House, thought this was off the rails, thought it was wrong, thought it was improper, though it was possible illegal when you got to the question of putting the hold on the money. The Republicans aren't challenging that.\n\n\n\nWhat they're trying to do is hold the Republicans in line by raising questions about judgment, about loyalty, about maybe political motivations or we're you leaking. It's all a side show, but it's an important side show politically to keep Republicans from breaking. TAPPER: Laura Coates, your take on, this time, not the president but\n\n\n\nthe White House itself attacking a witness -- that's my interpretation -- I should say criticizing, publicly airing critical testimony against one witness while that witness was testifying?\n\n\n\nLAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: What I really have a problem with is this idea in isolation not providing the full context of the statement. When you do that and you use selective quotes, you mislead the public and the job of the White House is not to do just that. It's supposed to guide the public to lead them in genuine fact. In fact, that didn't happen. That led to the quote.\n\n\n\nThe real issue for me is let's compare last week to now. Last week, it was all about, well, he was inappropriate but not outlandish. Now it's, you described an abuse of power, you described a quid pro quo, but you didn't say the words bribery and extortion, therefore, it's not really a problem. That's the only leg they have to stand on.\n\n\n\nThat combined with -- the really offensive one here to me was the idea of, who are you to tell me this information, Vindman? They questioned why he had the audacity to want his name referred to as lieutenant colonel instead of mister. Who do you think you are? You have the audacity to wear your uniform in this courtroom, this professional hearing room. Who do you think you are?\n\n\n\nAnd here you are, taking outside --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: You see Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, who also works in the White House, walking through the halls.\n\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\nCOATES: And you have both of them walking the halls and both in positions of real power. But he refused repeatedly to overstate his position. He refused to say that he was somebody who was in charge of policy.\n\n\n\nNobody questioned that he was in charge of policy to the -- that the president of the United States had the prerogative to set foreign policy as the real -- real diplomat. But they tried to attack him for that because they had nothing else there. It was the audacity arguments, the semantics.\n\n\n\nI think it's the most effective unpersuasive and effective here. And one was, as Dana was talking about, if you do not have anything to retort to the actual substance, you have to fire shots at the messenger and take the position of, well, it may be important for the world to have heard this, but you were the wrong person to tell us.\n\n\n\nIf that's the case, Jake, who should it have been?\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, you know a little about mean tweets from President Trump and the White House.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So without going through your entire history, we heard Ambassador Yovanovitch last week say, in real time, that she found President Trump's tweet intimidating. Republicans have said that mean tweets cannot be intimidating, it just mean tweets, who cares.\n\n\n\nHaving been on the end of it, having been on the end of a negative campaign from President Trump, coming from the White House, what is it like? Is it intimidating? And what do you say to people who say, it's just a negative tweet, who cares?\n\n\n\nANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, nobody said that to me because that's not what it is. It's absolutely horrifying. I know that from my time still serving in government, while I was serving as deputy director and acting director.\n\n\n\nTo be receiving those sorts of attacks from the president that you serve, while you're in a government position, and therefore not in any position to ever respond or reply or defend yourself in public, it is both horrifying to be turned upon like that by our chief executive of the nation.\n\n\n\nAnd also just oddly -- you just feel so defenseless because there's absolutely nothing you can do to respond to it, to respond in a way with the sort of amplification and clarity that the president has when he speaks about anything.\n\n\n\nIt is absolutely horrifying. It's chilling to your family.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: We heard Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say it's not just about the attacks of the president, it's everything it set off.\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Right, that it sets off. It unleashes a whole torrent of the president's supporters, people who follow him closely, voters and folks like that. But even worse so, people on the Hill, other folks, elected representatives, in positions of authority, who pick up these false narratives and then begin to repeat the lies that the president says about you.\n\n\n\nIt's just -- I can't even adequately describe it. And I know exactly how Ambassador Yovanovitch feels.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So stepping back from that tweet from the White House, John Dean, tell us what you think was effective. What wasn't effective, what point were made?\n\n\n\n[13:50:06]\n\n\n\nJOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: If I could just footnote what Andrew said about having been attacked. He knows, I know, you know the basic truth of what happened and efforts to stir up, confuse it. You get a certain comfort in knowing you've told the truth, and attacks just don't affect that.\n\n\n\nI happened to have been in the Witness Protection Program, so I had extra help in protecting myself. But what's happened this morning, to me, was not surprising. There was a lot of speechifying. Republicans found they really had no questions very quickly and posturing, and started posturing, attacking the process. And it shows the weakness of their position overall. The Democrats obviously refuted some of that.\n\n\n\nBig picture, nothing has changed. We're getting more confirmation, the public is getting educated, putting faces on these people and learning what, indeed -- how unprecedented that a president would use his office in this manner to get political advantage over his potential opponent.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Scott Jennings, I want to ask about one point that I thought was not ineffective by Republican Congressman Chris Stewart, of Utah, taking issue with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's use of the word demand for that part of the call with President Trump, suggesting he'd like a favor and wants President Zelensky to do something for him.\n\n\n\nWe heard Jennifer Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say they thought it was inappropriate and a demand.\n\n\n\nBut here's Chris Stewart taking issue with that. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): Much has been talked about as we discussed between President Trump and President Zelensky and the word favor and it being interpreted as a basis for impeachment.\n\n\n\nAnd your interpretation of the word favor -- and I'll paraphrase you and feel free to correct me. You said, In the military culture, which you and I are both familiar with, when a superior officer asks for a favor of a subordinate, they will interpret that as a demand.\n\n\n\nIs that a fair synopsis of what you previously stated?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, when a superior makes a request, that's an order.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: OK. In short then you think your interpretation of a favor is a demand based upon your military experience in the military culture?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that is correct.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: I think that is correct. Is President Trump a member of the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He is not.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Has he ever served in the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Not that I'm aware of.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Is President Zelensky a member of the military? VINDMAN: I don't believe so.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: The answer is, he's not.\n\n\n\nWould it be fair then to take a person, who has never served in the military, and to take your re-evaluation of their words based on your military experience and your military culture, and to attach that culture and that meaning of those words to someone who's never served?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, I made that judgment, and I stick by that judgment.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: He calls in nonsense. I think that's nonsense, is what Stewart says right after I made that judgment. What do you think?\n\n\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I thought it was an interesting line of questioning. But it went to the overall assertion by Republicans today that Vindman isn't in a position to know exactly what the president's state of mind was.\n\n\n\nOn other occasions, he says he never met or advised the president directly. He said, quote, I don't know what the president was thinking. He said, quote, I was making a judgment call as a layman.\n\n\n\nWhat Stewart was doing was effective. To say you heard this but, because you don't know the president, you didn't speak to the president, and have a different frame of reference, you're giving your opinion instead of what may be the most important fact, which is what is the president's state of mind.\n\n\n\nIt's fine for Republicans to argue that today and I thought it was effective. That's all going to change tomorrow when Gordon Sondland shows up, because he actually has been talking to the president.\n\n\n\nI view today, Jake, as bit of a bridge day to get to the main event, which is Sondland.\n\n\n\nKING: It is a smart strategy. The Republicans are trying to get that one or two moments that are played on FOX News, that are played on social media, Trump-friendly social media. Where you say, aha, you think it's a demand, because you're a colonel, but the president wouldn't.\n\n\n\nRepublicans want you to focus on that one moment. The other day, it was, well, Ambassador Yovanovitch, if they wanted to remove you so they could be corrupt in Ukraine, why replace you with Bill Taylor, a man of great integrity? They want you to look at the one moment as opposed to the weeks before, the weeks after, which is Sondland, and more on what Rudy Giuliani were up to.\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Far be it for me to predict what viewers of FOX News will think. But can we talk about what a crazy position Stewart was taking there? This president of Ukraine has people dying from lack of military equipment. He has people dying every day because they don't have military equipment.\n\n\n\n[13:55:00]\n\n\n\nDonald Trump holds in his hand the potential to save the lives of Ukrainians. Do you think maybe he's going to agree to what Donald Trump says about anything to get that money?\n\n\n\nI mean, the idea that this is -- well, it would be nice if you investigated Joe Biden. It's not a request. It's a demand with Ukrainians lives on the line.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Hold that thought. We'll talk about that.\n\n\n\nWe'll take a quick break.\n\n\n\nUp next, the impeachment testimony resumes with two additional witnesses.\n\n\n\nPlus, the president just responded to today's hearing.\n\n\n\nStay with us.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[14:00:00]
Repealing and replacing Obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of Americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\n\nRolling back Obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\n\nBut if Republican repeal efforts fail, House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled Tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\n\nIf the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of Obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, Ryan said on CNBC's Power Lunch.We will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\n\nGiven how hard repealing Obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. So for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. They include a high-income Medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\n\nThe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave Obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. It would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. And they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the Senate.\n\nAdding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. As it is, it's a heavy lift, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nRelated: Who pays if Congress kills the state and local tax deduction\n\nTax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. For starters, there are still big disagreements within the Republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\n\nIf they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under Senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what Ryan wants.\n\nThe White House has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the House and Senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\n\nDespite what many skeptics believe, Ryan on Tuesday said after a speech before the National Association of Manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.
Story highlights Authorities describe how they shut down a Texas sex slave and human trafficking operation Notorious alleged pimp Alfonso Poncho Diaz-Juarez remains on the run\n\nGot a tip about this case? Contact the FBI with any information here.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nEsperanza was waiting for her cousins outside her high school in Mexico one day, when a strange man drove up in a car, forced her inside with him and sped away. At that moment, Esperanza had in effect become a sex slave.\n\nHe beat and raped me, she told CNN's The Hunt with John Walsh.\n\nShe said the man – who called himself Poncho — brought her to a madam who showed Esperanza how to charge clients and how to use a condom.\n\nA few times Esperanza tried — and failed — to escape, but she said Poncho, now age 47, always tracked her down, and then beat her.\n\nEventually, Esperanza realized she was pregnant. Three months later, she said Poncho drove her across the Mexican-US border and on to Houston, Texas, where he forced her to work in a cantina called La Costenita.\n\nShe gave birth to a baby girl, but Poncho took the infant away as insurance that Esperanza would keep working as a sex slave and wouldn't escape.\n\nPHOTO: Photo Illustration/CNN Alfonso Diaz Juarez is accused of human trafficking in a Houston-area prostitution sting.\n\nI really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help, Esperanza said. But I got caught up by the threats he would make towards my daughter. I didn't want anything to happen to her.\n\nEsperanza — whose real name is being withheld for her protection — had become just like the more than 19,000 sex trafficking cases reported in the US since 2007, according to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center.\n\nThe site says more than 2,600 sex trafficking cases have been reported in the US this year alone, most of them in California. Texas ranks as the nation's number-two sex trafficking state, on the website.\n\nA 'crime that happens in third world countries'\n\nFor the uninitiated, it's hard to imagine that thousands of young people — overwhelmingly women — have been kidnapped in Mexico or elsewhere and taken against their will to the United States, where they serve as sex slaves.\n\nI thought human trafficking was just this crime that happens in third world countries. Until I started to look into my city, said Rachel Alvarez, a human trafficking case worker for the Houston YMCA.\n\nRelated story: How to help sex trafficking victims\n\nTexas authorities first met Esperanza when they raided La Costenita in 2010.\n\nHer initial demeanor was just kind of stoic, remembered Steve Roskey, who took part in the raid when he was an agent with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. But then, all of a sudden, we noticed tears start running down her face. She started telling us her story: how she got here, what she was forced to do.\n\nWhen she told police that her pimp, a man named Alfonso Diaz-Juarez who also went by Poncho, was holding her daughter, authorities sprang into action.\n\nWe knocked on Poncho's family members' houses, we knocked on his friends' houses, Roskey said. It irritated the family and friends so much that (Diaz-Juarez) eventually dropped off the child to a cousin, and at about 3 o'clock in the morning, we got a phone call. The child was safe.\n\nBut Diaz-Juarez was nowhere to be found.\n\nAmerica's human trafficking 'hubs'\n\nPimps will often lure women from Mexico across the border to the US by promising them better lives, perhaps a better job, Alvarez said. These pimps may get help from people the women already know and trust, like a neighbor.\n\nOnce they're kidnapped, these women are no longer viewed as people in the eyes of their handlers. They've been reduced to a commodity that can be bought and sold repeatedly in an open market. In the United States, Houston has become one of those markets.\n\nPeople see Houston as a hub for human trafficking because of its proximity to the border, said FBI special agent Suzanne Bradley. It also has access to the I-10 highway corridor, which goes across the country, so if they're smuggling people in and trying to get them into human trafficking in other areas of the country, it's very easy to get them on that I-10 route and disperse them throughout the country.\n\nRelated story: Why Atlanta is a US hub for sex trafficking\n\n'One of the most violent pimps'\n\nAfter the kidnapped women are brought into the US, the beatings begin as a way to keep them from trying to escape. Their captors threaten to hurt family members. Pimps use fear to keep their sex slaves in bondage.\n\nPoncho was one of the most violent pimps I've come across in the 11 years I've worked human trafficking, said Edwin Chapuseaux, a former investigator with the Harris County Sheriff's Office. He did a lot of brutal things, bordering into torture, to make the girls do what he wanted.\n\nA former sex slave we'll call Laura said Poncho knew her mother's name, her address, everything. He would threaten me, tell me if I talked to anyone that he would hurt my family.\n\nA pimp would have a lot to lose if a girl walked out the door.\n\nIf a pimp has, let's say, four or five girls, and each one is making him, you know, $2,000, $3,000 a week, do the math, tax-free, said Chapuseaux. That works out to a maximum of $780,000 per year.\n\nLaura recalls one night when she counted 70 women working. The usual was 30 men. We each had to tend to 30 clients a night.\n\nTeen girls available for $500 an hour\n\nFor years federal and local authorities had been gathering evidence against a huge Houston-area sex trafficking network led by Raquel Medeles Hortencia-Arguello.\n\nThe woman everyone knew as Tencha owned a brothel called Las Palmas that offered minor-aged girls to customers who would pay up to $500 an hour, according to the FBI.\n\nCoincidentally, as a cautionary move, Tencha had distanced herself from Las Palmas by leasing it to Diaz-Juarez.\n\nWhen police found out, they arrested him on a previous warrant.\n\nDiaz-Juarez pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors that led to his release several months later. Poncho was back on the loose.\n\nFollowing the money\n\nAuthorities continued to gather evidence in the big sex trafficking case.\n\nWe realized early on that we had potential financial crimes, money laundering involved in the case, so we got the [Internal Revenue Service] involved in it, said Bradley. The IRS began following the money, reviewing bank statements, locating assets.\n\nWe did an estimate on how much she made from the room rental, entrance fee, and the condoms for the whole entire period she was operating Las Palmas and that estimated to be about $12.5 million, said IRS Special Agent Lucy Tan.\n\nWhen it was time for police to move in and raid Las Palmas, 13 people were arrested. Diaz-Juarez wasn't among them. But Tencha was.\n\nTwelve pleaded guilty.\n\nProsecutors charged Tencha with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, one count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, three counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to money launder.\n\nTencha pleaded not guilty.\n\nAnger triggers testimony\n\nWhen Tencha began crying in front of the judge, saying she was innocent and she had no idea what was going on, it stirred something inside the freed women who once worked for her.\n\nThey began to get angry.\n\nOne by one they decided to take the stand and testify against their former captor.\n\nYou didn't have to speak Spanish to see how much pain they had over what had been done to them, and what they had had to do, remembered Bradley. You could just see it in their face, hear it in their voice.\n\nUltimately, the jury found Tencha guilty and the judge sentenced her to life in prison.\n\nDespite the legal victory against Tencha, authorities are disturbed by the fact that Diaz-Juarez remains free.\n\nIt's very important to get Poncho arrested and prosecuted, because he will not stop doing what he does until he is arrested and put behind bars, said Chapuseaux.\n\nLaura, who still fears Poncho, admits she'll feel safer when he is captured. There aren't any words to describe what a terrible person he is.

We think we'll arrive at 8am on the day of the match and the driver wants to be turning around again at 3am.\n\nREAD: Salah wins sixth individual award\n\nREAD: Salah – he's like the Sphinx and the Pyramids\n\nREAD: A day in the life of Mo Salah\n\nPHOTO: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images Liverpool and Real Madrid have been allocated 16,626 tickets each.\n\nAn issue for Britain's Parliament\n\nFans of both clubs have been critical of UEFA, European football's governing body, for allocating 16,626 tickets to each club for an event being held in the 63,000-capacity NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium, while airlines and hotels have also come under fire for raising the cost of flights and accommodation.\n\nThe issue has even been raised in Britain's Parliament, with Liverpool season-ticket holder and lawmaker Derek Twigg describing the situation as appalling.\n\nPHOTO: Joern Pollex/Bongarts/Bongarts/Getty Images The capacity of the stadium has been decreased from 70,000 to 63,000 for the final.\n\nAs of May 21 on Booking.com, a room for one adult at Hotel Verhovina on May 26 was £859 ($1,155), while staying a night in the same hotel on June 2 would set guests back just £16 ($21).\n\nOn the same website, a guesthouse apartment for one person for May 26 was £4,226 ($5,686). Rooms were unavailable at the time of searching in one of Kiev's plushest establishment, the InterContiental Kiev.\n\nSo expensive is the accommodation that generous Kiev residents have mobilized on social media to offer spare rooms and sofas to fans for free.\n\nMeanwhile, a flight to Kiev from London Gatwick on May 25, returning on Sunday May 27, was £1,214 ($1633) when searching SkyScanner on Monday. Flying to Kiev from Gatwick on June 2 and returning June 3 was £267 ($359).\n\nREAD: Real win historic Champions League title\n\nREAD: The match that changed football\n\n'A tax on loyalty and passion'\n\nPHOTO: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images Liverpool fans cheer their team from the Kop.\n\nTo have two clubs the size of Liverpool and Real Madrid in the Champions League should be a special moment as a football supporter and what you've got is loyal supporters being frozen out, added Roberts, a regular at Liverpool matches for 28 years. Liverpool had to organize a ballot to allocate tickets to fans.\n\nIt all feels unfair that they (a) can't put it in a bigger venue and (b) in a city that's got better infrastructure to cope.\n\nThere's been rooms advertised on the internet for £10,000 ($13,473). Going in the van is the only way we can do it.\n\nYou only have to go online and type in Champions League tickets and you find them from anything from £500 ($672) to £4,000 ($5382).\n\nEven through UEFA, they were selling tickets for £394 ($530). That's ridiculous. That's not fair pricing. That's a tax on loyalty, a tax on passion for your football team.\n\nWho do you think will win the Champions League? Have your say on our Facebook page.\n\nPHOTO: OSCAR DEL POZO/AFP/AFP/Getty Images A Real Madrid football team fan holds a replica of the Champions League trophy.\n\nThe estimated gross commercial revenue of UEFA's European competitions – the Champions League, Europa League and Super Cup – during the 2017-18 season is approximately 2.35 billion euros ($2.78 billion), according to European football's governing body.\n\nSpirit of Shankly, the Liverpool supporters' union, said the final would be surely the most expensive club competition final ever.\n\nIn a statement, the union criticized the governing body, saying: With their huge wealth, amassed from TV rights and sponsorship deals, how can they justify charging fans up to £394 per ticket?\n\nAside from the kindness of individuals wanting to help fans, what we have seen is a brazen rip-off with pre-booked hotels canceled and made available again for twice the price.\n\nThe union claimed Thomas Cook, Liverpool's travel partner which was chartering four flights from Liverpool John Lennon Airport to Kiev, had deliberately increased prices.\n\nThomas Cook had angered fans for charging £899 ($1,210) for flights when they had initially offered up a round trip for £759 ($1,021).\n\n02:32 - Source: CNN It's all about football (shirts)\n\nIn a statement, the airline said the cost was based on a number of factors, such as fewer aircraft available to charter in the summer season.\n\nThe company added that the final was also taking place on the same weekend as the Monaco Grand Prix, a bank holiday and also fell during school holidays in some parts of Britain.\n\nWhen we secured the additional aircraft for supporters, the increased price of seats reflected the increased costs we incurred from the aircraft leasing company, a statement read.\n\nIn no way have we been putting prices up to take advantage of supporters who want to get to Kiev.\n\nVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos\n\n'A party for UEFA not the fans'\n\nA total of 40,700 tickets have been made available to fans and the general public, according to UEFA, for a final being held at a 70,000-seater stadium operating at reduced capacity.\n\nAccording to a UEFA spokesperson, category three and four tickets – the cheapest available – have stayed at the same price since the 2012 final, with category four tickets selling for a reasonable 70 euros ($82) in March.\n\n02:06 - Source: CNN Liverpool legend Grobbelaar on 1984 Roma final\n\nOverall the pricing structure in the last five years has stayed very similar, as has the allocation for finalists. For example, at the final in 2014 in Lisbon with a stadium capacity of 61,000, the finalists received 17,000 tickets each, the spokesperson said.\n\nDefending champions Real Madrid were allocated 892 fewer tickets for Kiev than they did for last year's final in Cardiff.\n\nThe club says 24,268 season-ticket holders applied for the 12,802 Kiev tickets made available to fans by the club via a lottery but, according to the Independent, more than 2,000 Real fans have returned their tickets because of cost.\n\nFor the fans who planned ahead and had supreme belief in their team, however, they will travel to Kiev at a fraction of the cost of those who waited until the conclusion of the semifinals.\n\nNacho Vignote, a Real season-ticket holder for 18 years, booked his flight and accommodation in September. His confidence is perhaps understandable as this is Real's third final in four years.\n\nPHOTO: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images In 2017 Real became the first team in Champions League history to win back-to-back titles.\n\nVignote's flight from Madrid cost 100 euros ($118) – the cheapest flight departing Madrid on May 25 and returning on May 27 was £466 ($627) on SkyScanner on Tuesday.\n\nHe and nine friends have not had to dig deep for accommodation either as they are renting an apartment for four nights for 1,000 euros ($1,181).\n\nI try to book some months in advance and if Real reach the final then perfect for me and if not it's a nice weekend in a city, he tells CNN Sport.\n\nThis year fewer Real fans have applied for tickets, about four times less. The club is still calling for people on the waiting list because a lot of people have rejected tickets.\n\nThe fans are angry with UEFA for the location they have chosen for the final. The cost is because of the location. If it had been anywhere in central Europe it'd be completely different.\n\nAnd all the tickets are just for VIPs and UEFA. This is a party for UEFA instead of a party where fans can go at an affordable price. The real fans have to either stay at home or spend a lot of money.
By now you may have noticed some extra cash in your paycheck because of the new federal tax law.\n\nBut make sure you're not getting too much of a pay bump — or too little.\n\nWhile the new law lowered most income tax rates, it made a lot of other tax changes too.\n\nTo help you figure out if you're getting the right amount of take-home pay, the Treasury Department and the IRS on Wednesday put out a revised withholding calculator and a revised version of its withholding worksheet.\n\nEither can help you determine whether you're still claiming the right number of withholding allowances on the Form W-4 that you filled out for your employer when you started your current job, got married or had kids.\n\nBut the number you chose at the time may not be the right one for 2018. That's because the new tax law changed the underlying structure on which withholding allowances are based, particularly by eliminating the personal exemption and changing the eligibility for a now-expanded child tax credit.\n\nWhile it would be a good idea for everyone to double check their allowances, it's especially recommended if you have a more complex tax situation. For instance, you have more than one job or an outside source of income, you normally take a lot of itemized deductions, or you and your spouse both work and have a few kids.\n\nFor the most comprehensive assessment, use the calculator.\n\nWithholding issues can be complicated, and the calculator is designed to help employees make changes based on their financial situation, said acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter. Taking a few minutes can help taxpayers ensure they don't have too little — or too much — withheld from their paycheck.\n\nRelated: Here's how much paychecks may go up under the new tax law\n\nThe goal, he said, is to avoid surprises when you file your taxes in 2019.\n\nMost tax filers will want to avoid being under-withheld — meaning the number of allowances you used to take is now too high given the tax law changes. In that case, if you don't reduce your withholding allowances for this year, you'll risk owing money to Uncle Sam when you file your 2018 taxes, or at least not getting as big of a refund as you're used to.\n\nThe IRS suggests people at risk of being under-withheld may include those who itemized their deductions in the past, have two or more jobs in their household, or who have dependents age 17 or over. (Note: most wage earners are over-withheld, meaning they take too few allowances and end up getting a refund come tax time.)\n\nRelated: Tax law, bonuses and raises: 5 things you need to know\n\nTo use the IRS calculator, you won't need to fill out your name or any other identifying information such as your Social Security number. And the IRS says it doesn't store the data you enter.\n\nBut you will need to indicate your marital status, the number of jobs you hold, your gross income and whether your children qualify you to take two child tax breaks, plus other details.\n\nFor help providing those other details, the IRS recommends you have on hand your most recent pay stub and a copy of your last filed federal tax return.\n\nIf you decide to change your withholding allowances for this year, you'll need to resubmit another W-4 form to your employer.\n\n-- CNN's Donna Borak contributed to this story
London (CNN Business) The Bank of England has slashed interest rates to a record low and launched other emergency measures as part of a dramatic and coordinated UK response to limit the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nThe central bank said in a statement Wednesday that while the magnitude of the shock from the coronavirus remains highly uncertain, economic activity is likely to weaken materially in the United Kingdom over the coming months.\n\nA few hours later, UK finance minister Rishi Sunak pledged to do whatever it takes to protect the economy. He announced £30 billion ($39 billion) in tax breaks and additional spending, including targeted coronavirus relief measures worth an estimated £12 billion ($15.5 billion).\n\nThe rate cut follows the Federal Reserve's decision to slash US interest rates by half a percentage point in an extraordinary move last week. The European Central Bank, which meets Thursday in Frankfurt, is expected to push interest rates deeper into negative territory and announce other measures to fight economic damage from the virus.\n\nThe Bank of England said that slashing its main interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.25% would help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm.\n\nRead More

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nClifton Broumand has started noticing something is off at the trade shows.\n\nSince 1982, he's been selling medical-grade keyboards and mice produced at his facility in Landover, Maryland, and he's been through a few recessions. Each time, he gets the feeling one's coming when foot traffic seems to be down at the exhibitions he visits to attract new clients.\n\nThis year, he only got half the usual number of leads at an industry conference in Chicago. He knows what happens next.\n\nWhen you start seeing these things, it's like death by a thousand cuts, Broumand says. You see a cut here, a cut there, and all of a sudden it adds up.\n\nMost economic indicators aren't pointing to a downturn on the near horizon. But with seemingly constant chaos in Washington, recent turmoil in the markets and an expansion that's about to be the longest on record, businesses are getting nervous.\n\nIt's notably hard to predict recessions, which are only officially declared well after they've already begun. Eight months into the so-called Great Recession in 2008, many economists were still debating whether the economy was in fact in a recession.\n\nThe fact that the economy is strong right now is no shield against a recession. In fact, recessions typically start when the economy is at its peak and has nowhere to go but down.\n\nMost economists expect slower growth in 2019, but the big question is whether that will morph into a full-blown recession — or if the Federal Reserve can successfully guide the US economy into a soft landing, in which the economy slows but doesn't shift into reverse.\n\nEvery economist has their favorite advance warning system.\n\nBusiness confidence\n\nOne indicator that tends to run well in advance of recessions: The National Federation of Independent Business measure of members' own subjective well-being, known as the small business optimism index. It peaked in the third quarter of 2004, while the American economy was growing faster than it is now, and then started falling until it bottomed out in early 2009.\n\nMore recently, the index spiked after President Donald Trump was elected, reached its highest reading ever in August — and has been sagging since.\n\nSmall business confidence is important because it can determine if those businesses will hire new workers and invest to grow the business, or if they'll start to pull back. And small businesses account for roughly half of the nation's economic activity.\n\nCar sales\n\nBill Dunkelberg, chief economist of the NFIB, keeps an eye on intermediary businesses — anyone who takes orders directly from consumers, and could pick up on any hesitance in the sector responsible for 70% of gross domestic product.\n\nCar dealers are the ones who start to notice, Dunkelberg says. When the car dealer isn't selling, he sends the message up to GM, 'I don't need the cars.'\n\nMotor vehicle sales typically take a turn for the worse at least a few months before recessions officially begin. But recently announced layoffs at GM notwithstanding, car sales have been hovering near historically high levels since early 2015.\n\nWorkers in the auto industry and other supply-chain roles see the signs of a slowdown becoming a downturn even earlier.\n\nWorker hours\n\nA recession may get rolling with a few seemingly anomalous events like the recently-announced GM plant closures. There can also be warning signs in large-scale buyouts, such as those offered to 10,400 Verizon employees a few weeks ago or FedEx buyouts due to a slowdown in trade amid global trade disputes.\n\nBut the more common first step is not being asked to stay late and come in on Saturdays.\n\nWhen manufacturing weakens, the firms wouldn't lay workers off, they would cut back their overtime hours, says economist Ed Leamer, who directs the UCLA/Anderson Business Forecast Project. So far, manufacturing workweeks remain very long by historical standards, after reaching their longest point since World War II in the spring of 2018.\n\nSurprisingly, the low unemployment rate can help accelerate a slide.\n\nThe United States is at what economists consider full employment, with more job openings than workers seeking jobs. But employers unable to find the workers they want are more likely to turn to automation to do the work that they need done.\n\nRising wages, either because of market conditions or increases in minimum wage laws in many states, also makes increased use of automation more attractive. Another factor is the 2017 tax reform, which allows businesses a bigger tax cut on capital spending, such as robots and computer kiosks that can be used by customers, than on new hiring.\n\nThe trouble comes when the economy starts to slow, and it's the workers who are let go, not the machines.\n\nThat's why it can be just a matter of months for a labor market to go from very low unemployment to job losses and a recession, as happened in 2000 and 2001.\n\nThe housing market\n\nHousing has historically been a harbinger of recession — most dramatically in the financial collapse of 2008, which was caused by a real estate bubble fueled by too-easy credit. This time may be different.\n\nHome sales and residential investment have started to sag over the past couple of quarters. But there was no building boom, post-recession mortgage underwriting has been much more solid, and any drop-off in the housing market has been blamed on rising interest rates — as well as high home prices.\n\nStill, home building and real estate accounts for a significant portion of the US economy and a slowdown in housing, for whatever reason, amounts to a slowdown in economic activity, even if it's not the catastrophe of the last recession.\n\nGrowing deficits\n\nMichael Stritch, chief investment officer with BMO Wealth Management, says his clients are mostly concerned that ballooning government deficits may eventually force painful cuts in other areas and lead to political turmoil, even at a time of record corporate profits and low unemployment.\n\nWe don't think it's going to be an acute problem unless people lose faith in the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, Stritch says. It's likely to just eat away at potential GDP growth over time.\n\nThe rising federal deficits, about to crack $1 trillion for the first time, can result in higher interest rates, as the Treasury has to pay more to sell the bonds needed to fund the government. Rising corporate debt can have a similar impact on rates.\n\nAnd the higher bond rates, coupled with the Fed setting its rates higher, can raise the cost of doing business, and the cost of living for households. That in turn serve as a brake on economic growth — especially if deficits are only used to finance tax cuts, rather than priorities like infrastructure and education that would generate a return on the investment over time.\n\nOther pieces of the economy seem more likely to cause a slow drag than to suddenly crater and take the rest of the country with them. Tariffs, for example, have only started to increase prices in a few industries, which may eventually lead to lower orders.\n\nEven though most analysts don't see major imbalances — or bubbles — in the real economy that would internally bring on a recession, every recession is a little different.\n\nAnd this time, it's been long enough since the United States went through a serious downturn that a whole generation of business owners hasn't necessarily experienced one.\n\nFor Clifton Broumand, who's learned through hard experience how to prepare contingency plans as soon as it seems that business might disappear, the fading memories are cause for worry.\n\nA lot of people haven't lived through a recession before, Broumand says. And this is the dangerous part. It's been such a long time, people might not be able to recognize the signs.
First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Friday. Bush joined them via satellite from Genoa, Italy, where he is participating in the G8 Summit. Tax rebate schedule Date mailed Last 2 digits of Social Security # July 20 00-09 July 27 10-19 August 3 20-29 August 10 30-39 August 17 40-49 August 24 50-59 August 31 60-69 September 7 70-79 September 14 80-89 September 21 90-99 Source: Internal Revenue Service Bush said the tax rebates will give families a break and should also stimulate the economy. Beginning late last summer and early fall, our economy, especially the manufacturing sector, began slowing, he said. The combination of this tax relief and lower interest rates should help get it moving again. Not everyone will get a rebate check. Those who did not file a return last year, those who had no taxable income and those who can be claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return will not qualify. The amount of some taxpayers' checks may be smaller, too, if they owe any back taxes, child support payments or federal loan payments. The government will deduct those debts from rebate checks before sending them. So how will you spend your rebate check, if you're getting one? About 47 percent of those questioned for a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said they would pay bills with the money, 32 percent will save it, 17 percent will spend it and 2 percent will donate their check to charity. If you're undecided about how to spend the money, several stores are ready to help you make that crucial decision. At Wal-Mart stores across the country, people can cash their checks on site or spend the amount in the store against the value of the check. Home Depot stores are offering customers credit, based on the expected amounts of their rebates, until their checks come in. Some analysts say that if people immediately spend their checks, it could stimulate the economy. This is not a one shot deal. This is a down payment on future tax cuts, and I think people would be more apt to spend more of it than they would if they were just handed a one-shot rebate check, said Gerald Cohen of Merrill-Lynch. Others disagree. The problem right now is we're likely to see mounting job losses, and that's likely to erode confidence and induce consumers to save and not to spend, said Anirvan Banerji of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. If you filed your 2000 income tax return late, your check will come after the end of September. And if you moved since you sent in that return, make sure you've filed an official change of address form with the U.S. Post Office. The government says the checks will not be counted as taxable income for the 2001 federal tax returns, but residents of some states may have to pay slightly higher state taxes because of the rebates. One of the states -- Iowa -- has already moved to trim the extra taxes. The others affected are Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon. The situation came about because in those eight states taxpayers can deduct the amount they pay in federal taxes -- minus any refunds -- thereby reducing their taxable income. But some state officials, believing people will see only that the rebate will mean higher state taxes, fear a backlash from taxpayers who will think the rebate is being taxed. In Missouri the issue will be a subject of discussion at a special session of the legislature in September. Special sessions are being considered in Alabama and several of the other states, and a Montana official said something could be done in a future year to offset this year's slightly higher tax.

Lynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nThe French Open organizers won't offer special treatment to Serena Williams should she make the trip to Roland Garros in Paris this summer.\n\nThis year again, tournament officials will establish the list and ranking of the women's seeds based on the WTA ranking, the French Tennis Federation said, per the Associated Press (via ESPN.com). Consequently, [the seeds] will reflect this week's world ranking.\n\nWilliams has competed in just two WTA events this year after returning to the court following the birth of her daughter. Because of that, as well as her absence for almost the entire 2017 campaign, she sits No. 453 in the WTA rankings.\n\nBoth Maria Sharapova and Simona Halep lobbied on Williams' behalf for her to earn a seed at the 2018 French Open.\n\nSharapova said returning from pregnancy requires an incredible effort that can tax a player physically and emotionally, while Halep said it's normal to give birth and good to protect the ranking when someone is giving birth.\n\nWilliams won the 2015 French Open and was the runner-up in 2016. Failing to be seeded this season will leave her hopes of a fourth French Open title in serious jeopardy.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nWilliams received a wild card entry for her return at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, in March. As a result, she played No. 29 Kiki Bertans in the second round and sister Venus, who was seeded eighth, in the third round. Serena lost to Venus in straight sets. In her next event, the Miami Open, a meeting with fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina awaited Williams if she had defeated Naomi Osaka in the first round.\n\nSomething similar could happen again at the French Open without the luxury of a seeding designation.
Britain will suffer a hit to its economy if it votes in June to leave the European Union. That's the view of most independent forecasters, the International Monetary Fund and the U.K. government.\n\nEven Boris Johnson, the London mayor who is leading the leave campaign, has acknowledged that a vote to quit the world's biggest single market could initially cost Britain jobs.\n\nJohnson says there would then be a rapid upswing but there's plenty of debate as to how bad the Brexit blow would be, and how long it would last.\n\nRelated: Brexit: A short guide to the next two months\n\nThe U.K. government published its first detailed analysis Monday of what it thinks would happen under three scenarios. Here's the official view of the long term impact if Britain has to negotiate a new relationship with the EU:\n\n1. The good (or 'let's copy Norway')\n\nBritain leaves the EU, but retains its membership in the European Economic Area, a treaty from 1994 that gives three non-member countries access to EU markets.\n\nThat would give it the same status as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, but it would mean continuing to grant EU citizens the right to live and work in Britain, accepting EU regulations, and making payments to the EU budget -- all things many Brexit campaigners want to end.\n\nRelated: The truth about UK immigration\n\nEven under this scenario, finance officials estimate that the U.K. economy would be about 3.8% smaller after 15 years than it would have been with full membership in the EU.\n\nThat equates to lost GDP worth 1,100 pounds ($1,560) per person, and 20 billion pounds ($28.4 billion) in lost tax revenue.\n\n2. The bad (or 'Canada's pretty cool')\n\nThe second alternative would be to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with the EU, putting the U.K. in a group of countries that includes Canada, Switzerland and Turkey.\n\nOfficials say the negotiations would be extremely complex, and a free trade agreement would provide less access to the EU single market than Option 1 -- particularly in services, which account for nearly 80% of the U.K. economy.\n\nThe damage under this scenario would be greater: The economy would be about 6% smaller by 2030 than it would have been, equivalent to lost GDP of 1,800 pounds ($2,556) per person. Lost tax revenue would amount to 36 billion pounds ($51 billion).\n\n3. The ugly (or 'Britain joins the BRICS')\n\nIf all else fails, the U.K. could rely on a relationship with the EU based on the rules of the World Trade Organization.\n\nCountries such as Brazil, or Russia (when it's not under sanctions), trade with the EU on this basis.\n\nThis is the only scenario that would free Britain completely from the obligations that come with access to the EU single market. But it would also come at the highest price because of the additional barriers to trade.\n\nOfficials estimate the U.K. economy would be about 7.5% smaller after 15 years than it would have been. That's 2,100 pounds ($2,982) per person in terms of annual GDP, and 45 billion ($64 billion) in lost tax revenue.\n\nBrexit campaigners described the government's report as deeply flawed.\n\nIt also ignores the Treasury's own analysis that EU regulation costs the UK economy much more -- a staggering £125 billion a year, said Vote Leave CEO Matthew Elliott.
You've probably heard by now that the new tax reform bill will hit your paycheck as soon as February. But the change may not accurately reflect your ultimate tax bill.\n\nAbout 90% of people will see more take-home pay, according to the U.S. Treasury. That may sound like great news, but here's the problem: There's a chance you'll end up with too much money in your paycheck -- meaning you'll either be stuck paying it back at tax time next year or get a smaller refund.\n\nThere's also a possibility that too much will be withheld, and your paychecks will be smaller than they should be.\n\nFiguring out how much to withhold from your pay is always a bit of a guessing game. It's an estimate based on how you filled out your Form W-4 and calculation tables created by the IRS.\n\nBut in a rush to implement the new law this year, the estimate could be off more than usual.\n\nThat's because the IRS has updated the calculation tables, but not the Form W-4.\n\nWe've done the best we can in the short term to come up with tables that accurately reflect the tax liability of individual taxpayers. Going forward, in order to be more precise, we're going to need a new system, said a senior IRS official on a call with reporters last week.\n\nA new Form W-4 won't be ready for the 2018 tax year. The new calculations were made to work with the existing form, but the form factors in some deductions and credits that no longer exist or have been changed under the new law.\n\nFor most people, the amount withheld throughout the year is usually more than your actual tax bill -- which means you get a refund after your file your tax return. If not enough is withheld, you end up owing money to Uncle Sam. Generally, you want to get as close as possible to breaking even.\n\nThe new tables may result in under-withholding for some employees.\n\nThose who claim a large number of allowances based on their number of dependents, or on itemized deductions that no longer exist, or are limited by the new law, have the most reason to re-examine their withholding status, said Mike O'Toole, the Senior Director of Publications, Education, and Government Relations at American Payroll Association. The group's members represent 17,000 employers.\n\nBut the changes could also result in over-withholding.\n\nThe good news is the withholdings are within your control. You can always update your Form W-4 to change the amount that's withheld from your paycheck.\n\nHere's what you can expect.\n\nWhen will I see a change in my paycheck?\n\nThe IRS has encouraged employers to start using the new withholding tables by February 15, but it may take your employer longer to make the change.\n\nI can't say that this particular change is appreciably more difficult than in other years. But what will be different is the time pressure and the pressure from employees, who are going to be more sensitive to this, said Jonathan Zimmerman, a partner at Morgan Lewis, who helps employers with benefit plans and payroll matters.\n\nDon't expect your employer to advise you on whether you should change your allowances on the W-4, though. Employers should explain the uniqueness of the situation to workers, communicate when the new rates will be implemented, and then suggest consulting with a tax adviser, according to Mike Boro, a partner at the accounting firm PwC.\n\nHow can I make sure my pay is accurate?\n\nWait for your first paycheck that accounts for the new withholding tables before making any changes, said Barbara O'Neill, a CFP and a financial management specialist at the Rutgers Cooperative Extension.\n\nThen, you can estimate what you think it should be and adjust accordingly.\n\nIRS officials said the agency will be publishing a new online calculator by the end of February that can help you decide how to adjust your allowances based on information you provide regarding your income level and number of children under the age of 17.\n\nBut you can also try to estimate your 2018 tax liability yourself. Then divide that amount by however many paychecks you'll receive this year.\n\nIf the math is close, hang tight, O'Neill said.\n\nIf the math is way off, that's when you'll want to make a change to your Form W-4. You can make a change to the number of allowances you've selected, or you can simply change your allowances to zero and write in how much you want withheld exactly, O'Neill said.\n\nThe changes don't need to be made immediately. O'Neill always recommends taking a look mid-year. By then you'll know if you are receiving a raise or if you'll have additional income coming in during the year.\n\nWhat happens if my withholding is still off?\n\nIf too much is withheld, you'll simply get a bigger refund check after filing your 2018 taxes.\n\nThis amounts to an interest-free loan to the government until then, and could tighten your cash flow, said CFP Jim Guarino.\n\nIf too little is withheld, you could owe money after filing and possibly face a tax penalty if the balance is $1,000 or more, Guarino said. Generally, you can avoid paying the penalty in this case if you paid at least 90% of what you owe or at least as much as you owed during the previous tax year.
That free-wheeling attitude made theco-founder renowned inside and outside of his home country. But it also appears to be putting his business empire — and Ma himself — at enormous risk.\n\nThe trouble started in late October after Ma criticized China's regulators at a conference in Shanghai. As Ma's financial tech firm Ant Group was preparing for the world's largest initial public offering , he accused authorities of stifling innovation and blasted the country's banks for having a pawn shop mentality.\n\nMa, meanwhile, hasn't been seen in public since he gave his speech in Shanghai — a notable absence for a man who typically has no issue with the spotlight, and whose businesses now face their biggest threat in years.\n\nI think there's one overall message that the party is really sending, and that is that tech entrepreneurs may be the most glamorous, the most publicly favorable face that China is showing to the world, said Rana Mitter, professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University. But there is no one individual, no one company bigger than the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nMany observers of China say Ma is most likely lying low as authorities turn up the heat on his businesses, having gotten the hint about speaking out of turn.\n\nBut it's also not unlike Beijing to dole out severe punishment for prominent Chinese figures who clash with the interests of the Communist Party.\n\nSuperstar actress Fan Bingbing, for example, abruptly dropped out of sight in 2018 before reappearing a year later to apologize for a tax evasion scandal. And real-estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang disappeared for several months last year after he allegedly criticized President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He was eventually jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.\n\nA larger-than-life figure\n\nA former English teacher with humble beginnings, Ma has long personified China's economic prosperity and entrepreneurial grit. He built Alibaba into a $500 billion tech empire and amassed a personal fortune of some $50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n\nAs his companies, grew, Ma became the friendly face of China's economic rise. He frequently met with heads of state — Ma has lunched with former President Barack Obama and taken selfies with former UK Prime Minister David Cameron — and last year even donated Covid-19 supplies around the world.\n\nMa's style as an executive at Alibaba was unabashedly flamboyant , too: Once, he sang the 1950s classic  Unchained Melody  on stage at a company conference, often dressed up in costumes and appeared at events with celebrities like David Beckham and Nicole Kidman.\n\nJack Ma performs at Alibaba's 20th-anniversary celebration in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China in 2019.\n\nOn one level, Chinese authorities liked that Ma represented a high-powered and glamorous version of China because one of the things the Chinese Communist Party has found it almost impossible to do is to create soft power in the world, said Mitter, the Oxford professor.\n\nTencent TCEHY Baidu BIDU The government has encouraged the growth of its home-grown tech giants, including Alibaba, Ant Group,and, while shutting out their big American rivals. They're all largely indispensable in China for social interaction, entertainment, commerce and more.\n\nBut authorities in China increasingly view that outsized influence as a risk to the country's political and economic stability . Ant Group, for example, is able to collect lending fees free of the tough regulations imposed on commercial banks.\n\nThe squelching of the big name tech entrepreneurs is part of that wider process by the party to take back control, and really rewrite the narrative of how China's tech innovation takes place only under the circumstances the party will allow, Mitter said.\n\nIn recent months, the government's steps to rein in the industry have gotten more blatant. The Communist Party published an unusually frank set of guidelines in September, for example, that called on its members to educate private businesspeople to weaponize their minds with [Xi's] socialism ideology.\n\nIn the weeks since then, that tightening of the screws has come to pass. In addition to the regulatory demands for Ant Group and investigation into Alibaba, authorities have warned other tech representatives against creating monopolies and abusing consumer data for profit\n\nThe last of his kind\n\nMa, a Communist Party member, remains out of sight. His social media pages have been dormant since October, and he even missed the finale of an African entrepreneurial talent show that he created. (Alibaba said he missed the event because of a  scheduling conflict .)\n\nWhile Beijing hasn't been shy about fining or even jailing executives critical of the government — Ren, the real estate tycoon who was imprisoned last year, allegedly penned an essay that obliquely referred to Xi as a power-hungry clown — tech industry and government observers say Ma may be voluntarily staying out of the spotlight, at least for now.\n\nThe Chinese government wants its narrative about the Ant Group IPO to dominate the public conversation, said Duncan Clark, author of Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built and founder of investment advisory firm BDA China. He added that the company likely knows that it won't help to have any diversity of opinion on the issue.\n\nBut certainly it's remarkable ... the silence is somewhat deafening, Clark said, adding that he expects Ma to eventually come out publicly with a scripted statement about contributing to reform in China.\n\nHe got the signal that 'I spoke too much, that caused me trouble so I need to shut myself up', said Angela Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has studied Chinese antitrust enforcement.\n\nLoss of 'soft power'\n\nOne thing, at least, seems clear: As the Chinese Communist Party piles pressure on the country's tech titans, it seems unlikely the industry will see another figure like Ma. Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang, who succeeded Ma as chairman in 2019, struck a conciliatory tone on regulation in November by describing the government's efforts to tighten restrictions on internet companies as  timely and necessary .\n\nThe loss of that kind of voice, though, will have consequences for Beijing, Mitter said. Many countries, particularly in the West, already view China and its businesses as existential threats worthy of heavy sanctions and scrutiny — tensions that stem from fears that Chinese corporations all operate at the behest of the Communist Party. Stifling criticism from those tech leaders at home could make exerting influence abroad even harder.\n\nThe ability of a figure like Jack Ma to speak out will be harder, and I think this will actually create a further problem for China's desire to generate soft power, Mitter said. Nobody really takes seriously figures from any country who go around the world simply spouting the government line.
Dean camp condemns bin Laden ad\n\nCommercial attacks candidate's national security credentials\n\n(CNN) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean's campaign called on rivals Wednesday to disavow a television ad that uses an image of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to attack the former Vermont governor's national security credentials.\n\nA group calling itself Americans for Jobs, Healthcare and Progressive Values aired the ad in the early Democratic battlegrounds of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nHoward Dean just cannot compete with George Bush on foreign policy, an announcer intones over a magazine cover featuring bin Laden's visage. It's time for Democrats to think about that, and think about it now.\n\nDean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, called the ad the kind of fearmongering attack we've come to expect from Republicans, one that panders to the worst in voters.\n\nHe called on Dean's rivals to condemn the ad and demand it be pulled off the air.\n\nThis type of ad represents everything that is wrong with our political process today -- polluting our airwaves with smears on other candidates that have nothing to do with legitimate policy differences, Trippi wrote in a letter to his counterparts in other campaigns.\n\nAds like this are the reason that less than half of the voting population in America bothers to go to the polls.\n\nThe group was founded in November as a nonprofit committee known as a 527 -- named for the section of the tax code that limits its requirement to disclose the source of its funding.\n\nIts leadership includes two people with ties to Dean's Democratic rivals -- David Jones, a former aide to Rep. Dick Gephardt, and Robert Gibbs, a former spokesman for Sen. John Kerry's campaign.\n\nJones issued a statement Wednesday saying the ad was meant to raise the issue of Dean's national security and foreign policy experience.\n\nThat is the ad's intention and that is what it does, he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday conference call with reporters, Gephardt denied any knowledge of the ad and called on the group to disclose its donors.\n\nI wish they weren't running the ads, he said. I'm sorry they're doing this, but there's nothing I can do about it. But I would call on them and any other 527s to reveal their donors in a timely manner.\n\nBut a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who has hammered Dean's opposition to the war since the weekend capture of fugitive Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, echoed its criticism while denouncing its tone.\n\nWe agree with Joe Trippi that this ad is produced and presented in a way that is over the top, said Brian Hardwick, Lieberman's deputy campaign director.\n\nBut we also agree that it's exactly the kind of ad that Republicans would run. And that's precisely the problem. Simply put: The Democratic nominee will not win in 2004 if he appears weak on defense.\n\nIn August on Larry King Live, Dean deflected criticism of his opposition to the war. I think it's great that Saddam Hussein is not in power, but I would have approached it in a very different way, he said.\n\nAfghanistan, he said, deserves more attention, because the alliance between al Qaeda and the Taliban was an issue for the national security of the United States.\n\nPresidential hopeful Howard Dean. The ad attacks his anti-war stance.\n\nThis past weekend, Dean called the capture of Saddam, a great day of pride in the American military and a great day for the Iraqis and a great day for the American people.\n\nThe 527 committee's funding has come in part from labor unions, but a spokesman for one of those unions disavowed the spot Wednesday.\n\nIf it was up to me, I'd ask for a refund, said Rick Sloan, communications director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which donated $50,000 to the group.\n\nThe union has endorsed Gephardt, the Missouri congressman and former House minority leader. But Sloan said the union did not discuss the commercial with Gephardt, and said it could backfire big time.\n\nI think this has done more damage to Gephardt than any of his opponents ever could have done. The day after the primary or caucus, the Democrats have to go back to living with each other and working with each other, Sloan said.\n\nThis kind of attack ad just drives them crazy, and rightfully so. It makes the job of pulling back together all that much harder. I don't know what they were using for brains -- lug nuts?
Bitcoin and four other cryptocurrencies surgerd on Thursday, with the approach of tax day in the United States.\n\nBitcoin jumped 10% in just one hour, adding nearly $1,000 and surging above $7,000 for the first time since Sunday.\n\nOther popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash, made double-digit gains as well, ending a month-long sell-off.\n\nCryptocurrency experts say there are several factors driving the rally, but the most significant is April 17, the deadline to file taxes in the United States.\n\nRyan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core, which provides software used by Dash traders, said that investors are jumping back into the cryptocurrency market at the end of a tax-related sell-off. He said they've been unloading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent weeks to pay their looming tax bills. But with tax day, April 17, rapidly approaching, most of these investors have paid their tax bills, he said, and some investors have received tax returns that they're spending on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe selling pressure associated with tax day has subsided right now, said Taylor. As people get their tax returns, there may be new money entering the market.\n\nRelated: What is bitcoin?\n\nIt appears that investors are warming back up to bitcoin after a dramatic slump that's been dragging down prices since they peaked at $19,086 on Dec. 17, 2017.\n\nNolan Bauerle, director of research for CoinDesk, a company that tracks cryptocurrency activity, said that short selling has dried up dramatically just since Wednesday, when 44,000 short positions were open for bitcoin. He said that number dropped to 26,000 short positions on Thursday.\n\nThere was definitely a short squeeze, said Bauerle. We do know that this huge volume of short positions closed up simultaneously to that spike in price.\n\nGarrick Hileman, co-founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Mosaic, said that in addition to the end of tax season related selling and the short squeeze, the surge in digital currency might also be driven by heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nHe said that President Trump's rhetoric about bombing Syria might be contributing to the cryptocurrency rally.\n\nCoinDesk's Bauerle said the threat of war and other threats of instability, like the Brexit vote in 2016, have driven the price of cryptocurreny in the past.\n\nWe have noticed the trend of bitcoin acting as a crisis currency, he said.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nThe UK government is attempting to justify flagship legislation that critics say would hand the police and ministers powers that could seriously curb the ability of citizens to protest at a very difficult time. The legislation is being debated in Parliament just days after officers from London's Metropolitan Police forcefully broke up a peaceful demonstration mourning the death of a young woman, Sarah Everard.\n\nEditor's Note: Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOn Tuesday evening, members of Parliament voted in favor of preventing the UK exiting the European Union without a deal. On Wednesday, MPs voted to give the Prime Minister just three days to come up with an alternative plan if, as expected, her own carefully negotiated deal, is rejected by the Commons next week.\n\nAfter a series of bruising defeats last month, it seems the Prime Minister is starting the New Year continuing to be thwarted by a parliament trying to exert its sovereignty.\n\nAnd yet, as MPs prepare to begin a five-day debate ahead of that vote on the May deal next week, we are no closer to discovering what MPs actually want.\n\nWe know, after Tuesday's vote, that there is a majority in favor of blocking a no deal. But there is little evidence of a majority in support of anything else – not May's Brexit plan, nor an alternative Norway-style model for a future relationship with the EU, nor for a second referendum to allow the country to reject Brexit altogether.\n\nCrucially, the attempt to block a no deal is, on closer scrutiny, flawed – because without an alternative, no deal is the default, no matter what Parliament says. If May's plan is voted down next week and no other plan is put forward, Britain is leaving the EU without a deal, on the starkest of terms. The May plan is more than just a plan – it is a legal withdrawal agreement with the EU.\n\nIt is right that, after months of the government trying to force an unpopular version of Brexit on the Commons, MPs try to scrutinize the process of Britain's departure as much as they can. Originally, May had tried to force Parliament into accepting her plan without a meaningful vote before that plan was even finalized with Brussels in November.\n\n02:12 - Source: CNN As Brexit deadline looms, protests turn nasty\n\nWhen the vote was slated for December, she postponed it, to the anger of MPs from all parties who suspected she was trying to run down the clock and make her deal a fait accompli by not allowing enough parliamentary time for a debate on any alternative. Brexit is happening on March 29, in 79 days – but in parliamentary terms, the timeframe is much tighter because of weekends and breaks, and there are only around 40 days left for debate.\n\nYet despite this obstructive approach from May and her government, the House of Commons has been confused over what the alternative should be. MPs need to have a better, more constructive plan than simply opposing a no deal.\n\nBut the truth is there is no consensus around an alternative, an incontrovertible fact in keeping with the divisive nature of Brexit. What's more, while the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU needs to be ratified by the UK parliament – as well as all the other EU nations – it is not in Parliament's gift to amend that deal.\n\nAny changes they demand over the next few days and weeks need to be approved by Brussels. And, given the withdrawal agreement came after months of hardball negotiation with the EU, it is unlikely Brussels will give any substantial ground. Above all, Brussels will not move on one of the key demands of Brexiteers, that the Northern Ireland backstop be removed from the agreement.\n\nEven the technical procedure which MPs used to try to block a no deal, by amending the Finance Bill – a keystone of government legislation – could have dramatic real-world implications, because it means if a no deal does actually take place, the government's tax-raising powers will be restricted.\n\nIt is healthier for democracy that that meaningful vote will take place next week. But, if as is likely, the Prime Minister loses that vote and her plan dies, there needs to be a hardheaded and urgent alternative strategy ready to go, and the Commons needs to find a consensus.\n\nIf MPs get their way, they could force May to return to Parliament within three days of that vote with an alternative. But even then, this alternative must be approved by the EU. In this current Brexit stalemate, the UK Parliament may think it is sovereign, but ultimately it is the EU which retains the whip hand.
IRAs are a powerful tool for retirement savers to get lucrative tax breaks to help them reach their long-term financial goals.\n\nWhen it comes to safety and security, IRAs are as safe as you make them, and although some regulatory protections safeguard your retirement accounts, it's up to you to invest your IRA assets prudently. By using a smart strategy for your investing, you can ensure that your IRA will be as safe as possible while still achieving its underlying purpose.\n\nHow regulators protect your IRA\n\nIRAs get the same regulatory protection that applies to the investment vehicle you use to open your retirement account. For instance, if you invest your IRA in a bank certificate of deposit or savings account, then you'll receive interest in the same way a regular banking customer would, and your IRA will have the full protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's $250,000 deposit insurance.\n\nFor those who use brokerage accounts to invest, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation offers protection of up to $500,000 for securities and cash, including a $250,000 cash limit. IRAs get the same protection as other brokerage accounts. But it's important to understand that while FDIC insurance actually protects your principal from risk of loss, SIPC insurance only protects you against problems with the brokerage company you use. When a broker gets into financial trouble and has to liquidate, SIPC makes sure the assets in each investor's account are present and accounted for. If cash or securities are missing, then the SIPC makes investors whole, up to the dollar limit protected.\n\nWhat the SIPC doesn't do is to prevent you from suffering market losses. If you buy a stock and its value goes to zero, don't look to the SIPC to bail you out, because it won't.\n\nManaging risk with your IRA investing\n\nTo keep your IRA safe, you'll have to take a smart approach to your investing decisions. There are several things you can do to try to balance the returns that your IRA investment portfolio can produce against the risks that you face anytime you invest.\n\nFirst, diversifying your portfolio across several different types of investments can help you avoid catastrophic losses if one of your holdings suffers a setback. Diversification can take many different forms, such as holding many different broad asset classes including stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. It can also mean selecting several different options within a particular asset class, such as buying stocks in various sectors to offer more broad-based exposure.\n\nSecond, be aware of your time horizon. If you're already in retirement, then you'll generally want to be somewhat more conservative in your investing philosophy, because you're in a less favorable position to endure market downturns that could hurt the value of your portfolio.\n\nBy contrast, if you have decades to go before you need to tap your retirement assets, then investing your IRA in more aggressive investments can produce the best returns over the long run.\n\nFinally, make sure you acknowledge some of the risks that many investors neglect. Being conservative with your retirement account can minimize the risk of market losses, but being too conservative comes with the attendant risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of your retirement nest egg and keep you from being financially secure when you retire.\n\nSimilarly, selecting investments that come with higher management fees creates the risk that even if your return on investment is good, the net value of your nest egg at retirement could still be insufficient due to the thousands of dollars in inflated fees that your financial institution took out of your IRA over the course of your career.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nIRAs are extremely valuable for retirement investors, and you can do your part to make them as safe as possible. Although you can't eliminate IRA risk, you can manage it effectively and still reach the financial goals you set for yourself.
As if filing taxes weren't stressful enough, one aspect of the process that really shakes workers to their core is the prospect of getting audited.\n\nStatistically speaking, your chances of getting audited are pretty low, as less than 1% of all returns land on the IRS's list each year.\n\nThat said, in preparing your tax return, you could end up making certain moves that increase your audit risk without realizing it. Here are a few that could subject you to further IRS scrutiny.\n\n1. Rushing through your taxes\n\nSome people wind up filing their taxes at the very last minute because they're forced to wait on key information or are at the mercy of their CPA friend who's supposed to be helping out. But in many cases, folks who end up sweating it out right around the deadline are those who simply procrastinate.\n\nEither way, you should know that rushing through the process is a good way to inadvertently increase your audit risk, since, in doing so, you're more likely to omit key information or enter the wrong data.\n\nA better bet? Pledge to start tackling your tax return a minimum of one month prior to the deadline, which falls on April 17 this year. That's right — you get a couple of extra days, which means you have even less of an excuse to run out of time.\n\n2. Filing on paper\n\nIf you're the old school type, you may decide to file your taxes on paper this year rather than do so electronically. Bad move. Filing on paper means you're far more likely to make a mistake, and if that happens, your return could land on that audit list faster than you can say whoops.\n\nConsider this: The IRS reports that the error rate for paper returns is 21%, which means that one in five tax filers who go this route manages to muck something up. The error rate for electronic returns, on the other hand, is less than 1%. Remember, we're all human, and therefore subject to the occasional blunder. But if that slip-up results in an IRS audit, you'll be kicking yourself for not doing everything possible to lower your risk.\n\n3. Guessing at numbers -- even if you're close\n\nIf there's one thing the IRS is big on, it's accuracy. So as you sit down to file your taxes, make sure you're dealing with hard numbers. Guessing at data or deductions is a great way to raise your audit risk, and it doesn't matter if you're reasonably close — the IRS wants those numbers exact. This means that if you did freelance work last year but are missing that 1099 form that summarizes your income, don't just throw out a number you think is correct. Get on the phone with that client, insist on a copy of that tax form, and get that figure just right.\n\nSimilarly, if you lost a 1099, contact the issuer and find out what exact number that document contained. Remember, every time you get a 1099, the IRS receives a copy as well, and if your return doesn't match its records precisely, you'll automatically boost your audit risk.\n\n4. Being careless with deductions\n\nThe IRS offers a host of deductions that, if you're itemizing, could lower your tax burden significantly. But proceed with caution when claiming deductions, because if you don't, the IRS might choose to take a closer look at your return.\n\nFor one thing, avoid round numbers unless your deductions happen to work out that way. If you racked up, say, $6,966 in medical expenses, don't claim $7,000 for convenience purposes. Not only is that technically a lie, but having too clean a number, so to speak, will likely raise an eyebrow.\n\nFurthermore, try to avoid claiming disproportionately high deductions relative to your income. While it's one thing to list $5,000 in charitable contributions with a $60,000 income, if you claim a $15,000 deduction, it's apt to look suspicious. Of course, if you're looking at an exceptionally high deduction that's perfectly legitimate, by all means, claim it — just be sure to have meticulous documentation to back it up, because chances are, the IRS will ask for it.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nWhile plenty of taxpayers get audited for reasons other than these, avoiding these mistakes could help you stay off that dreaded list. And that's one way to make an otherwise harrowing process just a bit less daunting.
Editor's Note: Errol Louis is the host of Inside City Hall, a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe blue wave, powered in large part by voters who said they did so in opposition to the President, means the House is full of new Democratic members with a firm mandate to attack Trump frequently.\n\nPHOTO: CNN Errol Louis\n\nAlready, incoming freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan told supporters that Trump's days are numbered because We're going to impeach the m*****f****r. And when her comments sparked a furor, she declined to apologize and her office released a statement that read, The Congresswoman absolutely believes he needs to be impeached. She ran and won by making this very clear to the voters in her district, the statement said.\n\nTrump has already responded to the jibe, calling it disgraceful before turning to Twitter to attack Democrats. He wrote, They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!\n\nWhether impeachment proceedings will actually take place is a question perhaps best left to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nPelosi has so far downplayed talks of impeachment, although the option certainly remains on the table. We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report. We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason, she told NBC.\n\nResponding to Tlaib's comments, Nadler said on CNN, I don't really like that language. But more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts, we have to get the facts. That's why it is important to protect the Mueller investigation, that's why it's important to do our own inquiry. We have to get the facts. We will see where the facts lead. Maybe that will lead to impeachment. Maybe it won't. It is much too early.\n\nBut even if impeachment is currently on hold, a criminal indictment could theoretically lead to severe financial penalties or even imprisonment – something no president has ever faced.\n\nOn the hot-button question of whether a president can be indicted while in office – a matter on which constitutional scholars disagree – Pelosi said on NBC that she doesn't consider Trump immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nWhen reminded that internal Justice Department memos advise against the idea of prosecuting a sitting president, Pelosi said I do not think that that is conclusive. She later added, I think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.\n\nNadler went a step further when he told CNN's Jake Tapper in early December, I disagree with the Office of Special Counsel and the Department of Justice. There is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits the President from being indicted. Nobody, not the President, not anybody else, can be above the law. There's no reason to think that the President should not be indicted.\n\nWhether an indictment would guarantee impeachment, however, is another story. Nadler said, There are several things you have to look at. One, were there impeachable offenses committed, how many, etcetera. And secondly, how important were they? Do they rise to the gravity where you should undertake an impeachment?\n\nRegardless of whether the House initiates impeachment proceedings, Pelosi now has a great deal of power to make Trump's life miserable – both legally and politically – as the leader of a Democratic-led House with the power to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and dig into Trump's tax records. And she knows it.\n\nBefore her colleagues even voted to make her the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi let President Trump know that his days of dominating the national political agenda with bluff, bluster and bullsh** have come to an end.\n\nWhen asked whether she thought Trump deals with her differently because she's a woman, she said, I have no idea. We'll see how he will deal with the speaker of the House. … I hope he recognizes that a new day has dawned in America.\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump has grasped the full meaning of the new environment in Washington. For the past two years, as special prosecutor Robert Mueller has racked up indictments, convictions and guilty pleas from Trump associates, the President has defended himself with a key assist from Republican members of Congress.\n\nSeveral of the more outspoken members – whom Trump calls his warriors – have acted as political bodyguards by publicly attacking Mueller, calling for criminal prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey and appearing on right-wing media outlets to argue Trump's case.\n\nWhat a difference an election makes.\n\nFor the moment, talk of these grave legal matters is still hypothetical. We still haven't seen Mueller's findings and it will take a considerable amount of time for Pelosi, Nadler and other Democratic leaders to hire staff, hold hearings and begin playing catch-up on investigations that began years ago.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd a decision about whether to indict Trump is one that's up to the Department of Justice, which has a long-standing view that presidents are immune to criminal prosecution during their terms in office.\n\nBut the talk from Pelosi and Nadler about being open to the idea of indictment is a warning to the White House: The days of Congress defending the Trump administration at every turn have ended. And new political and legal problems for the President could just be beginning.

Aired 11a-12p ET\n\nAired December 15, 2018 - 11:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[11:00:44] ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. I'm Alex Marquardt, in for Fredricka Whitfield this Saturday. Thanks for joining us.\n\n\n\nWe are following a number of breaking stories this morning.\n\n\n\nFirst, the Trump administration losing yet another cabinet member. Just moments ago, the President announced on Twitter that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has resigned and will leave the administration at the end of the year. Zinke departs amid growing scrutiny over a number of ethics investigations during his time heading up the Interior Department. We will have much more on Zinke's resignation in a few moments.\n\n\n\nBut right now we move on to our other breaking story of the morning -- the future of health care for millions of Americans is once again up in the air.\n\n\n\nA federal judge in Texas striking down Obamacare, a controversial ruling that is setting the scene for a major legal battle ahead. This could once again leave the fate of President Obama's landmark health care law in the hands of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nNow the Texas judge's decision centers round the individual coverage mandate which requires all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress effectively eliminated that penalty as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. Now the judge is saying that mandate is unconstitutional. So the entire law, he says, is invalid.\n\n\n\nMany states in reaction are vowing to fight back and appeal that calling the ruling an assault while President Trump who campaigned vociferously against Obamacare is taking a victory lap on Twitter touting that new ruling.\n\n\n\nSo for more, we are joined by our Supreme Court reporter, Ariane de Vogue.\n\n\n\nAriane -- break this down for us. Obamacare, signing up for that ends at midnight. Millions have signed up for Obamacare for 2019. But this really will not affect -- will not immediately affect them? ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORT: Right, it won't. But this\n\n\n\nis a really broad ruling. This judge said not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional. He said the entire law must go.\n\n\n\nNow it's just one judge right, Reed O'Connor --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: It can be appealed on this. But boy, it sends into doubt the future of a lot of people thinking about health care. He said it can remain in effect pending appeal.\n\n\n\nBut let me walk you through just a bit the history of it --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Yes.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: -- so we understand how we got to today. Remember back in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Remember it was Chief Justice John Roberts, he said it was ok under the taxing power.\n\n\n\nFlash forward to 2017, Congress acts to get rid of the tax penalty. So this judge last night says, look, you got rid of the tax penalty. That's the legal underpinning of this Supreme Court opinion. So now, not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional, but everything else must fall. That is a huge win for critics of Obamacare.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And as you and I were discussing right before the show this goes well beyond what the Trump administration had even wanted.\n\n\n\nSo game this out for us. It will go through an appeals process but it could make its way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court has now shifted dramatically since the last ruling. So how does this all play out?\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Well, first of all, remember, the Trump administration they've declined to defend this law. So California and a group of other states, they stepped in and last night they said we are going to the Fifth Circuit. That's a very conservative federal appeals court in Texas.\n\n\n\nSo the Fifth Circuit will look at it. And if it upholds exactly what O'Connor did then this thing will shoot right to the Supreme Court because that's so broad. The Fifth Circuit could scale back a little bit and so maybe it wouldn't go to the court. But the court likes to hear things when they are big. national laws like this.\n\n\n\nWe do have this new, solidified, conservative majority but we also might have a concern about what is called severability, really kind of jibes by knocking down one provision, take the whole thing. That might be at issue at the court, too. So they will have to look at it if it gets to them.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: A lot of moving parts. But the important part to remember is nothing changes immediately --\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: -- but it is once again in jeopardy.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Yes.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So a lot of drama ahead probably.\n\n\n\nAriane de Vogue -- thanks so much for joining us and explaining that.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Thank you.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Well, the Affordable Care Act was, as we mentioned, one President Obama's biggest achievement while in office. This latest ruling threatens to wipe away the protection for people with pre-existing conditions, as you just heard from Ariane\n\n\n\n[11:04:59] That is a major staple of the law which was widely featured in the 2018 midterm campaign on both sides among Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\n\nSo joining me now is one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan -- thanks so much for joining us this morning.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, what is your reaction to this ruling out of Texas?\n\n\n\nJONATHAN GRUBER, ARCHITECT OF OBAMACARE: Well, I think it's really disappointing. I mean essentially a perversion of representative democracy.\n\n\n\nRepublicans controlled the Congress. They had a chance to strike down Obamacare. They said no, we are going to leave Obamacare and strike down the tax penalty. So they have literally said it is severable. Republicans have spoken. They said it's severable.\n\n\n\nYet, this judge is saying, no, I don't believe what the representative democracy delivered. I'm going to declare it unseverable.\n\n\n\nSo that's why legal experts, even legal experts who were opposed to the Affordable Care Act in previous cases are saying this is just ridiculous.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And the judge did say that because the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the whole law is as well. That mandate as we know is what they called as central and inseverable, as you were just discussing, from the remainder of Obamacare. So do you agree?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: Well look, I think when the law passed we all thought the mandate was a very important part of the law. We have now basically been proven that it's important but not as important as we thought because look, we now have experience of the law without it, they removed the mandate. And we are seeing it weakens the law, it raises premiums, but the law still remains quite strong, albeit not as strong as it would have been.\n\n\n\nSo we have seen empirically that the law -- that it is severable. The law still works without it. Congress in its wisdom has declared that it's severable, has said, look, we're going to keep the law but remove the mandate penalty.\n\n\n\nSo really there is just no basis for a judge in Texas to just say despite what the body that represents the American people have said, I'm going to decide this is not severable. There's just no reason to do it.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Are you confident in the appeals process that this won't go any farther?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: No, I'm not confident. Previous cases on the Affordable Care Act have all been clearly, by an objective standard, easy wins for the Affordable Care Act, and yet they've all passed by the skin of their teeth.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court clearly does not represent the constitutional expertise of the broad Senate constitutional experts, who for example in 2012 by about an 80 percent to 90 percent margin said the mandate was constitutional. Yet the Supreme Court found it wasn't.\n\n\n\nSo I'm nervous. What's fortunate is the Supreme Court I think does care about the opinion of the American people. The American people have spoken. They believe that protecting people with pre-existing conditions against insurance market discrimination is a key contribution of this law. And indeed it is.\n\n\n\nAnd I think hopefully the Supreme Court will see that that's something that matters to people. And that because of some obscure severability clause --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nGRUBER: -- Or lack of severability --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nGRUBER: -- they will not go against the will of the Congress.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: You say you are nervous. At the same time you say that the Supreme Court listens to the will of the American people. But now we have a Supreme Court that has two new conservative justices in Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on it. So if this makes its way to the Supreme Court, do you have any sense of how you think they might rule or how the whole court would rule?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: I honestly don't. I just hope that they will look and realize that even without the individual mandate, we are talking about a law that provided insurance to 17 million people, and for the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, it's saying don't worry, if you lose health insurance you can go buy it on the exchange.\n\n\n\nIf this law goes away, we return to a day where people who are sick can't get health insurance, which defeats the whole purpose of the product.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Jonathan Gruber -- thanks so much for joining us this morning. GRUBER: You bet. >\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Joining me now is NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell, and assistant editor at the Washington Post and CNN political commentator David Swerdlick.\n\n\n\nDavid -- let's start with you. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions was a focal point of the midterm campaigns and did help Democrats take back the House. What do you think are the political consequences of this ruling?\n\n\n\nDAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: So, good morning -- Alex.\n\n\n\nI think the political consequences are that Republicans have now basically done the equivalent of playing Jenga. They pulled the bottom block out of something hoping it will collapse. It's not going to go away yet because as your previous guest has said it's going to have to go up to the Supreme Court probably to resolve this.\n\n\n\nBut if the Affordable Care Act eventually does fall apart, then you have a divided Congress that's not going to be able to agree on how to proceed with health care and that will leave millions of Americans who depended on the Affordable Care Act sort of in the lurch.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are moving left toward Medicare for all. Republicans have been unable to pass their plans, which are a version of, you know, market-based health care where states can choose what kind of plans they have. The two sides are far apart.\n\n\n\n[11:10:02] I don't think Democrats in the immediate future are going to be able to deliver on this because they don't have the Senate. And I think Republicans are going to have to answer in the coming months why they want to take this apart if they don't have a plan in place that can replace it that's clearly better.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- picking up on that, the soon-to-be House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi has slammed this ruling. Is there anything that she can do?\n\n\n\nKELSEY SNELL, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, NPR: Well, she is very capable for bringing up bills to vote on her Congress at this point so that the House could potentially take a vote and uphold portions of the law or even bring back the penalty for the individual mandate that was zeroed out by Republicans last year.\n\n\n\nBut I think it's very important that this is a big political issue for Pelosi. She firmly believes and has strong evidence for the fact that Republicans lost many, many congressional races in states like New Jersey and in Florida and California based on messaging on the Affordable Care Act because voters really started to like this law.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: They may not like it being branded as Obamacare but they really do like the protections that are in the law.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nDavid -- a point that I have been trying to get at with some of our guests is --\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: -- if we play this -- if we game this out and it gets to the Supreme Court and now you have the Supreme Court that is firmly conservative with the nominations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- how does that impact things? Because the Chief Justice John Roberts was the key vote, the key voice last time and now you've got solid five to four conservative majority. So how is that going to affect things?\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: Yes. No -- I think we're going to -- it's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean this Texas federal judge has a reasonable if not ultimately winning point that if the Supreme Court in 2012, you know, premised its upholding of the Affordable Care Act on the idea that this was part of Congress's taxing power but now the law does not include the penalty or the tax then that premise is gone.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the idea I think Ariane was talking about the severability problem earlier in your program -- the problem is does this make the entire law fail. And you know, I can't get into the minds of the Supreme Court justices, including Justice Roberts who is a conservative Bush appointee who's the chief justice, but who I think in 2012 clearly saw what would happen if the Supreme Court intervened to essentially undo the will of Congress. So I have to go with wait and see right now -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Wait and see it is.\n\n\n\nAll right. Well, he have a lot more to discuss. David and Kelsey -- please stay with us.\n\n\n\nWe're going to take a quick break.\n\n\n\nStill ahead, turmoil inside the White House. Just after President Trump names Mick Mulvaney as his acting chief of staff, his Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke steps down amid several ethics investigations.\n\n\n\nWe will be live from the White House, next.\n\n\n\n[11:12:45] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: President Trump has lost yet another cabinet member after naming an acting chief of staff. In a tweet this morning the President announcing the resignation of his embattled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Trump tweeting that Zinke is stepping down and will leave his administration at the end of the year. Zinke was under growing pressure over a number of ethics enquiries.\n\n\n\nThe President has also announced on Twitter that Mick Mulvaney will become the acting chief of staff at the end of the year. Mulvaney will also somehow continue in his job as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the OMB.\n\n\n\nSo for more let's bring in CNN's Sarah Westwood at the White House. Sarah -- Zinke was in trouble because of all these investigations but his departure didn't seem imminent, did it? Why did all this happen today?\n\n\n\nSARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Alex -- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is someone whose fate within the administration had been was unclear for several months now given some of the headlines that he's generated in the White House responding to those by saying they'd look into the problems facing Zinke but the timing of his departure comes amid a massive staff shake-up across the West Wing in the cabinet.\n\n\n\nNow Zinke had been embattled for weeks now. He was facing a number of probes from the Department of Interiors inspector general over allegations that he used his post to enrich himself, that he perhaps had a relationship with the chairman of Haliburton that was under investigation. His dealing in a casino project in Connecticut also being looked at by the agency's inspector general. Abuse potentially of agency resources.\n\n\n\nAnd CNN reported in October, that the Department of Justice was looking into some of the Zinke's conduct after the inspector general referred some of its work to the Justice Department.\n\n\n\nNow, Zinke's departure does perhaps prevent some headaches for this White House because now he won't really be in a position to be dragged before Congress. Democrats had been vowing to bring him in to ask him questions about some of these scandals -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Sarah -- switching over to Mulvaney for a second, he has been named acting chief of staff, emphasis on the acting. And somehow he is going to do that incredibly difficult and time-consuming job while also holding on to his job as the head of OMB?\n\n\n\nWESTWOOD: That's right. That's what this administration says, although the day-to-day work will be taken over by a deputy. It won't even be the first time Mulvaney is pulling double duty. He also took over as head of the CFPB earlier in the Trump president -- something that was a little controversial at the time.\n\n\n\nBut the President is accepting Mulvaney in this position, in an acting capacity is a remarkable shift from just a couple of weeks ago when the President ultimately wasn't able to come to an agreement with his first choice for the position, Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, because Ayers wanted to hold it on a temporary basis as well. But the President is suddenly ok with having an acting chief of staff to fill this vacancy -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Sarah Westwood at the White House. Thanks for breaking that all down.\n\n\n\nSo back with me to discuss more are David Swerdlick and Kelsey Snell.\n\n\n\nKelsey -- Sarah was just hitting on the point that I wanted to start with you, the fact that the first choice for chief of staff, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President's Pence's chief of staff. [11:20:05] The reason those talks broke down is because he wanted the acting title and Trump didn't. So why do you think he's accepted it with Mulvaney? Is it just to sort of quash any perception that no one wants the job?\n\n\n\nSNELL: It may just be that because, as you know, there have been other candidates who have said no or who have been turned down since Ayers decided that this wasn't the job for him. Like Mark Meadows --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- the Freedom Caucus chairman. And you know, it may also be to put a little bit of ease with people in Congress because Mulvaney has an odd relationship with folks up there, particularly with Democrats.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Congressman for six years.\n\n\n\nSNELL: He was. And there are Democrats who are already out there saying that Trump is picking Mulvaney because he wants to have a bigger shutdown fight and that's something that Mulvaney has always been a kind of a critic of government spending and he was one of the Republicans who always fought to keep spending limited. So it's entirely possible that he is trying to calm the waters.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And he's a true partisan and true supporter of the President so it's unlikely that he's going to be that middle ground, that moderating diplomat with Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nSNELL: That is not the expectation that people have for the type of chief of staff that we would see from Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: David, to you -- like many Republicans the President's new acting chief of staff has not had kind words for the President in the past, specifically before the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nAnd overnight there's new video that we found of Mulvaney before election Day and in it Mulvaney actually explains why he is reluctantly supporting Trump. Let's take a quick listen to that and we'll talk on the other side.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMICK MULVANEY, OMB DIRECTOR: Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump. I'm doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that he's a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: He's a terrible human being. I wonder if the President has actually seen that piece of video. Assuming he does at some point, do you think that Mulvaney will actually become the permanent chief of staff?\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: No idea. But -- and I haven't seen that video yet -- Alex. But I have two reactions to it. One is that even though it's a little more blunt than most would put it, in some ways I think that is an articulation of the bargain that a lot of Republicans in Congress and a lot of Republican voters made with President Trump in 2016.\n\n\n\nThat they didn't think he was great on issues of personal character or comportment but they preferred him to Secretary Clinton. They liked his agenda and they wanted a Republican in the White House with a Republican Congress so they made that deal and they went with them and now here they are.\n\n\n\nAnd now here Congressman Mulvaney or rather Director Mulvaney is now. He's a loyal Trump soldier now, served as OMB director, CFPB as Sarah just reported.\n\n\n\nHe's got the right resume but I agree with what Kelsey said to you a minute ago. The fact that you have to take him on an interim basis just shows how much people don't want this job.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Kelsey -- when you hear -- to David's point -- that people don't want this job and yet you see the President saying that many people wanted this job, which is true? Are people actually lining up to try to be the chief of staff in this White House at this time?\n\n\n\nSNELL: Not as far as we have seen. There are some people who enjoyed having their names out there or were, you know, were not discouraging that conversation --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- about their candidacy. We haven't seen a lot of people come forward. It would be a very difficult job. We have seen that through the number of people who have gone through it already.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Very difficult because we have the Democrats coming in to taking over the House, and we're at possibly the end of the Mueller investigation. So this is a White House that's under fire.\n\n\n\nSNELL: Yes, this is a time when things are about to get a little bit stickier.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. David, back to you -- how could Mulvaney help Trump navigate this Russia investigation. We've seen a number of events this week with regards to Michael Flynn and Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. So there is a sense that Robert Mueller might be wrapping things up in the early months of next year. How do you think Mulvaney is going to help with that?\n\n\n\nSWEDLICK: You know, I think at a minimum, he knows Congress as a former member of Congress so he can at least help the President with the ins and outs of the committee process even if he, as Kelsey said earlier, is not on the best of terms with all the Democrats in Congress. That's the book on Mulvaney.\n\n\n\nHe has a fresh start here, right. With some bad blood brewing between the President and General Kelly. The President didn't have confidence in Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff. So at a minimum, he's able to turn the page and say ok, where do we go from here, fresh start?\n\n\n\nBut the President is looking at the Mueller investigation coming to a conclusion perhaps sometime in the next few months. The President is looking at a situation where he's already done a tax cut into a full employment environment. So if there's a recession, let's say, what stimulative things can he approach Congress with at this point? It is going to be a tough sled for any chief of staff for any White House in this next Congress, I think.\n\n\n\n[11:24:54] MARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- with Mulvaney coming in as acting, that is kind of plugging one hole in the boat but at the same time, you've got John Kelly widely respected, leaving. You now have Ryan Zinke leaving under this cloud of ethics investigations. That, of course, follows Scott Pruitt and Tom Price.\n\n\n\nI mean how battered does the White House become with these two high- profile departures after this long string of other departures?\n\n\n\nSNELL: Well, this is not necessarily something that's going to calm critics down. It's also not a situation that makes it any easier on the Senate because they are going to have to confirm replacements for Zinke --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- and for another attorney general.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: This has been very difficult for them to get through controversial nominees. We've seen a lot of nominees get through on very narrow votes. We've seen the Vice President have to break more ties his than several of his predecessors combined.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: So this is creating a serious backlog and a serious issue for the White House in the very beginning of next year.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So much to discuss, we could spend hours on it but unfortunately we have to go.\n\n\n\nKelsey, David Swerdlick in New York -- thank you so much.\n\n\n\nComing up, interview showdown. Sources telling CNN that the special counsel's team continues to be interested in sitting down with the President, but will the President give in?\n\n\n\n[11:26:03] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: The special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation still wants a face-to-face meeting with President Trump, but the President's lawyers are saying a sit-down interview is not going to happen. The development follows a new slam by Robert Mueller involving General Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor. The special counsel is dismissing suggestions by Flynn's lawyers that\n\n\n\nhe lied to the FBI because he was set up. The memo caps a head- spinning week of revelations that shows the legal walls are closing in on Trump and the people around him.\n\n\n\nThese are the current active investigations in and around Trump's orbit. Take a look at this. The Trump campaign, the Trump transition team, the Trump inaugural committee, the Trump Foundation, and the Trump Organization and, of course, the Trump administration itself.\n\n\n\nCNN's Erica Orden is following all of this. Erica -- let's start with Michael Flynn. This was a fascinating moment because both sides, the Flynn legal team and the Mueller legal team had said that Michael Flynn deserves no jail time because of his extensive cooperation. Now we see the Mueller coming out swinging saying that Michael Flynn's version of the facts is untrue and he should have known that lying to federal investigators is against the law.\n\n\n\nERICA ORDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. So, as you pointed out, one of the important things to keep in mind is that both sides have asked for little to no prison time for Michael Flynn. However the prosecutors had been pushing back against some of Flynn's claims.\n\n\n\nAnd one effect that all of this may have in terms of the sentencing is that the judge has brought up in his court filings and, you know, you've seen the judge order prosecutors and lawyers and from the special counsel's office to file additional material in response to some of those claims.\n\n\n\nSo what you may see during sentencing is the judge seek to elicit more information on some of these issues from both sides -- from Flynn's attorneys and from the special counsel team.\n\n\n\nAnd you may see the judge enquire with Flynn and with his attorneys about why Flynn is bringing up some of these -- some of these claims right now just before -- just prior to his sentencing.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So how do you think that actually plays into the sentencing which is on Tuesday? Flynn could face up to six months. I understand his legal team has asked for probation. They've offered 200 hours of community service. But given that Flynn has now clearly irked the Mueller folks, does that make it more likely that he could face some prison time?\n\n\n\nORDEN: He does seem to have irked them but given again that both sides have asked for little to no prison time, and that the Mueller team has gone into detail about -- although some of it has been redacted in court filings -- has gone into detail about Flynn's level of cooperation and his willingness to assist the special counsel investigation. It doesn't seem likely that these kinds of claims will substantively change the ultimate sentence for him.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And of course, the major question, what did Michael Flynn actually tell the prosecutors in more than 62 hours of conversations about President Trump.\n\n\n\nEric Orden -- thanks so much for breaking that down for us.\n\n\n\nORDEN: Thanks .\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So for more, let's bring in Elie Honig who is a former federal prosecutor and state prosecutor.\n\n\n\nMueller says that this won't change his recommendation, that Flynn will receive no jail time. So Elie -- what does this tell us about Mueller's process and what were Flynn's lawyers doing calling out the FBI in the first place in that sentencing memo?\n\n\n\nELIE HONIG, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes. I do not think this will change Mueller's recommendation of no jail time. I think -- but I do think Flynn's lawyers overstepped here. They went down a road that they didn't need to.\n\n\n\nTheir guy was perfectly situated to get a no jail time sentence.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right. That was the defense recommendation. That was Mueller's recommendation. It was a done deal.\n\n\n\nI don't know why they poked this bear. They did not need to. And the arguments they're making are silly. They are not correct as a matter of law. They're not correct as a matter of common sense.\n\n\n\nThe FBI has no obligation to tell someone in this situation that they ought to get a lawyer because the interrogation was not in FBI custody. So that's different from like a Miranda setting. The FBI did not have to warn Michael Flynn, hey if you lie to us, that's a crime.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way of all people who should know that it should be the incoming national security adviser. So I don't know why the lawyers went down this path. I don't see any benefit to it for Flynn.\n\n\n\n[11:35:01] Now the judge has shown some interest, as you said before -- Alex. And I don't -- that could mean either thing. That could meant the judge is thinking about throwing the case out. I don't think that's likely. It could mean that the judge on the opposite side is ticked off and think that Flynn has not truly accepted responsibility now which could result in a slightly higher sentence.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right. Let's just remind our viewers what happened is that Flynn was questioned by FBI agents, that those FBI agents did not tell him explicitly that lying to the FBI is illegal.\n\n\n\nHONIG: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And the Mueller's team response was someone who spent this much time heading up an intelligence agency in the military at this highest level of U.S. government should know that.\n\n\n\nSo Elie -- Flynn was one of the first people in Trump's inner circle to cooperate extensively as both his team and the Mueller have said at the highest level. He was cooperating. He was part of the campaign. He's part of the transition. He's part of the administration. Does it looks like this is a test case for other potential cooperators?\n\n\n\nHONIG: It could be. Look, I always approach cooperators from the point of view that the other potential cooperators are watching. And that's why I think Mueller has been smart.\n\n\n\nThe cooperators who have come through, who've been honest, who've been truthful, who've given him good information he's gone to bat for. Michael Flynn being one of them.\n\n\n\nThe cooperators who have messed around and played games and stretched the truth he's thrown out. Papadopoulos, right, Mueller put in a very negative sentencing memo on Papadopoulos. And of course, Paul Manafort who Mueller threw out of the prop room altogether. And now Manafort is looking at an extremely high sentence.\n\n\n\nSo I think there is important messages to be sent which is if you cooperate and you do it right and you do it fully and you do it truthfully you will get a benefit. But if you come in here and play games it's going to back fire.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And Elie, now this news that the special counsel says he still wants to interview President Trump on the Russia investigation. Of course, his lawyers have pushed back and say they are opposed. They don't want to do that.\n\n\n\nHere is what President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said about the President's truthfulness. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The special counsel did say that you were doing your best to tell the truth about everything related to their investigation, everything related to Russia. Do you think President Trump is telling the truth about that?\n\n\n\nMICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: No.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So very simply, is it in President Trump's interest to sit down with Robert Mueller?\n\n\n\nHONIG: No, if I was representing the President I would fight that at all costs. But there's two ways this can go. They can agree to terms of an interview between Mueller and Trump's team. I don't think that will happen because I don't believe Trump lawyers are willing to walk him into a room with Mueller and let him answer questions.\n\n\n\nAnd if not then the ball moves over to Mueller's court, is he going to issue a subpoena? And if he does, we're going to end up in the courts and we're going to have I think a very close contest up to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And if he issues a subpoena, of course, that is to be approved by Mueller's bosses -- Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general Matt Whitaker until there's actually a new attorney general. So it's unclear whether that subpoena would actually come into effect.\n\n\n\nBut Elie -- the last question to you. The Trump entities as we highlighted at the top there are under investigation across the board. It does feel like to some extent that the walls are closing in on the President. What does it mean for Trump legally, personally himself? Should he be scared at this moment more so than in the past?\n\n\n\nHONIG: He should. He's got exposure on various levels. Let's start with I DO think it's unlikely that the Department of Justice indicts the sitting president. There is existing DOJ guidance saying that DOJ will not do that.\n\n\n\nThat said there are plenty of people very close to the President, including potentially relatives of his who could be in criminal legal jeopardy. And he's going to have all manner of civil problems. The Trump Org is going to have to deal with all sort of civil lawsuits as well. So yes, I wouldn't be resting easy by any means.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Elie Honig, always appreciate your expertise.\n\n\n\nHONIG: Thanks -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Thanks for joining us. >\n\n\n\nAll right. Up next, we're going to hear from the family of a 7-year- old migrant girl who died in U.S. custody. And what U.S. officials are saying about how exactly this tragedy happened.\n\n\n\n[11:38:59] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: A protest is planned this afternoon in El Paso, Texas after a 7-year-old migrant girl from Guatemala died in U.S. custody. She was detained with her father in a remote part of New Mexico on December 6th. Officials say she was medically cleared to be taken to a detention facility with the rest of her group which included another 50 unaccompanied children.\n\n\n\nThe next day she got seriously ill and was airlifted to a hospital where she went into cardiac arrest and died a short time later. An autopsy is being performed, but an initial hospital report says that the girl died of septic shock.\n\n\n\nFor more let's bring in CNN's Ed Lavandera who is in El Paso. Ed -- what are we now hearing from the girl's family?\n\n\n\nED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they are simply devastated. We've been able to reach the family in Guatemala, the extended family and mother and grandfather who spoke about how devastated and horrified they are by the news of what has happened to this young girl.\n\n\n\nThe grandfather of Jacqueline spoke with us -- our CNN colleagues from CNN Espanol who were down in Guatemala speaking with them. And this is what they had to share. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDOMINGO CAAL, GRANDFATHER OF GIRL WHO DIED IN U.S. CUSTODY: I'm not going to speak that much because I can barely take it. It's difficult for us. This happened because we are very much in need. The girl would jump in happiness that she would get to go to the United States, very happy and content. But she didn't know. For us it's very difficult.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n[11:45:02] LAVANDERA: The family talked about how it was desperation that drove them to make that long journey. And of course, there has been a great deal of debate about the very trek that they made.\n\n\n\nTrump administration officials have been very critical of the father in particular for, quote, choosing to cross illegally into the United States. That has been pushed back on very intensely from immigrant rights activist, especially here in El Paso who say it's the Trump administration's policies and immigration stance that is driving many of these people to cross into the country illegally.\n\n\n\nThis father and daughter were part of a large group of migrants who had crossed into a border checkpoint in the far remote areas of western New Mexico. This was hundreds of miles from many things where they would have been able to provide quick medical care in this situation.\n\n\n\nSo a great deal of debate and a lot of finger-pointing as to how all of this could have happened -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: One of the disturbing things, Ed, in this whole story is that this happened more than a week ago so why did it take so long for this to come to light?\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: That's a big question, you know. And there has been a number of critics who really kind of fault the transparency or the lack of transparency on the part of the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nEl Paso Congressman Beto O'Rourke basically faulted the Department of Homeland Security for not being transparent enough. The leader of the Customs and Border Protection testified before Congress on Tuesday several days after this young girl had passed away and made no mention of this particular case.\n\n\n\nSo there is a great number of criticism of the administration for essentially having to count on a news report to break thins story and bring it to light.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Ed Lavandera in El Paso, Texas -- thanks so much.\n\n\n\nNow, remember the deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland Florida back in February? The panel investigating the attacks now wants a new law allowing teachers to carry guns. Details and reactions coming up next. [11:47:09] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: This week we saw a new controversial push to put guns in classrooms to try to avoid tragedies like the Parkland massacre. It's been ten months since 17 people, 14 of them children, were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\n\nNow the school safety committee formed after that shooting has voted to recommend a state law be passed that allows teachers to be armed with guns. Those teachers would have to volunteer and undergo a background check.\n\n\n\nNow, this comes as a new report from the CDC shows that nearly 40,000 people were killed by guns last year. That's the highest number since at least 1979 when firearm deaths were first recorded -- 40,000.\n\n\n\nJoining me now is CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval. Polo -- what can you tell us about this recommendation to arm teachers?\n\n\n\nPOLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, first off, Alex -- that commission is certainly still remembering those 17 people whose lives were cut short, their families continue to grieve today and they likely will the rest of their lives.\n\n\n\nBut for the last eight months, members of the commission that was appointed to try to come up with a solution has been meeting trying to figure out a way of preventing something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nAnd what's interesting here is that is a majority of them, about 14 of the 15 members of that panel all came to an agreement in the last few days. And all of them believe that perhaps the solution is to allow more teachers to carry weapons in the classroom.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBOB GUALTIERI, PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF: Such as participating on the threat assessment teams.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission is recommending teachers be allowed to carry guns on school campuses. The controversial proposal part of a 407-page preliminary report. It addresses failures by Broward County law enforcement during the massacre as well as recommendations on how to counter future school violence.\n\n\n\nChairing the commission, Pinellas County sheriff Bob Gualtieri who supports the measure.\n\n\n\nGUALTIERI: We have to give people a fighting chance so we've got to give them an opportunity to protect themselves in my view. We don't have enough to put cops in every school or multiple cops in every school and we're not maximizing the use of the guardian program. and one person, one good guy with a gun on every campus is not adequate.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: The proposal has yet to go before the governor or state lawmakers. If approved, teachers who want to carry would be required to go through training and background checks before arming themselves.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's the issue -- districts and schools need to act now.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They need to act now. They need to act now.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: Currently only some teachers and school staff are allowed to carry firearms. Since the Parkland shooting, at least 14 other states have introduced similar measures. The changes have been met with some support in states where rural communities lack funding and resources to respond to a school shooter.\n\n\n\nMax Schachter is the only person on the advisory commission opposing the arming of Florida teachers.\n\n\n\nMAX SCHACHTER, PARENT: I don't think teachers should be carrying guns. I think they have enough on their plate. I think their priority is teaching. It just creates a lot of host of problems.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: With the recommendation still tentative, more debate is likely about how to face a school's worst nightmare.\n\n\n\nGUALTIERI: What we got right now isn't working. So we need to do something differently.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\n[11:54:54] SANDOVAL: And though this measure has large support within that public safety commission, there is a plenty of opposition outside of it, particularly some of these pro-gun reform groups, including Every Town for Gun Safety, a volunteer with that group strongly condemning it.\n\n\n\nAlex -- I want to read you a small portion of the statement that he published the week following the release of this draft report. Gay Valemont (ph) a volunteer with this group, writing There is no evidence that arming teachers makes kids safer. He went on to write Our children deserve real solutions to keep them safe from gun violence, like a criminal background check on every gun sale.\n\n\n\nSo even though this is still a draft report, still has to go to the governor, Alex, still also has to go to legislators, this obviously is still making for quite a bit of debate there in Florida to try to keep something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And of course this is the kind of policy that the President has trumpeted numerous times --\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: -- after this horrific massacres that we've seen.\n\n\n\nPolo Sandoval, thanks so much for that report. All right. Still ahead, a federal judge has struck down the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare marking a win for President Trump but potentially putting the health care of millions of Americans in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n[11:55:59] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
A Message of Discontent from Wisconsin (TIME, April 17, 1972) -- Like some metaphysical lottery, with hazards of sudden political death or prizes of resurrection, the American primary system ramshackled through Wisconsin last week to the end of its first phase -- and a pause before the next series, starting April 25, in such crucial industrial states as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. It was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for Humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary. -- Edmund Muskie, limping into fourth place with only 10% of the vote, was the real loser. Once regarded as the front runner, Muskie's defeats in Florida and Wisconsin have deflated his trust and confidence campaign. In an almost breathtaking descent, Muskie in a matter of weeks has become merely another contender. At least one candidate did not survive Wisconsin at all. New York Mayor John Lindsay, with a dismal 7% showing on top of his 7% in Florida, declared himself out of the race. A Muskie aide who had earlier called Lindsay the wild card in this campaign remarked last week: He turned out to be a deuce. Washington Senator Henry Jackson, who won 8% in Wisconsin, remained the darkest of horses, suffering from a massive problem of nonrecognition; on primary day last week, his workers were still distributing a leaflet headlined WHO IS SENATOR JACKSON? On the Republican ballot, Richard Nixon was opposed by Ohio's conservative Congressman John Ashbrook, who got 1% of the vote. California's liberal Republican Congressman Paul McCloskey, who had already withdrawn from the race, also got 1%. The President scored 97%. The Wisconsin campaign was a furious montage of political styles. With mod glasses and carefully darkened hair, 61-year-old Humphrey bounced through 19-hour days. We can sleep next year, he told his workers. Everywhere, except among college students, he found deep affection, but the warmth did not always convert to votes. At times, his campaign savored of last hurrah. In Milwaukee, a woman wearing a McGovern button told H.H.H.: We love you. But you're voting for McGovern, replied Humphrey. Said the woman: Yes, but we love Hubert Humphrey. George Wallace planned only a minimal campaign in Wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. But when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in Milwaukee on March 23, Wallace abruptly changed his schedule. Suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. Wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. He repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. He complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: I dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. I'm just a little dog from Alabama. McGovern's television commercials confirmed the Wallace complaint. If you want lower property taxes, you want George McGovern, said one. It's as simple as that. But McGovern emphasized direct campaigning. In oblique reference to Lindsay's stylish and futile TV campaigns in Florida and Wisconsin, one McGovern press release claimed: The day of the media candidate is over. People have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. Top-Heavy. Despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, Muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. His organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. He failed to define a constituency. The overall message from Wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. Most specifically, Wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that McGovern and Wallace hit the hardest. In a study of TIME, the attitude research firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced Wisconsin voters were economic. The sixth was the Vietnam War, and McGovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. According to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the Administration's wage and price policies are not working. Fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. McGovern and Humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. They shared the rewards: well over half of McGovern's voters and almost two-thirds of Wallace's assailed tax loopholes. The issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, Republicans as well as Democrats. The Yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for McGovern among the Wallace voters -- support rooted in McGovern's broad anti-Establishment campaign. It was not that Wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both McGovern and Wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate. Significantly, the survey found that voters still saw Centrist Humphrey as the Democrat with the best chance to be nominated and, if nominated, to beat Nixon. According to the TIME/Yankelovich survey, McGovern trailed both Wallace and Humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. More than any other, McGovern came through as someone you can trust. Improbably, he won the Fourth Congressional District, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of Milwaukee, with the largest concentration of Poles in the state. Muskie, who had emphasized his Polish ancestry, finished fourth. Cross-Overs. Wallace and McGovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the McGovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the Wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. McGovern fared well with young voters (47%); Wallace did poorly. The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. It's kind of a scramble now, Humphrey said last week. Coming out of Wisconsin, Muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2. McGovern, gaining 54 in Wisconsin, had a total of 89 1/2, trailed by Wallace with 75 and Humphrey with 19. With the delegate-rich primaries in Pennsylvania (182), Massachusetts (102), New York (278) and California (271) still to come, all the candidates are still far from the 1,509 needed for nomination in Miami Beach. For the moment, Wisconsin seemed to have reduced it to a three-man contest among Muskie, Humphrey and McGovern. Although McGovern now ranks as a heavyweight contender, he must still establish that Wisconsin was not a fluke in which the candidate was secondary to the issues. McGovern displayed surprising strength among labor's rank and file in Wisconsin, but his comparative radicalism and long anti-war record have earned him the hostility of many labor leaders as well as Democratic professionals. If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome. Scenarios. These primaries, said McGovern last week, are going to go on from state to state, from battle to battle. His most optimistic scenario now is to win Massachusetts, where his liberal following is strong, on April 25, then Nebraska on May 9, run well enough (meaning third behind Humphrey and Wallace) in Michigan on May 16 and then go on to take Oregon, California and New York. For Humphrey and Muskie, April 25 will be critical. That is the date of both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries. Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July. A deadlock would probably eliminate McGovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion. Humphrey might also be unacceptable: too much like 1968...a loser's image. That might leave Muskie as a reconciliation candidate. Or is it possible, as some politicians have already begun to fantasize, that stalemated delegates from all factions of the party will send up a cry from the floor: Kennedy! Kennedy! Success at Last for George I believe the people of this country are tired of the old rhetoric, the unmet promise, the image makers and the practitioners of the expedient. The people are not centrist or liberal or conservative. Rather, they seek a way out of the wilderness. So said Senator McGovern as he officially hit the campaign trail 15 long months ago -- and all but disappeared into the political wilderness. As the earliest declared candidate for the presidential nomination in recent memory, he had a plan: challenge Edmund Muskie before he built up an insurmountable lead, go all out to make a credible showing in the New Hampshire primary, and then, gathering momentum, overtake the field in Wisconsin. Back then, his strategy seemed dreamy, if not downright doomed. Few political leaders took his candidacy seriously, dismissing him as a self-appointed conscience of the party or a stalking horse for Ted Kennedy. The Margin. The professional polls had clearly underestimated George Stanley McGovern, 49, child of the plains, minister's son, college-debate champion, World War II bomber pilot, former history professor, father of five and, according to Robert Kennedy, the most decent man in the Senate. Decency and doggedness -- traits that served him well when he first ran for Congress in 1956, traveling the dusty side roads for one-to-one meetings in farmhouses and general stores. Taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. Recalls Journalist Harl Andersen, who covered the campaign for the Associated Press: George only builds a stone at a time. After a while, though, it begins to show up. In 1962 he moved on to the Senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization. Without the aggressiveness of Bobby Kennedy or the aloofness of Eugene McCarthy, McGovern has forged a coalition of followers from both camps. On one flank are such Kennedy men as Advisers John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy Press Secretaries Pierre Salinger and Frank Mankiewicz, Writers Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky. (His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. He's a classic Clark Kent, says Aide Ted Van Dyk. All calmness on the outside -- serene -- but when crisis strikes, it's into the phone booth. He has other useful traits as well. Accused at a University of Wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, McGovern did not turn peevish as Muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. Instead, McGovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, McGovern moved on to other matters. He has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. McGovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. He remains confident despite the many Democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. Meanwhile, stone by stone, George moves on. What Happened to Muskie? In just one month, Maine's Ed Muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for President. Before the plunge, much of the press (including TIME) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the Democratic Convention in July. Now he could easily turn out to be what President Nixon derisively termed him after the 1970 Congressional elections: the George Romney of the Democratic Party. What went wrong? No single reason, or incident, can be cited to explain Muskie's decline. There was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, Muskie strategists and Muskie himself. In the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. That status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the Democrat with the best chance to defeat Nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. Yet that impression of Muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. Muskie had looked cool and impressive as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his G.O.P. counterpart, Spiro Agnew. Yet few voters select a President primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and Muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. Muskie was now recognized by most Democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? No one could be sure. Euphoric. Nevertheless, Muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. He would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. Ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the President. The essence of that campaign would be to portray Nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible. By contrast, voters were urged to trust Muskie, the man of integrity. That strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. Muskie at his best is far more inspiring than Nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. Nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link Democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while Muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. Perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. To further the bandwagon psychology, the Muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: California Senator John Tunney, Ohio Governor John Gilligan, Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Iowa Senator Harold Hughes, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. This was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. Suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. Democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with Nixon. They were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. They were in a balky, grumpy mood. They wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. They were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like George McGovern and George Wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest. Moreover Muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of New Hampshire, ironically at the very time that Nixon in Peking was acting as the healer of international passions. This outburst was partly the result of Muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. Trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. Fed Up. Muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. In a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. In New Hampshire, the Muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. Muskie now concedes that entering the Florida primary was a mistake; once Wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. He relied heavily for support in Florida upon its Democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in Tallahassee and were of little help. Muskie came out of his Florida defeat in a new fighting mood. He tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. Yet the turnabout gave Muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. Muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult. He has come across as a fuzzy Establishment kind of politician in a year when voters seem in revolt, and has been unable to put his brand on any issue that can attract that fed-up, turned-off voter. If he cannot beat such lesser-known Democrats, how can he be seen as the man to beat Nixon? He's got to find the ways to tap the anger and frustration that people have about big government and big business, says Senator Tunney, one of his now-disillusioned supporters. I know Muskie favors reform of institutions, but he hasn't been able to convey that. There is perhaps one consolation in all of the Muskie miscalculations so far. If the voters are as unpredictable as they early primaries indicate, similar troubles could lie ahead for the other candidates. Muskie may be no more finished now than he was a shoo-in in January.

An HSA combines the best features of all the various tax-advantaged retirement accounts available. If used correctly, money goes in tax-free, grows tax-free, and comes out tax-free.\n\nSound too good to be true? Read on to find out how it can be done and how you might qualify for one.\n\nWho is eligible for an HSA?\n\nIn order to qualify for an HSA, you must have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). For 2017, your annual health insurance deductible must be at least $1,300 for single coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,550) or $2,600 for family coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $13,100).\n\nIn addition, you cannot be covered by another type of health insurance plan, be on Medicare, or be claimed as a dependent on someone's tax return.\n\nWhat is an HSA account?\n\nA health savings account is a triple-tax-advantaged account that allows individuals to save for current and future healthcare costs. You can open an HSA account through a bank, an insurance company, or another IRS-approved trustee.\n\nFor 2017, you can contribute $3,400 to an HSA if you have a high-deductible individual health insurance plan or $6,750 if you have a family plan. And individuals 55 or older can contribute an extra $1,000. Contributions are deductible from taxable income, the money grows tax-deferred, and the distributions are tax-free -- as long as they are used for qualified healthcare expenses. Individuals can also make a one-time transfer from an IRA to fund an HSA.\n\nAccording to the IRS, a high-deductible health insurance plan may cover some preventive care without a deductible. Otherwise, an individual can use the funds in an HSA to cover prescription drugs and other medical expenses. For a better understanding of what qualifies as a medical benefit, and for a list of examples of what is considered a qualified medical expense, see IRS Publication 502.\n\nFinally, if you withdraw funds from an HSA for non-medical expenses, you will owe income tax and pay a 20% penalty. But once you turn 65, an HSA mimics a traditional 401(k) or IRA: You can withdraw funds for any purpose, and you'll only owe income taxes.\n\nHow to use an HSA as part of your retirement strategy\n\nChoosing a health insurance plan for you and your family is a serious financial decision. Among other things, you must consider the health of you and your family, along with your available resources and ability to pay for medical care. If you're eligible for an HSA and can afford to pay for all or most of your increased out-of-pocket medical bills now, including meeting the higher deductible, then saving in an HSA for your retirement might make sense.\n\nAn HSA account is similar to other retirement accounts in that the account is portable and moves with you, the funds roll over from year to year, and you can invest the money in the account for the long term. Even if you use some of the funds during the year and are able to save only a portion of your yearly contribution, you can invest the balance, making this another opportunity to save for your retirement years.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nAccording to a recent study by Fidelity, a couple in retirement today may need $260,000 to cover healthcare costs -- that's in addition to other living expenses. As we plan for retirement, we must continually look for new vehicles to help us achieve our goals using the most effective and tax-efficient methods available to us. And saving in an HSA can be a smart option.

Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984 Walter Mondale throws down gauntlet in run against Reagan My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans: I accept your nomination. Behind us now is the most wide open race in political history. It was noisy - but our voices were heard. It was long - but our stamina was tested. It was hot - but the heat was passion, and not anger. It was a roller coaster - but it made me a better candidate, and it will make me a stronger president of the United States. I do not envy the drowsy harmony of the Republican Party. They squelch debate; we welcome it. They deny differences; we bridge them. The are uniform; we are united. They are a portrait of privilege; we are a mirror of America. Just look at us at here tonight: Black and white, Asian and Hispanic, Native and immigrant, young and old, urban and rural, male and female - from yuppie to lunchpail, from sea to shining sea. We're all here tonight in this convention speaking for America. And when we in this hall speak for America, it is America speaking. When we speak of family, the voice is Mario Cuomo's. When we speak of change, the words are Gary Hart's. When we speak of hope, the fire is Jesse Jackson's. When we speak of caring, the spirit is Ted Kennedy's. When we speak of patriotism, the strength is John Glenn's. When we speak of the future, the message is Geraldine Ferraro. And now we leave San Francisco - together. Future of America And over the next hundred days, in every word we say, and every life we touch, we will be fighting for the future of America. Joan and I are parents of three wonderful children who will live much of their lives in the twenty-first century. This election is a referendum on their future - and on ours. So tonight I'd like to speak to the young people of America - and to their parents and to their grandparents. I'm Walter Mondale. You may have heard of me - but you may not really know me. I grew up in the farm towns of southern Minnesota. My dad was a preacher, and my mom was a music teacher. We never had a dime. But we were rich in the values that were important; and I've carried those values with me ever since. They taught me to work hard; to stand on my own; to play by the rules; to tell the truth; to obey the law; to care for others; to love our country; to cherish our faith. My story isn't unique. In the last few weeks, I've deepened my admiration for someone who shares those same values. Her immigrant father loved our country. Her widowed mother sacrificed for her family. And her own career is an American classic: Doing your work. Earning your way. Paying your dues. Rising on merit. My presidency will be about those values. My vice president will be Geraldine Ferraro. Tonight, we open a new door to the future. Mr. Reagan calls it tokenism. We call it America. Ever since I graduated from Elmore High, I've been a Democrat. I was attorney general of my state; then a U.S. senator. Then, an honest, caring man - Jimmy Carter - picked me as his running mate and in 1976 I was elected vice president. And in 1980, Ronald Reagan beat the pants off us. So tonight, I want to say something to those of you across our country who voted for Mr. Reagan - Republicans, Independents, and yes, some Democrats: I heard you. And our party heard you. After we lost we didn't tell the American people that they were wrong. Instead, we began asking you what our mistakes had been. And for four years, I listened to all of the people of our country. I traveled everywhere. It seemed like I had visited every acre of America. It wasn't easy. I remember late one night, as I headed from a speech in one city to a hotel a thousand miles away, someone said to me, Fritz, I saw you on TV. Are those bags under your eyes natural? And I said, No, I got them the old-fashioned way. I earned them. To the thousands of Americans who welcomed me into your homes and into your businesses, your churches and synagogues: I thank you. You confirmed my belief in our country's values. And you helped me learn and grow. New Realism So, tonight we come to you with a new realism: Ready for the future, and recapturing the best in our tradition. We know that America must have a strong defense, and a sober view of the Soviets. We know that government must be as well-managed as it is well-meaning. We know that a healthy, growing private economy is the key to the future. We know that Harry Truman spoke the truth when he said: A President . . . has to be able to say yes and no, but mostly no. Look at our platform. There are no defense cuts that weaken our security; no business taxes that weaken our economy; no laundry lists that raid our Treasury. We are wiser, stronger, and focused on the future. If Mr. Reagan wants to re-run the 1980 campaign: Fine. Let them fight over the past. We're fighting for the American future - and that's why we're going to win this campaign. One last word to those who voted for Mr. Reagan. I know what you were saying. But I also know what you were not saying. You did not vote for a $200 billion deficit. You did not vote for an arms race. You did not vote to turn the heavens into a battleground. You did not vote to savage Social Security and Medicare. You did not vote to destroy family farming. You did not vote to trash the civil rights laws. You did not vote to poison the environment. You did not vote to assault the poor, the sick, and the disabled. And you did not vote to pay fifty bucks for a fifty-cent light bulb. Four years ago, many of you voted for Mr. Reagan because he promised you'd be better off. And today, the rich are better off. But working Americans are worse off, and the middle class is standing on a trap door. Lincoln once said that ours is to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record. Reagan Record First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps. Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills. Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between. Then they socked it to workers. They encouraged executives to vote themselves huge bonuses - while using King Kong tactics to make workers take Hong Kong wages. Mr. Reagan believes that the genius of America is in the boardrooms and exclusive country clubs. I believe that the greatness can be found in the men and women who built our nation; do its work; and defend our freedom. Truth About The Future If this administration has a plan for a better future, they're keeping it a secret. Here is the truth about the future: We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids, and shrink our future. Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay Mr. Reagan's bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says they won't is not telling the truth to the American people. I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did. There's another difference. When he raises taxes, it won't be done fairly. He will sock it to average-income families again, and leave his rich friends alone. And I won't stand for it. And neither will you and neither will the American people. To the corporations and freeloaders who play the loopholes or pay no taxes, my message is: Your free ride is over. To the Congress, my message is: We must cut spending and pay as we go. If you don't hold the line, I will: That's what the veto is for. Now that's my plan to cut the deficit. Mr. Reagan is keeping his plan secret until after the election. That's not leadership; that's salesmanship. And I think the American people know the difference. I challenge tonight, I challenge Mr. Reagan to put his plan on the table next to mine - and then let's debate it on national television before the American people. Americans want the truth about the future - not after the election. When the American economy leads the world, the jobs are here, the prosperity is here for our children. But that's not what's happening today. This is the worst trade year in American history. Three million of our best jobs have gone overseas. Mr. Reagan has done nothing about it. They have no plan to get our competitive edge back. But we do. We will cut the deficits, reduce interest rates, make our exports affordable, and make America number one again in the world economy. We will launch a renaissance in education, in science, and learning. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. And this must be the best-educated, best-trained generation in American history. And I will lead our nation forward to the best system that this nation has ever seen. We must do it, we must do it. It is time for America to have a season of excellence. Parents must turn off that television; students must do their homework; teachers must teach; and America compete. We'll be number one if we follow those rules; let's get with it in America again. To big companies that send our jobs overseas, my message is: We need those jobs here at home. And our country won't help your business - unless your business helps our country. To countries that close their markets to us, my message is: We will not be pushed around any more. We will have a president who stands up for American workers and American businesses and American farmers in international trade. When I grew up, and people asked us to imagine the future we were full of dreams. But a few months ago, when I visited a grade school class in Texas and asked the children to imagine the future, they talked to me about nuclear war. As we've neared the election, this administration has begun to talk about a safer world. But there's a big difference: As president, I will work for peace from my first day in office - and not from my first day campaigning for re-election. As president, I will reassert American values. I'll press for human rights in Central America, and for the removal of all foreign forces from the region. And in my first hundred days, I will stop the illegal war in Nicaragua. We know the deep differences with the Soviets. And America condemns their repression of dissidents and Jews; their suppression of Solidarity; their invasion of Afghanistan; their meddling around the world. But the truth is that between us, we have the capacity to destroy the planet. Every president since the bomb went off understood that and talked with the Soviets and negotiated arms control. Why has this administration failed? Why haven't they tried? Why can't they understand the cry of Americans and human beings for sense and sanity in control of these God awful weapons? Why, why? Why can't we meet in summit conferences with the Soviet Union at least once a year? Why can't we reach agreements to save this earth? The truth is, we can. President Kennedy was right when he said: We must never negotiate out of fear. But we must never fear to negotiate. For the sake of civilization we must negotiate a mutual, verifiable nuclear freeze before those weapons destroy us all. A Second Mondale Term The second term of the Mondale-Ferraro Administration will begin in 1989. By the start of the next decade, I want to ask our children their dreams, and hear not one word about nuclear nightmares. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any classroom in America and hear some of the brightest students say, I want to be a teacher. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any public health clinic in America and hear the doctor say, We haven't seen a hungry child this year. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any store in America and pick up the best product, of the best quality, at the best price; and turn it over; and read, Made in the U.S.A. By the start of the next decade, I want to meet with the most successful business leaders anywhere in America, and see as many minorities and women in that room as I see here in this room tonight. By the start of the next decade, I want to point to the Supreme Court and say, Justice is in good hands. Before the start of the next decade, I want to go to my second Inaugural, and raise my right hand, and swear to preserve, protect, and defend a Constitution that includes the Equal Rights Amendment. My friends, America is a future each generation must enlarge; a door each generation must open; a promise each generation must keep. For the rest of my life, I want to talk to young people about their future. And whatever their race, whatever their religion, whatever their sex, I want to hear some of them say what I say - with joy and reverence - tonight: I want to be president of the United States. Thank you very much. (This is the Associated Press text of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale's July 19 speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination as delivered at the Democratic National Convention, in San Francisco.)
It's always a little surprising. In good times and bad, at least 75 million US households have ended up owing nothing in federal income taxes in recent years.\n\nThey're not dodging their tax obligations. It's just the way the US tax code works.\n\nThis year, an estimated 45% of tax filers — or just under 79 million households — are likely to have zero federal income tax liability, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nIf the new tax law hadn't gone into effect, the percent would have been closer to 43%. Put another way, the law added another 2.3 million households to the rolls of non-payers.\n\nBoth figures, however, come in below the 50% of non-payers recorded in 2009.\n\n[That] was the peak both because of the effects of the recession on employment and incomes, but also partly a result of temporary tax policies like the Making Work Pay tax credit that further reduced income tax liabilities, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nLooking ahead, TPC estimates between 44% and 45% of households — or roughly 80 million — will pay no federal income tax for the next several years.\n\nGetting to zero on your 1040\n\nThe ranks of non-payers are dominated by low- and middle-income households for several reasons.\n\nThe tax code is progressive so those who make very little don't end up owing tax.\n\nRelated: We asked how Trump's tax cuts were affecting CNNMoney readers. Hundreds responded.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, don't make a lot and can eliminate their federal income taxes through the use of the (now nearly doubled) standard deduction and some key credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which offset your tax bill dollar-for-dollar.\n\nAnd lower income retirees who live primarily off Social Security don't pay taxes on their benefits.\n\nBut there are non-payers in the upper-income ranks too. TPC estimates this year about 7% of filers with total incomes between $86,000 and $150,000, and about 1% of filers making more than that won't owe anything.\n\nThey may whittle their tax bill to zero by taking a lot in itemized deductions, even though those options are narrowed under the new law.\n\nVery high income non-payers may get lot of income from tax-exempt investments or carry a lot of losses from prior years if they're involved in a business or partnership. Such losses can offset your current taxes.\n\nThe payroll tax tab\n\nThe majority of tax filers who don't pay federal income tax still owe payroll taxes, however.\n\nFor instance, only about 12% of those in the lowest income group (making less than $25,000 all in) will end up owing income taxes this year, but 58% will owe payroll taxes, TPC estimates. The 42% in the group who don't end up owing payroll taxes typically don't earn a wage or are retired.\n\nRelated: Why the new tax law could make your state tax bill go up\n\nIndividuals with jobs will pay 6.2% of wage and salary income up to $128,700 into Social Security this year. And they will pay 1.45% of all their earned income for Medicare. Their employers will match those amounts, but economists say the employer payroll tax burden is ultimately borne by the worker, too, through lower wages.\n\nAll in, TPC estimates three-quarters of all filers will pay payroll taxes this year. And many who end up owing both income and payroll taxes will end up paying more in payroll taxes.
The new federal tax law created a lot of confusion over whether tax filers may still deduct the interest they pay on their home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\n\nThe new law suspends the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness for the next eight years.\n\nBut it turns out the suspension does not apply to all home equity loans (HELs) and lines of credit (HELOCs).\n\nIt just applies to those that are used to pay for non-home-related things, like paying off your credit card or buying a car.\n\nBut you can still deduct home equity loan interest that is used to pay for home improvements.\n\nUntil this year, you had been allowed to deduct the interest you paid on up to $100,000 in HELs and HELOCs, regardless of how you used the money.\n\nRelated: It's getting more expensive to buy a home\n\nTo clear up the confusion the IRS recently issued some clarifying guidance to let people know that in many cases you may continue to deduct the interest you pay when you borrow against your home equity.\n\nHere's the deal:\n\nDespite their names, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are not considered home equity indebtedness under the law when they're used for acquiring, constructing or improving your primary residence and are secured by your home.\n\nIndeed, when the money is used to build or improve your home, the loans are considered acquisition debt like the mortgage you got to buy your house.\n\nAnd the new tax law still allows you to deduct the interest you pay on acquisition debt.\n\nRelated: Is your paycheck being taxed enough? Check the new IRS calculator\n\nBut it does limit that deduction going forward.\n\nFor loans taken out between now and December 31, 2025, after which the suspension ends, you may only deduct the interest you pay on up to $750,000 of acquisition debt. That limit applies to your mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit combined.\n\nSo if you go out tomorrow and get a $750,000 mortgage then a few months later take out a $100,000 HEL to build an addition and replace your roof, you may only deduct the interest on your total debt up to $750,000.\n\nIf, however, you had taken out that same mortgage and HEL on or before December 15, 2017, the applicable limit for acquisition indebtedness is $1 million, so you could deduct all your interest.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed taxing the wealthy as high as 70% to fund a climate change plan she's pushing called the Green New Deal.\n\nThere's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, the freshman New York lawmaker said in an interview with Anderson Cooper that's slated to air Sunday on CBS' 60 Minutes.\n\nIn a clip of the interview that was released on Friday, Cooper asked Ocasio-Cortez about the specifics of the Green New Deal, a plan that calls for reducing carbon emissions to zero and moving the country off of fossil fuels in 10 years.\n\nOnce you get to the tippie-tops, on your $10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nShe also acknowledged that her goal is ambitious.\n\nIt's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, she told Cooper. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?\n\nBut she added, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country, citing President Abraham Lincoln's issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation and President Franklin Roosevelt pushing for the passage of Social Security.\n\nAsked if she considers herself a radical, Ocasio-Cortez replied, Yeah, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the youngest woman elected to Congress, was sworn into the US House on Thursday. A Democratic-Socialist, she has also pushed Medicare for all, tuition-free public college, canceling all student loan debt and housing as a federal right.
The start of a new year is a good time to update your budget -- or create one in the first place. But as you review your budget and, hopefully, adjust it for your raise, here are a few more changes you should really think about making.\n\n1. Carve out room for savings\n\nYour budget should include a line item for each spending category you encounter, from housing to cable to healthcare. But many people forget to incorporate one key line item: savings. If your budget doesn't have any wiggle room for savings, then it's time to reallocate your income so that savings come first. Ideally, you should aim to put away 10% or more of each paycheck, but if that's not feasible right now, then start slowly and work your way up.\n\nNo matter your age or income, you need an emergency fund with enough money to cover three to six months of living expenses. If you've yet to hit this target, any money you save should go directly toward an emergency account. Once you have enough short-term savings, shift your focus to long-term goals, like retirement or the house you're hoping to buy.\n\n2. Factor in one-time expenses\n\nMany of us have bills that creep up just once a year, like that annual heating maintenance fee or warehouse club renewal. If your budget doesn't already allow for these, look at your records from the past few years and identify the different one-off expenses you encountered. Then add those numbers up, divide the total by 12, and factor that amount into your budget each month.\n\nLet's say you spent $100 last year on a gutter cleaning in January, $400 in April on your annual lawn treatment, and another $100 in June to renew your warehouse club membership. In that case, you'll need to add a $50 line item each month to cover these sporadic expenses. If you pay your homeowners' or renters' insurance all at once, that's another cost to allocate over the course of 12 months.\n\n3. Eat out less often\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American household spends $3,008 a year, or $250 a month, on restaurants and takeout. But because most food establishments charge a 300% markup on what they serve, spending that much each year means throwing away a good $2,000 all-in. If you were to cut that spending in half, you'd have an extra $1,000 a year to save, invest, or use to pay down debt.\n\n4. Unload your vehicle\n\nOwning your own vehicle can be a nice convenience, and in some places, it's truly a must. But if you live in or near a city with ample public transportation, you might consider getting rid of that automobile, relying more on buses, trains, or a bicycle, and pocketing the savings. AAA estimates that it costs $8,700 a year, or $725 a month, to own a vehicle. On the other hand, according to LendingTree, the most expensive public-transportation commute in the nation -- in our capital of Washington, D.C. -- costs $237 a month. Compared to $725, that's a $488 monthly savings.\n\nEven if you were to take an Uber back and forth to work every day in New York City, you'd spend just $705 a month on average, which might still be slightly cheaper than owning a vehicle. Plus, you wouldn't have to assume the risk of major breakdowns or worry about parking.\n\n5. Stop banking on that bonus or tax refund\n\nMaybe you've gotten a bonus or tax refund over the past few years -- perhaps even consistently. But if you're including that money in your budget, then you're making a big mistake. Bonuses in particular are by no means guaranteed, and if your company has a bad year or you don't meet certain goals, you might not see that extra income this time around.\n\nTax refunds can be tricky, too. First of all, in an ideal world, you shouldn't be getting a significant refund in the first place, because that's just loaning the government money for free. But even if you've snagged a sizable refund over the past few years, it can be tough to figure out where it came from unless you're really in tune with your finances. It could be, for example, that you were eligible for certain tax credits or deductions in the past that no longer apply. That's why banking on a bonus or tax refund can really hurt you. If you count on money that never comes your way, you'll risk overspending and taking on debt.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nThe more precise and strategic you are with your budget, the better your chances of saving money and staying on top of your finances.

The Amex Gold card is ideal for foodies who spend money both eating in and dining out, and it comes with up to $240 in credits each year.\n\nStory highlights Thanks to up to $240 in annual credits, the American Express® Gold Card can almost pay for itself Amex Membership Rewards points earned with the card are extremely valuable when redeemed for travel The card is ideal for people who spend lots of money at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets\n\n(CNN) —\n\nCNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through the LendingTree affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\n\nOur quick take: The American Express® Gold Card is a foodie's dream, allowing you to rack up plenty of Membership Rewards points with its bonus categories on dining worldwide and at US supermarkets. The popular limited-edition Rose Gold design is now back as a permanent option, and thanks to new credits that have been added for 2021, the card almost pays for itself every year.\n\nPros:\n\nWith up to $240 in included credits each year, card members can effectively get and keep the card for just $10 annually.\n\nEarn an industry-leading 4 points for every dollar you spend on dining worldwide.\n\nEarn 4 points per dollar at US supermarkets up to $25,000 per year (1 point per dollar thereafter).\n\nEarn 3 points per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines.\n\nCons:\n\nCredits require planning and strategy to maximize.\n\nOther cards may be better for everyday purchases.\n\n$250 annual fee.\n\nCurrent welcome bonus: Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on eligible purchases within the first six months after opening the account.\n\nBest for: Points-minded travelers who spend significant money each month on dining, groceries and travel.\n\nDigging into the American Express Gold\n\nThe American Express Gold is a standout card, largely due to its clear efforts to be top-of-wallet in a few categories that are significant to many US households. Take a look at your budget — do you spend a fair amount of your cash on food right now? Chances are, the answer is yes.\n\nAmex designed the Gold Card to cater to those who spend nontrivial amounts at restaurants and on groceries, offering 4 points for every dollar you spend at eateries worldwide and at supermarkets in the United States. You'll also net 3 points per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines, which isn't too shabby.\n\nThe current 60,000-point welcome bonus — available after you spend $4,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership — is the highest bonus offer we've ever seen available on this card. And those Membership Rewards points are worth at least $600 when you redeem them via Amex Travel for airfare, and potentially a lot more than that with Amex's transfer partners.\n\nAlso, in 2018, American Express introduced a limited-time Rose Gold design for the Amex Gold, which was so popular that it was brought back again for a short while in 2019. Now, the issuer has announced that Rose Gold will be a permanent option for new card members going forward. That means you can choose between either the original Gold or Rose Gold design when you're approved for the card.\n\nBut here's the best part: When you combine the bonus with up to $120 in annual dining credits on the card and up to $120 in Uber Cash each year, American Express is literally almost paying you to hold this card.\n\nClick here for the bonus offer on the American Express Gold card.\n\nAdvantages of the American Express Gold\n\nThe biggest long-term advantage of the American Express Gold is its superior earning rate at US supermarkets and restaurants worldwide. With no foreign transaction fees, this should be your go-to card for dining everywhere you go. In fact, those bonus categories are so strong that it may be worth holding this card even if you only ever use it for dining and groceries.\n\nGiven that this is very much a food lover's card, it comes as no surprise to see up to $120 in annual statement credits are available for select dining spots as well. You can earn up to $10 in statement credits each month (so, $120 annually) when you pay with the Gold Card at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations.\n\nPHOTO: Grubhub Get up to $10 in credits each month for purchases at Grubhub and other select dining establishments.\n\nBut that's only the half of it. The Amex Gold also now comes with both a complimentary Uber Eats Pass membership for up to 12 months when you enroll by December 31, 2021, and $10 in Uber Cash each month. Uber Cash can be used either for Uber rides, or on food delivery orders made with Uber Eats.\n\nAdd it all together, and you're getting up to $240 in credits every 12 months. Since the Amex Gold has an annual fee of $250, if you can use all the credits, you're effectively paying only $10 for the card each year.\n\nAnd then there are the points. How much potential value can you get with the Membership Rewards points you earn with the Amex Gold? While you can exchange points for cash in order to pay down the balance due on your statement, each point nets you just 0.6 cents when you redeem them that way.\n\nYou can also shop at Amazon with Amex points at a rate of 0.7 cents apiece, or redeem for an array of gift cards or for airfare at Amex Travel at around 1 cent per point. Plus, Amazon sometimes offers additional discounts on purchases when using Amex points to pay for even a part of your order.\n\nRelated: Get up to $50 off at Amazon with targeted American Express cards.\n\nBut while the above options are easy — and yes, it's important to have easy options — savvy travelers will want to utilize Amex's 21 transfer partners for remarkable redemptions. Amex has partnerships with myriad hotels and airlines, enabling Membership Rewards points to be used for travel that would be prohibitively expensive if paid for in cash.\n\nAmex also includes a baggage insurance plan on the Gold Card, covering eligible lost, damaged or stolen baggage when you purchase the entire fare for a plane, train, ship or bus ticket with the card. In addition, you'll get secondary car rental loss and damage insurance for most vehicle types and in most countries.\n\nAnd the Amex Gold also comes with trip delay insurance, meaning if your trip is delayed more than 12 hours due to a covered reason, you can get up to $300 in unexpected expenses reimbursed.\n\nRelated: Having a credit card with trip insurance could save you thousands on your next vacation.\n\nA couple of overlooked-but-useful perks: American Express cardholders are often eligible for early access to tickets through Ticketmaster. While obviously there aren't any concerts happening at the moment, when the pandemic ends, getting a head start on ticket sales might be the difference between an enviable seat and a chair in the nosebleeds.\n\nAlso, Amex Offers have been quite stout of late. This is a rotating selection of discounts, covering everything from clothing to tax preparation software to travel. Those who make a habit of watching new ones pop up can save hundreds per year on purchases they were planning to make anyway.\n\nGet almost as much in annual credits as you pay for the American Express Gold card.\n\nDisadvantages of the American Express Gold\n\nPHOTO: iStock The Amex Gold is a good choice for dining and at supermarkets, but not as an everyday card.\n\nThe American Express Gold is a specialized card. Beyond dining, supermarkets and airfare, you'll earn only 1 point for every dollar you spend on everything else. This means the card works best when paired with a card like our benchmark credit card, the Citi® Double Cash Card, for purchases that don't fall into the Gold Card's bonus categories.\n\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's review of the Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nWhile the included credits are worth almost as much as the annual fee each year, they take a bit of strategy to use. The credits are capped at $10 per month, so you can't just use them in one fell swoop. Plus, the list of eligible restaurants is small. If you live in an urban area where Grubhub and Seamless are available, utilizing this credit becomes easier. But if you don't, maximizing the dining credit can be a challenge.\n\nAlso, while this won't impact many families, the 4x return at US supermarkets is capped at $25,000 per calendar year with the Gold Card. If you spend more than that on groceries in a year, you'll earn just 1 point per dollar after that.\n\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that Membership Rewards points take some studying and effort to really maximize. Managing transfer partners and dealing with dynamic award charts may feel like too much work for many, and you can't easily transfer Amex points to friends who may view this as a hobby. If you're looking for travel rewards that are easier to redeem, you'll likely want to pick a card like the Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card as an alternative.\n\nStacking up the American Express Gold against our benchmark\n\nCNN Underscored has chosen the Citi Double Cash card as our benchmark credit card. That doesn't mean it's the best credit card on the market — rather, it means we use it as a basic standard to compare other credit cards and see where they score better, and where they're worse.\n\nHere's how the Amex Gold scores against our benchmark. The features of each card in the below chart are colored in green, red or white. Green indicates a card feature that is better than our benchmark. Red indicates the feature is worse than our benchmark, and white indicates the feature is either equivalent or cannot be directly compared to our benchmark.\n\nKEY DETAILS Citi Double Cash Card American Express Gold Card Card type Mastercard American Express Sign-up bonus None 60,000 points after spending $4,000 in the first six months REWARDS Earning rate 2% on all purchases (1% when you buy, 1% when you pay it off) 4 points per dollar on dining worldwide, 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets up to $25,000 per year (1x thereafter), 3 points per dollar on airfare booked directly, 1 point per dollar on all other purchases Redemption value 1 cent (cash back) Up to 1 cent per point when booking through American Express Travel, 2.0 cents per point for transfers* Ease of basic redemptions Easy Easy Advanced redemption options Can convert cash back to ThankYou points that transfer to 16 airline partners if you also have the Citi Premier℠ or Citi Prestige® Yes, transfer to 21 airline and hotel partners Quality of advanced redemptions Good Great FEES Annual fee $0 $250 Foreign transaction fee 3% 0% BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS Travel perks None None Purchase protections None Purchase Protection, Return Protection, Extended Warranty Travel protections None Secondary Auto Coverage, Trip Delay Reimbursement, Lost Baggage Insurance Other perks None Up to $120 in annual dining credits and up to $120 in annual Uber Cash INTEREST RATES ON PURCHASES AND BALANCE TRANSFERS Introductory purchase interest rate None None Introductory purchase interest length N/A N/A Standard purchase interest rate 13.99%-23.99% variable None — Charge Card Introductory balance transfer rate 0% None Introductory balance transfer length 18 months N/A Introductory balance transfer fee 3% or $5, whichever is greater N/A * Based on point valuations calculated by frequent flyer website The Points Guy.\n\nWhen reviewing other credit cards, we use this format and these criteria to compare them with our benchmark.

This cash back credit card has a $95 annual fee and offers unlimited 4% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% cash back at grocery stores and 1% cash back on all other purchases. If you prefer cash back over travel points or miles, the Savor card may be the way to go — particularly if you can't easily leverage the annual credits on the Amex Gold.\n\nHowever, while cash back is infinitely more flexible than travel rewards — you can spend cash anywhere — you also can't increase the value of cash back the way you potentially can with points or miles. Membership Rewards points can be used with Amex's transfer partners to score premium trips for much less than you'd normally pay in cash, effectively increasing the value of your points when you redeem them.\n\nAlso, although it may not be immediately apparent, folks who are fond of the bonus categories on the Amex Gold should also look at the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card. With a $95 annual fee, this card earns 6 Hilton Honors points for every dollar you spend at US restaurants, US supermarkets and US gas stations.\n\nBut keep in mind that points aren't all created equal. According to the point valuations of frequent flyer website The Points Guy, American Express points are worth 2 cents apiece, while Hilton points are only worth 0.6 cents each. That makes 4 points on the Amex Gold worth 8 cents, while 6 Hilton points are worth just 3.6 cents.\n\nShould you get the American Express Gold?\n\nPHOTO: American Express Get the American Express Gold card with either the Gold or Rose Gold design.\n\nThe American Express Gold is a must-have for those who know they'll spend heavily at restaurants and US supermarkets, and who also have the patience to maximize their Membership Rewards points through Amex's transfer partners. While cards like the Capital One Savor have a lower annual fee and no hoops to jump through to redeem your cash back, the 60,000-point bonus on the Amex Gold and credits that can be worth almost as much as the annual fee make it the winner right now.\n\nSo if you're looking to redeem credit card rewards for exotic travel once the pandemic is over, and you spend a lot of your time eating in or dining out, the Amex Gold could be a great fit for you. And if you decide it's a card that should be in your wallet, make sure to grab it now and get it with the highest welcome bonus offer we've ever seen for it, and credits that make the card almost pay for itself.\n\nLearn more and apply for the American Express Gold Card.\n\nFind out which cards CNN Underscored chose as our best credit cards of 2021.\n\nGet all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money.
Angela Merkel will be German chancellor for a fourth term. But she won't have an easy ride.\n\nThe rise of the far-right, and other small parties, in Sunday's election has made it tough for Merkel to form a government that commands a majority in parliament.\n\nThe euro sagged against the dollar on Monday on the prospect of months of political wrangling before the future direction of Europe's biggest economy becomes clear.\n\nHere's what the vote could mean for Germany, Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nA new government by Christmas?\n\nWith Germany's second biggest party -- the Social Democrats -- heading for a spell in opposition, Merkel has only one real option: a three-way coalition between her conservative CDU-CSU bloc and two smaller parties -- the liberal FDP and the Greens.\n\nThe parties have never governed together at national level, but earlier this year struck a deal to run the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nCoalition talks will be difficult, they always are, said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank. But Merkel is good at bridging such differences.\n\nRegardless of those skills, it will take time. Serious talks on forming a new government are unlikely to start until the middle of October, once the result of elections in the German state of Lower Saxony are known.\n\nThat means it may be December, or even early January, before the new government takes office.\n\nRelated: German inequality may have fueled far-right surge\n\nIt could be good for the economy\n\nThe three-way coalition could give an extra boost to the German and European economies.\n\nMerkel's party and the FDP are likely to prioritize policies that favor business and trade, and all three have promised tax cuts. The Greens also want the government to spend more money supporting families.\n\nRelated: Germans are falling out of love with their carmakers\n\nThese policies would boost consumer spending, which could in turn lower Germany's trade surplus -- something that would please the country's European partners, as well as President Trump.\n\nStill, any shift in overall economic policy is likely to be small.\n\nThe big picture is that any fiscal boost will be modest, said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. None of the three parties plans to invest as much as the [Social Democrats] advocated and all of the major parties want to keep a balanced budget.\n\n...but possibly bad for the car industry\n\nThe Greens are likely to push hard for their environmental policies. That could spell problems for German car makers, already shaken by the Volkswagen (VLKAY) diesel scandal and claims that they were operating a cartel.\n\nMorgan Stanley economists said dealing with the fallout from these issues was likely to take center stage in German politics, given the importance of the automotive industry to the economy.\n\nOn the whole, the Greens pursue more ambitious goals and a more radical response to the diesel scandal, Elga Bartsch and Jan Kozak wrote in a research note.\n\nThe Greens want to ban the registration of cars with combustion engines from 2030 -- a decade earlier than Britain and France have proposed. Merkel has hinted she could support a ban but has given no indication of the timing.\n\nShares in Volkswagen and BMW (BMWYY) slipped on Monday, despite narrow gains on German stock markets.\n\nRelated: Infrastructure is Germany's weak link\n\nEuropean integration could slow\n\nThe new government might take a more cautious approach to further integration between Europe's economies.\n\nNew French President Emmanuel Macron wants to push through radical reforms of the European Union. He argues that closer cooperation between countries that share the euro currency -- such as the introduction of a common finance minister and budget -- would make Europe stronger and more stable.\n\nBefore Sunday's election, Merkel had appeared willing to work with Macron on finding a consensus for reform. Now that might be harder for her, given the liberal FDP are skeptical.\n\nA final compromise should still see European integration move forward in the coming years. That said, it is likely to be at a slower pace than currently envisaged by Merkel and [Emmanuel] Macron, said Ricardo Garcia, economist at UBS.
New Delhi (CNN) Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a complete lockdown for India's 1.3 billion people on Tuesday, warning that many families will be destroyed forever if the country didn't get to grips with its coronavirus outbreak in the next three weeks.\n\nModi said the lockdown would start at midnight local time, would last for a minimum of 21 days, and would apply to all of India's 36 states and territories.\n\nYou have seen the worldwide situations arising from the coronavirus pandemic in the news. You have also seen how the most powerful nations have become helpless in the face of this pandemic, Modi said in a live televised address to the nation on Tuesday evening ahead of the deadline.\n\nIndia is the world's second most populous country and the fifth biggest economy, but so far, it has appeared to avoid the full hit of the pandemic. The country has confirmed 519 coronavirus cases , including 10 deaths and 39 patients who have been cured, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\nA number of Indian states have ordered lockdowns in the past few days, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. International borders have been shut to most travelers coming from the Europe.\n\nA protest against the country's Citizenship Amendment Act at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh was cleared by the police on Tuesday after the government prohibited all public gatherings in the city. Hundreds of women have been protesting at the site for months , expressing their solidarity with protesters who have been allegedly assaulted by police.\n\nModi said that the measures are necessary to protect the population, and referred to experience from other countries.\n\nWhat the experts are saying is that social distancing is the only option to combat coronavirus. That is to remain apart from each other and stay confined to within your homes. There is no other way to remain safe from coronavirus. If we have to stop the spread, we have to break the cycle of infection, he said.\n\nFrom 12 midnight today, the entire country will go under a complete lockdown to save India and for every Indian, there will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes. Therefore, I request you to remain wherever you are in this country, Modi added.\n\nOnly essential services will be operational. These include water, electricity, health services, fire services, groceries and municipal services.\n\nAll shops, commercial establishments, factories, workshops, offices, markets and places of worship will be closed and interstate buses and metros will be suspended. Construction activity will also be on a halt during this period.\n\nModi said if the outbreak was not dealt with properly it could set the country back decades.\n\nAccording to health experts, a minimum of 21 days is most crucial to break the cycle of infection. If we are not able to manage this pandemic in the next 21 days, the country and your family will be setback by 21 years. If we are not able to manage the next 21 days, then many families will be destroyed forever, Modi said.\n\nTo soften the economic blow from the shutdown, the Indian government announced a number of measures on Tuesday.\n\nDeadlines to file tax returns have been extended by three months, charges on minimum bank balances have been waived and no fees will be charged for using other banks' ATMs.\n\nThe threshold for invoking insolvency has been raised to $131,000 from $1,300, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a news conference earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, India's Labor Ministry has advised all territories to to help construction workers who are out of work because of the outbreak. The vast majority of the country's construction workers are considered as informal labor and earn their livelihood through daily wages. Around 35 million construction workers across the country are registered with construction welfare boards.
Like most of us, you're probably still trying to figure out how the federal tax overhaul will change what you'll owe Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the new law could affect how much you'll pay in state taxes as well.\n\nOf the 41 states that impose an income tax, all but five (Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) directly tie parts of their tax code to elements in the federal code.\n\nThey may use as their starting point a filer's federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income. And they may adopt some of the same exemptions and deductions used at the federal level.\n\nBottom line: The more a state conforms to features in the federal code, the more their residents could feel an impact at the state level.\n\nThat is, unless their state makes changes. Some have started to, but many more are currently debating what to do.\n\nMany states have preliminarily estimated that they'll end up getting more revenue if they do nothing, meaning your state tax bill could grow, even though your state government hasn't done anything to raise your taxes.\n\nRelated: New York OKs plan to skirt controversial provision of GOP tax law\n\nSo legislatures across the country are debating what to do with the extra cash. They have three choices: Use it to make investments or fill budget holes. Provide offsetting tax cuts to residents. Or some combination of the two.\n\nColorado, for instance, estimates that it will collect hundreds of millions of dollars more each year between 2018 and 2025.\n\nOne reason is that the elimination of the federal personal and dependent exemptions could increase a Colorado resident's state tax bill by $191 per family member on one's return, according to estimates from staff economists of Colorado's legislative council.\n\nWhile Colorado lawmakers have introduced some bills — including one to expand a child care expense tax credit — to offset the loss of the personal exemption, it's not clear where the state will end up.\n\nMaryland estimated it could get an additional $500 million by doing nothing. Its lawmakers have decided to keep $200 million to invest in education. But this week, they struck an agreement in principle to make $100 million worth of tax changes to offset some of the state tax increases residents might owe as result of the federal changes.\n\nIdaho lawmakers, meanwhile, passed a bill lowering income tax rates to the tune of $100 million to offset their estimated revenue increase.\n\nBut that won't protect everyone in Idaho from a higher state tax bill. While the legislation will lower taxes for a lot of people, it would raise taxes on many large families, Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, noted in TaxVox.\n\nThat's because Idaho residents have been able to claim the full federal personal exemption and standard deduction on their state returns. The new federal law nearly doubled the standard deduction — which may reduce a filer's state tax burden. But it's not enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions for low- and middle-income parents with several kids.\n\nLawmakers have recently crafted a partial fix to the problem by increasing the newly created state child tax credit.\n\nRelated: 2018 federal tax cuts by state\n\nMeanwhile, some other states are trying to make a few technical corrections to address potential tax increases, said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\nNebraska lawmakers, for instance, have advanced a bill to create a state personal exemption to offset the loss of the federal one.\n\nIf you do face a higher state tax bill because your lawmakers don't act, Hicks thinks it's unlikely that the increase would wipe out the tax cuts you might see on your federal tax return.\n\nIt will still be a net tax cut, Hicks said.\n\nUnless, of course, you're in the minority of filers in 2018 who are also facing a federal tax increase.
John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nBecause any self-respecting institutionalist who has devoted his life to the defense of the Constitution and separation of powers should be able to recognize how dangerous and disingenuous lawyer Alan Dershowitz's argument is on behalf of President Trump.\n\nIf a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment, Dershowitz said on Wednesday.\n\nWith this argument, Dershowitz completely conflates a president's self-interest with the national interest. If a president thinks 'I'm the greatest president there ever was. If I'm not elected the national interest will suffer greatly,' Dershowitz believes that cannot be impeachable.\n\nThis is not consistent with the vision of the founders. It guts the system of checks and balances and it defies common sense. But we might be waiting a while to hear the cries of outrage from small-government constitutional conservatives like Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee -- despite the fact that this is the most breathtaking argument for an imperial presidency that could possibly be imagined.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dana Bash shuts down GOP senator over Dershowitz's claim Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dana Bash shuts down GOP senator over Dershowitz's claim 03:49\n\nThat's because hyper-partisanship and polarization have lulled politicians into staying silent when it is politically convenient. As a reality check, just imagine how the Republicans would respond if a Democratic president's legal counsel advanced that argument. They would be outraged. And they'd be right.\n\nThere's been a full court press to roll back Dershowitz's comments. Don't buy it. It appears he said what he meant. Trump's legal team seems to recognize he went too far and could scare off swing votes. That's because the ideas he articulated are worth being alarmed about. If the Republican senators roll over for Dershowitz's argument, they won't get a do-over when similar circumstances emerge under a Democratic president. This will set a precedent for virtually unlimited executive power.\n\nUnder this logic, President Richard Nixon could have been justified for covering up Watergate because he sincerely felt that his re-election was in the national interest. If that seems like a stretch, former White House Counsel and star Watergate witness John Dean facetiously applied that logic to Nixon and wrote , All Nixon was doing was obstructing justice and abusing power because he thought he was the best person for the USA to be POTUS.... Seriously, that was his motive!\n\nEarlier in the week, Dershowitz also argued that abuse of power could not be considered an impeachable offense: It is inconceivable that the framers would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as abuse of power to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment.\n\nActually, it is entirely conceivable that that was their clear intent. Because that's what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 65 : The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\n\nSo don't be swayed by Dershowitz's Harvard law-professor credentials -- this isn't some novel reading of the Constitution. It is self-serving nonsense. And that's why every single one of the four legal experts who testified during the House impeachment hearing -- including Republicans' favorite Jonathan Turley -- say that impeachment does not require a crime\n\nThe real danger of the President's defense is clear when you consider the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime. This leaves impeachment as the only remedy to hold the President accountable for serious misconduct. The two-thirds threshold to convict and remove a president is already a high bar to meet -- even more so in an age of polarization. Dershowitz's argument would essentially take it off the table, and allow a president to do almost anything to ensure his re-election -- including asking a foreign power to intervene on his behalf.\n\nGeorge Washington would have thought that argument absurd. In his Farewell Address in 1796, he said: Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial.\n\nIt's worth remembering that George Washington was obsessed with the virtue of being of disinterested. It's not a word we use very often anymore, but it means not being driven by self-interest, because self-interest distorts judgment and can't be trusted.\n\nTrump's legal team is advancing exactly the opposite argument, to a sinister extent.\n\nDonald Trump raised eyebrows when he bragged during the 2016 campaign that his followers were so devoted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing support. Nobody thought, then, that it would be the basis of a legal argument advanced by the President. But that's exactly the argument Trump's lawyer William Consovoy made in federal appeals court while trying to block the release of Trump's tax returns in October 2019. He argued that the President could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not be charged until he is out of office.\n\nThis absurd argument belongs in the legal hall of shame right alongside that of Nixon lawyer James St. Clair, who sounded a bit embarrassed when he told the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit:  The President wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV, only four years at a time, and is not subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment.\n\nSt. Clair's absurd defense at least made an exception for impeachment. Now Trump's legal team is taking it a step further -- by saying that he is effectively immune from a court of impeachment.\n\nThis is the King Trump defense. And it is an insult to our Constitution and separation of powers.\n\nAnyone who professes to care about the Constitution should recognize the danger of this argument. And if senators remain silent out of fealty or fear of a president from their party, they should not be allowed to forget it. History is watching and they will be establishing a new precedent that goes against their alleged principles.\n\nBut at this moment, it appears that even asking for additional information -- from credible conservatives like former National Security Adviser John Bolton -- is too much to ask. Here we have a direct witness who is willing to testify and who states in the unpublished manuscript of his forthcoming book that the President told him directly that he wanted to continue withholding congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine until they announced an investigation into his most formidable political rival.\n\nHearing from Bolton would force the Republican senators to confront uncomfortable facts. Instead, they seem eager to accept the word of a President who many acknowledge to be a liar and pretend that the highly relevant new information is not worth further investigation. Dershowitz's argument gives them a whisper of an argument to justify their complicity in a Trump coverup.\n\nThis is an insult to the trust put in them by the founding fathers. The Senate -- as articulated by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 -- was expected to be a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent...to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality in an impeachment trial.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney, who have hinted they could vote to hear from witnesses -- to uphold that standard. As of Thursday morning, Lamar said he was still undecided . Either way, his legacy will be written by the result of this vote.\n\nThe closing questions and debates in this impeachment trial represent much more than a partisan fight over power. They represent a fundamental challenge to the rule of law and the separation of powers. If hyper-partisan polarization is enough to make senators forget their oaths and even their own power as a co-equal branch of government, they will be setting a dangerous precedent that takes aim at the heart of our democracy at a time when autocracies are on the rise around the world.\n\nIn its place will be a President of low character who will be unleashed in pursuing his re-election by any means necessary.\n\nThis is happening right under the chief justice's nose -- and the question is whether he will let it happen without uttering a word of warning about the massively destabilizing impact it could have on the Constitution he has devoted his life to defending.
President Donald Trump said that members of his administration's coronavirus task force would be meeting with Congress to discuss a payroll tax cut relief and relief for hourly workers.\n\nWe are going to be asking tomorrow, we're seeing the Senate. We're going to be meeting with House Republicans, Mitch McConnell, everybody discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, Trump told reporters at a briefing Monday.\n\nWe're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they're not going to ever miss a paycheck, he added.\n\nTrump added that he is working with leaders in the cruise ship and airline industry very strongly for potential relief from coronavirus-related losses.\n\nWe want people to travel to certain locations and not to other locations at this moment, he said. We're working with the industries.\n\nTrump also said the administration is in communication with the hotel industry, saying that some places actually will do very well, but others may not.

Now, investors will see if those gains can hold under Joe Biden, who will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday.\n\nA look back: Shares shot up after Trump's 2017 tax cuts supercharged corporate earnings, then plunged at record speed when Covid-19 began battering the United States. Since then, however, they've been rocketing higher, repeatedly reaching all-time highs. Deep political polarization and a worsening pandemic have not been enough to hold Wall Street back.\n\nDespite this sharp rally, stocks under President Donald Trump have not performed as well as they did during the first terms of Presidents Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, according to an analysis by my CNN Business colleagues Matt Egan, Annalyn Kurtz and Tal Yellin.\n\nAnd some of the recent increases can be attributed to Biden's win, which investors believe will generate substantial government spending to boost the economy. Stocks have gained about 13% since Election Day as of Tuesday — the best post-election market performance for a new president in modern history, according to CFRA Research.\n\nBiden has not put as much emphasis as Trump on stocks as a gauge of the country's strength or wellbeing.\n\nThe idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening, Biden said of Trump in the final presidential debate in October. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. (Per the latest Gallup poll, 55% of Americans have some exposure to the stock market, many through retirement accounts.)\n\nEven so, Wall Street will be watching to see if market momentum can be maintained. Chatter has increased in recent weeks that corporate valuations, particularly in the tech sector, have jumped too high.\n\nMany investors worry that the equity market has rebounded too far and too fast and that there are signs of excess starting to emerge in parts of the financial system, Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs' chief global equity strategist, told clients this week. This is a reasonable concern given that the rebound in equities since the bear market trough in March of last year has been remarkable.\n\nOppenheimer said that while a correction — or a 10% decline in stocks from their recent peak — looks increasingly likely, the odds that stocks will enter a new bear market, dropping 20% from recent highs, in the next year appear fairly low.\n\nHe points to expectations of strong global economic growth in 2021 as the pandemic eases, as well as unprecedented policy support.\n\nOn that front, however, unknowns remain. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that interest rates could remain at historic lows for the foreseeable future, the fate of Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package will rely on his ability to generate some Republican support. In a divided Washington, that will be no easy task.\n\nNetflix comes of age as it hits 200 million subscribers\n\nNetflix NFLX has come a long way since it launched in 1997 to send customers DVDs in the mail.\n\nThe latest: The streaming service told investors on Tuesday that it now has more than 200 million subscribers globally, after adding 8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 — beating its own expectations.\n\nIt wasn't the only sign that Netflix has developed into a mature player in Hollywood and on Wall Street.\n\nThe company also said that it will no longer need to borrow money to finance day-to-day operations, and that it will explore returning cash to shareholders through stock buybacks.\n\nInvestor insight: Shares are up 13% in premarket trading, teeing them up to hit an all time high on Wednesday.\n\nCompetition in the streaming market remains fierce, of course. ViacomCBS' newly rebranded streaming service, Paramount+, will go live in early March, the company said Tuesday — joining an increasingly crowded field that also includes Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Comcast's Peacock, AT&T's HBO Max, and more.\n\nBut investors think Netflix appears to be in a good position to maintain its spot at the front of the pack. UBS, for example, upgraded the company's shares to a buy rating after it posted earnings, citing continued strong global subscriber growth even [against] rising competition [and] robust growth in the first half of 2020.\n\nRich Greenfield of LightShed Partners pointed out on Twitter that while investors previously seemed worried about how Netflix was going to finance its massive content production machine, the tone has shifted.\n\nThe question now, he says: What are you going to do with all the cash you will start generating in 2022 and beyond?\n\nJanet Yellen previews Biden's tough stance on China\n\nJanet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, has made clear the incoming administration will maintain a tough approach to dealing with China — setting the stage for prolonged tensions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday , Yellen promised to take on China's abusive, unfair and illegal practices.\n\nChina is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers and giving away subsidies to corporations, she said.\n\nYellen added that while the Biden team would work with US allies, as opposed to acting unilaterally, she is prepared to use the full array of tools to address such concerns. Biden has said that he will not quickly eliminate Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nThe stance was echoed by Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee to lead the State Department, in his comments Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nPresident Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China, Blinken said. I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one.\n\nWhat it means: The battle between the United States and China on trade and technology has been a key source of uncertainty for investors over the past four years. Under Biden, that's not going away.\n\nUp next\n\nJoe Biden will be sworn in as the next president of the United States at 12 p.m. ET.\n\nMorgan Stanley MS Procter & Gamble PG UnitedHealth UNH Alcoa AA United Airlines UAL Also today: BNY Mellon,andreport earnings before US markets open.andfollow after the close.\n\nComing tomorrow: Economists expect another 910,000 first-time claims for unemployment benefits, a sign of US labor market weakness.

(cnn) —\n\ntwo house millennials on opposite sides of the political spectrum have proved it's possible to find common ground, at least when it comes to cannabis policy.\n\ndemocratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york recently tapped dan riffle, a former federal policy director at the marijuana policy project, as a senior counsel and policy adviser. when she tweeted out a story about the hire from high times, she added, #legalizeit, and demand justice for communities ravaged by the war on drugs.\n\nrepublican rep. matt gaetz of florida retweeted her and added, you had me at hello.\n\nyou had me at hello. https://t.co/lqgynl6rhl — matt gaetz (@mattgaetz) january 10, 2019\n\nthat a self-described democratic socialist can share a drug policy stance with a man once called the trumpiest congressman in trump's washington by gq might have something to do with their ages. millennials are more supportive of legalizing marijuana than older generations, with 74% backing it in a 2018 pew poll. ocasio-cortez, 29, and gaetz, 36, are in line with their peers.\n\nand although democrats have led republicans when it comes to backing legalization, republican support has grown. in 2017 a gallup poll found a majority of republicans supported legalization for the first time. as of october 2018, 75% of democrats, 71% of independents and 53% of republicans supported legalization, per gallup.\n\ngaetz represents the shift in his party. in 2018, he and democratic rep. seth moulton of massachusetts teamed up on legislation that would require the veterans affairs department to survey veterans on marijuana use and protect the benefits of veterans who disclose their marijuana use to va doctors.\n\ngaetz also backed the medical cannabis research act, the first such legislation related to marijuana ever considered by a republican-led judiciary committee, his office said.\n\nthis drug should not be in the same category as heroin and lsd, and we do not need to continue with a policy that turns thousands of young people into felons every year, gaetz said in 2017. nor do we need to punish the millions of people who are sick and seeking medical help – from pain, from muscle wasting, from chemotherapy-induced nausea.\n\nformer house speaker john boehner also came out in support of weed. the ohio republican was opposed while he was the speaker, but last april he took a role on the board of advisers for acreage holdings, a cannabis company, and has spoken at cannabis investment events.\n\nthough republicans like gaetz might be rare in congress now, should his party continue to evolve on cannabis policy, issues like medical marijuana, the war on drugs and legalization could one day become more bipartisan.

rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez.\n\nin another new low for american politics, someone on twitter pounced on a video of her as student at boston university dancing on a rooftop. in a smoking gun of absolutely nothing, the anonymous poster suggested that the clip showed something untoward about one of america's newest members of congress. here is america's favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is, explained the person who posted the clip.\n\nthis followed a long line of attacks that the new york democrat has faced in the right-wing social media vortex since her surprise victory in the primary and her general election win. soon after her victory, republican ron desantis, the new governor of florida, dismissed her as this girl. fox news channel host sean hannity called her policy views downright scary. washington examiner writer eddie scarry tweeted out a screenshot of her walking down a hallway to say she was not wearing the clothes of a girl who struggles.\n\nrepublicans took solace when some democrats dismissed ocasio-cortez as a flash-in-the-pan who will not be a long-term force in party politics once her 15 minutes of fame is over.\n\nclaire mccaskill, the former missouri democratic senator, described her in a cnn interview as a shiny object for democrats. she took a shot at ocasio-cortez in her exit interview with the daily podcast, when she warned, i hope she listens to people who defeated republicans, because it's the people who defeated republicans, in this election, that we need to be emulating, not the people who defeated democrats in primaries.\n\nbut all of these attacks will likely backfire. they will only help to accelerate her rise to power, making her one of the most prominent voices on the national scene.\n\nperhaps one of the most pointed moments in the opening of congress occurred when the congresswoman stood up to vote for nancy pelosi as house speaker. since the november election there had been endless speculation about whether she and other incoming members would vote against the speaker. when republicans booed her, she turned to them with the cameras covering the action and mouthed: sorry. with republicans hoping that ocasio-cortez and other first-termers would cause problems for the incoming speaker, it turned out that the party is pretty united on one thing: the need to stop president trump's dangerous agenda and style of governance.\n\nby vilifying ocasio-cortez, the gop is helping to turn her into one of the political superstars of 2019. they are giving her more time in the spotlight and unifying democrats around someone who does come from a left-of-center perspective. extraordinarily savvy in her use of social media, ocasio-cortez is seizing the chance to make a name for herself as a democrat with a strongly progressive point of view who will not remain passive about the right-wing extremism that now shapes her opponents.\n\nironically, the ongoing attacks might overshadow real points of division that exist between her and pelosi, such as the pushback that the speaker has given on her approach to achieving a green new deal.\n\nocasio-cortez has a massive opportunity to emerge as one of the most important figures in the democratic party. when the congresswoman voted for pelosi she made an important statement. she intends to serve as a bridge between house speaker pelosi and the progressive wing of the democratic party despite their disagreements.. rather than being an obstructionist who will do anything to defend her particular views — the tea party model of legislating — ocasio-cortez wants to use her clout to ensure that her generation maintains a place at the table.\n\nof course, it's not inevitable that such an alliance will work.\n\nbut there is a precedent for this kind of intraparty bridge-building. during the 1950s, us sen. hubert humphrey – the minnesota democrat who was elected as a committed liberal in 1948 and a contrast to the anti-civil rights southern democrats – forged an important relationship with senator majority leader lyndon johnson, the texas democrat.\n\nthough johnson thought that humphrey and his cohort of young northern liberals were too extreme for the party and that they were forcing him to deal with divisive issues, the two ended up working closely together in the latter half of the 1950s.\n\njohnson depended on humphrey to serve as his point of communication with younger democrats who wanted the party to deal with issues like civil rights, health care and urban renewal. humphrey was willing to work with johnson — who many younger liberals didn't trust — because he made sure their concerns were being heard by the leadership. the relationship paved a path to the great democratic landslide of 1964, the passage of civil rights legislation and the great society social innovations.\n\nthough it is true that there are many democrats in middle america who would never support ocasio-cortez's basic agenda, republicans and moderate democrats should not underestimate what she brings to the table.\n\nbesides the important function she can serve for pelosi as a bridge to the left, her biography — her youth, her ethnicity, her economic background – embodies why democrats now represent the party of the future as republicans are doubling down on championing a narrowing portion of the population in white, rural america.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nher assertive and confrontational posture to the republicans, grounded in a sophisticated reliance on social media tools like instagram and twitter, offers a refreshing antidote to the previous generation of democrats who were terrified to take on their opponents for fear of looking too extreme. she has enabled her supporters to follow her activities almost every day, bringing congress fully into the age of instagram, according to jessica mendoza of the christian science monitor.\n\nat the same time, if there is anyone who can figure out how to negotiate the different factions within their party it is pelosi, who has repeatedly proven herself to be one of the most formidable legislative leaders in recent political history.\n\nrepublicans can attack ocasio-cortez all they want, dismissing her and mocking her as a lightweight, but they might very well be looking at a major power broker in the new era of capitol hill.
(cnn) as i wrote this, the us capitol building was being stormed by violent right-wing protestors trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nthis was an attempted coup, encouraged by the president of the united states, in an attempt to derail today's congressional certification of the electoral vote that will lead to joe biden's inauguration in two weeks.\n\ndonald trump's legacy is american carnage. our country is far more divided and violent and deluded than before he entered office. his misrule has led to this moment, but it is not his responsibility alone. trump's fear-fueled lies and extremism and conspiracy theories have been indulged for too long by partisans. his rhetoric has directly led to death threats against election officials who have done their job honestly and independently. now we are all reaping what they've sown, as the president watches it all burn from within the white house. but then, there are some men who want to ruin if they cannot rule.\n\nmake no mistake: this is sedition. and it's coming at the hands of self-styled super-patriots who have been amped up by the president's lies about non-existent mass voter fraud to excuse losing a free and fair election by a large margin.\n\nthey are not conservatives -- they are radicals. because patriots don't break the windows of the us capitol building and storm inside when they lose an election. no hostile foreign power has done more damage to what president-elect joe biden called  the citadel of our democracy  since an invading british army burned down the capitol in the war of 1812 . but certainly, the enemies of democracy have taken great comfort from their actions today.\n\nwe are still in the fog of war. but some things are clear. the politicians and hyper-partisans who have coddled this president's autocratic impulses have enabled this assault to our democracy. the republican members of congress -- like senators ted cruz and josh hawley -- who have tried to benefit politically from contesting the election results without any concrete evidence of fraud are culpable in this violence because they have stoked its fears. so is trump's attorney, rudy giuliani, who demanded  trial by combat  to resolve the election dispute at a save america rally this morning, after his legal team lost some 60 cases in court because of an absence of evidence.\n\nthere is no reasoning with conspiracy theorists. there is no negotiating with extremists. the president's lies unleashed this mob. responsible republicans need to condemn it clearly -- or own it forever.\n\nit's stunning but not surprising to see some self-styled constitutional conservatives -- who warned about mob violence and demanded law and order when it came to black lives matter protests - immediately default to rationalizing this violence through a flurry of whataboutism . folks who proclaimed facts don't care about your feelings suddenly seem to care about understanding the feelings of people who commit political violence. that's usually a definition of terrorism -- but these attackers were not contained or confronted or even arrested in large numbers. if they'd been black or left wing or muslim the reaction and calls for violent retribution by the president and his allies would have been deafening.\n\nthe mask has come off. the calls for law and order were really about race. the calls for respecting our democratic traditions apparently apply only to elections that republicans win. the partisan divisions in our country are not about policy or even ideology anymore. it's now about whether you believe in facts and science and even democracy itself. this is what happens when hyper-partisans indulge extremism, lies and conspiracy theories for political expediency.\n\nwhile the capitol building has been ransacked, left undiscussed is the fact that we just marked the deadliest day of the covid-19 pandemic -- adding to the more than 350,000 americans who have died because of trump's denialism and misrule. this is also a mark of trump's american carnage. he is unable to discharge the duties of the presidency without always thinking about himself first. that's why he couldn't bring himself to clearly and immediately condemn this violence. no wonder there are renewed calls -- even from some conservatives like john podhoretz at commentary -- to impeach and remove president trump from office. there is certainly cause even if there is not time.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nwhat's clear even in this fog of war is that donald trump will be remembered as the worst president in american history. character is indeed destiny: his years of divisive lies, corruption and incompetence have led to sedition and violence. it is an urgent reminder that hate can never be channeled into something constructive. golem always ultimately turns on its creator.

craziest, most controversial election in us history.\n\nwe say perhaps because we don't want to bog you down with superlatives when there have been so many truly zany moments in american elections.\n\nwho could forget howard dean screaming like he'd lost a limb, or rick perry forgetting one of the three federal agencies he'd cut if elected?\n\nthen there's the bevy of oh-so-colorful characters, from jello biafra, joan jett blakk and wavy gravy to lee mercer, jack shepard and lyndon larouche. did we mention deez nuts?\n\nto say an election was the craziest or most controversial simply isn't objective. sure, trump has claimed victory despite biden's projected win, questioned the voting system's integrity and suggested he might not step down, but is that more controversial than congress picking a president? that's happened a few times.\n\nwe'll let you decide. so, without any superlatives, here are 11 fascinating elections in american history:\n\n1800: prelude to a duel\n\nphoto: getty images vice president aaron burr killed alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804.\n\nthe outcome of the 1800 contest between thomas jefferson and john adams was so bizarre, the united states had to amend the constitution.\n\npre-12th amendment, electoral college members each had two votes for president, and there were no official tickets. whoever garnered the most votes was president, and second place took the vice presidency.\n\nthough problems with the system were apparent in 1796, the election of 1800 saw jefferson tie with his democratic-republican running mate aaron burr. both had 73 votes to adams'$2 65.\n\ncongress would be called upon to break the tie. enter alexander hamilton, the nation's first treasury secretary, founder of the federalist party and a man who did not care for adams, jefferson or burr.\n\nnonetheless, hamilton engaged in a campaign to convince the federalists to vote for jefferson, his lesser of three evils, writing in a letter that mr. burr loves nothing but himself – thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizement.\n\nthe house of representatives didn't easily arrive at its decision, casting 35 ballots in a week before finally voting to name jefferson the victor and burr the veep on february 7, 1801.\n\nmaking the election all the zanier, the rivalry between burr and hamilton would continue for more than three years before burr, still the sitting vice president, killed hamilton in a duel.\n\n1824: 'corrupt bargain'\n\nphoto: getty images andrew jackson called the 1824 election the corrupt bargain and promised to win in 1828.\n\nthis one was odd from the get-go, if only for the fact that the federalist party was on the cusp of extinction and all four candidates were democratic-republicans.\n\nandrew jackson, a war hero and statesman, won the popular vote by fewer than 39,000 ballots and took 99 electoral college votes. secretary of state john quincy adams secured 84, treasury secretary william crawford won 41 and house speaker henry clay had 37.\n\nwith no candidate earning a majority of the votes, the house again had to settle the deadlock, and jackson was confident he would win the presidency given that he had won the popular vote and electoral college. because the house could choose among only three candidates, clay got the boot.\n\nwe mentioned clay was speaker, yes?\n\nwell, after a month of horse trading, many of clay's supporters shifted their support to adams, who would go on to win the majority of the house vote. maryland, illinois and louisiana, which had cast most of their electoral college votes for jackson, as well as kentucky, where adams did not receive a single ballot in the popular vote, decided to back adams.\n\nafter his inauguration, adams selected clay as his secretary of state. jackson was furious and accused adams and clay of a corrupt bargain. he vacated his senate seat and vowed to win the 1828 election as a washington outsider.\n\nbacked by his new party, the democrats, jackson made good on the promise, besting adams, who by then was a leader in the national republican party.\n\n1860: nation divided\n\nphoto: n. spindler/library of congress a crowd gathers for the inauguration of abraham lincoln on march 4, 1861.\n\nthis election wasn't particularly close. abraham lincoln trounced john breckinridge in an election that had one of the highest voter turnouts of all time.\n\nno, the 1860 election was notable because it ripped the long-dominant democratic party – and thereby, the nation – in half.\n\nthe supreme court's dred scott decision of 1857, essentially legalizing slavery in all u.s. territories, had laid the battleground: the republican party largely opposed slavery but was reluctant to push for its prohibition in states that already had it, and the democrats were unable at their 1860 convention to establish an official party line on slavery.\n\nat a second convention that year, the democrats nominated sen. stephen douglas of illinois, but many southerners in the party defected and selected breckinridge, who was vice president, as their man. both would claim to be the official democratic candidate.\n\nthe constitutional union party, which had formed the year before and staged a campaign that basically ignored the issue of slavery, selected sen. john bell of tennessee.\n\nthe electoral college vote told the story. lincoln snared only 40% of the popular vote, but in the electoral college took most of the north, along with california and oregon. douglas came in second in the popular vote but took only missouri (and three votes in new jersey). breckinridge took most of the south, along with maryland and delaware, and bell's middle-of-the-road policies earned him the middle of the road: tennessee, kentucky and virginia.\n\nweeks after the election, south carolina voted to secede, followed by six more southern states. in february 1861, delegates from those states formed the confederate states of america and selected jefferson davis as their president.\n\nin april, a south carolina militia would take fort sumter, and four more states would join the confederacy.\n\n1872: death of a candidate\n\nphoto: mpi/getty images ulysses s. grant attended horace greeley's funeral after his rival died before the electoral college vote.\n\nset aside that 1872 was the year suffragette victoria woodhull of the people's party became the first woman to run for president. also, forget that writer and abolitionist frederick douglass, her running mate, was the first african-american to be considered for the vice presidency. and never mind this was the year susan b. anthony would be arrested for illegal voting.\n\nno, 1872 was strange because one of the primary candidates never saw the final electoral college vote.\n\nhorace greeley wasn't supposed to put up much of a fight in his bid to unseat president ulysses s. grant, but a schism in grant's republican party made things a little more interesting.\n\ngrant, who led the union armies that defeated the confederacy, had not been so convincing in the oval office. the white house website describes him as out of his element and quotes one visitor who spoke of his puzzled pathos, as of a man with a problem before him of which he does not understand the terms.\n\nsome republicans defected, becoming liberal republicans, and cast their lot with greeley, a democrat who would go on to snare 44% of the popular vote, almost 3 million ballots, despite ending his campaigning to tend to his sick wife, who died a week before the election.\n\nbefore the electoral college could cast its votes, the newspaper founder died november 29, 1872, and 63 of his 66 votes were dispersed among thomas hendricks, who would later become vice president, and other democrats.\n\ngrant attended his rival's funeral.\n\n1876: not-so-independent tiebreaker\n\nphoto: hulton archive/getty images rutherford b. hayes' election as president also marked the end of reconstruction in the south.\n\ndemocrat samuel tilden had beaten republican rutherford hayes. he snared a quarter-million more ballots in the popular vote, and he had 19 more votes in the electoral college.\n\nproblem was, tilden was one electoral college vote away from a majority of 185 votes, and four states composing a total of 20 votes – florida, louisiana, south carolina and oregon – were disputing the results. in the southern states, each party was accusing the other of fraud.\n\nwith no precedent to lean on, the two parties agreed to establish a 15-member commission made up of seven republicans, seven democrats and an independent.\n\nthe independent, supreme court justice david davis, however, was unexpectedly selected by the illinois legislature to serve in the u.s. senate. he was replaced by justice joseph bradley, a diehard republican who would cast every vote for hayes, providing him the 20 votes he needed for a majority.\n\ndemocrats initially threatened to block the decision, but in a backroom deal they agreed to drop their opposition if hayes, among other provisions, removed federal troops that had been in the south under reconstruction.\n\nhayes was sworn in march 5, 1877, and within weeks, he removed the troops. reconstruction formally came to an end, halting the progress african americans had made. it would be decades before civil rights would see serious discussion again in congress.\n\n1920: prison campaign\n\nphoto: getty images eugene debs ran for president five times, the final time from the most unlikely of headquarters.\n\nit was a battle between two newspaper publishers, but the election wasn't terribly exciting. republican warren g. harding handed democrat james cox a historic beatdown, taking more than 60% of the popular vote along with 37 of the 48 states.\n\nthird place is where it got interesting.\n\nlong before bernie sanders faced jabs for his liberal politics, the socialist party of america enjoyed a modicum of support at the outset of the 20th century. that union leader eugene debs ran for president in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912 is somewhat unremarkable, as is the fact he secured roughly 6% of the popular vote in 1912, more than 900,000 ballots.\n\nin 1920, though, debs had to run his fifth campaign from the most unlikely of headquarters: prison.\n\nno stranger to incarceration – he'd served time in connection with an 1894 railroad strike – debs again drew the government's ire in 1918 when he gave an anti-war speech in canton, ohio, in which he pilloried the ruling class who made all the decisions to send the working class to war.\n\nyours not to reason why. yours but to do and die, he said.\n\nhe was convicted under an espionage law and sentenced to 10 years in prison. demonstrations protesting his imprisonment evolved into the may day riots of 1919, and debs was later moved to the atlanta federal penitentiary, from where he conducted his presidential campaign.\n\nhe would again secure more than 900,000 votes – an impressive tally, but not nearly enough to compete with harding, who snared more than 16 million.\n\nthe following year, on christmas, harding commuted debs' sentence to time served.\n\n1948: ultimate 'whoops' moment\n\nphoto: underwood archives/getty images harry truman holds up the chicago daily tribune with a headline of his defeat to thomas dewey in 1948.\n\npresident harry s. truman was done before the election began. you could stick a fork in him, to hear the pundits tell it. the election was new york gov. thomas dewey's. period.\n\nthe 1946 midterms had handed both houses to republicans for the first time in almost 20 years, and opinion polls showed that just one in three americans approved of truman's handling of the presidency.\n\nmaking matters worse, truman's commerce secretary, henry wallace, had revolted over the administration's foreign policy toward the soviet union and declared his intention to run as a third-party candidate.\n\nsouthern democrats also jumped ship over his stance on civil rights, forming the states' rights party – aka the dixiecrats – and electing segregationist south carolina gov. strom thurmond as their candidate.\n\nthe final pre-election gallup poll – interestingly, taken in mid-october and not released until the day before election day – showed dewey beating truman by 5 percentage points.\n\neven on election day, truman recalled an nbc report predicting he would lose. it wasn't until 4 a.m. that his secret service agents woke him to say he had won.\n\nthe chicago daily tribune had referred to truman as a nincompoop on its editorial page in the run-up to the election. poetically, a printers' strike forced the newspaper to publish its morning edition hours earlier than usual, and publisher j. loy maloney took the pollsters' word and signed off on one of the most famous headlines in history.\n\ndewey defeats truman.\n\n1960: dawn of televised debates\n\nphoto: getty images candidates john f. kennedy, left, and richard nixon exchange smiles ahead of their first tv debate.\n\njohn f. kennedy set a lot of precedents when he was elected in 1960. he was the youngest president elected to office, the first at the time to be born in the 20th century. he was also the first catholic president.\n\nthe contest between kennedy and richard nixon, pitting a relatively unknown senator against a two-term sitting vice president, marked another precedent: the first time that presidential debates would be pumped into american living rooms.\n\nthis was important to the vote's outcome because televisions were increasingly part of the american household. eighty-eight percent of homes had them, compared with 11% in 1950.\n\nnixon had recently been hospitalized. he refused to wear makeup, which served to highlight his thin, sickly appearance. he had a 5 o'clock shadow. he wore a gray suit that blended into the background. his appearance left much to be desired, historians would note.\n\nkennedy, on the other hand, was tanned and wore a blue suit and shirt, so he stood out against the studio backdrop. unlike nixon, he spoke to the cameras rather than to his opponent.\n\nthe estimated 70 million people who watched the first of four televised debates, on september 26, 1960, felt kennedy won, whereas the much smaller audience listening on the radio felt nixon was the victor.\n\non november 8, kennedy edged out nixon by 119,000 votes (out of a total of almost 69 million).\n\nthough it's arguable that the debate alone won kennedy the election (he also secured the african-american vote by offering his assistance in getting the rev. martin luther jr. out of prison just weeks before the election), politicians and historians concur this changed the face of campaigns.\n\ntelevised debates made image and appearance primary considerations, and it raised such an unsettling specter for some candidates that it would be 16 years before another presidential hopeful agreed to a televised debate.\n\n1964: mandate on race\n\nphoto: national archives/newsmakers lyndon b. johnson prevailed in the 1964 presidential election, a contest dominated by race\n\nthis is the election that brought us the daisy ad – an attempt to paint republican barry goldwater as too reckless to be put in charge of the country's nuclear arsenal. the ad remains haunting even amid today's supercharged mudslinging.\n\nthe summer of 1964 brought the civil rights act. angry whites protested the legislation across the south, while blacks enraged by police treatment erupted into demonstrations in new york, philadelphia, chicago and other cities.\n\nthe stage was set for extremes, but the election would not hinge on whether goldwater or president lyndon johnson was a more capable commander in chief. race would not only shape 1964's ballot, but it would affect elections for decades to come.\n\nalabama's fiery segregationist gov. george wallace took on johnson for the democratic nomination, and despite the sentiment that white backlash against the civil rights act was a southern thing, wallace received more than 30% of the vote in wisconsin and indiana and more than 40% in maryland in the primaries.\n\nwallace would eventually drop out of the race, but not before causing both goldwater and johnson substantial concerns. goldwater feared wallace would run on a third-party ticket, sinking his campaign, and johnson worried about wallace's strong showing in non-southern states.\n\nwhile goldwater, who had cast his vote against the civil rights act, was painted as a racist, something he had always denied, johnson tried to please everyone.\n\nthat was most evident when the mississippi freedom democratic party, black activists organized by the student nonviolent coordinating committee, showed up at the national convention demanding to be seated because mississippi had run a segregated primary.\n\njohnson would have to broker a deal in which the segregationists were seated at the convention, along with two members of the mississippi freedom democratic party. he would later anger many in the south by selecting hubert humphrey, a staunch civil rights advocate, as his running mate.\n\njohnson would go on to win one of the most lopsided elections ever. goldwater won only his home state of arizona and alabama, georgia, louisiana, mississippi and south carolina. republicans still enjoy a great deal of political dominance in the south to this day.\n\n1972: death (of a campaign) by electroshock therapy\n\nphoto: photo by anthony korody/getty images sen. george mcgovern, right, and running mate sen. thomas eagleton during the 1972 campaign.\n\nit happened in a hasty two-minute phone call.\n\nsen. george mcgovern of south dakota had just won the democratic nomination for president and phoned sen. thomas eagleton to ask him to be his running mate. several high-profile democrats had declined to join mcgovern on the ticket, so he picked eagleton, in part, because he hoped he would help him shore up the catholic vote.\n\nto say eagleton didn't undergo the intense vetting of, say, sarah palin or paul ryan would be an understatement.\n\nhad mcgovern grilled eagleton according to today's standards, he might've learned eagleton's secret: that the senator from missouri had been hospitalized three times for depression and had undergone electroshock therapy on two of those occasions.\n\nwhen rumors first began to surface, mcgovern stood by his running mate but eventually decided that eagleton posed a liability.\n\nduring a news conference at a south dakota state park, where mcgovern was supposed to be relaxing, not campaigning, eagleton revealed his medical history to reporters and explained that he had only recently divulged the matter to mcgovern.\n\non august 1 – 18 days after he was selected – eagleton officially dropped out of the campaign.\n\nrichard nixon would go on to obliterate mcgovern, carrying 49 states and outpacing the democrat by about 18 million votes – thereby striking fear into would-be presidents for decades about who they choose to join them on the ticket.

(cnn) —\n\nlike most successful candidates, president donald trump's rhetoric from the campaign trail now runs up awkwardly against the often dense and arcane language that fills more formal executive actions and memos.\n\nthe impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall he pledged to build on the mexican border has been reduced, on white house stationery, to a physical wall on the southern border. trump has kicked off his administration with a slew of aggressive actions, but it might be hard to tell from the reading.\n\nhere are a few examples of campaign technicolor translated into the black and white of legalistic, government documentation:\n\n1. in february 2016, trump made this promise to a voter in new hampshire.\n\nobamacare is a disaster and we're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with something great.\n\nas the administration and congressional republicans now grapple with doing just that, trump on his first day in office issued an executive order directing federal agencies to back off enforcing the law's mandate. here's what it said:\n\nsec. 2. to the maximum extent permitted by law, the secretary of health and human services (secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under the act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\n\n2. the construction of a wall – not a fence – on the us-mexico border was a cornerstone of the trump presidential bid. appealing to voters, he led chants of build the wall and described the coming barrier like this during first rally:\n\ni will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and i'll build them very inexpensively. i will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and i will make mexico pay for that wall. mark my words.\n\nin the executive order trump signed on wednesday, he delivered the following, rather soberer instructions to the secretary of the department of homeland security:\n\n(a) in accordance with existing law, including the secure fence act and iirira, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;\n\n(b) identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;\n\n(c) project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and\n\n(d) produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of federal and state resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.\n\n3. trump has also issued an executive order aimed at sanctuary cities. back in september 2015, he told a rally in dallas: we have to end this sanctuary cities crap. later in the campaign, he made this declaration:\n\nblock funding for sanctuary cities. we block the funding. no more funds. we will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\n\nand this is what it looked like on paper this week:\n\nsec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the executive branch to:\n\n(a) ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the united states, including the ina, against all removable aliens, consistent with article ii, section 3 of the united states constitution and section 3331 of title 5, united states code;\n\n(b) make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the united states;\n\n(c) ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive federal funds, except as mandated by law;\n\n(d) ensure that aliens ordered removed from the united states are promptly removed; and\n\n(e) support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.\n\nhere's how his opposition to the deal sounded on the stump, at a rally in st. clairsville, ohio, in june 2016:\n\nthe trans-pacific partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country – just a continuing rape of our country.\n\nand this is what the formal departure looked like in a presidential memorandum from january 23. this, after a preamble on the importance of trade and american jobs:\n\nbased on these principles, and by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, i hereby direct you to withdraw the united states as a signatory to the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), to permanently withdraw the united states from tpp negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote american industry, protect american workers, and raise american wages.\n\n5. the keystone xl pipeline, which would deliver more than 800,000 barrels of petroleum daily from the canadian oil sands to refineries on the us gulf coast, was blocked by the obama administration in 2015. trump did not agree with that decision and made it a bone of contention during the campaign. here's what he said last january in iowa:\n\nwhen they do the keystone pipeline – i want it approved, i want all those jobs – i like a lot of oil flow, because right now we're low.\n\nand here's what the announcement that trump would re-open the process looked like in a presidential memo issued this week:
(cnn) lebron james and the nba community have expressed their disappointment after prosecutors decided not to charge any police officer in connection with the shooting of jacob blake.\n\njames, who has consistently used his platform to call for the end of police brutality, said the prosecutor's decision was a blow to the heart and to the gut.\n\nnot only to that community, but to us and to every black person that has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long, he told reporters after the la lakers' win over the memphis grizzlies in tennessee on tuesday.\n\nkenosha county district attorney michael graveley announced tuesday that no kenosha law enforcement officer in this case will be charged with any criminal offense based on the facts and laws.\n\nrusten sheskey, a white officer, shot blake, a 29-year-old black man, seven times in the back while responding to a domestic incident on august 23, 2020. blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nread more

the one who said i should be euthanized. all the other accounts, twitter told me, didn't violate the twitter rules.\n\ni'm an accomplished freelance writer and blogger. but online, and especially on twitter, i'm reduced to an object – literally, a thing to be mocked, ridiculed and shamed. my physical appearance is what those twitter trolls pounce on. immediately.\n\nmaybe they can sense that i've struggled with self-confidence surrounding my disability in the past? maybe they figure it took me a while to come to terms with my disability (spoiler alert: it did)? maybe they just know where to hit me to make it hurt just a little bit more? or maybe they're just sad, pathetic people unhappy with themselves and their own life?\n\ni've asked myself these questions a lot, and, honestly, i'm not sure of the answers. but here's what i do know: all too often, people with disabilities are overlooked when it comes to these kinds of conversations about hate speech online.\n\nwhen we think of hate speech and what sorts of things constitute hate speech, we automatically think of racism and lgbtq issues. what we don't automatically think of are things like ableism and discrimination against people with disabilities, which are rampant in society, to be sure, but sometimes get overlooked. consider the flippant use of the r word – and even a seemingly less offensive word like cripple. even disney villains usually have some sort of facial deformity, which sends the message to children from a young age that disabilities are bad and that people with disabilities are evil or monstrous.\n\nthankfully, though, society's views about people with disabilities are changing, as evidenced not only by twitter's change in policy, but also by apple's plans to add 13 new disability-related emojis to its lineup. everything from a cane to a hearing aid to a person zooming along in a wheelchair is just a starting point, apple hinted recently, saying, currently, emoji provide a wide range of options, but may not represent the experiences of those with disabilities.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\ndisabilities may make people uncomfortable. i'm sure my disability and my wheelchair has made people uncomfortable in the past. but that doesn't give people the right to use it against me and vilify me for it. twitter's change in policy gives me hope. hope that perhaps, finally, we've moved the needle of dismantling centuries of negative misconceptions surrounding people with disabilities. we're not monsters. we're people. and we're not going anywhere – on twitter and in real life.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump walked out of discussions to end a partial government shutdown, now in its third week, calling the talks with congressional democrats a total waste of time.\n\njust left a meeting with chuck and nancy, a total waste of time. i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up, are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier? nancy said, no. i said bye-bye, nothing else works! trump said.\n\ntop congressional democrats blasted trump after the meeting wednesday afternoon, accusing him of indifference to struggling federal workers and not trying to negotiate as the government shutdown drags on.\n\nunfortunately, the president just got up and walked out, said senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york. he asked speaker (nancy) pelosi, 'will you agree to my wall?' she said no. and he just got up and said, 'then we have nothing to discuss,' and he just walked out. again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way, and he just walked out of the meeting.\n\nmeeting sours after candy\n\ntrump was in a chummy mood when he entered the situation room, according to a source familiar with how things unfolded. the president passed out candy to attendees – butterfinger and baby ruth bars as well as m&m's.\n\ntrump told congressional leaders they would find a letter at each of their chairs – a copy of the budget request the office of management and budget had put together for congressional staff in sunday's meeting that laid out the administration's shutdown priorities.\n\nthen, with the letters stating their position in front of them, white house officials asked democrats where their position stood.\n\npelosi informed the president she was concerned about ports of entry, something which he agreed with. trump said there was money allotted in the administration's priority list that beefed up the ports of entry. but homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen, also seated at the table, interjected to say that even if the ports of entry eliminated all drug smuggling, smugglers would find another way in, which is why the barrier structure is important, sparking the most heated exchange of the meeting between pelosi and trump.\n\nschumer jumped in to stress the importance of opening up the government and then negotiating on border security funding from there.\n\nhe at one point asked trump, why won't you open the government and stop hurting people?\n\ntrump responded bluntly, because then you won't give me what i want.\n\na white house official disputes that the president replied with those words. the official claims that trump answered, i gotta get you to do the right thing.\n\ntrump then asked democrats whether, if he opened up the parts of the government that are shut down, pelosi would be willing to build a barrier. she declined.\n\na source familiar with what happened inside the room said trump ended the meeting by standing up and announcing bye-bye before turning and walking out.\n\nafter trump left the room, pelosi and schumer got up to leave. vice president mike pence then asked for a counteroffer from democrats – asking what they are willing to work on, so the white house would have a better idea to move forward. they didn't offer one, something that has frustrated white house officials since they first privately offered less than $5.6 billion the day after the government shut down.\n\nimmigration proposal considered\n\nstaring at a prolonged shutdown, republican senators are privately planning to court democratic senators on an immigration deal that would give trump money for his border wall and include several measures long-sought by democrats, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nfollowing trump's meeting, gop senators privately gathered in sen. lindsey graham's office wednesday to discuss a way out of the logjam. the long-shot idea: propose an immigration deal that would include money for the wall along with several provisions that could entice democrats. those items include changes to help those who are a part of the deferred action childhood arrival program as well as immigrants from el salvador and other countries impacted by the temporary protected status program – as well as modifications to h2b visas.\n\ngop senators pitched the idea to senior white house adviser jared kushner, who said if they came up with a proposal that got trump his border wall money and could pass the senate, the white house would be open to more discussions on the matter, the source said. he did not say trump would endorse such a plan.\n\nthe gop senators – who include graham of south carolina, susan collins of maine, thom tillis of north carolina, lamar alexander of tennessee, rob portman of ohio and lisa murkowksi of alaska – discussed the plan in a hastily arranged meeting wednesday, with several of them now planning to propose the idea to democrats to see if there's a enough support to break the logjam.\n\nbreakdown in talks leads to fiery rhetoric\n\na white house official says no other meeting with pelosi has been scheduled at this time, and a national emergency declaration is still on the table.\n\nthe meeting at the white house came just hours before the house of representatives was expected to vote on individual bills to help reopen the government. the bills aren't expected to go anywhere in the gop-controlled senate at this time but the maneuver is aimed at putting pressure on republicans. trump promised earlier wednesday to veto that legislation if it reached his desk.\n\npelosi, speaking alongside schumer outside the white house, said trump was insensitive to federal workers missing pay during the shutdown and alluded to trump's own privileged upbringing.\n\nhe thinks maybe they could just ask their father for money, but they can't, the california democrat said.\n\nshe added, if you don't understand financial insecurity then you would have a policy that takes pride in saying, 'i'm going to keep government shut down for months or years unless you totally agree to my position.' \n\nsen. dick durbin of illinois, the senate's number two democrat, said after the meeting that it was pretty clear trump's heart was not in it.\n\nhe said today, in the middle of this meeting, 'i don't know why i'm doing this. i didn't want to do this meeting. they told me i had to do this meeting,'  durbin said.\n\ntop republicans spoke to the media after the democratic statements and took issue with their characterization of the meeting, though they did not dispute that trump left the meeting. among them were pence, house minority leader kevin mccarthy of california, house minority whip steve scalise of louisiana and sen. john thune of south dakota.\n\nnotably, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a kentucky republican, did not appear alongside them.\n\npence said trump told the democrats goodbye after pelosi denied his request for a wall, and the vice president contended the move made clear that trump would not end the shutdown without his border measures.\n\nwhat the president made clear today is he is going to stand firm to achieve his priorities to build a wall, a steel barrier on the southern border, add additional personnel, additional resources, additional reforms to stem the crisis that we face on our southern border, pence said.\n\nmccarthy said trump had gone back and forth with pelosi and schumer, and then eventually asked pelosi,  'ok, nancy, if we open the government up in 30 days, could we have border security?' \n\nshe raised her hand and said, 'no, not at all,'  mccarthy recalled. the president calmly said, 'i guess you're still not wanting to deal with the problem.' \n\nwednesday's meeting came a day after trump delivered an oval office address standing by his demand for congress to fund his border wall with mexico and democrats continued to refuse the request. with no apparent end in sight to the disagreement, the shutdown was due to enter its 20th day.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments wednesday.\n\ncnn's lauren fox contributed to this report.
women in traditional korean dress head to the dance. though much of north korea is without electricity, the portraits of the supreme leaders are illuminated brightly.\n\nthis may look like an ordinary scene in any country, huniewicz explains, but in north korea, he feels it challenges a local song about no mother's love being greater than that of the communist party.\n\nthese settlements, captured from a speeding van, appear to be slums outside of pyongyang, according to huniewicz. he speculates that the tourist transport vans slow down when passing what the authorities are proud of showing and speed past less desirable sights.\n\na woman sells postcards, stamps and posters, many featuring themes focused on defeating the u.s. and destroying the white house. huniewicz says he did send one such postcard from north korea to the u.s. and it arrived with no problems.\n\nwho's american here? the museum guide asks. grab the flowers, go to the monument, bow, and lay the flowers there. huniewicz says north koreans told him they single-handedly defeated the u.s. in the korean war.\n\nnorth koreans head down to the pyongyang metro. it's 100 meters underground thus riding the escalator down to the station takes a couple of minutes.\n\nhuniewicz says this is just one of two photos in which he was able to capture a candid smile from local residents.\n\nlondon-based amateur photographer michal huniewicz recently visited north korea as a tourist. he snapped dozens of images during his trip -- some permitted, others not. huniewicz took this photo from the window of a train as he pulled into pyongyang from dandong. it looked like something you would see in a theater, he says. it's a bit too perfect.\n\nstory highlights a north korean senior intelligence officer has become the highest-ranking military official to defect to south korea terence roehrig: north korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities\n\n(cnn) —\n\neditor's note: terence roehrig is professor of national security affairs and director of the asia-pacific studies group at the u.s. naval war college. these views expressed here are the author's alone and do not represent the official position of the navy, the u.s. department of defense, or the u.s. government.\n\na report tuesday that north korea could be preparing to launch a ballistic missile with the potential to hit parts of the united states is just the latest reminder of the continuing tensions on the korean peninsula. the news comes amid a flurry of north korean launches and threats in recent weeks, and amid rumors that pyongyang might be preparing for another nuclear test.\n\nhow seriously should such threats be taken? in many respects, much of this is not a surprise; north korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities. the difficulty, of course, has always been separating rhetoric and reality with a nation from which it is notoriously difficult to secure concrete information.\n\nterence roehrig\n\nbut a series of defections – including one by what is believed to be the highest ranking military officer so far – could offer some useful insights into what is going on there.\n\nover the past few days, the south korean government has taken the highly unusual action of announcing the arrival of a number of high-profile north korean defectors to the south. the defectors include a group of 13 workers from a north korea-owned restaurant in china.\n\nthe north korean government operates more than 130 restaurants in a dozen countries to earn hard currency that is sent back to pyongyang. in addition, government officials also confirmed the defections of two north korea diplomats. one reportedly worked on economic matters in the embassy of an african country and defected in may 2015 with his family, while another diplomat was reported to have defected from an asian nation in february.\n\nmost interesting, though, was the revelation on monday that a high-level military officer who held the rank of colonel defected in 2015. the south korea defense ministry offered few details, but confirmed that he was from the reconnaissance general bureau, or rgb, which was created in 2009 with the merger of several military and party organizations.\n\nthe organization reports directly to north korean leader kim jong un and is responsible for intelligence gathering and espionage, along with the recent addition of cyberoperations under bureau 121. bureau 121 has itself been responsible for hack attacks on several south korean media outlets, government institutions and banks, and is believed by u.s. officials to have been behind the 2014 attack on sony pictures.\n\nsecurity issues\n\nmedia reports indicate the officer may have been in charge of espionage operations in south korea, and he is believed to be the highest-ranking military leader to have ever defected to the south. with all this in mind, it is clear why he could prove to be valuable.\n\nit is difficult to obtain reliable insights information into the inner workings of the north korean government given the opaque nature of the regime. access to a high-level military official familiar with the north korean system and leadership will therefore be an important asset on military and intelligence matters. in short, the defection of such a high-level member of the regime is both a serious security breach and an embarrassment for pyongyang.\n\nbut the announcement of the colonel's defection is part of a larger story. the public acknowledgment of defections is unusual, and government policy has typically been to keep these events quiet so as not to endanger remaining family members in the north (or other defectors that might be en route or considering such a move).\n\nthe south korean government has made the case that these defections are a sign that the economic sanctions imposed in the wake of north korean weapons testing are working, and that people are voting with their feet. conservative media sources, meanwhile, are also making the argument these defections are a sign of serious elite discontent that may lead to instability in north korea.\n\nmore: north korea sentences u.s. student to 15 years hard labor\n\ninstability on the horizon?\n\ncritics say the revelations are political and intended to influence the upcoming national assembly elections by highlighting security issues. they argue that by highlighting the supposed success of recent sanctions, the government is hoping to energize conservative support for the ruling saenuri party.\n\nadding an additional layer of intrigue is a report by the progressive hankyoreh newspaper, which reported that the unification ministry did not want to release information on the defectors, but was forced to do so by the park geun-hye administration. the government has for its part denied there were political motives in announcing the defections, maintaining the high-level nature of these examples and their links to u.n. sanctions and elite discontent were important to reveal.\n\nstill, whatever the truth behind the debate over the release of information, the escape of such a prominent military and intelligence official is important. the colonel will not only be able to furnish valuable information on military operations and tactics, but may also provide better clarity into the strategic thinking of north korea's leadership. moreover, these defections might start to reveal more about elite behavior in north korea. could such defections, for example, be early indicators of political instability?\n\nthe north korean regime will undoubtedly remain a serious security and intelligence challenge for the u.s. and regional allies like south korea, and the information provided by defectors of all levels cannot be taken at face value – it must be examined carefully. but the type of information that could potentially be gleaned from the sources revealed this past week may be one of the few windows we have to improving our understanding of one of the most isolated nations in the world.\n\njoin us on facebook.com/cnnopinion.\n\nread cnnopinion's flipboard magazine.
(cnn) the us set a grim milestone monday as the country recorded over 200,000 new covid-19 cases for seven straight days, according to john hopkins university.\n\nthe nation has never hit this milestone before, jhu data shows. over the last week, the us has tallied over 1.7 million total covid-19 cases and over 20,000 deaths.\n\non top of that, covid-19 hospitalizations have surpassed 100,000 for the last 40 straight days and officials are trying to ramp up the pace of vaccinations across the country.\n\nwe really need to get this vaccine out more quickly, because this is really our only tool, dr. scott gottlieb, former commissioner of the us food and drug administration, said on cbs' face the nation.\n\nexperts have long said the best combined defense against surging cases includes preventative measures such as masks and social distancing -- as well as widespread vaccination.\n\nnearly 9 million people have received their first doses of vaccine against coronavirus in the us and nearly 25.5 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, the centers for disease control and prevention said.\n\nwe don't have a public health infrastructure for mass vaccination, said dr. paul offit, a member of the fda's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee.\n\nmany states are diverging from vaccine prioritization guidelines set by the cdc, according to a report issued monday by the non-profit kaiser family foundation, which studies health care policy.\n\non some level it's understandable and on some level, the more people that are getting vaccine, especially two doses of vaccine -- that's more people who then aren't going to transmit this virus, and we get a greater and greater level of herd immunity, offit said.\n\nas of monday morning, 35.3% of doses distributed had been administered, compared with 30.2% on friday.\n\nhealth officials had hoped to get 20 million people vaccinated by the start of the new year, but the administration of vaccines has met with delays and roadblocks.\n\nwe need to acknowledge that it's not working, gottlieb said sunday of the vaccination plan. we need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get that out to patients.\n\nmore people, sites and online resources for vaccines\n\nas the surge ratchets up infection, hospitalization and fatality numbers across the country, officials are working to make it easier to access vaccinations.\n\ncalifornia gov. gavin newsom promised monday to have one million state health care workers, nursing home residents and staff vaccinated by week's end. this all hands on deck push to get the vaccine to more vulnerable residents comes as the state continues to see an unrelenting surge of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nas of monday, the state has received more than 2.9 million vaccine doses, but administered about 783,000 of them, amounting to just 27% given.\n\nthe announcement came the same day california surpassed 30,000 covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to johns hopkins university data. california is one of only three states to reach the milestone.\n\nin order to loosen the backlog, california plans to use dodger stadium in los angeles, padres stadium in san diego and calexpo in sacramento as mass vaccination sites, and newsom said more large-scale sites will be announced in the coming days.\n\nin new york, more vaccination sites have opened, including more 24/7 sites in new york city. mayor bill de blasio said that he's confident the city will reach its goal of administering 1 million doses by the end of january.\n\non monday, new york state expanded the people eligible for the vaccine to include those 75 and older, first responders, teachers and school workers, public-facing grocery store workers, transit workers and people living and working in homeless shelters.\n\nnew jersey will have a network of about 300 vaccination sites across the state to assist with its covid-19 vaccination plan, state officials said at a news conference.\n\nour objective and aspiration is 70% of the adult population in the state within six months, that's 4.7 million new jerseyans, said gov. phil murphy, speaking at rowan college at gloucester county, one of six mega-site vaccination locations.\n\nthe georgia department of public health launched a covid vaccine locator website in hopes of increasing access in the state that has administered the fewest vaccines per capita, according to the cdc covid data tracker.\n\nthe website will not allow for scheduling but will provide contact information for people to schedule vaccinations once available, according to a news release.\n\nthe cdc updated its guidance monday, saying there's no maximum time between a first and second coronavirus shot.\n\nyou should get your second shot: for the pfizer-biontech 3 weeks (or 21 days) after your first shot; for the moderna 1 month (or 28 days) after your first shot, the cdc said.\n\nyou should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. however, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. you should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. \n\nthe world health organization said last week that people can wait for as long as six weeks between doses. however, pfizer and moderna say they don't have any data on how long people can wait between doses and still get good protection.\n\na deadlier pace than 2020\n\nmore than 28,400 new covid-19 deaths have been reported in just the first 11 days of 2021, according to data from johns hopkins.\n\nat this rate, more people could die from covid-19 in january than in any other month of this pandemic. december had a record high of 77,431 deaths due to covid-19.\n\nin hard-hit arizona, the crisis will get worse, said joe k. gerald, associate professor at the university of arizona's zuckerman college of public health.\n\nwe should expect to set new records for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the coming weeks. policy action is urgently needed to mitigate the worst possible outcome, gerald wrote.\n\nhe also expressed concern about the inevitable arrival of the more highly transmissible strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the united kingdom and has spread to at least 10 us states\n\nas of monday, there have been 72 cases of the new variant, including at least 32 in california, 22 in florida, five in minnesota, four in new york, three in colorado, two in connecticut, and one case each in texas, pennsylvania, indiana and georgia.\n\nif it gathers a foothold, it will accelerate, lengthen, and deepen arizona's outbreak, gerald said.\n\non monday, arizona set a record with 4,997 people hospitalized for coronavirus-related reasons, according to the state's data dashboard. before the winter, the state's record for hospitalizations was 3,517 on july 13, 2020. the state surpassed that record december 11 and the tally of patients has, with a few exceptions, risen every day since then.\n\narizona recently opened a 24/7 site to administer vaccines. the operation at the home of the arizona cardinals nfl team is being overseen by the national guard. adjutant maj. gen. michael mcguire said at a news conference more resources are needed to implement the idea across the state.\n\nbiden gets second shot\n\npresident-elect joe biden received the second dose of the pfizer/biontech coronavirus vaccine on monday at christiana hospital in newark, delaware.\n\nhe received the first dose last month live on national television as part of an effort by his incoming administration to reassure the country of the vaccine's safety.\n\njust watched 100 million vaccine doses in biden's first 100 days 'realistic' replay more videos ... must watch 100 million vaccine doses in biden's first 100 days 'realistic' 02:21\n\nthe president-elect expressed his confidence in the vaccine and encouraged americans to receive one as soon as it becomes available to them.\n\nthe incoming administration is planning to carefully ensure people get their second covid-19 vaccine doses, according to michael osterholm, a member of biden's covid-19 advisory board and director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota.\n\nthe incoming administration is planning very carefully to make sure that that second shot is delivered on time, osterholm said in a washington post live event.\n\nmeanwhile, a new analysis found that states are increasingly abandoning guidelines from the cdc and taking their own approaches to giving people coronavirus vaccine.\n\noverall, we find states are increasingly diverging from cdc guidance and from each other, suggesting that access to covid-19 vaccines in these first months of the u.s. vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives, the non-profit kaiser family foundation, which studies health care policy, said in a report.\n\nin addition, timelines vary significantly across states, regardless of priority group, resulting in a vaccine roll-out labyrinth across the country.\n\ncongresswoman tests positive\n\nus rep. bonnie watson coleman, a new jersey democrat, said monday that she has tested positive for covid-19.\n\na statement from her office said coleman believes she was exposed during protective isolation in the us capitol building as a result of insurrectionist riots. as reported by multiple news outlets, a number of members within the space ignored instructions to wear masks.\n\ncnn has previously reported that six house republicans were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the us capitol insurrection. it's unclear whether watson coleman was in the safe location with those members.
general electric's 110-year run in the dow could be nearing its end.\n\nthe company's unending list of problems led deutsche bank analyst john inch to predict that ge is likely to be dropped from the dow.\n\ninch, a frequent critic of ge, appears to be the first major analyst to make such a call. in his report on wednesday, he cited ge's substantial challenges, including a serious cash crisis, badly slumping power division and efforts to dramatically shrink the sprawling conglomerate. there's also the sec investigation that ge disclosed last week.\n\nge's (ge) cratering stock price, which is hovering near six-year lows, is another issue. while the dow has soared 32% over the past year, ge has lost nearly half its value.\n\nthe committee that runs the dow prefers to have no more than a 10-to-1 ratio between the high and low stock on the index. but the ratio between ge and boeing (ba) is more than twice that today.\n\nthat's important because the dow is weighted by its stock price. most other market indexes are weighted by market cap. so a 1% move in a $350 stock like boeing would move the dow significantly more than a 1% move in $16 stock like ge.\n\nno decisions about booting ge have been announced. it's possible that the committee in charge of the dow's membership may opt to stick with ge.\n\na spokesman at s&p global, which controls the dow, declined to weigh in due to company policy. we do not provide comment on potential adds or drops to our indices as we consider this information to be market moving and material, he said.\n\nrelated: ge is under sec investigation\n\nge is an original member of the dow, the index born in 1896 that is perhaps the most recognizable market metric in the world. but the company was removed and invited back several times, before returning in 1907 where it has remained ever since.\n\ndespite ge's current crisis, there is a case to be made for keeping the stock in the dow. while ge's stock price has cratered, it still boasts a very large market valuation of about $140 billion. that's bigger than seven dow stocks, including mcdonald's (mcd), caterpillar (cat), nike (nke) and american express (axp).\n\nge is also still a massive company, with its fingers in everything from aviation and power plants to healthcare and railroads. corporate filings indicate ge employed about 295,000 people as of the end of 2016, though recent layoffs have reduced its headcount.\n\nhowever, ge is in retreat mode. it long ago parted ways with nbc, universal studios and much of ge capital. now it's planning to jettison its light bulb and railroad divisions. ge is even considering an outright breakup of the company.\n\nit's possible that ge may not be as representative of the broad american economy as it once was.\n\nconsider that ge's stock is plunging even as the u.s. economy gathers momentum and rival industrial companies like honeywell (hon), 3m (mmm) and united technologies (utx) are booming.\n\nit's a great time for industrials, said cowen analyst gautam khanna. the divergent performance for ge is simply egregious.\n\nrelated: ge's $31 billion pension nightmare\n\nge's downfall has been caused in large part by bad decisions under former ceo jeff immelt about where to deploy the company's cash. some acquisitions, like the 2015 purchase of alstom, have backfired badly. instead of shoring up its underfunded pension, ge aggressively bought back stock and paid out a fat dividend that last year had to be halved.\n\ngetting kicked out of the prestigious 30-stock index would be the cherry atop an embarrassment sundae.\n\nif ge were kicked out of the dow, there's no guarantee it would be replaced by another industrial company.\n\nwhen at&t (t) was removed from the dow in 2015, it was substituted by apple (aapl). (at&t has agreed to acquire cnn parent time warner). honeywell (hon) and altria (mo) were replaced in 2008 with bank of america (bac) and chevron (cvx).\n\nthis time, a tech titan like amazon (amzn), facebook (fb) and google owner alphabet (googl) could be swapped in. then again, amazon and alphabet sport stock prices above $1,100, making their inclusion potentially problematic.\n\n--cnnmoney's paul r. la monica contributed to this report.
(cnn) house democrats want you to believe these two things -- at the same time:\n\n1) the threat posed by donald trump is so dire that, if vice president mike pence won't remove him from office this week, then they must immediately vote to impeach the president (again).\n\n2) in order to avoid cluttering joe biden's first days in office with an impeachment trial, they may wait for up to 100 days to send the articles of impeachment to the senate.\n\nif those two ideas seem directly contradictory to you, well, good! it means you are paying attention. because they are directly contradictory.\n\nit can't be both incredibly urgent that the house impeach trump with just more than a week left in his term and totally cool for the house to sit on the articles of impeachment until the biden administration gets off the ground.\n\nread more
washington (cnn) -- sens. john mccain and barack obama showed thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations.\n\nthe presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks.\n\nthe candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by time at columbia university in new york.\n\na coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators time managing editor rick stengel and pbs's judy woodruff.\n\nasked why it seems the terror attacks of september 11, 2001, are fading in the minds of many americans, mccain said:\n\nwe needed at that time [september 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the united states of america.\n\nmccain criticized the bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the american public to live their lives as usual and go shopping.\n\ni would have called them to serve, said mccain.\n\n\n\nthe gop candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in washington and that americans want change in federal government.\n\nthey understand the challenges that we have in this world. they see the russian invasion of the little country called georgia. they see the problems in afghanistan growing larger. they see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them. watch mccain talk about service »\n\nmccain praised the peace corps and americorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive sufficient recognition from washington. but mccain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. asked about compensation for service mccain said:\n\ni'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. but you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... finding new ways to serve. that's what this next few years should be all about.\n\nmccain also fielded a question about his running mate gov. sarah palin's dismissive comments about sen. barack obama's community service in illinois.\n\nlook, gov. palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. that's what she was responding to. of course i respect community organizers. of course i respect people who serve their community. and sen. obama's record there is outstanding.\n\nmccain also said that politics is tough business, and that obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with mccain across america.\n\nobama said his views don't necessarily differ from mccain's on national service.\n\nhe said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well.\n\npart of what makes america work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves.\n\nobama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service.\n\none of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. and so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. i think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now.\n\nobama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers.\n\nthe fact is that we have to have government. when a hurricane strikes, as it did with katrina, we have to have a fema that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job. watch obama talk about service »\n\nnow, that does not crowd out the red cross. that doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. what it means is that each area has a role to play.\n\nthe forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to celebrate the power and potential of citizen service and lay out a plan to address america's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service, according to the organizers' web site.\n\neach presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. mccain was a navy officer for over two decades and often encourages americans to serve a cause greater than oneself.\n\nobama served as a community organizer on the south side of chicago after he graduated from college. in a speech in december, the illinois democrat said he would ask americans to serve if he becomes president. this will be the cause of my presidency, he said.\n\ntoday's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns.\n\nmccain's campaign recently attacked obama for lipstick remarks made during a campaign stop in virginia on tuesday.\n\njohn mccain says he's about change too, and so i guess his whole angle is, 'watch out george bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and karl rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in washington,'  he said.\n\nthat's not change. that's just calling ... the same thing something different. you know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. you know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. we've had enough of the same old thing. watch how tensions are rising on the trail »\n\nthe crowd erupted in applause when obama delivered the line. mccain's campaign said obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate sarah palin, despite the fact that the arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of hillary clinton's.\n\nobama shot back wednesday and accused the mccain campaign of engaging in lies and swift boat politics.\n\ni don't care what they say about me. but i love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics, he said in norfolk, virginia. enough is enough. watch obama deliver his harsh words »\n\nthe phrase swift boat comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group swift boat veterans for truth launched an attack ad campaign against democratic candidate john kerry that was said by some to be false.\n\nbut the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on thursday. they appeared together in new york to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the world trade center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al qaeda operatives plowed into them on september 11, 2001.\n\nthe two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials.\n\nearlier in the day, mccain attended a ceremony in shanksville, pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when united airlines flight 93 crashed in a field there on september 11, 2001. many believe that the hijackers intended to crash flight 93 into the u.s. capitol in washington.\n\nhundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom, mccain said. they -- and possibly i -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.\n\ni've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for america's sake, he said.\n\nthe obama campaign released a statement earlier thursday for its candidate in which he said, we will never forget those who died.\n\non 9/11, americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country, obama said. let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.\n\nmeanwhile, a cnn poll out thursday suggests that voters view mccain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting.\n\nnearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his democratic rival, obama, would be better on the issue.\n\nthe poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.\n\nopinion research corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from september 5-7 for the poll.\n\ntime's michael duffy contributed to this report.\n\nall about barack obama • john mccain • terrorism • september 11 attacks
nicholas kamm/afp/getty images/file\n\nambassador marie yovanovitch has retired, according to a senior state department official. it is unclear when she retired, but the official said it was sometime in the last two weeks.\n\nyovanovitch was a career foreign service officer for more than 30 years, who was pulled from her post as ambassador to ukraine at the order of president donald trump.\n\nyovanovitch is the fourth top state department official who has departed in the wake of the ukraine impeachment inquiry. the others are former us ambassador to ukraine bill taylor, former special representative for ukraine kurt volker, and michael mckinley, the former senior adviser to secretary of state mike pompeo.\n\nnpr was first to report her retirement, which comes about two months after she provided public testimony as part of the house impeachment inquiry. she said she was devastated to find out that trump had discussed her in such a negative way during his call with president volodymyr zelensky in july. she said trump's comments about her sounded like a threat.\n\nyovanovtich did meet with diplomatic security after the revelations earlier this month that robert hyde and lev parnas were discussing surveilling her while she was in kyiv. that investigation has not yet concluded.\n\npompeo has never defended yovanovitch by name. during an interview in ukraine today, when asked if he felt any moral tension about yovanvotich, pompeo said he did not.\n\nwe delivered for the president of the united states on a ukraine policy that will benefit the american people i hope for years and years to come, pompeo said in an abc news interview.\n\nmore background on yovanovitch: in may 2019, yovanovitch was recalled to washington, months earlier than expected. the state department said at the time that yovanovitch was concluding her 3-year diplomatic assignment as planned and that her departure aligned with the presidential transition in ukraine.

washington (cnn) the pentagon's top policy official who warned against withholding military aid to ukraine last year resigned on wednesday at the request of president donald trump, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by cnn.\n\njohn rood, under secretary of defense for policy at the pentagon, is the latest senior national security official involved in the ukraine controversy to be forced out following trump's acquittal in the senate impeachment trial, but sources told cnn that he broke with the administration on several issues, in addition to the handling of aid to ukraine, leading to a loss of support from leadership.\n\nit is my understanding from secretary esper that you requested my resignation from serving as under secretary of defense for policy. senior administration officials appointed by the president serve at the pleasure of the president, and therefore, as you have requested, i am providing my resignation effective february 28, 2020, rood wrote in his letter to president donald trump, dated wednesday.\n\ncnn was first to report rood's impending departure which was confirmed by trump in a tweet wednesday.\n\ni would like to thank john rood for his service to our country, and wish him well in his future endeavors! trump wrote, also sharing a story from bloomberg news which indicated that rood faced pressure to resign from some who lost confidence in his ability to carry out trump agenda.\n\nread more
seoul blocks beheading video\n\n\n\n\n\nseoul, south korea -- the south korean government is trying to block internet access to graphic video footage of the beheading of kim sun-il as public anger grows over his brutal slaying.\n\nthe move comes as president roh moo-hyun on thursday ordered a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding kim's kidnapping and murder in iraq by islamic militants.\n\nsouth korea's ministry of information and communication has introduced a 24-hour monitoring system in a bid to close down any web site that uploads video footage of kim's execution.\n\na tape of the beheading was first posted on an islamic web site and has subsequently made its way onto a number of other sites.\n\nthe tape shows the killing in graphic detail.\n\nthe information ministry has also asked local internet service providers to block the spread of the footage where possible, for fears it could further inflame anti-government passions sparked by the killing.\n\nthe militants believed responsible for the grisly slaying had demanded the south korean government drop plans to send 3,000 troops to iraq in exchange for kim's freedom.\n\nbut seoul was adamant it would not be blackmailed by terrorists.\n\nwhen the nation is in mourning, the ministry felt it was necessary to take strong measures, a ministry official told reuters news agency.\n\nwhen we think it's appropriate, we will take legal actions or request police investigation.\n\nthe ministry shut down a local web site showing images of the killing late wednesday, south korea's yonhap news agency reported.\n\nthe government's policy on troops in iraq is deeply unpopular with many in south korea, a sentiment that has been exacerbated by the kim murder.\n\nkim, a 33-year-old arabic-speaking interpreter, was an evangelical christian who had worked in iraq for a year for a south korean firm supplying the u.s. army.\n\nroh has asked his top advisers for an extensive review into the circumstances surrounding kim's death following media reports that south korea's foreign ministry had been notified of his kidnapping in early june.\n\nthe news of kim's slaying wednesday was met with sorrow and outrage around the world, with south koreans rallying close to the u.s. embassy in seoul, late on wednesday.\n\nkim's body was found by u.s. military police west of baghdad and appeared to have been thrown from a vehicle.\n\nthe man had been beheaded, and the head was recovered with the body,a senior coalition official in iraq said.\n\npentagon sources said the body had been booby-trapped with explosives.

it probably was not necessary to say, close aide and our revolution president nina turner told cnn earlier this week. but the main thing that he said, that i apologize and my senate campaign took steps based on what we learned from 2016, and we plan to do even more – that is what you want somebody to say.\n\nfor both sanders and his team, the spate of allegations have brought front and center both political and organizational challenges awaiting them if, as many believe is likely, he chooses to enter the democratic primary.\n\nif he decides to run again, bernie would have to have a campaign structure which is much more robust with a much bigger leadership team, weaver, slated to become a senior strategic adviser if sanders runs, said on wednesday. it would have to be much more diverse than was the case in 2016, when it was too male and too white.\n\noutside loyalists – including a number of whom are either ideological and political allies or former staffers who support sanders' agenda – who spoke to cnn were uniformly insistent that sanders takes the mistreatment faced by women on his campaign, along with the broader related issues, seriously, even if they doubted his ability to effectively convey it.\n\nin 2020, we're going to see how much bernie has grown from his own limitations in 2016, waleed shahid of the progressive justice democrats, which formed out of sanders' campaign and recruited new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez to run in 2018. can he speak to this constituency of democrats who really care about sexual harassment and me too, who really care about reproductive rights being under attack, that really care about police killings of black men and women and supporting athletes like colin kaepernick? it's all wrapped up in the same thing of, can you authentically speak to these identity and social movements?\n\ni think he's taken lots of steps toward doing that, shahid said, but it is always going to be something that he needs to work on.\n\nprogressive strategist rebecca katz cautioned that sanders had time to improve his posture.\n\nit's january of 2019. there is a long road ahead. his first time out after the news was known was not a good answer, she said. his tweet today was good. his actual answer showed improvement.\n\nkatz also stressed that the behavior on the sanders campaign in 2016 was not unique to bernie.\n\nmaybe the incompetence in how they handled it (on the campaign) was, but this stuff has been going on for decades. frankly, it's that more people have voices now and they are exercising their voice and that's great, she said. team sanders now has to show how the culture there has changed.\n\nbut as political matter, the concerns over sanders' capacity to win over voters outside his core of support have for some progressives come into sharper focus over the last couple weeks.\n\none progressive political strategist and consultant who has worked with our revolution and who requested anonymity to speak candidly about a sensitive subject expressed anxiety over what the strategist viewed as a rhetorical blindspot.\n\ni'm worried that there's a chance that bernie damages the social democratic cause long-term by not being conversant in gender and sexuality and race, the strategist said. i'm not saying he's bad on these issues – that critique is bs, he's actively to the left on almost every single substantive policy issue – but because our system is so individual-focused, he risks giving the people who oppose him on those issues so much ammo.
trump has used past addresses to highlight his administration's victories, target his political enemies and push forward on efforts to fulfill his vision for the country.\n\nthe president is banking on the strong us economy and trade deal victories to carry his reelection campaign to a win in november, and he's sure to highlight his wins on tuesday.\n\nhis approval rating among voters stands at 45% according to a recent cnn poll conducted by ssrs -- no worse than his approval rating in december and the highest it's been since july. and in december, 76% of individuals polled said they rated the economy very or somewhat good, indicating a shifting tide in americans' economic outlook, which had remained tepid in the wake of the recession.\n\nhere's what to watch for during tuesday's state of the union:\n\nimpeachment\n\ntrump aides had once hoped the address would be an opportunity for vindication following a senate acquittal, but the senate won't hold its final vote on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress until wednesday -- the day after the president is scheduled to deliver his speech.\n\nwhite house deputy press secretary hogan gidley said tuesday that the word impeachment is not in the president's state of the union speech, but suggested that it could be added to a later draft.\n\ni've read through the speech, and i've not seen the word impeachment. as he likes to say, 'we'll see what happens,'  he told reporters.\n\nunlike president bill clinton, who apologized to the country after he was acquitted, people close to trump said they anticipated he will continue to proclaim his complete and total innocence\n\ni don't see the president making a big statement one way or another that would indicate anything different than what he's been saying for many months, one republican close to trump said.\n\na senior administration official laying out plans for the speech wouldn't divulge whether the president would bring up impeachment during his remarks, but they did say the speech isn't being written in a vacuum and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the speech to evolve before it's delivered.\n\nmeanwhile, a handful of republican senators said they hope trump steers clear of impeachment talk during his address to the bipartisan audience.\n\nstaunch ally sen. lindsey graham of south carolina said it would be smart to focus on other issues, encouraged trump to be positive and posited that most people are ready to move on from impeachment.\n\ni hope he is, too, because i am, said graham.\n\ncampaign pitch\n\nthe overall theme of trump's speech will be the great american comeback, the senior administration official said. the president is expected to focus on what he sees as victories for his administration through the lens of election issues, such as the economy, health care and national security.\n\nthe official said trump is expected to focus on five areas: blue-collar workers, promoting and supporting families, lowering health care costs, immigration and protecting american families.\n\nthe president is also expected to draw contrast between his beliefs and the proposed policies of democrats.\n\nspecifically, the official said trump is expected to contrast his health care policies with those on the socialist left, presenting a sharp difference with policies such as medicare for all, which has been touted by some democratic presidential candidates.\n\na mixed crowd\n\ntrump's speech is, of course, expected to be delivered in the presence of several members of congress who are often at odds with the administration's policies. however, this year's speech will be a markedly more contentious year between the president and democrats.\n\nit will likely mark the first time trump and house speaker nancy pelosi have been in the same room in months. their relationship became more tense after pelosi began the impeachment proceedings, and, according to a pelosi spokesman, the two have not spoken since the october 16 meeting in which trump insulted pelosi, including calling her a third-grade politician, before she and other top democrats walked out and later accused the president of having a meltdown.\n\nit will also likely mark the first time trump will be in the same room as some of his democratic opponents running for president. he's used recent interviews and speeches to unleash a litany of insults and attacks on his potential opponents, but the official previewing trump's address wouldn't say whether he would do the same while speaking in the senate chamber.\n\ni won't preview if he's going to call anybody out but i think the president would be entirely comfortable with that, the official said.\n\ncoverage of the democrats' iowa caucuses dominated televisions tuesday morning, potentially increasing the odds that trump will use his high-profile speech to swipe at potential rivals.\n\nchecking in on past promises\n\nthe president has used past state of the union addresses to push new policy proposals, such as tax cuts, an infrastructure plan and health care revisions. some of these proposals have been successful, while others have not.\n\nduring the 2019 state of the union, trump called for the great rebuilding of america's crumbling infrastructure. but he held off on moving ahead, saying he would move on it only after the us-mexico-canada trade agreement was passed by congress. he signed the pact into law last week.\n\nin 2018, trump touted the success of his new tax cuts, calling them the biggest tax cuts and reforms in american history and claiming they would be a boon to the economy. however, a combination of the reduced revenues due to the tax cuts and record-setting defense spending helped balloon the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion last year. more recently, the president has said he is considering cuts to entitlement programs as a means of debt reduction.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\neditor's note: frida ghitis, a former cnn producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. she is a frequent opinion contributor to cnn and the washington post and a columnist for world politics review. the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on cnn.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nsomething has changed. president donald trump's headline-hungry governing style has never lacked for drama, but there's a new sense of aimlessness lately in trump's frenetic search for a crisis, his efforts to control the headlines, distract from other events, and keep his base satisfied that he is the muscular fighter who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.\n\nfrida ghitis\n\nin reality, the trump administration is a vortex of incoherence.\n\nin the final weeks of 2018, trump suddenly revived his promise to build a wall with all the concentrated determination of a man fleeing a posse. the promise was never quite dead (the second stanza of the build the wall campaign chant, the part about mexico paying, has faded, drowned by the debunking of nonsensical claims) but two years into the trump administration, the urgency of building a wall exploded onto the scene only after tangible threats to trump looked imminent.\n\nafter winning control of the house of representatives, democrats prepared to launch real investigations into the endless areas of possible corruption and malfeasance in the administration, a development that coincidentally occurred just as the probe into ties between the trump campaign and russia started gushing new damning revelations, with the mueller investigation appearing to zero in on its target.\n\ntrump is flailing badly on foreign and domestic policy. at home, some of his allies are worried, and abroad there is also concern.\n\nat home, the government shutdown over a phony crisis at the border has created a very real crisis for hundreds of thousands of americans, not only the more than 800,000 federal workers at risk of going without a paycheck, or the more than 420,000 who are – incredibly – required to work without pay, but also the millions more who depend on spending by all of those people.\n\ntrump's strategy seems baffling because it is so unnecessarily harmful to individuals, to the country, and even to republicans in congress. already some republican senators have parted ways with him. sen. lisa murkowski has called for an end to the shutdown. sen. susan collins said she's looking for a compromise, something trump histrionically signaled he has no interest in when he walked out of a meeting with democratic leaders. both murkowski and collins were instrumental to ending the 2013 shutdown, conferring with colleagues across the aisle when other republicans wouldn't.\n\ntrump's claim that there's an immigration crisis at the border is refuted by experts. his demonization of immigrants treads a well-worn path of demagogues seeking to invent enemies to build support. and even people who live along the border are skeptical of his claim that a wall is a solution. and yet he has brought part of the government to a standstill over it.\n\nthe shutdown is helping trump keep the latest developments on russia off the top of the news. but it is not making them disappear. just this week, a redaction error in a court filing revealed that paul manafort, trump's campaign chief, passed confidential campaign polling data to a business associate with close links to the kremlin. it is the most powerful public evidence yet of coordination between russia and the trump campaign. separately, the russian lawyer who met at trump tower with donald trump jr. and other top campaign figures, natalia veselnitskaya, was indicted in an unrelated case that offered further proof of her close links to the russian government. the case against trump is becoming more ominous by the day. and that's just a small piece of his troubles.\n\nno wonder trump is throwing everything at the wall, trying to make us look in a different direction, threatening to cut off aid to californians who lost everything in recent fires, saying he will declare a national emergency if he doesn't get his way.\n\nrepublicans see what the rest of us do. the guy is nuts, is what some congressional republicans say about trump privately, according to former democratic sen. claire mccaskill. he doesn't have a grasp of issues, he's making rash decisions, he's not listening to people who know the subject matter.\n\na recent foreign policy example shows the destructive impact of trump's impulsiveness on the global stage, with top administration officials touring the middle east to contain the fallout from his sudden announcement that the united states is pulling out of syria. american troops, he unexpectedly announced, are coming back now. we won.\n\nthe december announcement sent shockwaves. almost every expert said it was a mistake. defense secretary james mattis, one of the administration's most respected officials, resigned in protest, with a letter that castigated trump's conduct of foreign policy. the syria plan seemed to contradict every foreign policy objective trump had claimed to embrace. it was a boon to iran, a gift to isis, a potentially deadly blow to america's kurdish allies, and a weakening of support for israel.\n\nthen started the backtracking, the meandering, the confusion so astonishingly unseemly for the world's most powerful nation. the now turned into a little later, maybe four months. national security adviser john bolton said us forces would leave, but only after isis was really defeated (never mind we won) and after guarantees that turkey would not attack the kurds.\n\nturkey was furious. when bolton traveled to turkey, president erdogan snubbed him, refusing to meet. secretary of state mike pompeo then gave yet another version of washington's plans for syria, creating even more confusion.\n\nprofessionals in government have been trying to keep a semblance of sound and coherent policygoing, but when trump becomes directly involved, rationality can disappear. trump's faith in his gut, his narcissistic belief that he knows more than people who have dedicated their lives to understanding complex issues, propelled by his compulsion to be the center of attention and his goal of obscuring reality and distracting from his growing troubles, adds up to a destructive policy muddle.\n\nthat's one reason he can't fill key positions. mattis was only one of many top figures to leave. after chief of staff john kelly (the last one of what trump called my generals) left the administration, the president went through an embarrassing spectacle trying to replace him. now many of the most important jobs in government are temporarily filled by interim or stand-in acting officials.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\ntrump is trying to look tough, but his actions betray nervousness, fear. the news that michael cohen, trump's former lawyer, will testify publicly before congress in february is likely to become yet another thing from which the president will try to distract us. his apparent belief that a national border crisis protects him from his troubles represents a very real crisis of presidential leadership for the country.

compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. so let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\n\nciti double cash\n\nbest overall card for cash back\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the citi double cash card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\n\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nexpert users can convert the cash back to citi thankyou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the citi prestige® card or citi premier℠ card.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: none.\n\nwhat we like about the citi double cash: when compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the citi double cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. with this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. there's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\n\nthe citi double cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). and you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\n\nrelated: read cnn underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\n\nexperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium citi thankyou credit cards, such as the citi premier or citi prestige. that's because if you also have a premium thankyou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the citi double cash to citi thankyou points and then transfer those points to one of citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the citi travel portal with the citi premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after april 21, 2021).\n\none thing that could be better: although the citi double cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. this can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\n\nyou'll also find that the citi double cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. this is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\n\nwhy it's our benchmark card: the ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the citi double cash are why cnn underscored currently uses the double cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\n\nyou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the citi double

blue cash preferred credit card.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the blue cash preferred card from american express earns 6% cash back at us supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\n\nthis card is right for: people who spend a significant amount of money at us supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 6% cash back at us supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select us streaming subscriptions.\n\nearn 3% cash back at us gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\n\nearn 1% cash back on everything else.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\npurchase protection and return protection.\n\ncar rental loss and damage insurance.\n\nterms apply.\n\nwelcome bonus: earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\n\nwhat we like about the blue cash preferred: for many americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. the blue cash preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\n\nnot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your us streaming subscriptions. this includes over 20 different providers, such as disney+, hbo, netflix, spotify and youtube tv, among others. and when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\n\nrelated: earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\n\nthe blue cash preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. as long as you used your blue cash preferred to pay for it, american express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\n\none thing that could be better: many of the bonus categories on the blue cash preferred are limited to purchases made within the united states. there's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. and the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\n\nthe blue cash preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. but if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the blue cash everyday® card from american express instead.\n\nwhile the blue cash everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at us supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. that means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\n\nrelated: amex blue cash preferred vs. amex blue cash everyday.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to citi thankyou travel points when combined with the citi prestige card or citi premier card.\n\nlearn more and apply for the blue cash preferred

sentence: the new chase freedom flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\n\nthis card is right for: people who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 5% cash back on travel purchased through chase ultimate rewards.\n\nearn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nearn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nearn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\n\nearn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\ncash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select chase ultimate rewards cards, such as the chase sapphire preferred card\n\ncell phone protection.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the chase freedom flex: while you might sign up for the chase freedom flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\n\nthe chase freedom flex earns 5% on travel booked through chase ultimate rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. and even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\n\nbut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. for the current quarter from january through march, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, the rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\n\naside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other chase cards. one of our favorites is cell phone protection. as long as you use your chase freedom flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. this is currently the only no-annual-fee chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\n\none thing that could be better: while there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5%

earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at costco and other gas stations.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the costco anywhere visa card by citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all costco and costco.com purchases.\n\nthis card is right for: costco members who want strong rewards when buying at costco and filling up their gas tank.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\n\nearn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\n\nearn 2% cash back on all costco and costco.com purchases (other than costco gas).\n\nearn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\npurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: none.\n\nwhat we like about the costco anywhere visa: for those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the costco anywhere visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\n\nearning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. and aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\n\nthe costco anywhere visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. you'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for new york residents). the coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\n\nthe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at costco. but even while costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\n\nalso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your costco anywhere visa as your payment method.\n\none thing that could be better: one big disadvantage of the costco anywhere visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your february billing statement closes each year. the certificate can be redeemed for costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by december 31 of that calendar year.\n\nalso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. also, the costco card is a visa credit card, which is accepted at costco in-store and at costco.com — mastercards like the citi double cash are not accepted in-store.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: with the citi double cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\n\nread our complete costco

we hear a lot about how college is expensive, but many folks don't realize quite how costly a degree can be these days. according to the college board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2016-2017 school year looked something like this:\n\n$9,650 for in-state public colleges\n\n$24,930 for out-of-state public colleges\n\n$33,480 for private colleges\n\nof course, that's just one piece of the puzzle. room and board -- an oft-necessary component of college attendance -- averages $10,440 at public colleges and $11,890 at private ones.\n\nwhen we look at these costs, it's easy to see why so many low- and middle-income families struggle to pay for college.\n\nbut for a large number of higher earners, most universities are out of reach as well. according to research by the institute for higher education policy (ihep), even families earning over $100,000 a year can't afford nearly 60% of u.s. colleges.\n\nnow ihep defines affordability as the means to pay for college after saving 10% of one's discretionary income for the 10-year period leading up to college, combined with earnings from a student working 10 hours per week during college.\n\ngiven that most folks are advised to save 10% of their income for retirement, setting aside another 10% for college is a pretty tall order. it's therefore demoralizing to learn that even those who manage to hit that threshold still wind up falling short in terms of being able to afford most learning institutions.\n\nthat said, just because some folks might very well be saving 10% of their income for college doesn't mean that they're saving in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nand that could spell the difference between affording college or winding up with a ridiculous pile of debt for privilege of having a child attend the university of his or her choice.\n\nfind a smarter way to save\n\nwhile setting aside money for college is a smart move off the bat, where you put that cash could have a huge impact on your eventual ability, or lack thereof, to pay those bills.\n\nfidelity investments reports that about 40% of families are now saving for college via a 529 plan, which represents an increase from previous years. and while 529s are by no means the only option for saving for college, they're a far more efficient route than savings and traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nthough you don't get an immediate federal tax break for contributing to a 529, once you fund an account, that money gets to grow tax-free. as long as you use that money for qualified higher education purposes, you'll get to keep your ending balance in full.\n\ntraditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. this means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.\n\nthen there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. these days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool.\n\nrelated: how should i save for my kid's college education?\n\nimagine you earn $100,000 a year, and sock away 10% of that, or $10,000 annually, for 10 years. with a regular old savings account, you'll grow your college fund to roughly $104,000 -- not all too impressive considering that $100,000 of that stems from principal contributions.\n\non the other hand, if you save in a traditional brokerage account or 529, your investments might very well generate an average annual 7% return, which would leave you with $138,000 after 10 years' time.\n\nhere's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. with a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs.\n\nnow one major drawback of opening a 529 is that if you don't end up using that money for qualified purposes, you'll face a 10% penalty on the gains portion of your account. it's for this reason that you might consider other college savings avenues, like a roth ira, if you're eligible to open one. (even if you can't fund one directly, you can always convert a traditional ira to a roth.)\n\nrelated links:\n\n• motley fool issues rare triple-buy alert\n\n• this stock could be like buying amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 people are clueless about this trillion-dollar market\n\nno matter how you decide to save for college, you should do so in a manner that lets you maximize your gains and minimize your taxes. even if you're a relatively high earner, covering the cost of college is likely to be a challenge, so the smarter you are about how you save, the better your chances of meeting your ultimate goals.

(cnn) —\n\na national fraternity and four men are expected to be sentenced monday for charges related to the 2013 hazing death of baruch college student and fraternity pledge chun michael deng. experts say the punishment could influence other cases that involve hazing deaths.\n\npi delta psi inc. was found guilty in november on a felony count of involuntary manslaughter, among other charges, though it was acquitted of the more serious charges of third-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n\nphoto: wnep chun michael deng\n\nin may, four pi delta psi members – kenny kwan, raymond lam, charles lai and sheldon wong – pleaded guilty to felony charges of voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension in deng's death, which was the result of a hazing ritual.\n\nthe case bears numerous similarities to the february death of timothy piazza, a fraternity pledge at penn state university who died after consuming an excessive amount of alcohol then engaging in a hazing ritual similar to the one that killed deng. legal experts wonder if the pi delta psi case could have an impact on the piazza case.\n\nat the time of deng's death, baruch college said that deng died participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event that the school had no knowledge of, adding it had a zero tolerance policy regarding hazing.\n\npi delta psi ended its affiliation with its baruch college colony, saying it had violated the values and rules of our organization. individual members involved also had their fraternity memberships revoked.\n\naccording to its website, the asian-american fraternity has a presence on at least 25 college campuses across the country, most of which are based in the northeast.\n\npi delta psi inc. and its lawyer did not respond to cnn's requests for comment.\n\nthere can be no question that the death of michael deng was tragic, said todd greenberg, an attorney for lam.\n\nto a lesser extent it's also a tragedy for mr. lam and the other young men. they never intended for this to happen, he said, adding lam had been guilt ridden for his conduct since the day it happened.\n\nan attorney for wong told cnn, sheldon remains, and will always be, deeply saddened and devastated by michael deng's death.\n\nlawyers for the two other individuals could not be reached for comment sunday.\n\nphoto: monroe county da/monroe county da's

2013 during pi delta psi's crossing over weekend for pledges, according to a criminal complaint. the fraternity chapter held the event at a rented house in pennsylvania's pocono mountains.\n\nit was there deng ultimately suffered and died from a traumatic brain injury while participating in the glass ceiling, a ritual that required pledges to run through a line of fraternity brothers who shoved, pushed and tackled the aspiring members to the ground.\n\nphoto: wnep the house rented by the baruch college colony of pi delta psi in december 2013.\n\nat some point, deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a weighted backpack, fell, struck his head and was immediately unconscious, according to police. some fraternity members placed deng by a fire while others searched the internet for his symptoms and tried to wake the pledge.\n\nmeanwhile, the criminal complaint said, other fraternity members were told by a member and the national fraternity president to protect the fraternity and hide all the memorabilia from police – including clothes, fraternity paddles, banners and signs. they were also instructed to conceal cellphones, marijuana and mushrooms, the complaint said.\n\ndeng arrived at a nearby hospital for treatment 2 hours after he was injured – a delay that a forensic pathologist concluded significantly contributed to the death of mr. deng, the complaint said.\n\ndeng's death was ruled a homicide, with forensic analysis revealing at least three clear impacts to the head, rendered by forces considered significant and severe.\n\nit would take hundreds of pounds of impulsive loads and/or hundreds of g forces in order to cause the damage to the interior of the brain, the criminal complaint said.\n\nsetting precedent\n\nfour fraternity pledge deaths in 2017 overshadowed the case against pi delta psi and its members. however, experts say university communities across the united states will be paying close attention to monday's sentencing for indications of how other cases may be handled.\n\npledge deaths are being investigated on the campuses of louisiana state university, florida state university and texas state university.\n\nprosecutors in the february death of penn state beta theta pi pledge timothy piazza, in particular, will be watching the deng case closely. the similarities in the two cases could mean that the deng outcome effects the course of the piazza prosecution.\n\npiazza died as the result of a hazing ritual called the gauntlet, which involved pledges drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. afterward, piazza fell several times, resulting in a traumatic brain injury and a laceration in his spleen that ultimately proved fatal.\n\neven after it was clear he needed medical attention, fraternity members didn't call for help for at least 12 hours. a criminal presentment in the case detailed an alleged coverup, in which pledges were told to clean up evidence of alcohol and keep quiet about what happened. one member allegedly deleted video evidence from inside the house as police came to collect it.\n\nstill, there are crucial differences – particularly the role of alcohol. whereas piazza consumed at least 18 drinks in 82 minutes, according to video surveillance, deng's toxicology report revealed no alcohol or other substances of abuse.\n\nphoto: patrick carns photography timothy piazza, center, and his parents\n\ndoug fierberg, an attorney for deng's family, said prosecutors in the piazza case could learn from the outcome of the deng case and pi delta psi case sentencing.\n\nthese are two of the higher-profile circumstances involving the prosecution of hazing, said fierberg. prosecutors in the piazza case, he said, might as well learn from the outcome of the deng case.\n\nfierberg said he expects the deng case will help clarify some things ahead of the piazza case and could set a number of precedents.\n\nnumber one, fierberg said, national fraternities can and should be held criminal and civilly responsible for the injury and death caused by their members. the criminal prosecutions shows that can happen and should proceed that way and they can be convicted.\n\nin regard to civil responsibility, fierberg said the deng case will show fraternities can carry the blame, and not just individual students who were involved.\n\nthere are reasons why young men die year in and year out at fraternities, fierberg said. and the ability to reduce those incidents rests within the control of the national fraternities and universities, not solely in the lap of the men who are on the ground.\n\nnot all legal experts believe the pi delta psi case will impact the piazza case.\n\nmonroe county assistant district attorney kimberly metzger, the prosecutor in the deng case, said on friday the two cases are very different and that it would be inappropriate to comment on what (prosecutors in the piazza case) might learn from our case.\n\na 'chilling effect'\n\nthe outcome of the pi delta psi case could also have an impact beyond pennsylvania, said cnn legal analyst joey jackson, who predicted a chilling effect on universities and fraternities nationwide.\n\ni think there's a reckoning here, jackson said, comparing the attention placed on recent hazing deaths to last year's #metoo movement, which became a tipping point in how the public addresses sexual misconduct.\n\nfor whatever reason, this has reached a crescendo, and we're focused on it now, jackson said. i think you will see forceful prosecutions in other jurisdictions and i think they can learn a lot from prosecutions in pennsylvania. universities, he said, will pay attention.\n\nhank nuwer, a journalist and professor at franklin college in indiana who has been tracking and writing about hazing deaths since the 1970s, agreed with jackson's assessment.\n\nnuwer said the verdict against pi delta psi and looming sentence strengthens the arsenal for cases like piazza's and others involving hazing.\n\nparents of victims and activists don't think there's enough being done in these cases, nuwer said, and are pressuring courts to take a harder look at hazing deaths than they have in the past.\n\n03:40 - source: cnn parents open up on son's hazing death\n\njudges are taking it more seriously, said nuwer, adding that lawyers who didn't know how to bring a case against fraternities in the past now have greater understanding of how to handle such cases.\n\ni'm seeing huge changes from 1978 when my first article appeared, he said. these are important cases right now. that's going to be interesting to see how magistrates and juries look at fraternities now.\n\nhopefully, jackson said, whatever sentence pi delta psi receives, it deters other fraternities and ensures they enact policies to protect members and pledges.\n\nthey'll learn from the lessons of pennsylvania, jackson said. you're going to see aggressive prosecutions until this stops and that's the way it is.\n\ncnn's sara ganim contributed to this report.
this story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs.\n\n(cnn) flags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with trump 2020 banners and american flags at wednesday's riot at the us capitol.\n\nthe pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day -- from passionate and peaceful trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions.\n\nthe mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about.\n\nthe certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. the initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by president trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.\n\nthis was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow, mark pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the anti-defamation league said.\n\ncnn spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-semitism and hatred they portray.\n\nnoose and gallows\n\nwhile a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. it is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly vice president pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged, he explains.\n\nthat treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event.\n\nthree percenters flag\n\nthe three percenters (also known as iii%ers, 3%ers or threepers) are part of the militia movement in the united states and are anti-government extremists, according to the adl.\n\nlike others in the militia movement, three percenters view themselves as defending the american people against government tyranny.\n\nbecause many adherents to the militia movement strongly support president trump, in recent years, three percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, muslims and immigrants, according to the adl.\n\nthe group's name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the british during the revolutionary war.\n\nthe flag seen above is their logo on the traditional betsy ross flag. pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt america's first flag.\n\nrelease the kraken flag\n\nthe flag references former trump lawyer sidney powell's comments that she was going to release the kraken. powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that joe biden won the presidency.\n\nthe kraken, a mammoth sea creature from scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. the kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. on social media, qanon conspiracy and fringe sites #releasethekraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud.\n\nthe proud boys and the ok sign\n\nthe far right has co-opted the ok sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. the adl added that symbol to its long-standing database of slogans and symbols used by extremists.\n\na photo from the riot at the us capitol shows several people making the ok hand gesture.\n\nsome of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the proud boys, specifically the arizona chapter.\n\nthe man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the capitol saying support your local proud boys.\n\nin the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, they wanna know what the orange hats stand for.\n\none man replies that it's a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: it stands for the best f*cking chapter in the best f*cking organization in the world.\n\nasked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: the proud boys.\n\nthe proud boys has been supportive of president trump and present in large numbers at stop the steal rallies in washington, dc. the proud boys' leader, henry tarrio, who goes by enrique tarrio, was released from police custody tuesday on charges related to allegedly burning a black lives matter banner taken from a black church last month during protests in the city after a stop the steal event. tarrio has admitted to cnn he did burn the banner. he was ordered by a local judge to stay out of dc as he awaits trial, including during this week's protests.\n\nkekistan flags\n\nthe green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for kek, a fictional god they also created. it has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies.\n\nthe kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke, pitcavage explained. younger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the kekistan flag at rallies and events.\n\naltered historic flags\n\naltered confederate and gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the capitol. one confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan come and take it to convey an anti-gun control message. the phrase come and take it paraphrases the come and take them retort uttered by spartan king leonidas at the battle of thermopylae when the persian king xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, pitcavage said.\n\nthe gadsden flag, which is known to many as the don't tread on me flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the american revolution. the flag and symbol are also popular among libertarians. but it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.\n\noath keepers\n\na man is seen wearing an oath keepers hat inside the capitol after it was breached. the oath keepers is a pro-trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. the group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police.\n\ntheir leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on election day during an interview with far-right conspiracist alex jones and said his group would be armed to protect the white house if necessary, according to the adl.\n\nthe confederate flag\n\nduring the united states' long civil war, no confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the us capitol, but on wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls.\n\nphotographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist charles sumner and slaveholder john calhoun.\n\nthe flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. after world war ii, it became a prominent symbol of jim crow and segregation, pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists -- even outside the united states.\n\namerica first flag\n\na rioter cloaks himself in an america first flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator nick fuentes. fuentes attended the event at the capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the capitol building.\n\namerica first was also a slogan president trump used in describing his foreign policy . its adoption was criticized by the adl, which said it had an anti-semitic use seeking to keep the us out of world war ii.\n\nthe adl says fuentes is part of the groyper army, which the adl calls a white supremacist group.\n\nwhile the group and leadership's views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with 'christianity' and 'traditional' values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family, the adl explains. like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the 'true america' -- a white, christian nation.\n\ncamp auschwitz\n\na rioter inside the capitol wore a camp auschwitz sweatshirt. the bottom of the shirt reads work brings freedom, which is the rough translation of the words arbeit macht frei on the gates of the nazi concentration camp. auschwitz was the largest and most infamous nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during world war ii.\n\npitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website aryanwear. the design, which has been around for about 10 years according to pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made.\n\nnationalist social club stickers\n\na social media image shows nationalist social club stickers on what appears to be us capitol police equipment it's unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted wednesday in a telegram chat the group uses, which includes a nazi symbol as part of their name.\n\nnsc, apparently a word play on the national socialists or nazi party, is a neo-nazi group that has regional chapters in both the united states and across the globe, according to the adl . it is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a new england chapter, or because the group originally called itself the new england nationalists club.\n\nnsc members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race, according to the adl. their goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.\n\nmaga civil war january 6, 2021 shirts\n\nthere are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the capitol happened and who led the charge. but the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles.\n\nthe shirts worn by these men on the capitol grounds on wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. they wore pre-printed shirts, referencing trump's signature make america great again slogan, alongside the words civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection.\n\nmany commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired.\n\nupdate note: this story has been updated with new cnn reporting on the men pictured in orange hats who say they are affiliated with the proud boys.
exxonmobil xom\n\na federal judge in manhattan on thursday dismissed exxon's lawsuit claiming officials in new york and massachusetts were pursuing bad faith investigations in violation of the oil giant's constitutional rights.\n\nus district judge valerie caproni called exxon's position implausible.\n\nexxon has asked two federal courts—first in texas, now in new york—to stop state officials from conducting duly-authorized investigations into potential fraud, she wrote. it has done so on the basis of extremely thin allegations and speculative inferences.\n\nexxon maintained in the lawsuit that the attorneys general in new york and massachusetts worked behind the scenes with environmental groups, who were attempting to promote litigation against fossil fuel companies. it also said the state officials tried to squash exxon's right to free speech and dissenting opinions on climate change.\n\nexxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the ruling.\n\nin a statement, new york attorney general eric schneiderman, who opened an investigation into exxon's historical knowledge of climate change in 2015, praised the decision.\n\nhe said the lawsuit wrongfully attempted to thwart a serious state law enforcement investigation into the company.\n\nschneiderman and massachusetts attorney general maura healey are investigating whether exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, misled investors and the public about its knowledge of climate change and the potential effects that climate change may have on its business.\n\nharvard study: exxon 'misled the public' on climate change for nearly 40 years\n\nthe attorneys general are looking into whether exxon's past securities filings were misleading because they failed to disclose the company's internal projections regarding the potential costs of climate change and expected environmental regulations.\n\nexxon filed a lawsuit against the new york and massachusetts officials in 2016, claiming the probes were part of a conspiracy to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change.\n\nexxon is also facing lawsuits from san francisco, oakland and other municipalities in california, which have demanded the company and its rivals pay billions of dollars to cover damage from looming sea level rise due to climate change.\n\nexxon gives up major climate change fight\n\nexxon argues that the california cities and counties have contradicted themselves by admitting in bond sales that climate change risks are unpredictable.\n\nfederal law requires companies and governments to reveal risks to investors before selling securities like stock or muni bonds.\n\nand in late 2017, after years of resisting, exxonmobil agreed to reveal the risks it faces from climate change and the global crackdown on carbon emissions.\n\nexxon said the disclosures will include how the company is positioning for a lower-carbon future and how its business could be hurt by shifting energy demands.\n\n--cnn's jackie wattles and matt egan contributed to this report

(cnn) — it's been a two-horse race this year to be named the world's most powerful passport, with both top contenders in asia.\n\ngoing into the final quarter of 2019, japan and singapore held onto their position as the world's most travel-friendly passports.\n\nthat's the view of the henley passport index , which periodically measures the access each country's travel document affords.\n\nsingapore and japan's passports have topped the rankings thanks to both documents offering access to 190 countries each.\n\nsouth korea rubs shoulders with finland and germany in second place, with citizens of all three countries able to access 188 jurisdictions around the world without a prior visa.\n\nfinland has benefited from recent changes to pakistan's formerly highly restrictive visa policy. pakistan now offers an eta (electronic travel authority) to citizens of 50 countries, including finland, japan, spain, malta, switzerland and the united arab emirates -- but not, notably, the united states or the uk.\n\nrelated content passports for purchase: open citizenship doors around the world\n\nthe european countries of denmark, italy and luxembourg hold third place in the index, with visa-free/visa-on-arrival access to 187 countries, while france, spain and sweden are in the fourth slot, with a score of 186.\n\nfive years ago, the united states and the uk topped the rankings in 2014 -- but both countries have now slipped down to sixth place, the lowest position either has held since 2010.\n\nwhile the brexit process has yet to directly impact on the uk's ranking, the henley passport index press release observed in july, with its exit from the eu now imminent, and coupled with ongoing confusion about the terms of its departure, the uk's once-strong position looks increasingly uncertain.\n\nthe united arab emirates continues its ascent up the rankings, up five places to rank 15th.\n\nit's the strongest climber this quarter, lorraine charles at cambridge university's centre for business research says in the october release.\n\nwhile the uae may not be able to compete with saudi arabia -- the regional hegemon -- in terms of military strength and economic power, the projection of its soft power is uncontested in the gcc.\n\nat the other end of the scale, afghanistan is once again at the bottom of the rankings, with its citizens needing a prior visa for all but 25 destinations worldwide.\n\ndr. christian h. kaelin, chairman of henley & partners and the creator of the passport index concept, says in the july release: with a few notable exceptions, the latest rankings from the henley passport index show that countries around the world increasingly view visa-openness as crucial to economic and social progress.\n\njapan has held onto the top spot throughout 2019. toshifumi kitamura/afp/getty images\n\nthe best passports to hold in 2019 are:\n\n1. japan, singapore (190 destinations)\n\n2. finland, germany, south korea (188)\n\n3. denmark, italy, luxembourg (187)\n\n4. france, spain, sweden (186)\n\n5. austria, netherlands, portugal (185)\n\n6. belgium, canada, greece, ireland, norway, united kingdom, united states, switzerland (184)\n\n7. malta, czech republic (183)\n\n8. new zealand (182)\n\n9. australia, lithuania, slovakia (181)\n\n10. hungary, iceland, latvia, slovenia (180)\n\nthe worst passports to hold\n\nseveral countries around the world have visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to fewer than 40 countries. these include:\n\n100. lebanon, north korea (39 destinations)\n\n101. nepal (38)\n\n102. libya, palestinian territory, sudan (37)\n\n103. yemen (33)\n\n104. somalia, pakistan (31)\n\n105. syria (29)\n\n106. iraq (27)\n\n107. afghanistan (25)\n\nother indexes\n\nhenley & partner's list is one of several indexes created by financial firms to rank global passports according to the access they provide to their citizens.\n\nthe henley passport index is based on data provided by the international air transport authority (iata) and covers 199 passports and 227 travel destinations. it is updated in real time throughout the year, as and when visa policy changes come into effect.\n\narton capital's passport index takes into consideration the passports of 193 united nations member countries and six territories -- roc taiwan, macau (sar china), hong kong (sar china), kosovo, palestinian territory and the vatican. territories annexed to other countries are excluded.
there were just two words i uttered after job offers early in my career: thank you.\n\ni never negotiated for more money. if i did think about it, i quickly worried that i would anger my future employer if i even asked.\n\nto prevent women from making that mistake and to help narrow the gender pay gap (women still make around 80 cents for every dollar a man makes), the american association of university women (aauw) is providing free salary negotiation workshops. over 30,000 women have completed them since 2015, according to the aauw.\n\nnow the goal is to train as many as 10 million women by 2022, by bringing workshops to more cities and states, and releasing a free online training tool, which will be available this summer. currently, workshops are available in boston, washington, dc; tempe, arizona; long beach, california; san francisco and various cities in massachusetts.\n\ni think too many women unfortunately just don't talk about this enough, said kimberly churches, chief executive officer of aauw. it's a muscle and it takes practice to learn negotiation skills and if you're not already in a sales job, that becomes even more trying.\n\nbased on a study conducted in boston, where aauw first started doing the workshops in collaboration with the boston mayor's office, the extra training helps. nearly half of the women who completed workshops in the first year either negotiated a pay raise at their existing job or a competitive starting salary at a new position, according to the report by the center for women in politics and public policy.\n\nrelated: #metoo and #timesup have pushed 48% of companies to review pay policies\n\nhourly workers are negotiating and receiving $2 to $3 more per hour and salaried workers are getting 20% to 30% higher salaries after the workshops, said churches.\n\nsabrina antoine, 29, attended a free workshop in her boston neighborhood. during the two hours, she learned how to define the values she brings to a company, conduct research to understand her value in the marketplace and practice asking for more in role play sessions.\n\nthe biggest piece about negotiating your salary for women particularly is that there is a sense of 'i am not enough' and so ... a lot of the training was around feeling comfortable taking the extra mile, said antoine, who is an account manager in a nonprofit working with banks.\n\nshortly after the training, antoine entered into negotiations for a new position in her organization. but first, she practiced by looking in the mirror, and doing a role play with a trusted colleague. she pushed for 40% more than she was currently making and then ended her pitch.\n\nthat's what they teach you in the training is 'say your piece and stop talking.' you don't have to fill the silence, said antoine, who ended up getting the 40% increase she asked for.\n\nrelated: equality at work sounds great but how do we get there?\n\na new survey shows how critical this training can be. forty percent of women have received salary increases of 5% or less in the past five years, which is below the cost of living increases during the same time frame, according to the sheknows media survey of nearly 1,500 working women in the us. nearly half of the women surveyed said women are less likely to ask for raises and promotions than men.\n\nto help women overcome their fears about negotiating, ashley pare, founder and chief executive officer of own your worth, which helps women grow and manage their careers, turns the tables and has them focus on what they are giving up.\n\ni flip it and i ask 'well what are the consequences if you don't ask? how much money are you leaving on the table? will you be able to pay your bills? will you have the life that you desire?'  said pare, who attended one of the workshops in 2015.\n\npare said she sometimes asked for more during her career in corporate human resources but that the workshop convinced her to stay in the game longer as she negotiated a new position.\n\nin the past, i would ask but i didn't persist, so after that first workshop i went to, it definitely gave me the confidence to ask for everything that i wanted and go back and forth a couple of times to land at a happy medium.\n\nshe now volunteers as a facilitator at aauw workshops in boston.\n\nemployers expect you to negotiate so it's ... knowing that you can and it's ok and you should because it's one way that we can help make a difference, said pare.

(photo by brendan smialowski / afp)\n\neditor's note: a version of this story originally published in january 2019.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe departure this week of president donald trump's acting defense secretary – who was subsequently replaced with another acting defense secretary – has underscored again the temporary nature of trump's cabinet.\n\nthe new acting pentagon chief, mark esper, joins acting counterparts at the department of homeland security, the us mission to the united nations, the federal emergency management agency, the office of management and budget, citizenship and immigration services, immigration and customs enforcement and the small business administration.\n\ninside the white house, trump's chief of staff mick mulvaney is also serving in an acting capacity. there hasn't been a white house communications director for months. and trump's press secretary recently announced her departure.\n\nacting gives you much greater flexibility. a lot easier to do things. so that's the way it is, trump said tuesday when asked about the number of acting officials in his administration.\n\nit's a sentiment he's expressed before – and one he's shown he's willing to see through.\n\nacross the government, almost 40% of key leadership positions that require senate confirmation are vacant, according to the partnership for public service, a nonprofit focused on good governance.\n\nwith the partial government shutdown on the verge of becoming the longest in history, an executive branch filled with temps and riddled with leadership vacancies is another sign that the federal government is not functioning as it should.\n\nthe president has sought to put a positive spin on the situation, telling reporters late last year that acting department heads give him more flexibility, yet there's a downside to that. not only does it strip congress of its oversight role in approving the president's top officials, experts say interim officials are limited in their ability to make long-term and strategic decisions because they are not likely to hold their positions.\n\npeople underestimate the corrosive effect it has, said max stier, president and ceo of the partnership for public service. it's like when you have a substitute teacher in your classroom. they aren't going to take on the tough issues.\n\nat his cabinet meeting jan. 2, as trump sat flanked by his top officials, viewers could be excused for not recognizing a lot of them. gone were familiar faces like former defense secretary james mattis, chief of staff john kelly, and interior secretary ryan zinke, all of whom resigned in december. in their place were a handful of relatively unknown interim agency heads, including patrick shanahan, the acting defense secretary, and david bernhardt, the temporary replacement for zinke at the interior department.\n\nshanahan, who trump said he would nominate to the permanent role, announced this week he was withdrawing from consideration due to family concerns. bernhardt was confirmed to the permanent post in april.\n\nwhile mulvaney is operating on an acting basis, that position does not require senate confirmation.\n\nthis is all the result of the record level of chaos and turnover among the president's top advisers and officials. ten cabinet-level officials, including two chiefs of staff, have left their roles in trump's administration so far. that compares with one cabinet-level departure each at the same point in barack obama's and george w. bush's first terms.\n\nas for the vacancies inside federal agencies, there are 260 unfilled leadership jobs, out of a total of 713, that require senate confirmation, according to the partnership for public service. that includes 61 open posts at the state department, 12 at the pentagon and 15 at the justice department. most of these unfilled jobs have official nominees awaiting confirmation in the senate.\n\nyou have an administration that got off to a very slow start filling its leadership positions, and continues to lag even now, said stier. the added element is the amount of turnover, especially at the top.\n\non wednesday, the white house sent six new nominations to the senate. that included formally nominating andrew wheeler to be permanent epa chief, two months after trump said he would do so.\n\nthe president's aides and allies say the lingering vacancies are in part a symptom of how difficult it has been for the administration to attract candidates to fill posts and the challenges in confirming them in a closely divided senate. they also blame the democrats.\n\npresident trump has a well-qualified, talented bench for senior officers that gives him the flexibility to pursue his positive agenda for the american people and the time needed to select appropriate replacements – even as the democrats continue to dither, delay and obstruct needed nominees, white house spokesman hogan gidley said in a statement in january.\n\nacting officials can serve in their posts for only 210 days, because of limitations set in the vacancies reform act. temporary leaders can have trouble rallying their employees and senior staff, who see them as without real power. they can also have a hard time developing relationships across the government, including with congress, undercutting their ability to get things done.\n\non capitol hill, republican lawmakers are cold to trump's suggestion that he can simply leave acting officials in their posts indefinitely.\n\nnot ok with that, oklahoma republican sen. james lankford said when asked about trump's reliance on acting heads for his agencies. we need to get senate-confirmed people in those positions.\n\nlankford said having acting secretaries has a significant impact because their authority can be more limited than that of senate-confirmed nominees. they can't execute all policy when they are acting, he told cnn. anytime you have an acting, they can't perform all the duties that a senate-confirmed appointee can.\n\naides say trump often polls a wide net of associates, friends and advisors to fill key roles in his administration, making the process of naming officials an unconventional affair.\n\nhe has repeatedly offered candidates jobs in spur of the moment decisions, while announcing the hiring and firing of other officials through his twitter feed.\n\nthis has left some nominees unprotected and facing a brutal vetting process with little preparation. his surprise announcement last year of dr. ronny jackson as veterans affairs secretary, for example, revealed accusations of misconduct during jackson's time serving as the presidential physician that eventually derailed his nomination.\n\nsimilar scenarios played out after trump announced he would nominate heather nauert as us ambassador to the un, and herman cain and stephen moore to seats on the federal reserve. all withdrew their names from consideration after damaging information came to light.\n\nand as departures have increased in trump's third year, the resources devoted to vetting potential candidates and publicly defending them have diminished.\n\ni think it's always better to have the advice and consent of the senate and have people that have been thoroughly vetted and confirmed, said texas republican sen. john cornyn.\n\nwith a government shutdown grinding business in washington to a halt, trump is likely to be set back even further.\n\ngovernment ethics officials who vet candidates are operating on a skeletal staff and the senate is unlikely to take on any other significant business while the shutdown remains in effect.\n\ncorrection: this story and graphic have been updated to correct the number of vacant positions at the pentagon.

it said.\n\nthe statement also clarified that although the night house has video surveillance cameras, they were not recording at the time, and are only activated when the zoo has newborn tiger cubs.\n\nwhy or how this could possibly occur is the subject of five ongoing investigations, including our own, aiken said in his statement.\n\nthe zoo said the afternoon that konwiser entered the enclosure, she was alone, which is in compliance with the nationalized standards from the association of zoos & aquariums.\n\ncnn's attempts to reach the zoo for further comments were not immediately successful.\n\nno guarantee 'cat won't kill you'\n\ndave salmoni, a large predator expert and tv host for animal planet, said there is no way to ever guarantee that a cat won't kill you.\n\nalmost never would you allow a keeper to have access to a dangerous predator … if she's given these keys then she has a history of perfect gate-locking procedure, he added.\n\nkonwiser had worked at the zoo for three years and was very experienced with tigers, zoo officials said.\n\nphoto: palm beach zoo stacey konwiser with her husband, jeremy konwiser.\n\nsalmoni said no matter the relationship between konwiser and the tiger, once she entered that enclosure, if this was something unusual, the tiger would have looked at her like a ball of yarn to play with.\n\nonce she started to struggle or moved quickly, that tiger's primal hunter instinct would have then come into play, he said.\n\nthreats against tiger\n\nthe rare tiger was one of four at the facility, held in a contained area where the animals are fed and sleep, carter said. the exhibit has surveillance cameras but is closed to the public, carter said. it is not known at this time whether there is surveillance footage of the incident.\n\nthe male tiger was tranquilized after the attack and remains at the facility. zoo officials have declined to provide information on the tiger, including its name.\n\nidentifying the animal only serves to stigmatize and potentially places the tiger in harm's way, the zoo said in a statement posted on its facebook page. it said it has received threats against the animal.\n\nthe tiger was off-exhibit at the time and no guests could see what happened, carter said. the tiger was never on the loose, contrary to early reports on social media, she said.\n\nother recent attacks by big cats\n\n• in january, a keeper was severely injured at an australian zoo founded by the late wildlife conservationist steve irwin.\n\n• last september, a keeper was attacked and killed by a a sumatran tiger at a zoo in hamilton, new zealand.\n\n• in june 2015, police shot and killed a white tiger that killed a man in tbilisi, georgia, after severe flooding allowed hundreds of wild animals to escape the city zoo.\n\n• in 2013, a 24-year-old woman working at a northern california animal sanctuary was mauled and killed by a lion.\n\n• in 2007, an escaped siberian tiger attacked and killed one zoo patron and injured two others in a cafe at the san francisco zoo.\n\n• in 2003, a white tiger attacked roy horn of siegfried and roy during a performance in las vegas. the tiger lunged at horn's neck about halfway through the show and dragged him off stage as audience members watched.\n\ncnn's keith allen and ralph ellis contributed to this report
(cnn) — there's hope: summer vacations abroad may happen in a big way this year.\n\nthe number of people busting out of their countries will start creeping up this spring and rise higher by mid-year, travel industry experts predict, as vaccines and risk-based safety measures are rolled out more widely and spiking coronavirus cases around the world begin to fall once again.\n\ni'm actually quite confident that first of may onwards ... we'll all be in a much better world, said paul charles, founder and ceo of london-based travel consultancy the pc agency\n\nvaccines and testing are the way forward, charles and other industry experts say, but what's needed perhaps as desperately is greater consistency and coordination across borders.\n\nwhen you don't have a coordinated global approach, it's very difficult for the industry to go forward, especially when you have the rules of the game changing basically every single day, said luis felipe de oliveira, director general of airports council international (aci), a global trade organization representing the world's airports.\n\ndeparture testing is one component of making travel safer during the pandemic. joseph okpako/getty images\n\nthere's a lot more work to be done in ironing out testing protocols that would allow globetrotters to opt out of quarantines and finding ways to smoothly and securely share vaccination and testing information across borders.\n\nsovereign nations still decide what's best for them individually, looking at their own health situations and economies, but progress has been made in getting countries to look more globally at the huge economic force that is travel.\n\nicao, aci, an alphabet soup of agencies, organizations and companies ( unwto wttc , the airlines and so on) have collaborated on numerous sets of guidelines and global recommendations aimed at making travel safer, easier and less confusing for a world of consumers starving for a change of scene.\n\naci's de oliveira says that the summer rebound could mean international air traffic reaching 50% to 60% of previous levels in most countries.\n\nhere are some of the hurdles travelers and the industry will need to get over as travel picks up:\n\nrelated content 21 places to go in 2021\n\neliminating quarantines\n\nmandatory -- and shifting -- quarantine requirements basically are killing the process to restart the industry, de oliveira said.\n\nwhen he spoke to cnn travel, de oliveira was on day 12 of a 14-day quarantine in montreal after returning home from a business trip to the dominican republic followed by a personal trip to mexico. he has quarantined four times in the past seven months, spending 56 days at home without the possibility of going out.\n\nthat kind of time investment, along with the confusion around requirements -- both going and coming home -- are big deterrents for people who might otherwise be willing to travel. safety is essential, but those in the industry are advocating for a more nuanced, layered approach.\n\ntravelers at a hotel in melbourne, australia in december had to quarantine after returning from overseas. william west/afp/getty images\n\na test-out mechanism is needed to avoid quarantines, says tori emerson barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy at the national nonprofit u.s. travel association, which has been advocating for a science-driven, risk-based approach to reopening international travel in particular looking at the elimination of quarantines if you have the right testing protocol in place.\n\nwhile vaccines will be critical, de oliveira and others say the travel industry absolutely cannot afford to wait to ramp up until vaccinations are fully administered globally, making testing an essential part of the equation for safer travel in the near-term.\n\nrelated content how risky is flying during a pandemic? what we know and how to make it safer\n\nbarnes mentioned a two-tiered regimen of testing 72 hours before departure and again upon arrival as one possible standard, and she cited a testing pilot program in hawaii -- where a 10-day quarantine can be bypassed on most islands with negative test results -- as an example of where testing out of quarantine has generated demand.\n\nwhile u.s. travel would encourage people to get vaccinated and to test out in places that require quarantines, the association isn't looking for blanket requirements for access, barnes said. we wouldn't say that you have to have a vaccine to travel.\n\nshe acknowledges that determining who is responsible for creating and implementing consistent protocols is a challenge. the government doesn't necessarily want to, she said, and i don't know that the private sector should have that responsibility.\n\nyet countries and organizations around the world are making progress in coordinating common approaches, says alessandra priante, regional director for europe at the world tourism organization (unwto), a specialized agency of the united nations.\n\na coordinated way of testing is already being implemented in numerous cases, and the next step at a global level is tracing, priante says, to make sure that we're able to share a certain amount of data, because if we don't share the data, then we are not really able to have all the information that we should have.\n\nthe travel industry can't afford to wait until vaccines have been distributed globally to ramp up. patrick t. fallon/afp/getty images\n\ngetting vaccinated ... and proving it\n\nsome of that information likely would pertain to vaccinations. the united kingdom's vaccination program is well under way. other countries have also made significant progress, and the united states' program is slowly ramping up.\n\ntraveler confusion may well ramp up, too, as more people start moving around in the spring and additional requirements come into play for negative tests and proof of vaccination.\n\naustralia, for example, just announced that it will require negative pcr covid tests for all travelers, and airline qantas has suggested that all international passengers may soon be required to have a vaccination certificate.\n\nwe'll need a harmonized global approach to recognizing and accurately and safely sharing vaccination and testing information, de oliveira said.\n\ncurrent practices -- involving printed paper documents from unknown labs in languages that may be unfamiliar to those inspecting them or a tangle of unconnected databases across the world -- are less than ideal.\n\nthat's why aci supports the use of health apps such as commonpass , a tool that would allow travelers to share lab results and vaccination records without revealing other personal health information. the international air transport association (iata) is also working on a digital travel pass platform\n\neven when vaccines do become widely available, not everyone will take them and researchers are looking at whether the virus could be still be transmitted by vaccinated people. masking, social distancing, sanitation and other safety layers will still be part of daily life -- and travel -- for a long time to come.\n\ntravel bubbles -- like the anticipated two-way corridor between new zealand and australia -- are among the tailored measures aimed at restoring some international travel. jorge fernández/lightrocket/getty images\n\nmeasures in the meantime\n\nseamless international travel won't happen overnight.\n\neven as we wait for declines in coronavirus cases and more global coordination around safer, less confusing cross-border travel, destinations and corporations increasingly are rolling out their own interim solutions.\n\ndelta air lines is trying out a handful of covid-tested, quarantine-free flights to the netherlands. these flights employ a combination of the gold-standard pcr testing with preboarding rapid antigen testing.\n\nde oliveira sees rapid antigen testing as a potential aid in the industry's recovery. while considered less accurate , antigen tests are also much quicker and less expensive than molecular tests as one layer of risk management.\n\niceland and hungary have embraced the concept of immunity passports, allowing people to enter who have already been infected with covid-19 and recovered.\n\ntravel bubbles, such as a much-anticipated, two-way corridor between new zealand and australia , allow people to travel back and forth between countries without quarantining.\n\nunfortunately like most things covid-related, these measures are subject to change.\n\ncorridors can be useful if they're consistent, but again, they've been up and down, opening and shutting at short notice and that has not helped consumers at all, said paul charles, the travel industry consultant.\n\nultimately, travelers would like to get back to safely mixing and mingling with the rest of the world. robin utrecht / stringer / getty\n\nthe great goal: mingling with strangers\n\nthe unwto's priante is hoping the ups and downs level out soon because the world is missing out.\n\nwhat i regret the most is that all that tourism is about, which is to trust the unknown ... the beauty of exploring, of meeting somebody you've never met before from another culture, another nation, is all sort of on hold and at stake because people are telling us 'don't trust anyone, cross the sidewalk, wear your mask, don't mingle,'  she said from her home in madrid.\n\nand while priante and her colleagues have taken every precaution and continued to travel and work to address the global crisis that is threatening livelihoods in the industry, she wants to see more people traveling safely.
washington (cnn) -- the u.s. supreme court ruled monday the federal government has the power to keep some sex offenders behind bars indefinitely after they have served their sentences if officials determine those inmates may prove sexually dangerous in the future.\n\nthe federal government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose, justice stephen breyer wrote for the 7-2 majority.\n\nat issue was the constitutionality of federal civil commitment for sex offenders who are nearing the end of their confinement or who are considered too mentally incompetent to stand trial.\n\nthe main plaintiff in the case, graydon comstock, was certified as dangerous six days before his 37-month federal prison term for processing child pornography was to end. comstock and the others filing suit remain confined at butner federal correctional complex near raleigh, north carolina.\n\nthree other inmates who filed suit served prison terms of three to eight years for offenses ranging from child pornography to sexual abuse of a minor. another was charged with child sex abuse but was declared mentally incompetent to face trial.\n\nall were set to be released nearly three years ago, but government appeals have blocked their freedom. the government says about 83 people are being held under the civil commitment program.\n\ncorrections officials and prosecutors determined the men remained a risk for further sexually deviant behavior if freed. the inmates' attorneys maintain the continued imprisonment violates their constitutional right of due process and argue congress overstepped its power by allowing inmates to be held for certain crimes that normally would fall under the jurisdiction of state courts.\n\nthe law in question is the 2006 adam walsh child protection and safety act, which includes a provision allowing indefinite confinement of sex offenders. a federal appeals court in richmond, virginia, ruled lawmakers had overstepped their authority by passing it, prompting the current high court appeal.\n\nthe statute is a 'necessary and proper' means of exercising the federal authority that permits congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others, breyer wrote.\n\nbreyer equated the federal civil commitment law to congress' long-standing authority to provide mental health care to prisoners in its custody, if they might prove dangerous, whether sexually or otherwise.\n\nin dissent, justice clarence thomas said the federal government overstepped its bounds.\n\ncongress' power, however, is fixed by the constitution, thomas wrote. it does not expand merely to suit the states' policy preferences, or to allow state officials to avoid difficult choices regarding the allocation of state funds. he was joined by justice antonin scalia.\n\nthe case represented a victory for the federal government and the woman who argued the case on its behalf, solicitor general elena kagan. president obama nominated kagan last week to serve on the supreme court.\n\na key lawmaker behind the adam walsh act applauded the ruling.\n\nthe court's holding today is a victory on behalf of the american people, said sen. patrick leahy, d-vermont, chairman of the senate judiciary committee.\n\nthe process to enact this law to protect our children from those who would do them harm was difficult. i am heartened to see an overwhelming majority of the supreme court uphold this important child protection law.\n\nthe justices in april 2009 had blocked the imminent release of dozens of sex offenders who had served their federal sentences after the obama administration claimed many of them remain sexually dangerous. chief justice john roberts ordered the men be kept in custody while the case worked its way to the high court.\n\nmost violent sex offenses are handled at the state level, and at least 20 states run programs in which sexual predators are held indefinitely or until they are no longer considered dangerous. the federal government's civil commitment program is relatively new.\n\nthe adam walsh act was named after the son of john walsh, host of tv's america's most wanted.adam walsh was kidnapped and murdered by a suspected child molester in 1981.\n\nthe act also increased punishments for certain federal crimes against children and created a national registry for sex offenders. those aspects of the bill were not being challenged in this case.

[my husband and i have] been married 30 years in september. we raised three boys together. we have a happy marriage, but we're very strong-minded people and have learned when something is non-negotiable.\n\namong those non-negotiables? dyson hair dryers and bathrobes from ikea -- both things that brown herself swears by and uses at home. she spent years traveling the world for her work and considers herself an expert on what hotels are doing right -- and what they're doing wrong.\n\na few of her favorite things\n\nwhile the expensive dyson hair dryers will have to be signed out from the front desk to prevent thievery, brown had a very specific idea of which things guests would need in grabbing distance, namely coffee -- so there are nespresso coffee makers in every room to prevent pre-caffeinated guests from having to interact with other humans.\n\nbrown, who loves the soho house hotels around the world and opts for boutique stays over big-name brands with loyalty programs, also wanted to keep things personal. since she has strong reactions to fragrances, she chose a delicate peppermint lavender scent for all the in-room toiletries, and has a policy against using perfumes or room sprays in common areas.\n\njust like home: many of the george's interiors come from brown's home goods line with lord & taylor. lesley unruh\n\nwe're very hands-on people, brown says about why the hotel project suited her and plofker so well.\n\ni get into the details. we're going to be serving breakfast and brunch both to hotel guests and the community, we'll have an afternoon tea and smoothies. it matters what yogurt we serve. i will be curating everything, brown says. it's a small hotel, so it's about customer experience and accommodating.\n\nand customer-friendly service doesn't just extend to guests of the human persuasion. brown, a dog lover, has made the george extremely animal-friendly. not only are there special doggie treats and beds, but travelers can pick out their pup's accessories (such as a food bowl) ahead of time when they make their reservation so that everything in the room will be ready to go upon arrival.\n\nanother challenge for brown and plofker was negotiating montclair's quirky local laws. the town has a very small number of liquor licenses, which can make it tough for a new bar or restaurant to open.\n\nwhile the george does not have one of those licenses, brown has come up with creative ways to bring booze onto the property, such as having a favorite local wine store host on-site tastings. (the licenses are portable, which works out nicely.) her team can also arrange for deliveries to individual guest rooms.\n\nthe hotel's small size also makes it easy to accommodate specific dietary needs, from gluten-free to diabetic-friendly.\n\nthe one thing the george will never have, though? a spa.
j. scott applewhite/ap\n\nharvard professor alan dershowitz, a member of president trump's legal team, offered a new defense of the president's actions with ukraine, while answering senators' questions.\n\nin a nutshell, dershowitz argued that a us president is allowed to orchestrate a quid pro quo with a foreign leader to benefit their own re-election campaign, if they also believe that their re-election is in the national interests of the united states.\n\ndershowitz said: every public official that i know believes that his election is in the public interest. and mostly you're right — your election is in the public interest. and if a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\n\nthese comments could normalize the type of behavior that landed trump in the middle of an impeachment scandal, and which democrats say constitutes an improper solicitation of foreign influence into a us election.\n\ndershowitz offered this argument in response to a question from republican sen. ted cruz about the legality of a quid pro quo. dershowitz said all elected officials make decisions through a political lens, and often hire pollsters to see how their decisions would play out.\n\ntrump's legal team does not concede that he attempted a quid pro quo. dershowitz was speaking hypothetically. in his defense of trump this week, dershowitz has relied on controversial theories that are rejected by a wide cross-section of legal scholars.\n\nhow democrats responded: democrats later criticized dershowitz, saying his theory would open the door to rampant abuses from future presidents.\n\nthey also rebutted dershowitz's claims that presidents oversee this-for-that deals with foreign leaders all the time, in furtherance of their personal interests. when vice president joe biden pushed for the dismissal of a top ukrainian prosecutor, he was acting in accordance with established us policy, and promoting the views of international organizations like the imf. trump's team has argued, without providing credible evidence, that biden actually did this to protect his son's corruption in ukraine.\n\nwhat sets trump's behavior apart is that there is substantial evidence that withholding the ukraine aid was not in accordance with official us policy toward ukraine. defense secretary mark esper and secretary of state mike pompeo, along with then-national security adviser john bolton, all lobbied trump to release the aid before he relented in september. additionally, the nonpartisan government accountability office determined trump's decision to withhold the appropriate funds violated the law.\n\ntrump's lawyers argued that only the president sets foreign policy, not his advisers or lower-level diplomats
story highlights idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease with poor prognosis of nine patients, seven died during the reported 16-year period\n\n(cnn) —\n\na cluster of cases of a progressive lung disease occurred among dentists and other dental workers treated at one virginia care center, according to thursday's morbidity and mortality weekly report from the us centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nof nine patients, referred to as a cluster, seven died during the reported 16-year period. the disease, called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is a chronic, progressive lung disease with a poor prognosis. the cause is unknown.\n\na cluster is a term used to define a collection of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, dr. randall j. nett, lead author of the study and medical officer with the us public health service, explained in an email.\n\nin this case, among 894 patients treated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at the virginia hospital, nine patients – or 1% – were identified as dentists or dental technicians. this number was about 23 times higher than expected, nett said.\n\nall the cluster patients – eight dentists and one dental technician – were men, with an average age of 64. though the reason for illness has not been identified, occupational exposures are possible, nett and his colleagues wrote.\n\ndentists and other dental personnel have unique exposures at work, nett said. these exposures include bacteria, viruses, dusts, gases, radiation, and other respiratory hazards.\n\none of the surviving cluster patients reported polishing dental appliances and preparing impressions without using a mask or other protection, according to the report. during these tasks, a dental worker would have been exposed to silica and other compounds with known or potential respiratory toxicity.\n\nat this time, we do not know what caused this cluster of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cases in dental personnel, said nett, who recommended that workers wear certified respiratory protection if the ability to improve ventilation is not practical or effective.\n\nmore work has to be done before we can make any conclusions about the risk dentists or other dental personnel have, nett said. cdc will follow up on this newly recognized cluster.\n\nabout 650,000 dental personnel work throughout the nation, he said.\n\ndr. paul casamassimo, chief policy officer of the american academy of pediatric dentistry's pediatric oral health & research center, said the new report is not surprising.\n\nfor years, dentists have been exposed to plaster and dust from drilling, in addition to the toxic substances listed in the report. the cluster patients were all older, so they may not have been using the most up-to-date practices for personal protection and safety, he noted.\n\nwe do work with materials and with human bioproducts that are potentially damaging to our bodies if we inhale them, casamassimo said. younger dentists are taught differently than in the past, so they know to delegate certain work or procedures to laboratories that meet more safe and stringent ventilation requirements, he said.\n\nfollow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.\n\ntoday, dental personnel also have required protections from the occupational safety and health administration and the national institute for occupational safety and health, he said.\n\nhis own father was an old-school dentist.\n\nmy father passed away at 79, casamassimo said. though his father did not die of pulmonary fibrosis, he had respiratory problems.\n\nthis probably has been more common than we have known in the past, he said.

with us and see how they stack up.\n\nchase sapphire preferred: best overall travel rewards card\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the chase sapphire preferred earns 2 ultimate rewards points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining purchases, and the points can be redeemed for travel and other eligible categories at 1.25 cents per point, or transferred to the program's airline and hotel partners for potentially even more valuable redemptions.\n\nthis card is right for: people with larger than average travel and/or dining expenses (including food delivery) who want a low-fee card with basic transferable points.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 2 points for every dollar spent on travel and dining purchases.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\npoints can be redeemed for travel through the chase ultimate rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.25 cents per point.\n\nnow through april 30, 2021, points can also be redeemed for purchases at grocery stores, dining establishments and home improvement stores at a rate of 1.25 cents per point.\n\npoints can also be transferred to any of chase's 13 airline and hotel partners.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$95 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nwhat we like about the chase sapphire preferred: it may not seem like it, but at over 10 years old, the chase sapphire preferred is practically the granddaddy of travel credit cards. with classic travel and dining bonus categories, 5 points per dollar on lyft rides and a 60,000-point sign-up bonus, it should be easy to quickly score plenty of points, especially since most food delivery services will code as dining on the csp and earn 2 points per dollar.\n\ncard holders also get a complimentary dashpass subscription for at least one year, and for a limited time from november 1, 2020, through april 30, 2021, you can earn 2 points for every dollar spent at grocery stores using the chase sapphire preferred, up to $1,000 in purchases each month.\n\nrelated: chase sapphire credit cards earn bonus points on groceries for a limited time.\n\nbut the real power of the sapphire preferred is in its redemptions. you'll get 1.25 cents per point when redeeming points through the chase ultimate rewards travel portal, and can get potentially even more value when transferring points to one of chase's 13 travel partners. in fact, the ultimate rewards program still features some of the best transfer partners, including united airlines, southwest airlines and hyatt hotels, and all chase partners transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio.\n\nchase also added new redemption options to the sapphire preferred in 2020. the issuer's pay yourself back feature allows you to redeem points on purchases beyond just travel. the current eligible categories are grocery stores, dining establishments (including delivery and takeout) and home improvement stores. through april 30, 2021, you'll get 1.25 cents per point when redeeming this way.\n\nto top it off, when travel resumes, you'll be able to safely use the sapphire preferred overseas, since it has no foreign transaction fees on international purchases. it even provides primary car rental insurance, so you don't have to look to your own auto policy first if you have an accident with your rental car.\n\nphoto: istock you'll get primary car rental insurance with the chase sapphire preferred.\n\nwhat could be better: the chase sapphire preferred is a classic, but in some ways it's starting to get long in the tooth. other credit cards now offer bonus points or cash back in those same travel and dining categories, and in some cases at higher rates (though usually accompanied by higher annual fees).\n\neven our benchmark citi double cash card earns 2% on all purchases (1% when you buy, plus 1% when you pay it off) and not just on travel and dining, though you can get more value when redeeming your sapphire preferred points than you can with simple cash back.\n\nfor many people, the sapphire preferred isn't as flashy as its older sibling, the chase sapphire reserve, which comes with travel perks, higher bonus rates and a $300 annual travel credit (but also a much higher annual fee). but if you don't need or won't use all those extra perks — especially right now with travel so limited — you may be better off with this significantly less expensive version.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: travel and dining bonus categories, excellent travel protections, solid airline and hotel partners and sign-up bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nread cnn underscored's chase sapphire preferred credit card review.\n\nlearn more and apply for the chase sapphire preferred card.\n\namerican express gold: best pandemic travel card\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the american express gold card earns tons of valuable amex travel points on practically all the food-related purchases you're making while you're not traveling, and the credits available on the card nearly offset its annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people who can utilize all of the card's various credits and who are currently spending significant money at restaurants, on food delivery services or at us supermarkets while they're not on the road.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 4 points for every dollar you spend at us supermarkets (up to $25,000 per year in purchases, then 1x).\n\nearn 4 points per dollar at restaurants worldwide.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar for flights booked directly with airlines or on amextravel.com.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on everything else.\n\nup to $120 in annual dining credits.\n\nup to $120 in uber cash annually.\n\n$250 annual fee.\n\nterms apply.\n\nwelcome bonus: earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first six months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the american express gold: calling it our best pandemic travel card may sound odd, but the amex gold is a perfect choice if you want to earn as many travel points as possible during the pandemic, and then have lots of ways to use those points on trips after the pandemic ends.\n\nfirst, with the amex gold, you'll earn 4 points for every dollar you spend on restaurants worldwide, and on up to $25,000 in annual purchases at us supermarkets (1 point per dollar thereafter). most food delivery services count as restaurants on this card, so that means the vast majority of your food purchases will earn 4x points, regardless of how you're eating right now.\n\nyou'll also earn 3 points per dollar when you book airfare directly with an airline, so if you're looking to jump on any sales for flights later in the year, you can pay for them with the amex gold and earn extra points on those as well.\n\nthe points earned on this card are american express membership rewards points, which are extremely useful. you can redeem them directly for flights via amex travel at 1 cent each, but if you put in some extra effort and research, you can potentially get much more value from them by transferring them to any of amex's 21 airline and hotel partners, which include delta air lines, jetblue, marriott and many more.\n\nthen there are the annual credits. while the amex gold has a substantial $250 annual fee, you can earn almost as much from the card's credits as you pay for it.\n\neach year you have the amex gold, you get up to $120 in dining credits, which can be used for purchases at grubhub, seamless, the cheesecake factory, ruth's chris steak house, boxed and participating shake shack locations. these are doled out in portions of up to $10 each month, but the credits don't roll over from month to month, so you must use them or lose them.\n\nthen, amex has also added up to $120 in uber cash each year to the amex gold. again, these credits come in $10 monthly installments and can be used either for uber rides or on uber eats orders. that's up to $240 in annual credits, which would leave you with an effective annual fee of only $10 if you can use them all.\n\nphoto: istock you'll get up to $10 each month in uber cash with the american express gold card.\n\nwhat could be better: the one big downside of the amex gold is that most of the annual credits come in monthly installments rather than annual chunks, so you'll need to make sure you can take advantage of them each month to make the card worth it.\n\nalso, while amex points are valuable, they're best used for the airline and hotel transfer partners, which take some time to understand and flexibility to maximize. if you'd prefer to just book flights through a standard online travel portal, you might be better off with one of the chase or capital one cards, which can offer more value when redeeming rewards the easy way.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: welcome bonus, annual credits, bonus categories and solid airline and hotel partners.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nread cnn underscored's american express gold card review.\n\nlearn more and apply for the american express gold card.\n\nchase sapphire reserve: best for travel purchases\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the hugely popular chase sapphire reserve comes with a high price tag but also a $300 annual travel credit, airport lounge access, a $60 annual doordash credit in 2021, a massively increased earning rate when you use lyft and 3 points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining.\n\nthis card is right for: people who make lots of travel purchases, even in their daily lives while they're not on the road right now.\n\nhighlights:\n\n$300 annual travel credit.\n\nearn 3 points for every dollar you spend on dining purchases.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar on travel purchases (after using your $300 travel credit each year).\n\nearn 10 points per dollar on lyft purchases through march 2022.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\npoints can be redeemed for travel through the chase ultimate rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.5 cents per point.\n\nnow through april 30, 2021, points can also be redeemed for purchases at grocery stores, dining establishments and home improvement stores at a rate of 1.5 cents per point.\n\npoints can also be transferred to any of chase's 13 airline and hotel partners.\n\n$60 annual doordash credit in 2021.\n\nup to two years of free dashpass membership.\n\none free year of lyft pink membership.\n\ncomplimentary priority pass select airport lounge membership.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$550 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nwhat we like about the chase sapphire reserve: when it first launched in 2016, the chase sapphire reserve was an instant hit, thanks in part to its broad travel and dining categories. it's incredibly easy to earn bonus points with the card, since dining includes almost every restaurant, fast food and even food delivery services such as seamless.\n\na $60 annual doordash credit further adds to the card's value, especially right now. if you can utilize it along with the travel credit, you're left with an effective annual fee of just $190. and like the sapphire preferred, you'll also get bonus points at grocery stores from november 1, 2020, through april 30, 2021, with the sapphire reserve, but at an even higher rate of 3 points per dollar, up to $1,000 in purchases each month.\n\nthe ability to redeem points you earn with the card for any flight or hotel at a rate of 1.5 cents per point via the chase ultimate rewards travel portal makes the card's rewards easy to use, though you'll potentially get even more value if you can dive into the more advanced airline and hotel transfer partners.\n\nalso, like the sapphire preferred, chase added its new pay yourself back feature to the chase sapphire reserve, which allows you to redeem points on purchases beyond just travel. the current eligible categories are grocery stores, dining establishments (including delivery and takeout) and home improvement stores, and through april 30, 2021, you'll get 1.5 cents per point when redeeming this way.\n\nrelated: new redemption options added to the chase sapphire reserve.\n\nand if you plan to fly regularly once travel resumes, you'll find solid value in the card's priority pass select airport lounge membership, with access for you and up to two guests to over 1,200 lounges around the world.\n\nphoto: american express visit the plaza premium lounge at london heathrow, part of the priority pass select network.\n\nwhat could be better: while the high cost of the chase sapphire reserve was easy to justify for the last several years, it increased its annual fee from $450 to $550 at the start of 2020, so you really need to be able to use all of the card's perks for the price to make sense, which can be difficult given the current worldwide travel situation.\n\nthe lyft bonus category means you'll earn an impressive 10 points for every dollar you spend on the ride-sharing service, but it won't be of any use to most people who aren't currently using lyft. the same goes for the added doordash annual credit and free dashpass membership, which are only valuable to folks who order food for delivery and have doordash service in their area.\n\nand while the travel and dining bonus categories were market-leading four years ago, there are now other credit cards with similar if not even better earning rates in those categories, such as the amex gold, which earns 4 points per dollar on restaurant purchases worldwide. or, if the annual fee increase on the sapphire reserve is too much to stomach, consider the cheaper chase sapphire preferred with fewer travel perks but only a $95 annual fee.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: easy-to-use travel credit, travel and dining bonus categories, excellent travel protections, solid airline and hotel partners, and sign-up bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nexplore whether the chase sapphire reserve is worth the annual fee.\n\nlearn more and apply for the chase sapphire reserve.\n\namerican express platinum: best luxury travel perks\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: it's definitely not cheap, but the famous american express platinum card is a heavyweight when it comes to travel perks, with numerous annual credits; access to more than 1,200 airport lounges worldwide, including amex's own centurion lounges and delta sky clubs when flying delta; elite status with hilton, marriott, hertz, avis and national car rental; and many other luxury travel benefits.\n\nthis card is right for: people who want top-notch luxury travel perks, refundable travel credits and transferable travel rewards.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 5 points for every dollar you spend on flights booked directly with airlines or with american express travel.\n\nearn 5 points per dollar on prepaid hotels booked on amex travel.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\npoints can be redeemed for travel through amex travel at a rate of up to 1 cent per point.\n\npoints can also be transferred to any of amex's 21 airline and hotel partners.\n\nup to $200 in statement credits annually for incidental fees at one selected qualifying airline.\n\nup to $100 in statement credits annually for purchases at saks fifth avenue.\n\nup to $15 in statement credits every month ($35 in december) when you pay for your uber rides with the card.\n\ncomplimentary access to american express centurion lounges , delta sky clubs when flying delta, and priority pass airport lounges (not including priority pass restaurants).\n\ncomplimentary gold elite status with hilton and marriott hotel chains.\n\ncomplimentary preferred elite status with hertz, avis and national car rental chains.\n\ncomplimentary shoprunner membership.\n\naccess to american express fine hotels & resorts.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$550 annual fee.\n\nterms apply.\n\nwelcome bonus: earn 75,000 bonus points after you make $5,000 in eligible purchases in your first six months.\n\nwhat we like about the american express platinum: for an annual fee of $550 a year, you need to be able to really take advantage of the perks of this card to make it worth the cost. while that's difficult in the current environment, when travel returns to normal, you'll feel like a true vip.\n\nthe amex platinum has access to literally thousands of airport lounges, including amex's own centurion lounges, which are considered some of the best domestic airport lounges in the us. to many road warriors, this benefit is worth the cost of the card all by itself.\n\nbut if you can also take advantage of the card's up-to-$200 annual incidental airline fee credit as well as the up-to-$200 annual uber credit, plus the up-to-$100 saks fifth avenue credit (which you can use to buy anything at saks, either in-store or online), you'll be scoring up to $500 worth of annual credits for a card that costs $550 a year.\n\nspeaking of those credits, the uber credit can also be used on uber eats purchases, which means you can still take advantage of them even if you aren't using ride-share services at the moment. same goes for the saks fifth avenue credit, which can be used on anything you buy at saks' online website.\n\nrelated: how to take advantage of your expensive travel credit card when you can't travel.\n\nthe cherry on top is the 75,000-point welcome bonus after you spend $5,000 on the card in your first six months, which at the very least you should be able to redeem for a pair of domestic airline tickets for you and a companion, or even a trip to europe in coach for yourself.\n\nphoto: istock use your amex platinum bonus to score a pair of domestic airline tickets.\n\nwhat could be better: surprisingly, the american express platinum isn't a terrific card when it comes to earning points. it's strong when you're booking airline tickets, since you'll earn an impressive 5 points for every dollar you spend directly with airlines. but to earn 5 points per dollar at hotels, you'll need to book only prepaid hotels, and only through amex travel. for such an expensive card, those aren't exceptional bonus categories.\n\nthe credits on the amex platinum can also be a challenge to maximize. unlike travel credits on cards such as the chase sapphire reserve, the up-to-$200 airline incidental fee credit is only good on the one airline you choose each year, and then only for certain fees like checked baggage or in-cabin pet fees.\n\nthe up-to-$200 annual uber credit doesn't come as one big credit but instead as a monthly series of $15 credits, with an extra $20 in december to get to the $200 total. even the saks fifth avenue credit is split in two, with $50 available in the first six months of the calendar year and the other $50 in the second half.\n\nin the end, the amex platinum isn't really designed for everyday use. rather, you need to be a regular traveler with a desire to be treated better during those long days on the road for the cost of the card to make sense in the long term.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: luxury travel perks and travel credits, airline and hotel bonus categories, solid travel protections, extensive airline and hotel partners, and welcome bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nread cnn

once travel resumes, the southwest rapid rewards priority credit card is an easy win, as its annual credits, perks and points can easily offset its annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people who want a card that offers elite perks when flying southwest.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 5 points for every dollar you spend on southwest purchases between december 1, 2020, and march 31, 2021, on up to $2,000 spent per month.\n\nearn 2 points per dollar on all other southwest purchases.\n\nearn 1 mile per dollar on all other purchases.\n\n$75 southwest travel credit each year.\n\nfour upgraded

the southwest priority card: if you're already a fan of southwest, you'll really enjoy the perks that come with the southwest priority card. but right now is also the perfect time to take advantage of the card's sign-up bonus to earn the airline's coveted southwest companion pass.\n\nthe companion pass is an elite travel benefit that allows another passenger to fly with you for free on southwest (plus taxes) an unlimited number of times. normally, earning the pass requires earning 125,000 qualifying points in a calendar year. that's a massive amount of flying on southwest, which you likely aren't doing right now.\n\nbut for a limited time, the airline is including a companion pass valid through february 28, 2022, for all new card applicants who spend $5,000 on the southwest priority card in the first three months after opening the account. that's an incredible deal, and one you should grab if you have a friend or family member you'd like to travel with later in 2021.\n\nrelated: use this credit card offer to fly your companion for free for an entire year.\n\nyou'll also get some truly great perks with the southwest priority card. the biggest one is a $75 southwest travel credit every year, which can be used toward any southwest flight purchase — just pay for your flight or taxes on your southwest card and you'll receive a statement credit up to $75. use the credit every year and you've already recouped half of the card's annual fee.\n\nthe southwest priority card also offers four upgraded boarding certificates annually. this means you can purchase an a1-15 boarding position at the gate (if available), giving you the opportunity to board the plane before most other passengers, and you'll receive a statement credit for the amount charged.\n\nyou'll also get 20% back on in-flight drinks and wi-fi purchases on southwest, and 7,500 bonus points at each card anniversary. those points are worth $113 on wanna get away fares, so this card very easily pays for itself as long as you're flying southwest every year.\n\nphoto: istock the southwest priority card offers excellent perks for southwest flyers.\n\nwhat could be better: while southwest flyers can get great value from the perks on the southwest priority card, you probably won't want to use it as your everyday spending card. southwest points are worth approximately 1.5 cents per point when booking southwest's lowest wanna get away fares, so while you're earning a terrific 7.5% return on the temporary southwest 5x bonus category through the end of march, you're only getting a 1.5% return on everything else.\n\nyou'd be better off putting your daily purchases on our benchmark citi double cash card and getting 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you buy it, and another 1% when you pay it off — and utilizing other credit cards with stronger bonus categories or more flexible travel rewards when you can.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus and travel perks on southwest.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nlearn more and apply for the southwest rapid rewards priority credit card.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the world of hyatt credit card features a solid set of bonus categories and earns points in the most valuable hotel loyalty program around while at the same time offering complimentary hyatt discoverist elite status and the ability to earn even higher levels of elite status even if you can't travel at the moment.\n\nthis card is right for: people who routinely stay at hyatt hotels under normal travel conditions, especially those chasing hyatt elite status.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 4 points for every dollar you spend at hyatt hotels.\n\nearn 2 points per dollar on dining and on airlines tickets purchased directly from the airlines.\n\nearn 2 points per dollar on local transit and commuting, and on fitness club and gym memberships.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\ncomplimentary world of hyatt discoverist elite status and 5 qualifying night credits every year.\n\nreceive 2 qualifying night credits per $5,000 spent.\n\nreceive 1 free night at any category 1-4 hyatt each year after your first card holder anniversary.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$95 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 60,000 bonus points — 30,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening, plus 2 bonus points for every dollar you spend on purchases that earn 1 bonus point, up to $15,000 in the first six months of account opening.\n\nwhat we like about the world of hyatt credit card: hyatt's loyalty program remains by far the best of all the major hotel chains, which makes the world of hyatt credit card our pick for the one hotel credit card to include on our best travel credit cards list.\n\nyou can earn boatloads of hyatt points with this card and still get great value when redeeming hyatt rewards, including stays at top-notch properties like the park hyatt new york or at the hyatt ziva and hyatt zilara all-inclusive resorts.\n\nyou'll also get automatic hyatt discoverist elite status just from having the card, which is the lowest-level elite status but still gets you perks such as 10% bonus points on your hyatt stays, elite check-in, premium internet and a late 2 p.m. checkout where available. and the hyatt card can put you on the way to earning higher-level explorist or globalist elite status — card holders get 5 elite night credits every year just from having the card.\n\nbut the icing on the cake starts one year after you first open the card — you'll receive a free night at any category 1-4 hyatt property every year at your card anniversary when you pay the new year's annual fee. that's perfect timing since travel is likely to have significantly recovered by then.\n\nphoto: hyatt hotels stay at the park hyatt sydney using points earned with the world of hyatt credit card.\n\nwhat could be better: while the bonus categories on the world of hyatt credit card are useful, it's important to remember that chase's ultimate rewards program includes hyatt as a transfer partner, meaning that points you earn with cards such as the chase sapphire preferred or chase sapphire reserve can be turned into hyatt points as well as other airline or hotel points, making them more flexible than just regular hyatt points.\n\nso if you have a card like the sapphire reserve, you'll do better using it on some purchases instead of the hyatt card. for instance, you'll earn 3 points per dollar on dining with the csr versus just 2 points with the hyatt card (and you'll have more options when it comes to redeeming chase points).\n\nthe one major downside to hyatt is that it's a much smaller chain than the big players such as hilton and marriott, which can make it difficult to find a convenient hyatt hotel in some smaller cities. however, the chain has made promising attempts to improve this situation in recent years by partnering with other hotel groups such as small luxury hotels of the world, allowing you to use hyatt points at a greater variety of properties.\n\nhyatt was also originally scheduled to add peak and off-peak redemption rates to its award chart last year, meaning properties would have become more expensive to redeem points for during high-demand times (though also cheaper in low-demand periods). however, the chain announced those changes are delayed until sometime in 2021.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus, decent bonus categories and travel perks at hyatt.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nlearn more and apply for the world of hyatt credit card.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: you'll earn 2 capital one miles per dollar on every purchase with the capital one venture credit card, and you can redeem those miles for any travel purchase you make at 1 cent per mile, or transfer them to capital one's airline partners for potentially even more valuable redemptions.\n\nthis card is right for: people who want to travel for free, using easily redeemable miles, but with the option to learn how to master transferable miles down the line for even greater value.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 2 miles per dollar on all purchases with no limit.\n\nredeem miles for any travel purchase at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nnow through april 30, 2021, redeem miles for food delivery and streaming services at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nmiles can also be transferred to any of capital one's 15 airline partners.\n\nup to $100 credit when applying for global entry or tsa precheck.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$95 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 60,000 bonus miles when you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the capital one venture: some people want easy-to-redeem travel rewards. others don't mind more complicated redemptions that can increase the value of their miles. the capital one venture card gives you the best of both worlds.\n\nfor folks who don't want to deal with complex charts or award availability, you can use the venture's purchase eraser feature. it uses miles you've accumulated to pay off any travel purchases that you make with the card at a rate of 1 cent per mile, making the 60,000-mile sign-up bonus worth at least $600 in travel.\n\neven better, for a limited time now through april 30, 2021, you can also use the purchase eraser on food delivery and streaming services along with travel purchases. so your miles can still be redeemed for the same value even while travel is halted.\n\nfor others who want to put in the time and research to find first- or business-class flight redemptions when travel returns, capital one's 15 airline transfer partners provide another option. you can transfer miles to most of those partners at a 2-to-1.5 ratio (meaning for every 2 venture miles you transfer, you'll get 1.5 airline miles on the other end), while emirates, singapore air and accor hotels transfer at a 2-to-1 ratio.\n\ncapital one removed the first year annual fee waiver on the venture card, so you're paying $95 a year right from the start. but you'll still get up to a $100 fee credit when applying for either global entry or tsa precheck and no foreign transaction fees.\n\nphoto: istock use the capital one venture to take your family on a beach vacation.\n\nwhat could be better: there's only one bonus category on the capital one venture — you'll earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels or car rentals, but only when you book them through capital one travel. unfortunately, you likely won't get elite credit or have your elite benefits honored when booking a hotel through a travel portal instead of directly with the hotel. it also doesn't have trip cancellation or interruption coverage, which is somewhat unusual for a travel credit card.\n\nif you're only planning to redeem your miles using the purchase eraser, you could be better off with our benchmark citi double cash card, which earns 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase, 1% when you pay it off — since you'll be effectively earning 2 cents in rewards for every dollar you spend either way, but the venture card has a $95 annual fee.\n\ncapital one's transfer partners also include only one us airline option (jetblue), though advanced card holders will be able to leverage international airline alliances to score domestic redemptions. but if you think you'll mix in some airline transfers, even down the line, the venture card serves as a great beginner gateway to the world of transferable points.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus, purchase protections and travel protections.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee and an introductory rate on balance transfers.\n\nread our complete capital one venture credit card review.\n\nwells fargo propel american express: best travel protections for no annual fee\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the wells fargo propel amex features a unique combination of strong bonus categories, easy-to-redeem points, an introductory interest rate on purchases and balance transfers, solid travel protections, no foreign transaction fees and even cell phone protection coverage, all for no annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people who spend significant money on dining, travel (including gas) and certain streaming services, and want to earn travel rewards for no annual fee.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 3 points for every dollar you spend on dining and travel.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar on gas stations, ride-shares and transit.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar on popular streaming services\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\ncell phone protection coverage.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (14.49% to 24.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% interest for 12 months on balance transfers made in the first 120 days after you open the card (14.49% to 24.99% variable afterward).\n\nbalance transfer fee of 3% of each transaction (minimum $5).\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 20,000 bonus points when you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first three months.\n\nwhat we like about the wells fargo propel: while we've included it on our best travel credit cards list, the wells fargo propel amex is similar to a cash back card, since its points can be redeemed at 1 cent per point whether it's for travel, gift cards, as a statement credit or even for cash at a wells fargo atm.\n\nbut the card has a great mix of features, including a slew of useful 3x bonus categories that cover many everyday purchases, and the fact that it doesn't rely as heavily on travel as the other cards on our list could make it more valuable in the current climate.\n\nyou'll also find a 0% introductory interest rate on both purchases and balance transfers on the wells fargo propel, though be sure to clear your debt within 12 months, because after that the rate jumps to a variable 14.49% to 24.99%, depending on your creditworthiness.\n\nyou'll get many enhanced travel protections — such as travel accident insurance, car rental damage coverage and lost luggage insurance — that will be useful when travel resumes. and even while you're not on the road, you'll be covered for up to $600 in the event your cell phone is stolen or damaged (subject to a $25 deductible), so long as you pay your cell phone bill with the propel amex. it's a surprisingly robust set of benefits and perks on a card that has no annual fee.\n\nphoto: istock you're covered with the wells fargo propel amex if your cell phone is stolen or damaged.\n\nwhat could be better: the major feature missing from the wells fargo propel is the ability to transfer points to airline or hotel programs — instead, you can only redeem the points for travel using the issuer's go far rewards travel portal. (however, there's one way to increase the value of your points: if you also have the wells fargo visa signature® card, you can transfer your points between the cards and redeem them for airfare at 1.5 cents per point through the visa signature.)\n\nyou'll also want to be sure the bonus categories make sense for you based on your spending habits versus a flat-rate everyday card. the propel amex is also missing a few high-end travel protections like trip delay and trip interruption coverage, but frankly, for a no-annual-fee card, these are minor omissions.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: bonus points for travel, dining and streaming services, travel protections, cell phone protection, an introductory rate on purchases and sign-up bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has a longer introductory period on balance transfers (18 months) and the option to convert its cash back to transferable thankyou points if you also have the citi premier℠ card or citi prestige®.\n\nthe information for the wells fargo propel amex card and the wells fargo visa signature card has been collected independently by cnn underscored. the card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: one of the few no-annual-fee credit cards with both transfer partners and easy-to-redeem direct redemptions, the capital one ventureone features a lower earning rate than its more expensive sibling but offers the same solid redemption options.\n\nthis card is right for: people who like the features of the capital one venture but are willing to exchange a lower everyday earning rate for no annual fee.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 1.25 miles per dollar on all purchases with no limit.\n\nredeem miles for any travel purchase at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nmiles can also be transferred to any of capital one's 15 airline partners.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (15.49% to 25.49% variable afterward).\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 20,000 bonus miles after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the capital one ventureone: usually when there are two versions of the same credit card — one with an annual fee and another without — you can expect the no-annual-fee one to be a fairly stripped-down offering. but that's not necessarily the case with the capital one ventureone.\n\nmost of the features of the more expensive capital one venture remain intact on the ventureone, including the same 1 cent per mile redemption value when using the card's purchase eraser to wipe out any travel charge (as well as food delivery and streaming services between now and april 30, 2021), access to the same airline and hotel transfer partners at the same transfer ratios, the same travel and purchase protections, and even the same no foreign transaction fees.\n\nthe main two downsides of the ventureone are a reduced 1.25 miles earned for every dollar you spend (instead of the 2 miles you get on the venture) and only a 20,000-mile sign-up bonus, albeit with a lower minimum spending requirement of just $1,000 in purchases in the first three months you have the account. depending on how much value you can get from these two features, you may want to consider the ventureone with no annual fee and most of the best perks.\n\nphoto: istock miles earned with the capital one ventureone can be redeemed for any travel purchase.\n\nwhat could be better: unless you're going to take advantage of capital one's transfer partners, you'd be better off with our benchmark citi double cash card over the ventureone. that's because you're only earning 1.25 miles per dollar with the capital one ventureone, and you only get 1 cent per mile when redeeming them using the purchase eraser, meaning you're effectively getting a return of 1.25 cents per dollar spent, while the citi double cash earns 2 cents per dollar spent.\n\nthat equation changes if you can utilize the transfer partners when travel gets rolling again, since you can score a higher redemption rate than just 1 cent per mile if you do your homework. but if you're ready for that more advanced step, you're probably better off starting with the more powerful capital one venture card anyway, especially since the $95 annual fee on that card is more than offset by its bigger sign-up bonus.\n\nin the worst-case scenario, you can always try the venture card for a year and get the sign-up bonus, then convert it to a no-annual-fee ventureone after the first year if you still aren't using all its features (though keep in mind you won't get a second sign-up bonus for converting).\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus, purchase protections and travel protections.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\n\nread our complete capital one ventureone rewards card review.\n\nwant a credit card that covers you when you're traveling? check out cnn underscored's guide to the best credit cards with

(cnn) north korean leader kim jong un said his country is developing new weaponry including a nuclear-powered submarine, tactical nuclear weapons and advanced warheads designed to penetrate missile defense systems.\n\nin comments published saturday, kim said north korea is pushing ahead with the armaments to deter the united states, comments that appear to show president donald trump's strategy of high-level engagement with pyongyang -- including three historic in-person meetings between trump and kim -- failed to convince pyongyang to stop its pursuit of a modern nuclear arsenal.\n\nno matter who is in power in the us, the true nature and the true spirit of the anti-north korea policy will never change, kim said, according to the country's state-run korean central news agency (kcna).\n\nthe development of nuclear weapons be pushed forward without interruption.\n\nthe projects, according to kim, are at various stages of development. he said multiple-warhead guidance technology is in the final stage, while studies in hypersonic flight that could be applied to new ballistic missiles are complete, with north korea making preparations for their test and production -- a possible sign that pyongyang may be on the verge of resuming the type of missile testing anathema to washington and seoul.\n\nimprovements in tactical nuclear weapons -- which are meant to be used at shorter range and are often less destructive than strategic nuclear weapons -- are also being finalized, kim said. nuclear-powered submarine research appears to be the least far along. research into these subs is complete and in the final stages of examination, kim said.\n\nin this photo provided by the north korean government, north korean leader kim jong un attends the party congress in pyongyang, north korea, on tuesday.\n\nread more

(cnn) —\n\nmichigan state university fostered a culture that was more focused on protecting the school than the survivors of serial abuser larry nassar, a report released thursday by the michigan house of representatives said.\n\nstate lawmakers conducted their own investigation of msu's handling of complaints against the former sports doctor to identify possible policy solutions. the house sent their findings to law enforcement for consideration in the michigan attorney general's investigation of msu's handling of the nassar case.\n\nphoto: jeff kowalsky/afp/afp/getty images larry nassar\n\nthe attorney general appreciates the work done by the michigan house of representatives, the attorney general's office said in a statement. the investigative team will be reviewing the report.\n\nthe report marks the first time the state legislature has commented publicly on the nassar case. it is one of many steps taken by lawmakers and law enforcement to figure out how multiple institutions failed hundreds of nassar's victims – many of them minors – for over 30 years. nassar was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison for his crimes in both ingham and eaton counties.\n\nmichigan state spokeswoman emily guerrant said the university will continue cooperating with lawmakers to create improvements and changes with the hopes of preventing tragedies like this from ever happening again.\n\nthese are some of the report's findings:\n\n243 people have reported nassar to msu since 2014\n\nfrom 2014 to the present, 243 people reported abuse to the michigan state university police department, according to the report. most of those who reported abuse were minors at the time.\n\nthe house report also noted that 91 other title ix complaints were filed against nassar since rachel denhollander filed a title ix complaint against him in 2016. denhollander spoke to the indianoplis star in 2016, and, after her interview, many others came forward to tell their own stories of sexual assault and harassment at the hands of nassar.\n\nmsu 'failed to properly investigate'\n\namanda thomashow, a former msu student, filed a title ix complaint against nassar in 2014. the school conducted an investigation and determined that nassar's conduct did not violate the school's sexual harassment policy.\n\nbut the house report states that msu failed to properly investigate thomashow's complaint for a number of reasons.\n\nfor one, the investigation was based on flawed testimony from biased medical experts, the report said. each expert worked with nassar or knew him personally, and nassar handpicked one of them, according to the report.\n\nmoreover, the experts' explanations were fallacious at best and only provided circular justifications for what nassar claimed were legitimate medical treatments, the report states.\n\nthe report also points out that thomashow received a different final report than nassar. thomashow's report did not include the new requirements nassar would need to follow when practicing similar procedures on patients. nassar's did. the discrepancy demonstrates an office culture more focused on protecting the institution than survivors, the report states.\n\nmsu 'defiantly' stands by its 2014 investigation\n\nthe report notes that msu continues to defiantly and wrongfully maintain it did not mishandle the 2014 title ix investigation. msu still defends the conclusions of their 2014 investigation, arguing that the facts of thomashow's case were materially different from a later investigation, which reached the opposite conclusion, the report states.\n\nnassar didn't keep medical records on everything\n\nmedical records for many of what nassar called his treatments were not kept, the report found. in the medical records that were kept, they didn't include any mention of or reference to the more sensitive parts of his treatments, like intravaginal penetration.\n\nin other cases, msu destroyed medical records of people who reported abuse or harassment to msu police later, but they were all destroyed in accordance with state law and msu's record retention policy, according to the report.\n\nnassar grew more comfortable with abuse over time\n\nwhile nassar initially took more care to make his treatments seem medically appropriate when he began these treatments in the 1990s, as time went on, he grew more comfortable with his conduct. initially, nassar would explain the procedure and demonstrate on a pelvic model.\n\nby the 2000s, he would only mention to victims that he was going to adjust the pelvic bones. by 2014, he felt comfortable enough to abuse his patients without any prior explanation when performing the treatment, according to the report.\n\nby 2016, he was self-assured enough to readily admit to investigators that he 'does not get written consent from the patient before treatment' and even testified that 'unless the patient stops him, he is assuming the patient understand.' \n\nmsu sexual assault and harassment policies are changing\n\nmsu has changed a number of policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment and assault since nassar was suspended from msu in 2016. the office of institutional equity, the office within the university that handles title ix complaints, only had three staff members in the 2014-2015 academic year, the staff increased to

repealing and replacing obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\n\nrolling back obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\n\nbut if republican repeal efforts fail, house speaker paul ryan signaled tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\n\nif the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, ryan said on cnbc's power lunch.we will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\n\ngiven how hard repealing obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. so for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. they include a high-income medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\n\nthe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. it would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. and they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the senate.\n\nadding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. as it is, it's a heavy lift, said roberton williams, a senior fellow at the tax policy center.\n\nrelated: who pays if congress kills the state and local tax deduction\n\ntax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. for starters, there are still big disagreements within the republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\n\nif they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what ryan wants.\n\nthe white house has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the house and senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\n\ndespite what many skeptics believe, ryan on tuesday said after a speech before the national association of manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.

(cnn) the rev. raphael warnock , the senior pastor of ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, will be the first black senator from georgia, cnn projected early wednesday, a repudiation of republican sen. kelly loeffler and her adherence to president donald trump.\n\nthe democratic party appears closer to retaking the us senate, as georgia republican david perdue narrowly trails in his fight to keep his seat against democratic candidate jon ossoff. both candidates claimed they would win after all the ballots had been counted, but cnn has not yet called the race.\n\nwarnock is the first georgia democrat elected to the senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state house democratic leader stacey abrams and other activists. president-elect joe biden also won georgia, the first time for a democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s.\n\ni am an iteration and an example of the american dream, the senator-elect told cnn's john berman wednesday morning on new day. he added, when i think about the arc of our history, what georgia did last night is its own message in the midst of a moment in which so many people are trying to divide our country, at a time we can least afford to be divided.\n\nafter no georgia senate candidate received 50% of the vote in november, the races turned to two runoffs. while ossoff and warnock ran on a unity ticket, trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the republican party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.\n\ntrump's ongoing onslaught against the republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two gop senators to make a choice: join the president in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. trump recently appeared to pressure georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse the results. raffensperger refused.\n\nbut despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, loeffler and perdue decided to join the president in objecting to congress' certification of the electoral college's results in a final, deluded display of devotion to trump supporters.\n\nthe american people deserve a platform in congress, permitted under the constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed, said loeffler in a statement on monday.\n\nasked if it was appropriate for her to vote against certification of the electoral votes, warnock told cnn wednesday that his opponent has consistently put what she perceives to be her own short-term political interests over the concerns of ordinary people.\n\nwhat is unfolding in the senate today or in the house, what's unfolding in this moment is a distraction. it's a distraction, he told berman. these senators know better and the people that i'm talking to all across georgia are concerned about their lives.\n\nwhile georgia is a rapidly diversifying state, the republican candidates came into the senate runoff elections with an advantage.\n\nin november, perdue received over 88,000 more votes than ossoff, while loeffler and the other republican candidates received more votes than warnock and the other democratic candidates in the special election (warnock received most of the vote -- 33% -- overall).\n\nrepublicans hoped their message that georgia should be a check on washington would prove successful, noting that if warnock and ossoff win, biden, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer will be in charge.\n\nwe're talking about the future of the country, and we can't just turn it all over to one party, said eric tanenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former republican georgia gov. sonny perdue, before election day. that could be wishful thinking on my part. but i do think that that's going to be a big motivator.\n\nbut republicans are worried that trump's unwillingness to concede jeopardizes the party's hold on the senate, even though the state has not elected a democrat to the chamber since 2000.\n\nheath garrett, a campaign manager for former georgia republican sen. johnny isakson, told cnn that trump's attacks on gov. brian kemp and raffensperger were counterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base republicans to go vote, and said they've threw perdue and loeffler off message in the final days of the campaign.\n\nsenator perdue and senator loeffler are being whipsawed by the president on one side and by the democratic money on the other side, he said.\n\nperdue and loeffler had attempted to avoid the intraparty feud sparked by trump by focusing on ossoff and warnock.\n\nperdue's closing message in a recent video was littered with attacks, saying that if republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, americans' private health insurance will be taken away, and democrats will pack the supreme court and defund the police.\n\nwe win georgia, we save america, perdue told the camera.\n\nthe democratic candidates counter that they would demilitarize rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. neither democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.\n\nthey argued they would do a better job ending the health care crisis over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 20.8 million americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. they've pushed policy goals, including debt-free public college and a new voting rights act. and they've attacked the republican senators for their multi-million dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. the senators have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nwarnock told cnn wednesday that he believes tackling the pandemic by effectively distributing the vaccine and passing $2,000 stimulus checks should be the new senate's top priority.\n\nthe special election was particularly brutal, starting last year when gop rep. doug collins forced loeffler, who kemp appointed to the role in 2019, into a race to the right.\n\nafter no candidate received 50% of the vote, the runoffs turned even more vicious, as loeffler portrayed warnock an anti-police marxist who would destroy america in the senate.\n\nwe have to have georgians come out and vote because we know that chuck schumer's radical agents of change are raphael warnock and jon ossoff, said loeffler on the campaign trail monday. they would defund the police. they would lock down our economy. and we have to make sure that we hold the line right here in georgia.\n\nwarnock has in turn promoted his background from the savannah projects to the pulpit of martin luther king jr.'s historic church, while firing back at loeffler.\n\nkelly loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you, said warnock in an ad. she's trying to make you afraid of me because she's afraid of you. afraid that you understand how she's used her position in the senate to enrich herself and others like her. afraid that you'll realize that we can do better.\n\nperdue, a 71-year-old former fortune 500 ceo, has dismissed ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, saying the democrat does not know how to create a job. at their debate in the fall, ossoff called the senator a crook who was fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading while attacking the health of the people who he represents. perdue snapped back that the democrat had worked for the mouthpiece of terrorism and communist china -- claims ossoff called ridiculous.\n\nthe georgia us senate races have attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the biden administration and the state's shift from red to purple. dr. charles bullock, a university of georgia political science professor, told cnn that the senate elections could be the first in which urban georgia casts more votes than rural georgia.\n\nwe've seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while democrats will have a lead when polls open ... republicans are expected to have a strong election day, said seth bringman, a spokesman for fair fight action, a voting rights organization founded by abrams.\n\npolitical groups spent about $520 million to advertise in the two runoff races, according to kantar media/cmag, averaging more than $8 million per day. republicans outspent democrats by tens of millions of dollars.\n\nwith the senate on the line, trump rallied his supporters in northwest georgia on monday, while president-elect joe biden held an event in atlanta.\n\nbiden said electing ossoff and warnock would end the gridlock in washington and allow congress to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to americans. trump urged the state to elect perdue and loeffler, and claimed that biden would not take the white house.\n\nwe're going to fight like hell, said the president.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments wednesday.

(photo by chip somodevilla/getty images)\n\neditor's note: fernand fernandez is the interim president and ceo of the united states hispanic chamber of commerce, the country's largest hispanic business association. the opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nlast september, when president trump moved to phase out the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, congress was given until march 5 to pass a permanent, legislative solution. this week, that deadline passed. were it not for a federal judge's ruling that the program must at least temporarily continue, 800,000 daca recipients would be at risk of deportation.\n\nphoto: sheryl lanzel fernand fernandez\n\nthough the termination of daca has been delayed by the federal court, the legal stability of daca status is not guaranteed. the ruling that is protecting daca recipients could be overturned by an appeal process, just as the executive order that created the program was subsequently overturned with a change in presidential administration. in order to permanently secure the legal status of dreamers, daca or a similar act must be enacted as law.\n\nour leaders in congress have an excellent opportunity to pass a bipartisan solution that has the overwhelming support of the american public. in fact, a poll last september by abc/washington post shows that 86% of americans want dreamers to stay. instead of wrongfully conflating the fate of dreamers with totally separate issues such as national security, our elected officials should be jumping at the chance to create substantive, meaningful change just before the 2018 midterm elections.\n\ndaca has long been framed as a humanitarian issue. the moral case is clear. the individuals who immigrated to the united states as children did not intentionally violate immigration law and should not be punished for the actions of their parents. they have grown up in american schools, pledged allegiance to the american flag and are contributing to the american workforce. the united states is the only home they know.\n\nat the united states hispanic chamber of commerce, we recognize that daca is also an economic issue. the contributions of dreamers to our economy cannot be overstated. they contribute over $40 billion each year to our gross domestic product (gdp), according to a report from the american action forum.\n\ndaca-eligible immigrants pay $2 billion each year in state and local taxes, according to a report from the institute on taxation and economic policy. one study indicates that 97% of daca recipients are in school or employed.\n\namerica depends on dreamers, many of whom give back to their communities. approximately 9,000 daca recipients are serving as teachers. an additional 14,000 work in health care services. to threaten the legal status of daca recipients is not only a disservice to the individuals contributing to our economy and society, but also to the greater united states.\n\nthe state of arizona, for example, has approximately 27,000 daca recipients. if arizona's daca recipients were forced to leave, the state's gdp would drop by $1.3 billion. if texas's 124,300 daca recipients were deported, texas gdp would drop by nearly $6.3 billion. california – the state with the largest daca population of 222,795 –would suffer a gdp loss of over $11 billion without its daca recipients.\n\na daca solution is the path forward for a prosperous american future. while march 5 no longer marks the official end of daca, it should remain a call to action for the white house and members of congress. we ask that our leaders in government save the partisan fighting for actual partisan issues and take this opportunity to show the american people that our elected officials are willing to come together to craft legislation that supports the shared interests of all americans.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthis is a crucial moment for washington – a chance to demonstrate to the american people that our government still works and that our leaders can still lead.\n\nbut, most importantly, this is a crucial moment for dreamers, the bright, young individuals who do not wish to live in the shadows. their futures rest in the hands of our elected officials, and we ask that they be granted the security to permanently live, work and learn in the united states – their only home.
alabama, which is one of the most profitable college football programs in the country, defends its title against clemson on monday night.\n\na win could bring in even more money for the school.\n\nthe crimson tide's football program reported $103.9 million in revenue for 2016 and posted a $47 million profit. that's up 3.6% from last year.\n\nticket sales account for a big chunk of those earnings, and another championship title will probably mean even stronger ticket sales for next season.\n\nmerchandise revenue will also get a big boost -- alabama has a lucrative deal with collegiate licensing company. it's netted $98 million in royalties since the company was founded in 1981 by alabama's current athletic director, bill battle. alabama was the company's first client and is its top seller, with licensing fees skyrocketing 250% since 2005. battle no longer runs the company.\n\nrelated: clemson is covered -- win or lose\n\nticket prices for monday night's game hit a record high. the average resale ticket price was $3,053 as of saturday, according to ticketiq. the cheapest ticket to get into the game on the alabama side was $1,794. on clemson's side, the cheapest tickets cost $2,600.\n\nwhile these prices won't affect 2016 profits, they'll translate into more money for the program going forward.\n\nas a division i school, alabama also gets a cut of espn's 12-year deal for the rights to broadcast the playoffs, which is worth $7.3 billion.\n\nwith all the money alabama makes, it can afford to pay its head football coach well. nick saban, the second-highest paid college coach in the country, made $6.9 million in 2016. michigan's jim harbaugh made $9 million.\n\nin addition to his ceo-like salary, saban has postseason bonuses built into his contract, which he'll receive whether the team wins or loses. other coaches and select staff members will also receive bonuses.\n\nrelated: ticket prices for alabama-clemson championship game hit a record\n\nstaff bonuses are just part of the expenses of playing in a championship game. clemson, which narrowly lost to alabama in the 2016 title game, took out an insurance policy this year to help cover the cost of what it hoped would be a rematch.\n\nalabama, which has won four national championships in the last seven years, didn't need insurance.\n\nin the words of battle, alabama feels like self-insuring is a better bet.\n\nbattle said alabama budgets for postseason expenses like bowl and championship games so spending on insurance doesn't make sense.
federal reserve chair janet yellen traded sharp words in a rare, feisty exchange with a congressman over legislation that could limit the central bank's independence.\n\nthe normally reserved yellen pushed back against pointed questions from bill posey, a florida republican. he asked why she's opposed to a bill that would allow the government accountability office, a unit of congress, to audit the fed, and, more controversially, review its decisions on interest rates.\n\nposey said the bill, known as audit the fed, would provide more transparency for the central bank and its decisions. fed leaders say it would ruin the central bank's credibility by eliminating its independence.\n\nin january 2017 a version of the audit the fed bill was introduced in both chambers. it passed out of committees in both the house and the senate, but neither version has received a full vote in either the house or the senate. few think it will pass the senate.\n\nrelated: fed chief: trump policies are a source of uncertainty\n\nfor the life of me, i can't understand what the fed fears. can you give me an example that would justify the lack of transparency? posey asked at a hearing of the house financial services committee.\n\nwe don't have a lack of transparency, yellen quickly replied.\n\nyou do if you can't audit it -- that's a lack of transparency, posey shot back.\n\nfed leaders do make their decisions behind closed doors. but the central bank is audited twice a year -- once by the government through the fed's inspector general and once by a private auditor. critics of the bill question the point of a third audit.\n\nright now, gao officials don't attend fed meetings and are unable to second-guess its decisions. yellen argues that the proposed law would give them that power.\n\nrelated: fed raises rates in june\n\nposey pressed on.\n\nwhat do you fear about the audit? can you give me a real-time example? he said.\n\nyellen replied that central bank leaders need privacy to discuss monetary policy without being second-guessed in real time by officials representing lawmakers.\n\nposey wasn't satisfied. just give me an example -- give me an example -- of how transparency could hurt the fed? just give me one example, he asked, holding up his index finger.\n\nyellen started: because what you're talking about with the gao are policy reviews ...\n\nposey cut her off. no, just give me an example.\n\nshe did: i would envision a situation where the gao, at the request of members of congress, might come in and say at our meeting a week ago ... they believe the decision we made was the wrong one at that particular meeting, and i would say that's an extreme interference into monetary policy.\n\nposey replied: so you're telling me we shouldn't be transparent for the fear of being second-guessed or somebody criticizing you because they thought you were wrong?\n\nwhat we're talking about is political interference in decision-making by the [fed's] committee, yellen said.\n\ni don't see that, posey said.\n\ni do, yellen shot back.\n\nwell, give me an example, posey asked again.\n\ni gave you an example, yellen said, sharply.\n\nposey ran out of time, and the hearing moved on.\n\nyellen's testimony before the house on wednesday may have been her last. her term ends in february, and it's unclear whether president trump will reappoint her. house leaders repeatedly asked yellen whether she wants to say on, and she declined to comment.
the u.s. tax code overhaul will result in a tax cut for nearly two-thirds of u.s. households in 2018, according to the tax policy center.\n\nbut the average tax cut will vary by state depending on economic and demographic characteristics, and whether residents pay high state and local taxes, which are now capped as a deduction on one's federal return.\n\nthe map below indicates the average tax cut in each state as measured across all filers in that state – those getting a tax cut, those facing a tax increase and those who will see no change at all. only a small minority of filers will owe more in federal taxes, ranging from a low of 2.8% of residents in west virginia to a high of 10.2% in new jersey.\n\nwhile a tax cut may represent a notable drop in average tax burden, it doesn't necessarily represent a big jump in one's after-tax income, which is a better measure of how a tax cut changes someone's economic situation. for example, mississippi residents will see their average federal tax burden drop by $1,040, or 9.5% on average. but that only represents a jump of 1.8% in after-tax income.

this was excerpted from the january 4 edition of cnn's meanwhile in america, the daily email about us politics for global readers. click here to read past editions and subscribe.\n\n(cnn) if the anti-democratic plotting taking place in washington right now were unfolding in a developing nation, the united states would no doubt lead the condemnation.\n\nimagine: a raging president refuses to accept that his rule is ending and incites mass protests to disrupt the certification of his election loss. a radicalized band of loyalist lawmakers also tries to deny voters' verdict . the wannabe autocrat leans on a party subordinate to find enough votes to let him win. propagandistic media organs spew misinformation to support the his lies. meanwhile the real crisis — a once-in-a-century pandemic that kills 3,000 citizens each day — is ignored in a gross display of negligence.\n\nwere this anywhere else, the us state department would issue a statement calling for the restoration of democratic principles and good governance. the president might make a disapproving comment in a press conference, and legislators might call for sanctions. but they can't, because the turmoil is here at home, wracking world's oldest democracy and undermining america's claim to be a moral example and advocate for free people worldwide.\n\nwhen congress meets on wednesday to certify the presidential election results, more than half of the elected republicans in the house and a quarter of their number in the senate are expected to support an effort to raise baseless claims of mass voter fraud. they won't stop president-elect joe biden from becoming president. but they will cement a false belief among millions of trump voters that the election was stolen.\n\nbefore that, two senate runoffs in georgia tuesday will decide whether democrats can achieve a 50-50 split in the chamber. if so, biden's party will have the advantage of vice president-to-be kamala harris's tie-breaking vote. but a thin republican majority would create huge friction on biden's administration, complicating efforts to confirm cabinet nominees, secure a new stimulus plan and money to fix a botched vaccine rollout, and to advance big goals in climate policy, health care and rebuilding us infrastructure.\n\nread more

why are there no emojis that represent interracial couples?\n\na group of advocates which include dating app tinder, reddit cofounder alexis ohanian and the founder of emojinotion, jennifer 8, are asking unicode consortium to add interracial couple emoji into its mix. the consortium is the nonprofit that reviews and develops emoji standards,\n\nin a proposal made public on tuesday, they ask for the addition of 21 different sequences with various skin tones for the existing emoji, couple with heart, for example.\n\ntinder also launched a change.org petition to drum up support.\n\nas the largest and most diverse platform for meeting new people, we are uniquely positioned and incredibly proud to petition for this update, said rosette pambakian, tinder's head of brand, in an e-mail. inclusivity is a core value at tinder, and we believe in fighting for what our users believe in.\n\npambakian said tinder ideated the concept for the interracial couples and is an author of the proposal.\n\nmultiracial emojis only became available in 2015. in 2017, microsoft's windows 10.0 added interracial couple sequences. but those can only be accessed by copy and paste for now.\n\nrelated: 157 new emoji coming to ios, android\n\nthere's been a steady rise in interracial marriages since 1967, according to a pew research study. in 2015, about 17% of all newlyweds were in interracial relationships.\n\ntinder recently paid for a study on interracial couples that it also released on tuesday. its findings reveal 61% of respondents say they're very open to the idea of interracial dating and marriage.\n\nthe interracial couple emojis proposal features photos of some of the authors and their biracial spouses.\n\nohanian is pictured with his wife, professional tennis star serena williams. he said in the proposal that emojis should reflect current society.\n\nwe want our kids to have emojis that look like their parents, he said in a statement. emojis are the universal language of the internet and should reflect the modern world where interracial relationships are normal.\n\nohanian was one of the advocates who helped make the hijab emoji a reality in 2017, along with emojination's lee.\n\nlee, who has advocated for a number of emoji including the dumpling, is a coauthor of the interracial couple proposal.
is your phone, tablet and laptop killing those in-flight entertainment screens at each seat? not quite.\n\nin-flight internet provider gogo and delta air lines on tuesday announced it was unveiling a new kind of tablet that would be affixed to the seat-back. rather than a wired, custom-designed screen, delta would install standardized android tablets at each seat that would wirelessly stream content from an on-board server.\n\nthat will not only reduce the weight of the system, but also opens a lot of new possibilities for airlines.\n\ngogo's new product is part of a major shift in how in-flight internet is transforming how we stay entertained in the sky.\n\nthe new screens will start rolling out on the first of 75 new bombardier c series aircraft arriving at delta in the spring.\n\neven as seats are smaller and planes more packed, your flying experience is going to be marked by improved technology. and increasingly the advancements represent a marriage between our personal devices and in-flight entertainment and connectivity.\n\nour airborne living room\n\nhow we use our devices on the ground is now how we expect to use them when we fly, airlines say.\n\npeople are very accustomed to consuming multiple pieces of information at one time these days, said joe kiely, managing director, customer experience & product development at delta in an interview. and having the seat back screen and having streaming...and wi-fi, which is getting faster and faster is what they're really accustomed to when they're at home.\n\ndelta has those individual screens on all its new planes and it spent $770 million to add them to most of its older jets. and the carrier announced wednesday the airline was adding free texting to all its connected aircraft.\n\nairlines have split on the future of seat back screens. smaller jets that don't hop between continents aren't getting the same electronic amenities as bigger jets. airbus says only about 30% of its smaller single-aisle jets are delivered with personal monitors, the number is estimated to be even lower for boeing.\n\nrelated: this plane may vastly improve flying in the u.s., if it first doesn't start a trade war\n\nbut with more passengers coming aboard with a myriad of electronics, some airlines are questioning if the screens they provide still have a place in the sky. nearly 80% of americans now own a smartphone and half have a tablet, according to the pew research center.\n\nunited airlines, alaska airlines and hawaiian airlines have all steered away. instead, phones, tablets and laptops can tap into high-speed internet or on-board streaming to deliver the same entertainment library or live tv.\n\nand the country's biggest carrier, american airlines, said that its 100 new single-aisle 737 max jets would arrive without seat back screens. the airline said thursday it was removing them from its current 737s.\n\nit makes sense for american to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years, the company said in a statement.\n\njonathan norris, vice president of sales and marketing for panasonic avionics, which supplies about half of the world's in-flight screens, says american's attitude is understandable. your [in-flight entertainment] screen is judged by your latest iphone or your tablet, he said. panasonic is developing a new generation of more easily upgradable screens that will be ready around 2020.\n\ngoing the distance\n\nwhile airlines debate the future of those seat-back screens, the one place they aren't going away is on long-distance flights.\n\nairbus says all its new long-range a350 jets and a380 superjumbos are fitted with the screens at each seat. and over the past three years about 95% of its smaller twin-aisle a330s have the same. boeing declined to supply its figures, but a review by cnnmoney suggests its long-range jets have similarly tricked-out cabins.\n\nthe electronics ban on nine middle eastern airlines earlier in 2017 put the screens back in the spotlight. the ban forced travelers to check or leave behind their laptops and tablets. one airline declared: 'let us entertain you,' a nod to the individual systems at each seat for movies, games and even a view outside.\n\neven low-cost, long-haul carriers like norwegian air shuttle are putting screens at each seat on its biggest jets.\n\nin-flight entertainment has come a long way. the first in-flight movie dates back to the 1920s, but aerial cinema took its biggest leap in the 1990s with small personal screens at each seat. airlines started adding sluggish wi-fi in 2004, but it wasn't until smartphones and tablets arrived a decade ago, that carriers started to think differently about aerial entertainment.\n\ndelta's move to improve the seatback screen is only the first step, says gogo. by connecting the aircraft through a high-speed satellite internet connection, the seatback screen may open up a world of entertainment choices for airlines.\n\nhigh-speed services from gogo, honeywell, panasonic and viasat can already stream video to a device you bring aboard, but it won't be long before airlines can enable streaming services like hulu, hbo now and amazon video directly to the seatback.\n\nand the big names in content streaming are taking notice. netflix on monday said it had developed a new type of encoding to shrink the amount of bandwidth used for in-flight streaming.\n\nairlines are also merging on-board technology with the devices passengers have in their carry-on luggage.\n\nlufthansa's app now lets you make personal playlists of music, audio books and films that are ready on the screen when you take your seat. singapore airlines wirelessly pairs your phone or tablet with your screen to control a movie or follow the flight's progress.\n\nthis is about the internet of me, says norris. this is about a passenger who walks on, synchronizes their phone with the seat back...to customize their experience on board.

champagne corks pop in berlin as gay rights supporters celebrate a historic vote to legalize same-sex marriage photographs by andrea gjestvang for cnn story by laura smith-spark and claudia otto, cnn\n\nberlin (cnn) — pouring rain could do nothing to dampen the spirits of scores of people who gathered outside the bundestag in berlin on friday morning, some clutching rainbow umbrellas, to await parliament's vote on a bill legalizing gay marriage in germany.\n\nas news came that the bill had passed — convincingly — they broke out into loud cheers, wept tears of joy and exchanged kisses. some popped champagne corks in celebration despite the early hour.\n\nthis was the day that some had doubted would ever come. and now, in the space of a few days, an offer by chancellor angela merkel to allow lawmakers a free vote on the issue has become all but law.\n\npeople celebrate outside the chancellery in berlin after lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nonce germany's senate approves the bill next week, as expected, homosexual couples in germany will have the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry and jointly adopt children — barring any legal challenge.\n\nit is a very important moment for germany and for the queer people in germany, because we fought really long for equality in our rights and now it is time, project manager andreas reschke told cnn.\n\nasked if he had any marriage plans, reschke laughed and looked at his partner as he responded. yeah, maybe.\n\nandreas reschke kisses his boyfriend after the result was announced.\n\nnico, a 20-year-old student who preferred to give only his first name, said he had traveled with his partner from dresden, 120 miles away, to be part of the landmark moment and that he was now so happy.\n\nwe woke up very early and we knew it was raining in berlin, but we thought it is so important we have to come here, he said. it is incredible, i can't believe it. i think (merkel) said it on monday and today is friday and we have a new law.\n\nthe change means his dream of marriage is now possible, he said, as is his hope of one day adopting children.\n\nnico and jan came to berlin from dresden to witness the historic moment.\n\nhannah klaubert, 26, said it was important to be visible on such a significant day — and that the fight for equality was not over.\n\nthere are still 200 people who voted against (the bill) today, so i think it's going to be important still, said klaubert, who works for an international non-profit organization.\n\nand there are so many other issues like trans-rights and all other kinds of things that are not okay here and that we need to keep on fighting for.\n\nhannah klabuert hugs her partner.\n\nspeaking after the bill passed, merkel — who had until monday opposed the holding of a free vote on the issue — said she had voted no, but that it had been important to put it to a vote of conscience.\n\nklaubert said she was unimpressed by the way the chancellor handled the issue. i think it was just a political, cold-hearted strategy and i really don't like it.\n\nfor torsten benzin, a lawyer, the change in the law is hugely significant.\n\ntorsten benzin said friday's vote was as monumental a moment as the fall of the ussr.\n\nit took almost 30 years in germany, we fought for it and today is the day. for me personally, because i'm from the former gdr, this is as important as the berlin wall falling, he said.\n\ni'm already in a partnership and of course, i will now finally change it into a real marriage. this means no longer having to tick boxes on forms to say that he is partnered rather than married, benzin said, adding: my sexuality is nobody's business.\n\nhe said merkel had delayed on the issue until her hand was finally forced by pressure from rival political parties ahead of september's elections. i believe that it was a tactical maneuver because she knew, if she didn't do it now, it would be an ever-lasting thing for the next coalition negotiations.\n\nrainy weather didn't stop people from gathering outside the bundestag in berlin.\n\nsoftware developer sebastian vetter told cnn he had braved the downpour to be part of the historic moment.\n\nit is important to show we are here, we support gay marriage, marriage equality, marriage for everyone — so that the people there who are giving their vote know we are here and we are proud to be part of the community, he said.\n\nmerkel could have acted on the issue far sooner, vetter said, but no matter how it happened it just happened. now we got the chance and we have to use it.\n\nit is a historical day and yes let's celebrate the whole weekend, said sebastian vetter.\n\nwhile he has no immediate plans to get married, vetter is very happy to now have that option.\n\nlet's see what the future brings, but as we saw in other countries, if there is gender equality people are more aware that people love people and that has nothing to do with their sex or gender.\n\nit is a step in the right direction to end discrimination.
atlanta (cnn) i live alone in my home surrounded by my family who live here, too... it's corona-complicated.\n\ni haven't seen them in weeks. not in person. i hear them, their footsteps, and my wife's voice as she talks on the phone to others. the creak of the floor, the open and close of a door. the tv. the shower.\n\ni am haunted by living ghosts.\n\nweeks ago my wife, blis, and i planned what we'd do if someone in our family got sick, including how we would divvy up living space to isolate the patient. it's a concern because my wife has an autoimmune disease.\n\nwe had already stocked up. being a journalist, you are pretty up on the information, and the virus writing was on the wall some time ago. but events have unraveled in ways i hadn't fully considered.\n\ni had been on the road about two weeks, in alabama for an execution, then on the trail of the coronavirus, hopping flights to hot spots in florida, boston and new york.\n\nusually my family is thrilled when i tell them i'm headed home. this time i could hear the hesitation in my wife's voice when i called with the news.\n\nyou can keep going, she said it's ok.\n\ni said cnn had told us we all were now going to be based and working from home.\n\noh, was the reply.\n\nit wasn't that she didn't love me. but for the first time in 30 years she wasn't sure she wanted me... home.\n\ni knew why. i was a threat.\n\nthe rest of the family had been sheltering in place. i was waltzing back with who knows what. and though i had no symptoms, i had to be treated like that patient we had hypothesized weeks ago.\n\nonce at my house, in the garage, over the phone, i was told what my life would be.\n\nyou will go up to the master bedroom she said. she had already hurriedly evacuated her things. that is where you live, eat and work.\n\nmy heart said, this seems pretty extreme. my head said, she's exactly right.\n\nsavidge has quarantined himself in a bedroom to protect the rest of his family.\n\ntwo weeks is what they recommend, she added, referring to the self-quarantine guidelines. and every time you go off on another story... the clock resets.\n\nso, in the bathroom, i have a cooler full of drinks, a coffee maker and sanitizing wipes.\n\nin the bedroom, i have three computers for work, another to watch netflix, and two phones that serve as communications and camera for video links to cnn and my team.\n\nif i need anything, i call my wife or son and it materializes outside my door. there's a knock, they retreat, i retrieve once they have vanished again.\n\ni do leave the house each day to exercise. i call down. the rest of the family shelters in place till i'm out the door. we do the same in reverse when i come back.\n\nsavidge used a tablet to continue his tradition of making a birthday card for his wife.\n\nmy biggest challenge so far has been a birthday card. i have made one for my wife every year of our marriage. today, her birthday, i struggled. i managed some crude drawings using a tablet.\n\nthe hard part was getting it to print remotely downstairs when i couldn't see if anything was coming out. it took several tries coordinating over the phone with my son, who was at the printer.\n\nfinally, success.\n\non his wife's birthday, a slice of cake was left for savidge outside his self-imposed quarantine room.\n\nthen tonight over facetime, i joined my family singing happy birthday. instead of blowing out the candles, my wife extinguished them with a wave of a magazine.\n\nmoments later came a knock and a slice at my door. i never saw who delivered it.\n\nthese are the times in which we live.

year. follow him on facebook and twitter . the views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. view more opinion at cnn.\n\n(cnn) several candidates made strong cases for themselves in the new hampshire debate on friday. while amy klobuchar came out on top, the grades below indicate just how close the debate was (and unlike the iowa caucus, you don't need some new app to figure out who performed well).\n\namy klobuchar: a\n\nsen. amy klobuchar avoided most of her previous mistakes (interrupting other candidates and speaking over the moderators) and had her best debate yet. klobuchar was particularly terrific in the last half of the debate. her final answer -- in response to a question about the state of our country, where nearly one in five preschoolers live below the poverty line -- was by far the best on stage. she slammed the complete lack of empathy from president trump and made clear that she would support those who have trouble stretching their paychecks to pay for rent. to highlight the contrast between her and trump, klobuchar continually repeated, i know you and will fight for you.\n\nbut it wasn't just her final answer. senator klobuchar was solid on her defense of voting for the united states-mexico-canada agreement and why big money, voter purges, and gerrymandering are hurting the political process. finally, klobuchar pointed to the popularity of the affordable care act, and delivered an excellent defense of keeping it in favor of medicare for all.\n\njoe biden: a-\n\nbiden defended the politics of the past with more vigor than in any previous debate. he began by mentioning many of the policies he supported, from fighting domestic violence, to banning chemical weapons, and allowing same sex marriage, going on to say, i don't know what about the past of barack obama and joe biden was so bad.\n\nbiden also effectively highlighted his record on gun control and slammed senator bernie sanders for voting to protect gun manufacturers against lawsuits from victims of gun violence.\n\nfinally, in a uniting stance, biden asked the audience members to stand and applaud the actions of lt. col. alexander vindman, who testified in the house impeachment inquiry, only to be fired on friday by president trump.\n\nbiden should reiterate his commitment to african-american voters, instead of simply repeating poll numbers that point to their strong support for his candidacy. finally, biden should try to remember that his newly found energetic anger isn't appropriate for every answer in the debate.\n\nbernie sanders: b+\n\nsenator sanders was effective in his overall message about corruption, taking on drug companies, and price fixing. and toward the end of the debate, sanders was persuasive when he brought up the climate crisis and argued that military spending around the world could be better used to fight our common enemy, which is climate change..\n\nsenator sanders took some shots at pete buttigieg for courting wealthy donors, which would have been more effective if the senator had been able to provide clear examples of how campaign money might have influenced specific policy decisions. sanders also had a bit more trouble on issues like the cost of his health care plan, and gun control, but ultimately came out with decent defenses.\n\nelizabeth warren: b+\n\neven though warren may not have stood out in the first half of the debate, she set up her answers with a clever theme and reiterated the values of the party by stating: we are democrats. this played well with her indictment of the overarching corruption in the political system that favors corporations and the wealthy.\n\nperhaps her best moment came when she criticized pete buttigieg's answer on racial disparity in policing, and easily pivoted to the broader topic of why we need race-conscious laws in all areas, including housing, education, employment.\n\nfinally, while i like that warren seemingly stood her ground on the need to withdraw troops from the middle east, she then hedged her answer when she was pressed on whether she would maintain a us military presence in the region if her generals advised her to do so by saying, i want to hear the plan. in the end, i wasn't sure precisely what her position was.\n\npete buttigieg: c+\n\nbuttigieg's best moments came when he talked about his own experiences. as a veteran, buttigieg was excellent when talking about trump being unfit to serve as a commander-in-chief. he argued that trump has no regard for the military when he does things like refusing to read the intelligence reports or pardoning war criminals.\n\nbuttigieg had trouble answering a question about why marijuana arrests of african-americans increased while he was mayor of south bend, indiana. and buttigieg missed his moment when he was criticized for accepting big money donors. his defense -- that democrats needed to bring everybody into the fold -- fell flat. buttigieg delivered a stronger answer in the previous debate when he said that democrats needed all the financial help they could get in order to beat trump.\n\ntom steyer: c\n\nsteyer's theme was that the democratic nominee must be able to hit trump on trump's best talking point: the economy. over three different questions, steyer mentioned how the economy must be central if a democrat wants to beat trump. this strong use of repetition played to his strength.\n\nwhile steyer's eye contact with moderators, other debaters, and audience members was much better than in previous debates, he still made a basic debating error by bringing up a point without explaining it. steyer claimed one of biden's campaign surrogates made a racist remark. steyer refused to drop this point but did not clearly explain the situation. what happened? i don't know -- because tom steyer didn't offer an explanation. steyer's attack left viewers confused, and biden went on to brag about his support among the black caucus.\n\nandrew yang: c\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\ni liked that yang went back to his freedom dividend -- a $1,000 a month stipend -- as his theme. what hurt yang in this debate was his inability to tie the idea of a universal basic income to solid evidence that it will help issues from social justice to employment and even addiction. when klobuchar pressed him, yang should have interjected and spoken up about how he'd pay for his addiction treatment centers.\n\noverall, i thought yang was a bit off in his delivery last night with misplaced pauses, a lackluster speaking style and a rare inability to focus on presenting his most persuasive answers. to be honest, i think not being in the iowa debate might have thrown off his timing. both in substance and in style, i've heard yang give better answers in previous debates.
return to transcripts main page\n\nerin burnett outfront\n\njpmorgan's massive loss; interview with senator bob corker; iranian nuke program; interview with senator dianne feinstein; trayvon martin case; romney leading obama in new poll\n\naired may 14, 2012 - 19:00 et\n\nthis is a rush transcript. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n\n\nerin burnett, host: outfront next, the losses at jpmorgan, the number getting bigger today. the dow took a hit and a high level executive lost her job.\n\n\n\nand possible new evidence of iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. today there's a diagram. we show it to the chair of the senate intelligence committee, senator dianne feinstein outfront tonight.\n\n\n\nand new details just released about the case against george zimmerman, the man charged with killing trayvon martin. let's go outfront.\n\n\n\ngood evening, everyone and outfront tonight we have breaking news. the market today dropped about 125 points, thanks to greece and jpmorgan. deepening trading losses at the bank today. the total losses for america's biggest bank, at this moment we can tell you could now be $4 billion. just on friday we were telling you it was only three billion and you may have seen reports the day before that it was two billion. and jpmorgan is about to face a firing squad here in washington. at the bank today heads started to roll.\n\n\n\nthe first out was the woman at the top of the chief investment officer, ina drew (ph). she made $30 million in compensation in the past two years. it's unclear at this time how much of that may be clawed back related to recent competition reform. we're also just hours away from a more public showdown. ceo jamie dimon will be facing shareholder fire in person at the company's annual meeting in tampa.\n\n\n\njamie likes a fight but you can bet that he is not thrilled about the timing of this. there will be a lot of tough questions from shareholders and here in the halls of the senate there's an investigation in the works. senator bob corker, republican from tennessee, is the man who called for the hearings and he's outfront tonight. and good to see you, senator.\n\n\n\nsen. bob corker (r-tn), senate banking committee: good to be with you, erin.\n\n\n\nburnett: all right, so what do you want to find out?\n\n\n\ncorker: well i mean this is an interesting point in time. rules are being promulgated right now that affect all of these things. and the question is under current laws that have been passed, if they're fully in place, was this in fact a proprietary trade or not, which is something we don't want to see happening in these institutions, or was this really a legitimate hedge that would take place within an institution. we've been getting a lot of, you know, this has evolved.\n\n\n\nwe had a lot of conversations this weekend with the examiner in charge at the occ that oversees jpmorgan. and we got one piece of input that's evolved, that sort of walked back away from that and i guess at the end of the day this is very complex. this is certainly no threat whatsoever to jpmorgan as far as it being --\n\n\n\nburnett: well it's small relative to their assets.\n\n\n\ncorker: yes, this is two months worth of earnings to them, but the issue is there are a lot of rules that are being created right now and whenever you have especially something this high profile it's going to affect the outcome --\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\ncorker: -- of what's actually happening right now in washington.\n\n\n\nburnett: but you're saying looking at the top accountants and auditors who are looking at this right now they still are not able to determine whether it was proprietary, i.e., should not be happening under the new rules --\n\n\n\ncorker: right.\n\n\n\nburnett: -- or legitimate?\n\n\n\ncorker: and those rules aren't in effect yet.\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\ncorker: the question is what's really happened here and do we have laws that affect what's been happening. there's some very specific language in the volcker rule that really -- that talks about hedging and it talks about aggregate, it talks about unique trades and the fact is nobody yet has been able to determine whether this is something that could stay in place or not.\n\n\n\nburnett: so -- but jpmorgan itself, i mean is it possible you could do something about the bank? i mean you talk about it being small for that bank, and it is. and some people say, oh, well that's a sign that the system is strong. but then you could look at it and say why is the bank so big. it's 45 percent bigger in terms of assets, 2.3 trillion in assets. that's 15 percent of the u.s. economy, jpmorgan and it's 45 percent bigger now than it was right before the financial crisis, just to be clear.\n\n\n\ncorker: yes.\n\n\n\nburnett: i mean is that ok?\n\n\n\ncorker: well i mean that is a whole different issue. and you know there was resolution language that i actually spent a lot of time on myself that you know you create the opportunity to wind -- you have the ability to wind down an institution that fails. but again, that's a whole separate issue --\n\n\n\nburnett: right. but you could make the argument it isn't because you could say well if it were smaller, jamie dimon would have known what was going on opposed to --\n\n\n\ncorker: (inaudible) so here's the question. under volcker --\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\ncorker: -- is this something that is legitimate after volcker is fully implemented? a lot of people are saying yes. secondly, there are people who say that this couldn't have happened if you had the glass-steagall (ph) regime in place.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncorker: the occ -- the occ has categorically said that's not true, this could have still occurred. and if you had -- if you downsize the institutions, this kind of trade could still occur.\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\ncorker: so i think what we need to do is understand you know how this -- how this occurred. it was all on the banking side, not on the investment bank side. and do we have policies that appropriately deal with this? so this is, again, very unique, very specific, very complex.\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\ncorker: and we only had one hearing on the volcker rule prior to making it law.\n\n\n\nburnett: although -- i hear you, but i mean unique and specific, i feel like we hear that every time there's a big trading loss. they are all unique and specific. that's why they keep happening.\n\n\n\ncorker: yes. no, no, no, look --\n\n\n\nburnett: that's the problem.\n\n\n\ncorker: i mean and let's think about it. i mean human beings do bone-headed things. in a business like this, things like this are going to occur. we need to make sure we try to regulate properly. but the best antidote to this is to have capital requirements that are sufficient. and as we mentioned earlier, this is a very large institution.\n\n\n\nburnett: yes.\n\n\n\ncorker: the riskiest thing they do is to make a loan. and what we need to ensure is that capital requirements are strong enough. and in this case, obviously, way beyond that.\n\n\n\nburnett: now, you're speaking for reform so i don't mean to imply that you're not. but your top contributor was jpmorgan chase. individual and pac (ph) donations, $61,000. you're up for re- election.\n\n\n\ncorker: yes.\n\n\n\nburnett: do you feel conflicted? do you feel that you're more likely to be sympathetic listening to jamie dimon because he gives you a lot of money?\n\n\n\ncorker: i mean -- you know my race last time was a national race that was huge. there were people who contributed from all walks of life and the same is true this time. i was the first person who called for a hearing here, so i don't think that's the case at all and i know it's not the case. and, no, i don't feel conflicted at all. look, i tell these guys when they come in, i just had this same conversation with jamie dimon recently and a group of other people here i'm not a friend of banking.\n\n\n\ni'm not a foe of banking. what i want to see is that we have capital markets -- that we have capital markets in this country that function appropriately, that we have a financial system that meets the needs of an economy like we have in the u.s. and i just want to see it work in the appropriate way. one of the biggest setbacks we've had to our economy is the crisis in this financial system that sets us back years.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncorker: so look i just want to make us -- i want to make sure that we have good outcomes here. and what -- and senators are not basing judgments on this or things that they believe to be perceptions, but the reality of what's actually happened in this case and hopefully a hearing will help us do that.\n\n\n\nburnett: all right, well senator, thank you very much. senator corker of course joining me here in washington. now let's check in with john avlon in new york. john, what are your thoughts? i'm curious just overall about your thoughts about lobbying dollars going from industries to committees that regulate those industries.\n\n\n\njohn avlon, cnn contributor: well look the growth of lobbying over the past decade in particular has been a real problem. many people point to it as a cause for not just the increased spending we've seen but things like the lobbying that has watered down the volcker rule. much of it was pursued by jpmorgan chase. so lobbyists do have their thumb on the scale and it's a growing problem in washington. and it's contributed to a lot of the frustration that people feel at home, the sense that washington isn't working. lobbyists are an important reason -- part of the reason why.\n\n\n\nburnett: so do you think, john that we'll be able to get reforms or what's your sense?\n\n\n\navlon: well, look, follow the money. that's one of the tougher things to do, but certainly in this specific case calling for a hearing is a step in the right direction. the question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of jpmorgan chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that jpmorgan chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the volcker rule. well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher. this is a complicated position they find themselves in of their own making.\n\n\n\nburnett: yes, absolutely of their own making and as we said completely avoidable as well. john avlon thank you.\n\n\n\nand ahead, senator dianne feinstein, chair of the senate intelligence committee, joins me to talk about evidence of a possible weapons test, explosive test for a nuclear weapon in iran.\n\n\n\nand president obama slamming mitt romney for his time at bain capital, calling the republican a job-killing vampire on the same day he well had lunch with a private equity titan to raise money. tonight romney fires back.\n\n\n\nand hangings and decapitations. we're going to take a look at what could be the biggest threat to this country. it's not in the middle east. it's across our southern border. we'll be back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nburnett: our second story outfront, countdown to an iran showdown. there is new evidence today that iran is moving forward with a nuclear weapons program, just as talks are getting under way to convince the country to stop its suspected program. negotiators from the international atomic energy agency today left the iranian mission in vienna in silence. usually you know they'll take the opportunity -- you see the cameras there -- to talk to them to say something. they said nothing.\n\n\n\nthe iaea is in the middle of its first talks with iran in three months. the latest report from the agency, of course you may recall, said there were quote strong indications of possible nuclear weapons development. indications like this picture from the associated press in today's washington post. now let me just explain exactly what you're looking at here because i looked at this and said what is this? something that could be in my backyard. it's a drawing of what's believed to be a nuclear explosion containment chamber hidden at a secret iranian military base perhaps near a site called parshan (ph) that the government in iran has refused weapons inspectors access to.\n\n\n\nexperts say a chamber like this is what you use to test a nuclear weapon. and we talked to them. they confirmed that. important to say, though, that this picture is not a picture that we have confirmed the authenticity of. there are, though, new signs that the economic sanctions against iran are working. take this story on the front page of today's washington post. quote iran unable to sell oil stores it on tankers. literally they're storing it on tankers, turning off the gps on the tankers so that -- because it's against maritime law to do so because they don't want anyone to know where the tankers are (inaudible) they're trying to sail into ports and just find anyone to buy their oil. so earlier today i spoke to senator dianne feinstein. she is a key leader in the senate on national security issues, chairman of the senate intelligence committee and i began by asking her what it will take to reach an agreement with iran.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\nsen. dianne feinstein (d-ca), senate intelligence committee chairwoman: i think all of us pretty much know what the parameters of an agreement are. and i think we also know the window is closing, that israel is quite adamant that this is an existential threat, that she will not let iran achieve a nuclear warhead and that means all kinds of unpredictable military actions.\n\n\n\nburnett: when you say everyone is on the same page about a deal, i was talking to prime minister netanyahu a couple of weeks ago and he said he would allow no enrichment, none at all, not even the three percent that you would be using if you were using nuclear power for medical use or things like that. that doesn't really seem to be the same page as the united states, though, right? i mean would --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nburnett: the united states would accept a little bit more, right?\n\n\n\nfeinstein: i don't think that's the united states' position. i think its confined enrichment to five percent, limited to the medical isotopes. move anything above five percent out of the country or secure it --\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: -- have full transparency and 24/7/365 day-a-year access for the iaea to all these sites. and then be willing to also talk about other things, which is what the iranians have wanted to do. i am hopeful. in my view it's the best chance of a solution. of course this is the p-5 (ph) plus one, so it's a unique bargaining agent, you might say.\n\n\n\nburnett: when you talk about access, i want to ask you about israel in a second, israel issue, but access. i have this picture which i know is -- it looks a little strange. the associated press obtained this from a government that is skeptical of iran's honesty in its nuclear program and they say this is a chamber used for testing explosives for nuclear weapons. we did make some calls today and experts said indeed this would be consistent with that, but we haven't independently verified the source government. supposedly it's at the parshan (ph) site though, which is the site the iaea has not been able to --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nburnett: -- get access to after repeated requests. how big of a problem is this?\n\n\n\nfeinstein: well, number one, i've never seen that picture. it could be from anywhere so i don't know where it's from, so a comment would be useless. i can say this. the decision as far as our intelligence is concerned is that iran has not made the decision to enrich to military grade uranium. now, having said that, there's no comment on whether they have speeded things up so they could get to that position --\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: so that if a decision was made, it could go more quickly.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nburnett: yes.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: so i mean i think that's what's out there. there's one other thing. the sanctions are biting. they're biting deeply. additional sanctions will go into play with the central bank. and so by june or july, the sanctions should be approximately full tilt.\n\n\n\nburnett: iran is going to ask for the sanctions to be rolled back. don't put those really tough sanctions that europe was going to be putting on this summer, don't do it, because we've made progress. that's what they're going to ask for. is there any way you think that the united states at least would say, ok, we don't have to put that extra round of sanctions on, or is that something that must go forward to get the final deal done.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: well, this is just my view.\n\n\n\nburnett: yes.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: my view is that sanctions should not be lessened until and if there is a final deal concurred in by all.\n\n\n\nburnett: and that leads me to israel where you said the u.s. and israel aren't necessarily on the same page in terms of what level of enrichment to allow. prime minister netanyahu telling me nothing. you're saying the u.s. would allow up to five percent. how is the u.s. and israel going to bridge that gap? because if they say zero we say five and they strike, we're going to be involved.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: well, there is a strong difference between the united states and israel. there also is a strong likelihood that if israel were to attack, the united states would be drawn into what would become rapidly another war with iran that could have catastrophic consequences throughout the middle east. and one of the things that we don't do well is follow through on figuring out if you do this and they do that, then what happens? do we support israel? israel is close to us. obviously we're going to back up israel.\n\n\n\nburnett: right.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: then, is it war? and then what do the rest of the middle east do?\n\n\n\n(end videotape) burnett: is it war, the big question that everyone has to be thinking very much about here in the senate and washington and in this country over the next few months.\n\n\n\nnext on outfront prosecutors filing new evidence just this afternoon. (inaudible) actually crossing right now, regarding the shooting of trayvon martin and the case against george zimmerman. and the president goes after mitt romney and his record at bain capital. plus, we're going to go inside the drug wars from mexico. and amazing statistic, did you know that 90 percent of the cocaine in this country comes from mexico, and 70 percent of the guns that are used in mexican drug crime come from right here in the u.s.? we'll be back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nburnett: new evidence coming to light tonight in the murder case against george zimmerman. he of course is the neighborhood watchman who's admitted to shooting trayvon martin. now, the orlando sentinel reported late this afternoon that the special prosecutor's office filed an eight-page preview of their case with the county clerk. now, in it nearly two dozen primary witnesses are listed.\n\n\n\nthere's also some never-before-seen video and more than 50 recorded audio statements that the state plans to use at the trial. coming outfront on this story, our legal analyst, mark nejame and mark obviously i know you know a lot about this. can you tell us who are some of the witnesses and obviously everyone is going to go what, a new video, i feel like we've all seen these videos so many times. what is this new video?\n\n\n\nmark nejame, cnn legal analyst: well, we have a lot of things coming out but it's just the beginning. you're going to see a lot more coming out over time. i think there's about 18 police officers from the sanford police department who are on the witness list. there are 67 cds coming out that will have a lot of information on it. and there's two videos, as i understand it, one from the 7-eleven and one from the clubhouse. so we're going to be getting a whole bunch of new information.\n\n\n\ni'm not sure if some of the most important information is coming out in this first wave though. the autopsy reports i think are going to be extremely relevant. an enhancement of the 911-tapes is extremely relevant. and knowing where everybody was, the proximity of where the shooting occurred, the clubhouse, the car, where he was staying, all those are important pieces that i don't know if those are going to come out in the first wave. i'm anxious to see if they do.\n\n\n\nburnett: and why would they come out in waves? why would you wait -- just because literally they don't have it all together or is this standard procedure? i mean how much more do you think there is and when will we get it?\n\n\n\nnejame: well, it's entirely possible that they're just not completed -- they have not completed everything yet and they're not going to turn it over until in fact they are. and if i could, you had indicated earlier that all this was information they were planning on using. not necessarily, in florida we have very open discovery laws. and if in fact there's something that's favorable or unfavorable, it still needs to be turned over to the defense and then a determination will be made if one side or the other plans on using it and if it's even admissible in court. so there's a very open discovery --\n\n\n\nburnett: oh ok.\n\n\n\nnejame: and everything has to be turned over.\n\n\n\nburnett: all right i didn't know that and we just found out that zimmerman's lawyer got the discovery package, you know, late tonight, so presumably he's just going through it, presumably going to try to block all of this, the video for example, something that the american public would want to see. but to block it from going public. will he succeed?\n\n\n\nnejame: he'll have an uphill battle, that's for sure. we have very -- as i said, very open not only discovery, but sunshine laws in florida. so he'll have to make an argument that the public's right to know is far outweighed by the public policy of protecting the safety of some of these witnesses because of the possibility of some death threats or injury or harm coming to some of these witnesses, to possibly being harassed and witness tampering. one would imagine that he would try to bring that out to show that some public safety outweighs the public's right to know. it will be an uphill battle.\n\n\n\nburnett: yes. mark, how in the world are they going to find a jury that isn't full of people that have opinions on this case? i mean everyone in this country has an opinion on this case.\n\n\n\nnejame: well everybody who's watching cnn has an opinion on the case but that doesn't necessarily mean that everybody is in fact watching it. it's interesting to find that those of us who follow matters such as this, it's water cooler talk, and we all follow this and are interested in it. but there's many people who in fact don't follow these matters, then the challenge becomes are those really people you want to have on a jury who really remains so utterly misinformed, but that's what happens.\n\n\n\nburnett: all right especially when they live in the area. all right thanks very much to mark. appreciate it.\n\n\n\nahead, 49 mutilated bodies dumped in mexico, an absolutely horrific act. we're going to talk about that, tell you exactly why it's happening and why it could be the biggest threat to this country.\n\n\n\nand the president going negative, attacking mitt romney. we'll be back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nerin burnett, host: we start the second half of our show with stories we care about, where we focus on our own reporting from the front lines.\n\n\n\nand, first, jpmorgan making some changes after taking a massive loss on trades. the chief investment officer, ina drew, the first person out. she made more than $30 million in the past two years. she headed the unit that has lost what could be now $4 billion.\n\n\n\ntomorrow, ceo jamie dimon will be answering shareholders at the company's annual meeting in tampa.\n\n\n\nnumber two, a group representing palestinian prisoners has reached a deal with israel to end a hunger strike. that strike began all the way back april 17th. the announcement of the deal sent crowds to the streets of gaza to celebrate.\n\n\n\ntwo thousand prisoners were protesting their treatment in israeli prisons. the deal covers things like when a prisoner can be moved into solitary confinement and will allow family members to visit. there are over 4,500 palestinian prisoners in israeli jails tonight.\n\n\n\nsixteen billion dollars -- well, that's the size of california's deficit. and it's nearly twice as big as governor jerry brown estimated four months ago. if he were running a bank, he'd be facing some problems right now.\n\n\n\nbut today, he said he wants to cut state payrolls by 5 percent and hike taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\n\ni asked the senior senator, dianne feinstein, about the crisis and she brought up one specific individual.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsen. dianne feinstein (d), california: i was reading about one high- tech executive that because of capital gains was going to leave his citizenship and move to -- or become a citizen of singapore.\n\n\n\nburnett: yes, the facebook guy.\n\n\n\nfeinstein: yes. well, i say let him go. i can't think of anything more disloyal to do, candidly.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nburnett: the man's name is eduardo saverin. he's 30 years old and was the founder of facebook. reports say he'll save $60 million in taxes by becoming a citizen of singapore, which has no capital gains tax.\n\n\n\nwell, yahoo!'s ceo is out. scott thompson resigned over the weekend after it was revealed he didn't have the computer science degree that he claimed. we took a look through the latest sec filings and here's what he'll get. no severance but he will get to keep the $7 million he recently collected in cash and stock.\n\n\n\nyahoo! has named ross levinsohn the interim ceo, currently the head of global media for yahoo!\n\n\n\nwell, it's been 284 days since the u.s. lost its top credit rating. what are we doing to get it back? i asked (inaudible) in the air, i'm sitting here in the senate, where is everybody?\n\n\n\nour fourth story outfront: one of the biggest threats to this country and it's much closer than a lot of people think. you know, you think of, you know, the middle east somewhere or you think of china. but, no, it's mexico.\n\n\n\nand investigators are trying today to identify 49 bodies that were found mutilated beyond belief and recognition. stuffed in plastic bags in a small town of san juan, yesterday. that's less than 100 miles from the american border. the bodies are 43 men and six women were found headless with no feet and no hands. they are victims of mexico's los zetas drug cartel.\n\n\n\nmore than 47,000 people -- 47,000 people, just think about that for a minute -- have been killed in mexico since president felipe calderon launched an offensive against drug cartels in 2006. ninety-nine have been killed in brutal fashion like what i just described in just the past month, as the two biggest cartels, los zetas and sinaloa fight for control of mexico's border with the united states.\n\n\n\nwhy do they fight for control of that border? because the drug wars are continuing. ninety percent of the cocaine that enters the american country and it comes through mexico. it's also the main supplier of marijuana and meth in this country.\n\n\n\nso the question is what else is getting into the united states that we don't know about?\n\n\n\njay ahern is former head of the border protection and now a principal at the chertoff group; hipolito acosta is a former undercover ins agent and author of the shadow catcher.\n\n\n\nappreciate you both taking the time.\n\n\n\njay, let me just ask you, it seems like the violence is getting much, much worse. what i just described with the heads and the feet cut off, this is brutality at a level that i think is very hard to imagine, but it appears to be at this point, dare i say common?\n\n\n\njay ahern, former head of u.s. customs and border protection: yes, i think when you actually take a look, erin, the numbers may be closer to 50,000 since december of 2006 when president calderon really started to take the fight to the cartels. we've seen it start to level a little bit in the last few months. leveling is really a statement of choice here, that about 1,000 killings per month. but the gravity and the heinousness of the killings this past few days really shows as far as how aggressive and how ruthless these individuals are. beyond just the beheadings, the cutting off the arms and legs sends a strong signal.\n\n\n\nburnett: it certainly does.\n\n\n\npolly, how -- is this really about controlling -- who's controlling the drugs going into the united states? i mean, this is still a question of u.s. demand and supply that is not necessarily from mexico but transiting through mexico?\n\n\n\nhipolito acosta, former undercover ins agent: yes to both of your questions.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nburnett: polly, sorry, go ahead.\n\n\n\nacosta: i think what you have -- i'm sorry. what you have are two cartels that are actually fighting for a very lucrative route, and i think this violence is going to continue. jay was talking about sending a signal and i think it sends a strong signal to anybody who would oppose the cartels in that particular area.\n\n\n\ni think the violence is going to continue during the next few months. we have a presidential election coming up in mexico and i think some of the cartels are positioning themselves to make sure that they control this particular areas for a number of reasons.\n\n\n\nburnett: and let me ask you, jay, about something else. i don't know if everyone remembers but obviously there was a plot that the united states government alleges was put forth by the iranian government using an iranian-american in texas who was hiring a mexican drug cartel to commit an assassination that would have killed civilians right here in washington, d.c.\n\n\n\nwe also, of course action heard from air force general douglas fraser, who testified on whether there was other terrorist activities going on in mexico to get into the united states, and here's what he said.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ngen. douglas fraser, commander of u.s. southern command: those organizations are primarily focused on financial support to organizations back in the middle east, but they are involved in illicit activity. and so that is the connection that we continue to look for, as we watch in the future, that connection between the illicit activity and the potential pathway into the united states.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nburnett: jay, how big of a risk is this, the hezbollah or other terrorist activities could be working with drug cartels to get into the united states?\n\n\n\nahern: well, i think one of the things that's important to recognize, these are criminal organizations and they certainly will diversify what their level of criminality is, whether drugs today, weapons tomorrow or a need to move high-valued targets across the border. certainly, that was a great piece of work by the federal agencies specifically doing drug investigations and actually uncovered the individual who was contemplating an assassination attempt.\n\n\n\nbut, clearly, these are criminals, and they're going to do anything they can for a profit going forward. burnett: polly, one thing i find hard to understand here, and especially with all the coverage in this country on the whole fast and furious controversy, there are 6,600 licensed gun dealers in the united states within 100 miles of the mexican border, 70 percent of the guns recovered from mexican drug activity had originated here in the united states.\n\n\n\nwe're the ones arming this whole problem, right?\n\n\n\nacosta: well, you know, but let's understand one thing. the guns were going into mexico way before fast and furious occurred, whether we would have had fast and furious or not. i think that the -- frankly, the mexican government needs to stand up and stop blaming the united states for arming them.\n\n\n\nthey have -- they need to address the issue of the cartel that say they have in mexico and certainly we work very closely with foreign governments to stop the illegal flow of weapons in any direction. but i think that weapons were long available in mexico before fast and furious. i think that the efforts that our government is doing to stop that flow is commendable because our agents work very hard to stop that flow of weapons into mexico.\n\n\n\nburnett: jay, do you think it's fair to say that the biggest threat to the united states could be from our southern border, whether from drug wars or from other terrorist organizations? you know, i was in laos a year ago and a mexican drug dealer had been with someone i was with doing a deal for drugs coming from southeast asia, so it's certainly more than colombian cocaine now.\n\n\n\nahern: sure it is. but, i think, erin, let's put a couple of things in perspective. certainly when you aggregate the amount of cartel deaths, again action 47,000 or 50,000, it's more than any other loss of life anywhere else on the globe so that poses a significant threat.\n\n\n\nlet's also focus on some of the facts that occurred the last few years as well. when you take a look at the apprehensions along the mexican border coming into the united states, last fiscal year was 340,000. that's down 53 percent from 2008, and one-fifth in 2000, when it reached the tied of 1.6 million coming across the border.\n\n\n\nso when you actually take a look at the fence being built, the deployment of additional agents, personnel and technology, there's a higher degree of control on the border today. that's not to say that 300,000 is an adequate number to apprehend, we need to do better. but i think the key to continue to make sure we protect the country is to continue the strategy of not only controlling our own border, but mexico needs to control the borders coming into their country from central and south america where all of those drugs originate.\n\n\n\nburnett: all right. thanks very much to both of you. this is going to be an issue we're going to cover a lot more of on this show.\n\n\n\nand coming up, president obama's brand new attack ad accusing mitt romney of killing -- we'll tell you what.\n\n\n\nplus, turmoil in greece and the domino effect that might hit us right here at home.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nburnett: apple and exxon are in bed together and we're going to explain exactly, well, why this marriage has occurred. that's coming up in just a couple of moments.\n\n\n\nbut now, our outer circle where we reach out to sources around the world.\n\n\n\nand we begin tonight in greece. talks to form a government failed, and that leaves the state of greece's government and economy in complete and utter chaos. this is crucial for the rest of the world. new elections could happen in june but no one is sure.\n\n\n\nand with no government to manage the economy and no one to pay the debt or pay anybody that works for the government, there is a real possibility that greece leaves the euro. you may say so?\n\n\n\nwell, matthew chance is in athens and i asked him what the consequences would be for the rest of europe and the world if greece goes vamoose.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nmatthew chance, cnn sr. international correspondent: erin, the truth is we're in uncharted waters. one of the main effects immediately it's going to have to greece is that the country will run out of money. it won't be able to pay its bills, its pensions, its state workers' wages -- none of these things that a country needs to survive will be need to be paid.\n\n\n\nit will have to print its own currency, the drachma. that currency is like to drop through the floor when it comes to its valuations against the euro. so, greece would set itself on a path to a great deal of poverty and economic hard ship.\n\n\n\nthe other impact greece crashing out of the euro may have is the impact of contagion. if greece crashes out of the single currency, what's to stop other debt-laden economies like ireland, like spain, like portugal, like italy from doing exactly the same thing? up until now, this big european project of getting all these countries together, these diverse countries together, diverse economies together and bringing them all under the umbrella of a single currency has been something that's really dominated european politics. if that ends, if greece exits the euro, that whole project comes to an end and it potentially puts the european union and the cohesion of the european union under threat.\n\n\n\nand so, you can't really overstate the significance of what greece is deciding right now, which direction it will go in -- erin.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nburnett: all right. thank you very much to matthew chance. of course, europe the biggest trading partner for america. so if it falls, major job losses and another deep recession would happen here.\n\n\n\nand now, let's check in with anderson. anderson is in a turkish refugee camp near the syrian border.\n\n\n\nanderson, obviously, you're going to have a special show tonight. tell us a little bit about it, anderson.\n\n\n\nanderson cooper, host, a.c. 360: yes, erin, we're in one of many refugee camps along the turkish/syrian border, now home to 23,000 syrians -- men, women and children. the reason we came here is because for 14 months, the regime of bashir al assad has lied about what's happening in syria. we came here because for 14 months, the regime of bashir al assad has tried to silence the voices of the people who are living in these camps and the people who have had to flee syria.\n\n\n\ntonight, we want you to hear their voices. we want you to see their faces and hear their stories and hear what they have had to live through for the last 14 months. the children that they have seen arrested by the regime, tortured by the regime, parents who got the mangled bodies of their children return to them in the dead of night. children who have seen their parents shot to death on the streets of syria simply for asking for reforms, asking for basic freedom that we all take for granted.\n\n\n\nso, tonight, we're going to be telling you their stories and you're going to hear their voices and see their faces to find the truth of what is happening inside syria -- erin.\n\n\n\nburnett: all right, anderson, very much looking forward to seeing you in just a few moments there.\n\n\n\nour fifth story outfront, it's the economy finally. well, maybe. but at least in this ad.\n\n\n\nobama and romney trading jabs on issue number one. first up, a new obama ad rolling out in five battleground states which calls the private equity firm that mitt romney founded a job killer.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip, obama campaign ad)\n\n\n\nunidentified male: they made as much money off it as they could, and they closed it down, they filed for bankruptcy without any concern for the families of the communities.\n\n\n\njack cobb: it was like a vampire. they came in and sucked the life out of us.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: it was like watching an old friend bleed to death.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nburnett: the romney camp is not hanging back, rolling out its own video attacking the president's record on debt, announcing plans for a speech on the deficit tomorrow and, i have to say, sending e-mails and finding private phone numbers of members of the media to send or their p.r. people to send their stats on jobs. so, fighting back hard.\n\n\n\ncnn contributor david frum, john avlon in new york, and michael waldman, former head of speechwriting for president clinton also joins us.\n\n\n\nok, great to have all of you with us.\n\n\n\nburnett: you said that that's a pretty tough ad.\n\n\n\ndavid frum, cnn contributor: that is a pretty tough ad. but i wonder whether it really counts as a pivot to the economy. what exactly is president obama proposing to do? i mean, if private equity really is bad, if it does more harm than good, it's free to operate in the obama administration. president obama isn't proposing to do anything to restrict private equity.\n\n\n\nso, all he is saying is you are a bad man. he is not offering an economic critique. and he's not offering an economic alternative.\n\n\n\nburnett: ok. do you buy that spin, michael?\n\n\n\nmichael waldman, brennan center for justice, nyu: well, i think that part of this is in a sense kind of a brush-back pitch. romney is going to say i've run a big company, i have a successful record and so i can make the critique against president obama and his record. and this is saying, you know, when one thing when governor romney talks, he talks about success and we ought not penalize success.\n\n\n\nand to a lot of people the way he says it sounds a little smug. i think there's a real unease that people have apart from the specifics of bain, let alone the ad, an unease with the kind of the financialization of the economy that leads to manufacturing firms being hollowed out and that sort of thing.\n\n\n\nso i think, look, it's certainly not subtle and it's not unexpected.\n\n\n\nburnett: not subtle and not unexpected. but john avlon, certainly something the romney campaign is afraid about.\n\n\n\nlet me just go back to emphasizing the point they literally called members of the media on their private cell phones and got their numbers to try to make the case for how bain capital and private equity creates jobs. so they're afraid.\n\n\n\njohn avlon, cnn contributor: yes. well, look, i mean, this attack left a mark back in the republican primaries. remember, you had rick perry saying this isn't venture capitalism, this is vulture capitalism.\n\n\n\nbut i think, you know, this is not even an economic ad. this is an attempt by the obama camp to draw an early contrast to define the candidate further as a person. it is a personal attack, a personal characterization about values underlying the economy, rather than anything aiming to provide a prescription for how to solve this problem. burnett: speaking of how the president wants to be seen. so, today, he gave the commencement address at barnard college. and i watched it, and i watched the introduction to him. it's very laudatory. this is a women's college.\n\n\n\nso, david, we know he's trying to build a case to get women's votes. but at best it split. cbs poll came out today, mitt romney is leading among women 46 to 44 percent. i want to emphasize that's within the margin of error, but still.\n\n\n\nfrum: you know, it's kind of a screwy poll, i have to say. among other things, one of the questions it asks, are you less likely to vote for the president because of his stance on same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nwell, they have 43 percent of americans saying i'm less likely, even though republicans disapprove of the president 90-10. so, they've gone from saying, i will absolutely never vote for the president, too. i will double absolutely never vote for the president.\n\n\n\ni don't know how meaningful that is. i wonder the gender gap is usually about 10 points. so if it's shrunk to two, that is true. that would be colossal news. it's also possible the polls make mistakes.\n\n\n\nburnett: well, and we have many polls coming out everyday.\n\n\n\njohn, what's your case?\n\n\n\navlon: i do get the sense, as david does, that this is a bit of an outlier. that said, it could be on the leading ledge of the other shoe dropping with the regard to the political consequences of the president's decision to back gay marriage. we're seeing troubling gaps, not just among independent voters, but also self-identified centrists.\n\n\n\nthose trends should make the obama camp very nervous as they look to future polls.\n\n\n\nburnett: and one thing that could make you very nervous, michael waldman, is what came out of this same poll in terms of independents. mitt romney now leads independents, according to the cbs poll, by 43 percent to 36 percent. that's well -- that's no margin of error.\n\n\n\nwaldman: well, again, if the numbers for women or the numbers for independents on election day are on this poll, then it's president- elect romney. but it is a bit of an outlier. the one bit of good news for president obama in that poll, interestingly, was that independents and women and young people were more likely to be supportive of the president's stance on same-sex marriage than other voters.\n\n\n\nyou never know entirely -- it's true. this could play out in a bad way for him or in a good way. remember during the 1960 campaign -- we all read about, i should stress, wasn't actually playing attention then. we read about john f. kennedy's outreach to martin luther king's family and the kind of surprising impact that that had. these social issues are not as straight and linear and easy to predict as sometimes the economic indicators are. so this will have ripples. but we don't know in which direction the ripples will go.\n\n\n\nburnett: all right. thanks very much to all three of you. we appreciate it.\n\n\n\nahead, apple and exxon sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g. who does that upset more? apple people or the exxon people? but they are. and we'll tell you why, next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nburnett: so today while we were looking at the market selloff i checked out the two biggest companies in america. it used to be for years that there was one company and everybody else. and that one company was exxonmobil. but now exxonmobil, a company that many people love to hate, is a distant second.\n\n\n\none of the nation's most prestigious journalist has just written a book on exxon called, private empire: exxonmobil and american power. it talks about the valdez spill and deals with corrupt governments.\n\n\n\ni spoke to the book's author steve coll about what we as americans should like about exxon.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsteve coll, author, private empire: i do think they bring out the rule of law wherever they go. they want a world that is stable and safe for oil and gas drilling. one of the ways they promote that is by evangelizing about the importance of the rule of law. and they enforce a universal system of contract.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nburnett: all right. so those are pretty good things -- probably not good enough.\n\n\n\nbrings me to a company that everybody loves to love, apple. nine months ago, it was the second biggest company in america. it is now number one, and by a huge margin.\n\n\n\nmeasured by market cap, apple is more than 1/3 bigger than exxon, worth more than half a trillion dollars, half a trillion dollars. look at the ipad in your hand, half a trillion dollars.\n\n\n\nwith the surge has come scrutiny of keeping money off shore to avoid u.s. taxes, of offshoring too many jobs, of using materials like, which is sometimes mind by children. apple said it's working to address some of these things. and it is a company seen as the best of america to children around the world.\n\n\n\nbut you know what's interesting? i asked steve coll about whether apple and exxon had anything in common. he said absolutely. and let me list to you what he said. they're both closed systems. neither of them like to be written about. they don't have an open door policy for the press. and they have a culture that's strong but set directly from the top.\n\n\n\ni thought he might have laughed. but it seems there's a lot alike about exxon and apple.\n\n\n\nso, here's to being proud that american companies are the leaders in their fields and they hope to continue to become better companies not just bigger ones.\n\n\n\nwell, tomorrow, i'm spending the day here in washington at the 2012 fiscal summit. it's an issue that will define the power and greatness of our country. this year, the bush cuts expire, the $1.2 trillion in super cut takes effect. the debt ceiling needs to be raised. these are just a few of the things that could send like lemmings off a clief.\n\n\n\nformer president bill clinton, treasury secretary, alan simpson, congressman paul ryan, and speaker of the house, john boehner, are all going to be together. you'll see speaker boehner tomorrow at 7:00 p.m., because i'll be with them. we've been looking very much forward to that.\n\n\n\nthanks for watching, look forward to seeing you again live from washington

concord, new hampshire (cnn) jill biden isn't a stranger to the presidential campaign trail, having stumped for her husband's bid for president and vice president.\n\nshe's now logging grueling hours advocating for joe biden's 2020 bid\n\nthe pace of the campaign often keeps joe and jill biden, a married couple of 42 years, apart. jill biden spoke with cnn in concord, new hampshire, where she shared how she stays handles the pressures of the trail.\n\nhe came home the other night, i hadn't seen him, probably for a week. and so i think it's important in a marriage that you keep that spark going, she told cnn in an interview in concord, new hampshire. before i saw him, i lit the candles. i put on the fire. we sat down and we started talking. and like always, it's always about the kids and what's this person doing or that person doing, or the grandkids. but after 20 minutes, we were like, 'god, we're exhausted.' so we went to bed.\n\ni'm telling you we have very few moments together, so i tried to make the most of those moments, and i don't talk politics, she said.\n\nread more
protestors attend a demonstration in stockholm, sweden, in november 2017, against slavery in libya,\n\nstory highlights the overall number of reported trafficking victims has increased globally girls account for 23% of all trafficking victims, says report human trafficking worsens in conflict zones\n\n(cnn) —\n\na growing number of girls are being reported as victims of human trafficking, according to a new un report.\n\ngirls account for 23% of all trafficking victims detected globally, according to the 2018 global report on trafficking in persons, produced by the un office of drugs and crime (unodc).\n\nthe figure, which is based on data from 2016, is up from 21% in 2014, and 10% in 2004, the year when the unodc began collecting data on children.\n\nboys account for 7% of reported trafficking victims, down from 8% in 2014, and up from 3% in 2004.\n\nin the profile of identified victims, we are seeing more and more children, an increase particularly in girls, says angela me, chief of the unodc's research and trend analysis branch.\n\nmore on human trafficking\n\nbut the un says that this rise could be due to better detection of victims globally.\n\nme explains that trafficked girls are typically victims of sexual exploitation, while boys are more often exploited for forced labor.\n\nthe un defines girls and boys as being aged less than 18, but me says some member states use different definitions.\n\nthe report shows that women and girls account for almost three quarters of all detected victims of trafficking in 2016. females make up 94% of the total victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, and 35% of those trafficked for forced labor.\n\narmed conflict\n\nit also finds that armed conflict in some regions of africa, the middle east and asia is likely to increase vulnerability to trafficking.\n\nit says that areas with weak rule of law and lack of resources provide traffickers with fertile terrain to carry out operations, adding that armed groups take advantage of people in a desperate situation to traffic victims for sexual exploitation, forced marriage, armed combat and various forms of forced labor.\n\npopulations fleeing conflict, such as syrian, iraqi and rohingya refugees are also targeted by traffickers.\n\nin migration flows, you have a dispersion of families and then you have many children who travel alone, who definitely become more vulnerable to be trapped into exploitative situations, says me.\n\nthe report also indicates that the overall number of reported trafficking victims has increased. in 2016, about 40% more victims were detected compared to 2011.\n\nbut the un says that this rise could be due to an increase in trafficking globally, or it could be a result of enhanced national capacities to detect, record and report data on trafficking.\n\nin 2009, only 26 countries had an institution which systematically collected data on trafficking cases, whereas in 2018, the number had risen to 65.\n\nthere are now a whole bunch of countries that have new legislation so are more equipped from a legislative point of view to criminalize and to prosecute and at the same time to protect the victims, says me.\n\nsuch anti-trafficking policies have not only led to increasing numbers of detected victims, but also to more trafficking convictions in asia, the americas, africa and the middle east.\n\nhowever, the report cautions that the absolute numbers of convictions remain very low, adding that globally there appears to be hardly any risk for traffickers to face justice.

(cnn) — the term indian cuisine covers a lot of ground. from the himalayan peaks in the northern state of uttarakhand, to the tropical southwestern coast of kerala, each landscape comes with its own climate, history, trade links and religious customs. and each has a unique food culture.\n\nas a culinary destination, india offers an epic food bucket list . but the past year has been tough for travel, with most of the world's holiday plans put on hold because of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nindia's cuisine, at least, can still journey far beyond the country's borders. according to the united nations , people from india make up the world's largest diaspora community -- and they have brought their delicious food with them.\n\nin the uk, for instance, tens of thousands of indian immigrants arrived in the early 20th century, followed by an influx of bangladeshi immigrants in the 1970s -- many setting up restaurants that tailored indian curries to local tastes. as a result, curry has become a firm fixture and anglo-indian inventions, such as chicken tikka masala, are among the nation's favorite dishes.\n\nwhile curry houses with standard menus are still popular, the world's taste for indian fine dining is evolving to encompass lesser known regional delicacies and bolder experimentation.\n\nindian chefs living around the world are feeding this growing movement, with menus that celebrate their family heritage, while bringing new dimensions to traditional cooking techniques and recipes.\n\ncnn spoke to five of these culinary ambassadors about the dishes that -- for them -- capture the delicious diversity of india.\n\nchef jessi singh: buffalo milk kebab, punjab\n\nchef jessi singh was born in punjab, india, and grew up between australia and america. he brings his unique culinary journey to modern indian cuisine, including his signature buffalo milk kebabs.\n\nwhen it comes to making a kebab, milk curd probably isn't the first ingredient that springs to mind. but for punjab-born chef and restaurateur, jessi singh, this is the ultimate taste of home.\n\ncrispy on the outside, with a soft, creamy center, kebabs made with curd, yogurt or paneer cheese are a popular appetizer in restaurants across northern india.\n\nborn in a farming village outside of punjab's capital, chandigarh, singh encountered the dish -- and its key ingredients -- at source.\n\nbefore i even turned 10, i knew how to milk the buffaloes, he says.\n\nsingh takes charge of fermenting the milk for the kebabs in his restaurants in australia, including melbourne's daughter in law and don't tell aunty in sydney. served with an orchid and bright pink beetroot sauce, his kebabs might not look like the meals he ate as a child, but the vivid colors represent singh's punjab heritage in other ways.\n\nback home, color doesn't associate with a gender, or a certain people, or a class, he says. color belongs to everyone. you will see men wearing pink turbans, a red shirt ... we are a very, very colorful culture. so that's what i put in my food.\n\ndaughter in law , 37 little bourke street, melbourne, victoria, australia;

a fragrant mix of meat or vegetables, rice and spices, the meal is universally loved across the indian subcontinent. many historians believe biryani originated in persia and was brought to india by the mughals, who controlled the area from the 16th to 18th century.\n\nit made its way into the cuisine of almost every region, each suffusing the dish with its own flavors and techniques.\n\nkhosla makes a version known as awadhi biryani -- a beloved dish back home in uttar pradesh.\n\nlightly spiced pieces of mutton and rice are layered into a pot, sealed with dough, and slowly steamed for hours, in dum pukht style.\n\ndum pukht means slow breathing, so you let the food breathe in its own juices, khosla says.\n\nwith an ever-evolving menu that adapts to the seasonal produce that can be grown on the farm, khosla is excited to spotlight authentic, regional recipes.\n\nwhat we know about indian cuisine is not even the tip of the iceberg, he says. india has 22 distinct cuisines with more than 5,000 different dishes ... that is what i take pride in.\n\nhaoma , 231 3 soi sukhumvit 31, khlong toei nuea, watthana, bangkok, thailand;

rhae lynn barnes is an assistant professor of american cultural history at princeton university. keri leigh merritt is a historian, writer, and filmmaker from atlanta. they are at work on a new civil war documentary. the views expressed here are the authors' own. read more opinion on cnn.\n\nover the last four years, many have warned the public about the flagrant threat to democracy that president donald trump poses. wednesday's failed coup proved that maga, or trumpism, is not over simply because trump lost the 2020 election to joe biden. trumpism is far from dead. instead, it is now their new lost cause\n\nthe lost cause, also known as the lost cause of the confederacy, is america's most successful disinformation campaign. it was an ahistorical theory advocating the erroneous belief that all white southerners valiantly fought for the confederacy to save true american (read: white supremacist) values. it centers on the delusion that slavery, known as the peculiar institution, was often benign and even welcomed by the enslaved.\n\nthis postwar mythology exploded nationally in the late 19th and early 20th century through popular culture vehicles like the films the birth of a nation and gone with the wind and white supremacist laced textbooks that argued the american civil war hinged on the protection of states rights from an aggressive north or federal government -- not the expansion of slavery -- and the promise that the south would rise again.\n\na new lost cause raised the confederate flag\n\nduring tuesday's georgia runoff election , the south did rise to meet our historical moment and elected two democrats, further spurring trump's new lost cause, a dangerous delusion of election fraud spread rampantly by social media algorithms proven to spread disinformation faster than fact, russian bot farms and far-right media.\n\nbut the main perpetrator and beneficiary of the myth is trump himself, who claimed even before the election took place that it would be stolen through rigged election practices, hacked voter machines and by fraudulent ballots. much like the perpetrators of the confederate lost cause, the proponents of the new lost cause claim to be patriotic defenders of the real america or authentic (white) america.\n\nmuch of wednesday's melee was more reminiscent of both the triumphs and the tribulations of the historical era that created the lost cause : reconstruction. its distorted representations in popular culture, with its brilliantly hopeful beginnings, its progressive ideals, and its attempts at racial justice unbearably gave way to an unrelenting violent, deadly white backlash that had no repercussions or consequences for home-grown terrorists.\n\nwednesday, for the first time in american history, white supremacists treasonously raised a confederate flag inside the united states capitol, disrupting america's peaceful transfer of power and invoking tangled memories of our nation's civil war.\n\nlive on cnn, washington, dc's former chief of police said the national guard needed to take back the capitol, a structure built by enslaved black laborers , making it clear that the bedrock of our nation's legislative body was under siege.\n\nreconstruction is more than a punch line\n\nas historian heather cox richardson argued thursday , yesterday the executive branch of our government tried to destroy the legislative branch. perhaps realizing this, sen. lindsay graham , one of trump's most ardent defenders, finally spoke out against the violent attempts to avenge trump. invoking the 1876 election that essentially ended reconstruction, graham quipped that for people looking for historical guidance, this is not the one to pick. as a white senator from the state that launched the civil war, his aside about reconstruction served to historically distance himself from the bloody violence and racist terror of his confederate and segregationist forefathers.\n\njust watched keilar on gop: when you sell your soul, there's a debt to settle replay more videos ... must watch keilar on gop: when you sell your soul, there's a debt to settle 13:12\n\nsen. ted cruz , advocating for a third option, also hearkened to the 1876 compromise to call for an electoral commission to examine claims of voter fraud, urging congress to create a committee of house members, senators, and supreme court justices to conduct a 10-day emergency audit.\n\nlike graham and cruz, sen. dick durbin also compared the trumpist objections to the 2020 election results to the 1876 election. durbin stressed the cataclysmic ramifications of ending reconstruction too early: it was a commission that killed reconstruction, that established jim crow ... (that) re-enslaved african americans, durbin said. relating the 1876 compromise to modern-day voter suppression, he blamed trump for inciting the attempted coup.\n\nrep. dan kildee, a democrat from michigan, connected the day's events to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, tweeted that politicians who supported the coup have put their name on a list with orval faubus, george wallace and bull connor. faubus, wallace and connor all used the confederate flag as a rallying cry to white supremacists to join in lost cause ideology and maintain jim crow segregation.\n\nsupporters of us president donald trump protest in the us capitol rotunda on january 6, 2021, in washington, dc.\n\nas rioters, incited by the president and with some carrying white supremacist imagery descended upon the capitol , scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: the bright reds of the confederate and nazi flags and matching maga hats simmered against a sea of trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered american flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of klan lynchings, and a sweater reading camp auschwitz. the lineage between the slaveholding secessionists and the modern insurrectionists could not have been more clear: both groups were willing to destroy the union and both used violence to deflect their own racial fantasies of power and privilege slipping away.\n\na scene -- literal and figurative -- from 'the birth of a nation'\n\nmany historians have feared, and some have warned of the possibility of this day for months, some for years. trump even campaigned in the style of the jim crow south's white supremacist demagogues, running on hatred and grievance, and cashing in on racism and xenophobia.\n\nnow, in the same moment as the historic election of rev. raphael warnock and jon ossoff, who will respectively be the first black and jewish senators to represent georgia , white supremacists armed with equipment ideal for taking hostages staged the nation's first real coup attempt while seeking to burn the electoral college ballots. just like their confederate forebears, they angrily rejected legitimate election results, vowing vengeance and inciting racist violence.\n\nto be sure, the chaos and uncertainty from the attempted coup and their defiling antics were jarring but not without precedent - the entire scene could have been lifted out of the 1915 white supremacist film  the birth of a nation . as the first major motion picture screened in the white house, the blackface epic rife with disinformation and lost cause sentiment had been based on the bestselling novel  the clansman: an historical romance of the ku klux klan .\n\nformer president woodrow wilson, a historian and architect of federal segregation, was rumored to have deemed the birth of a nation like writing history with lightning. in one of the most pivotal scenes in the saga, set in 1871, former slaveholding confederates watched in horror from the capitol's gallery -- the exact place where reps. jason crow and susan wild were pinned to the floor beneath chairs yesterday -- and gawked at america's newly-elected black congressmen and the first (fictional) black speaker of the house.\n\nlike the domestic terrorists who vandalized house speaker nancy pelosi's office, defiantly putting their feet on her desk with the american flag prostrate, the black congressmen in the birth of a nation (white actors in blackface) were admonished to keep their shoes on, with their feet off desks.\n\nfrom the birth of a nation (1915)\n\nthe blackface congressmen snuck liquor into the capitol. they devoured fried chicken while wildly gesturing as they argued in favor of interracial marriage. they openly brandished guns and knives, gambled, and leered lasciviously at cowering white women in the gallery. as a silent movie, a title card on screen explained it all: the helpless white minority.\n\nthe lie of the 'helpless white minority'\n\nthe helpless white minority.\n\nthat simple lie lays bare so much of america's misery and suffering. the far-right and white supremacists' purported fear of losing status, wealth and most importantly, political power, in the face of mass black voter turnout has always been part of what animated racial violence in this country, from riots to lynchings to police brutality.\n\nit's no coincidence that the infamous the birth of a nation scene that perverts and degrades black leadership supposedly occurs in 1871, one of the most tumultuous years in reconstruction. hiram revels , america's first black senator and a preacher like warnock, was in office, serving only a year. union army generals founded the national rifle association, and congress passed the ku klux klan act outlawing terrorist conspiracies by white supremacists. the act gave the president the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in regions prone to homegrown terrorism.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\ndespite this act, and the formation of black militias and voting blocs throughout the south, white supremacist violence accelerated unabated throughout the region for another 90 years with a legacy that still haunts us today. slavery, jim crow and reconstruction's failures to prosecute treasonous americans materialized yesterday - in the plume of gun smoke inside the capitol.\n\nthe task of peaceful unification is monumental, but it is imperative america upholds the constitution and prosecutes those who commit treason to the full extent of the law -- for the stability of the nation and for the continuation of democracy. as the radical republican congressman thaddeus stevens aptly concluded just months after the bloody civil war, if we fail in this great duty now, when we have the power, we shall deserve and receive the execration of history and of all future ages.
sean gardner/getty images\n\nlos angeles — the los angeles lakers' 2017-18 season might be considered an audition for the services of lebron james, who can leave the cleveland cavaliers in july as a free agent.\n\nafter the cavaliers' 121-112 win over the lakers on dec. 14., james imparted private advice to rookie point guard lonzo ball.\n\nbrandon ingram has begun to emerge as the team's primary scorer, as evidenced by his toe-to-toe battles with kevin durant in two overtime losses to the golden state warriors. rookie kyle kuzma scored a career-high 38 points wednesday in a road win over the houston rockets.\n\nthe lakers (11-18) are showing impressive flashes of what they could be, but it's premature to consider los angeles a favorite for james' services. the hypothetical marriage is seen as a long shot, according to ramona shelburne and brian windhorst of espn.com.\n\nexecutives earvin magic johnson and rob pelinka need to have contingency plans in place.\n\ndarron cummings/associated press\n\nas the oklahoma city thunder (16-15) and new orleans pelicans (15-16) struggle to find their stride, the lakers should keep close tabs on paul george and demarcus cousins. like james, george has a $20.7 million player option with the thunder for the 2018-19 season that he is likely to decline, while cousins' deal with the pelicans ends after the current season.\n\nvideo play button videos you might like\n\nbased on the nba's current salary-cap projection of $101 million for the 2018-19 season, both players will be eligible for contracts starting at around $30 million. the lakers can afford to sign one of the two without breaking up their youthful core. they'd be able to re-sign pending restricted free agent julius randle with another $6.4 million to spend (less if they keep ivica zubac, thomas bryant and/or tyler ennis).\n\ninstead of randle, los angeles could have $18 million to spend, perhaps to retain kentavious caldwell-pope, brook lopez or to acquire another team's free agent altogether.\n\nboth johnson and pelinka have claimed the lakers will have two max slots available next summer, but that currently isn't accurate, not without a move to open space that sheds the $36.8 million owed to luol deng and/or the $25.9 million to jordan clarkson over the next two seasons.\n\nthe lakers could have the space to bring in both george and cousins to play alongside larry nance jr., josh hart, ball, ingram, kuzma and even one of clarkson or randle, depending on how the team escapes deng's contract.\n\nconsidering james will turn 33 on dec. 30, george and cousins—both of whom are 27—may give the lakers more longevity on their dollar. neither has lebron's nba finals experience, but both would represent a significant upgrade in comparison to the incumbent talent.\n\nif landing james and one of the two is plan a, george and cousins without james might be plan b.\n\ndavid zalubowski/associated press\n\nas the feb. 8 trade deadline nears, the lakers should consider making a play for their targets before free agency. the cavaliers are going to ride or die with james, even if he leaves the franchise in july. the chance to win another title is worth that risk.\n\ncan the same be said of the thunder and pelicans, with both teams hovering around .500? what could the lakers offer, knowing they may be able to lure george and/or cousins in free agency?\n\nlos angeles would be better off waiting if the price includes ball, ingram or kuzma, but randle would be the key piece the lakers can afford to dangle.\n\nthat assumes new orleans or oklahoma city is interested in the kentucky forward, who has blossomed this season as the team's backup center. few teams will have much available cap space this summer, meaning randle's restricted rights could be valuable to either franchise.\n\nto make a deal with the pelicans, the lakers would need to send out at least $13 million in salary to acquire cousins. randle is earning just $4.1 million, which means they'd have to include other players with him, be it caldwell-pope or a bigger package with corey brewer, tyler ennis and zubac. roster space could be problematic for new orleans in a four-for-one trade.\n\na deal could expand to include a pair of bad contracts, with omer asik going to the lakers and deng to new orleans. that wouldn't entirely erase the deng mistake, but asik's contract is more forgiving, with $23.3 million owed over the next two years (including only $3 million guaranteed for the 2019-20 season).\n\ncousins would still be an unrestricted free agent after the season with a cap hold of $27.1 million. that could give the lakers $30-35 million left to spend, be it on george or even james in free agency. trading for cousins at the deadline essentially would give the lakers an additional $3 million in cap space in july, before they re-sign him at the max of roughly $30 million.\n\ndavid zalubowski/associated press\n\ngeorge has a higher salary, as he's earning $19.5 million with the thunder this season. the lakers would need to send out at least $14.5 million in salary to acquire him in a trade. as a free agent in july, george's cap hold would be $29.3 million, around $1 million below his maximum salary.\n\ncousins would be slightly friendlier from a salary-cap perspective, but it isn't as though the lakers will have a friendly menu of choices before the trade deadline. the pelicans and thunder would much rather bolster their own rosters with hopes of retaining their respective all-stars this summer.\n\nclarkson, who runs the point for the team's second unit while providing 14.1 points a game, might appeal to other teams as well. he's earning $11.6 million this season with two additional years left on his contract. the lakers could trade him in lieu of or in conjunction with randle.\n\nas far as draft picks, the lakers owe their 2018 first-rounder either to the philadelphia 76ers or boston celtics. los angeles cannot trade its 2019 first-round pick until after the 2018 draft. in the meantime, the lakers can freely trade away first-rounders starting with the 2020 draft.\n\nother top potential free agents in 2018 include kevin durant, deandre jordan, chris paul, isaiah thomas, avery bradley, jabari parker (restricted), carmelo anthony, aaron gordon (restricted), clint capela (restricted), zach lavine (restricted), greg monroe and nerlens noel.\n\nultimately, the lakers can afford to wait. if they miss out on james, cousins and george, they still have spending power for one or two max contracts to go with a nice group of young, developing players.\n\nwhile the lakers would love to have an all-star on their roster before los angeles hosts the all-star festivities at staples center in mid-february, they may have to wait until the summer for a blockbuster acquisition.\n\nall quotes were obtained firsthand unless otherwise noted. email eric pincus at eric.pincus@gmail.com and follow him on twitter: @ericpincus.
(cnn) — what are the world's best foods? we thought we knew. apparently we don't. our list of the world's 50 best foods stimulated some impassioned debate about the conspicuous lack of french dishes and the merits of ketchup over mayonnaise.\n\nketchup?

great big story\n\nis south korea the most generous nation or what? south korean restaurants provide this starter dish of fermented vegetables for free. perhaps because few south koreans can last more than two days without it.\n\n11. lasagna, italy\n\nlasagna is right on so many levels. pinch of yum\n\nlasagna overtook pizza to become the most sought-after italian food in this delicacy list. there's a reason this pasta-layered, tomato-sauce-infused, minced-meaty gift to kids and adults alike is so popular -- it just works. dee dodge wrote, i love lasagna. the lack of exclamation marks tells you how seriously true fans take this dish.\n\n10. massaman curry, thailand\n\nstill a top 10 best foods entry. courtesy marita/creative commons/flickr\n\nalthough not the world's most delicious food, it is still emphatically the king of curries. spicy, coconutty, sweet and savory, its combination of flavors has more personality than a thai election. even the packet sauce you buy from the supermarket can make the most delinquent of cooks look like a michelin potential. thankfully, someone invented rice, with which diners can mop up the last drizzles of curry sauce. the land of smiles isn't just a marketing tag-line. it's a result of being born in a land where the best curry is sold on nearly every street corner.\n\n9. peking duck, china\n\nthe only way to eat your duck. greg baker/afp/afp/getty images\n\npeking duck! its a wonder..... wrote shan cao on our facebook page. we can only guess shan cao was in the middle of forking a piece of this maltose-syrup glazed duck dish into his/her mouth and forgot to finish the sentence. slow-roasted in an oven, the crispy, syrup-coated skin is so good that authentic eateries will serve more skin than meat, and bring it with pancakes, onions and hoisin or sweet bean sauce. other than flying or floating, this is the only way you want your duck.\n\n8. ramen, japan\n\nworld's loudest food? courtesy jonathan lin/creative commons/flickr\n\njapanese protocol says the tastier your ramen is, the louder you should slurp it up to show respect to your chef. not that they need more respect. one mouthful of this most japanese of noodle broths will quickly tell you that either you have a ramen trigger in your brain, or japanese chefs are geniuses.\n\n7. dim sum, hong kong\n\nfamily lunches are fun again. kate springer\n\nequally fun and delicious to eat, a trip to hong kong isn't complete without trying this traditional cantonese lunch food. popular with everyone from pass-through tourists to local kids and the elderly, most dim sum come in bite-size pieces so you don't have to waste time cutting the stuff up. bring a few friends and wash the food down with the free-flow tea.\n\n6. som tam (papaya salad), thailand\n\nthailand's best salad. courtesy jessica spengler/creative commons/flickr\n\nafter reading reader kun chotpakdeetrakul's comment, papaya salad and som tam [are] the same thing. you should combine vote for these two together, we did just that, pushing som tam to just 80 votes shy of the top five. to prepare thailand 's iconic salad, pound garlic and chilies with a mortar and pestle. toss in tamarind juice, fish sauce, peanuts, dried shrimp, tomatoes, lime juice, sugar cane paste, string beans and a handful of grated green papaya.\n\n5. pad thai, thailand\n\neven better when it's messy. courtesy steve snodgrass/creative commons/flickr\n\nhere's a food thai people can't live without. similar to bulgogi (see #22), pad thai is packed with nutrients stirred into one glorious fried-noodle dish. the secret's in the sauce -- tamarind paste. if anyone ever creates a hall of food fame, that should be first on the list.\n\n4. tom yam goong, thailand\n\ndo you eat or drink soup? either way just get it inside you. courtesy amrufm/creative commons/flickr\n\nreader supot sakulwongtana made it clear that delicious includes a little bit hot. a little bit hot is right because you need room for a load more flavors too. this thai masterpiece teems with shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves. usually loaded with coconut milk and cream, the hearty soup unifies a host of favorite thai tastes: sour, salty, spicy and sweet. best of all is the price: cheap.\n\n3. sushi, japan\n\nrice, salmon, wasabi -- world's best food trio? tonic photo studios, llc/ photographers choice rf/ getty images\n\nwhen japan wants to build something right, it builds it really right. brand giants such as toyota, nintendo, sony, nikon and yamaha may have been created by people fueled by nothing more complicated than raw fish and rice, but it's how the fish and rice is put together that makes this a global first-date favorite. this perfect marriage between raw fish and rice has easily kept sushi in the top five. and like one reader, nymayor, wrote, now to be fair, delicious can be simple. the japanese don't live practically forever for no reason -- they want to keep eating this stuff.\n\n2. nasi goreng, indonesia\n\nmore rice -- a common factor in many of these dishes. courtesy indi samarajiva/creative commons/flickr\n\ni like rendang and nasi goreng, two of most popular food in indonesia! reader rizky ramadhika's got it. and thousands of other voters agreed. the wonder of combining rice with egg, chicken and prawns strikes again. the second fried rice to make the list, this indonesian delight received more than 10 times the vote of its thai counterpart (see #23), propelling the former from non-runner to runner-up.\n\n1. rendang, indonesia\n\nno. 1 as voted by you. courtesy stu_spivack/creative commons/flickr\n\nreader kamal f chaniago showed great foresight when he wrote, rendang is the best. a clear winner with a loyal following, this beefy dish can now rightfully claim the title of world's most delicious food. beef is slowly simmered with coconut milk and a mixture of lemongrass, galangal, garlic, turmeric, ginger and chilies, then left to stew for a few hours to create this dish of tender, flavorful bovine goodness.\n\nthe indonesian dish is often served at ceremonial occasions and to honored guests. it's not only delicious but also comes with a simple recipe. if you haven't already, go ahead and take reader isabela desita's advice: rendang should be the first! it's really nice, you should try!

championship game is coming up monday. other than being a mouthful to say – it needs something elegant, like super bowl – it should be a great game. expect a clash, of both titans and colors, as the alabama crimson tide and the clemson tigers vie for the title. here's everything, and we mean everything, you need to know about the game.\n\nwhat time is it?\n\nkickoff is at 8 p.m. et monday.\n\nwhat channel is it on?\n\nthe game will be broadcast on espn, and if you don't have cable, you can catch it on watchespn, the channel's streaming service.\n\nwhere is it?\n\nthe game will be played at raymond james stadium in tampa, florida.\n\nwhat team usually plays there?\n\nthe stadium is home to the nfl's tampa bay buccaneers, which explains the giant pirate ship in it.\n\nwho's playing?\n\nthe alabama crimson tide (in crimson, obviously) will take on the clemson tigers (in white, with orange helmets, according to bleacher report).\n\nwhat schools do they represent and where are they?\n\nthe university of alabama is in tuscaloosa, and clemson university is in clemson, south carolina.\n\ndo these teams have history?\n\nboy, do they ever. this game is a rematch of the 2016 college football playoff national championship, which alabama won 45-40.\n\nwho are the quarterbacks?\n\nkeep these names handy: the alabama quarterback is jalen hurts, and clemson's is deshaun watson.\n\nwho are the coaches?\n\nnick saban coaches alabama, and dabo swinney coaches clemson. more on this later.\n\nwhat's the spread?\n\naccording to bleacher report, alabama is favored by six points (the same number as a touchdown), with the total points at 51. we told you this would be good.\n\nhow many championships has alabama claimed?\n\n16, including four under current coach nick saban.\n\nthat's a lot.\n\nyeah, they're a pretty big deal.\n\nhow many championships has clemson claimed?\n\none, in 1981.\n\ncan i get tickets, and how much will they set me back?\n\nit's going to

at either alabama or clemson.\n\neveryone keeps talking about the sec. i don't know what that is and at this point, i'm too afraid to ask.\n\ndivision i fbs teams are divided into conferences. think of them like leagues. alabama belongs to the southeastern conference, or the sec. it is the most powerful conference and one of the reasons it seems like everyone in the south is crazy about football.\n\nclemson is in the atlantic coast conference, which is also pretty good.\n\nwhy is alabama's mascot an elephant if the team is called the crimson tide?\n\nthis is actually a great story, as related by alabama's athletics website. basically, during a much-hyped 1930 game between alabama and ole miss, the alabama team came out with such strength and force, fans yelled, hold your horses, the elephants are coming! and the name red elephants stuck amongst sportswriters.\n\nhow do you pronounce clemson head coach dabo swinney's name?\n\nit's dab-oh swee-nee, as in doing the dab. someone should call him the dab. his real name is william christopher swinney.\n\nwho is lane kiffin, and why does anyone care?\n\nkiffin was the offensive coordinator for alabama and was slated to leave the school at the end of the season to coach another team. however, saban, alabama's head coach and a god among football men, recently made the surprising announcement that kiffin would not be sticking around to coach during the championship game. drama ensued.\n\nwhat should i yell out the car window if i want to proclaim my allegiance to one of these teams?\n\nif you're into alabama, you only need to know two words: roll tide. this is suitable for any occasion, up to and including wills and marriage vows.\n\nif you're rooting for clemson, a hearty go tigers will suffice.\n\nwhat does the trophy look like, and is it better than the crystal football egg thing teams used to get?\n\nthe trophy looks like this:\n\nit's not better than the old trophy, which looked like it belonged in the throne room of buckingham palace.\n\nhere's what the winning team used to receive. pretty snazzy, right?\n\nwhat are some other fun facts i can use to sound smart?\n\nclemson had an undefeated 2015 season going into last year's championship game and then lost to alabama. this year, it's alabama that's been undefeated so far. does that mean anything? who knows?\n\nthis is also the first time two teams have met for a rematch of a division i college football championship, made even more interesting (or boring, perhaps) because, well, they just played each other last year!\n\nnow you know everything there is to know about monday night's game. enjoy.
written by allyssia alleyne, cnn\n\nfor football fans, the super bowl is the most important day of the season, the culmination of five months of national football league competition. and for those less interested in the sport, there's the halftime show, when the world's most famous performers deliver 15 minutes of high-voltage entertainment.\n\non sunday night, jennifer lopez and shakira gave highly energetic performances which included crowd surfing and pole dancing . throughout, j-lo changed into multiple versace outfits, including a silver mesh body suit and a feathered cape that dueled as puerto rican and american flags, to celebrate her heritage.\n\nsinger jennifer lopez performs during the pepsi super bowl liv halftime show at hard rock stadium on february 02, 2020 in miami, florida. lopez and her daughter sing opening notes to bruce spingsteen's born in the usa. credit: elsa/getty images north america/getty images\n\nshakira and jennifer lopez perform onstage at the hard rock stadium on february 02, 2020 in miami, florida. credit: kevin winter/getty images\n\n\n\n\n\nthe halftime show has long been popular among viewers, whether they're into football or not, if the perennial twitter jokes about the game being the opening act for the performer are to be believed. indeed, the most-watched halftime show, katy perry in 2015, attracted 118.5 million viewers , while the game itself drew an average audience of 114.4 million viewers.\n\nthis massive audience makes the halftime show a valuable platform for artists to promote designers and spread messages through their fashion choices -- sometimes courting controversy and backlash in the process.\n\ncnn style looks back at some of the best fashion of halftime shows past.\n\n1993 - michael jackson rocks the military look\n\nmichael jackson performs at super bowl xxvii in 1993 at the rose bowl in pasadena, california. credit: steve granitz/wireimage/getty images\n\ngiven its significance today, you'd think the super bowl halftime show has always been a prestige event. but it was only in 1993, when michael jackson brought his trademark pageantry to the event, that it took on its current reputation. before then, the show had mostly been dominated by marching bands.\n\njackson's performance -- introduced by no less than james earl jones -- opened with him springing eight feet into the air from underneath the stage (a trademark of his 1992 dangerous world tour), against a backdrop of pyrotechnics.\n\nhe then stood motionless for one-and-a-half minutes in a military-inspired black-and-gold ensemble, before launching into a medley of his hits.\n\ngiven jackson's repertoire of songs against police violence, war and injustice, this look was subversive. michael made (the uniform) his own by pushing the envelope, rebelling against the establishment the uniform is supposed to represent with all those badges and making it rock 'n' roll, michael bush, one of jackson's costume designers, told rolling stone in 2012.\n\nbut it was also just fantastic theater for an audience that had previously settled for disney characters and an elvis-impersonating magician\n\n2004 - janet jackson's wardrobe malfunction\n\njanet jackson performs during the halftime show at super bowl xxxviii at houston's reliant stadium in 2004. credit: frank micelotta/getty images\n\njanet jackson and justin timberlake's 2004 performance will forever be remembered as the incident that brought wardrobe malfunction into popular parlance.\n\nwhile performing a duet, timberlake ripped off a part of jackson's bustier, exposing her breast to millions of viewers, and nipplegate was born.\n\na lot of people were unhappy. the federal communications commission reportedly received more than 500,000 indecency complaints about 9/16 of a second of exposed flesh, and levied a $550,000 fine against cbs, the network airing the game, and its affiliates. (the fine was thrown out by the supreme court in 2012.)\n\n2007 - prince's perfect timing\n\nprince at super bowl xli in 2007. credit: philip ramey/ramneypix/corbis/getty images\n\nprince -- dressed in blue suit and chest-bearing orange button-down, hair covered with a black scarf -- performing purple rain in the middle of a torrential storm, purple symbol guitar in hand, was a glorious finale to a performance that saw one of history's most incandescent performers giving his all for 140 million views.\n\nthe heavy rain made the smoke and lights seem mysterious, instead of merely ridiculous. and there was a sneaky thrill in watching prince steal the field from guys three times his size, if only for a few moments, opined music critic kelefa sanneh in the new york times following the show.\n\n2012 - madonna brings high fashion to halftime\n\nmadonna wears givenchy by riccardo tisci at super bowl xlvi in 2012. credit: al bello/getty images\n\nthe 2012 super bowl is when halftime officially went high fashion. to add an extra veneer of dark glamour to her performance, madonna enlisted designer riccardo tisci , then creative director of givenchy, to design her costumes.\n\nfollowing my collaboration with madonna on her last tour three years ago, it is a great honor for me to be a part of yet another historical and iconic moment, tisci told vogue after the performance. people say everything has a limit, but limits do not exist with madonna.\n\nthe bespoke outfits, inspired by looks tisci had designed for the french fashion house, included an embellished gold cape and a gladiatorial black mini skirt with a studded belt, each accessorized with an egyptian-inspired headpiece by british milliner philip treacy.\n\n2015 - katy perry goes (more) pop with jeremy scott\n\nkaty perry, wearing jeremy scott, performs her single roar atop a metal lion during the super bowl xlix halftime show. credit: tom pennington/getty images\n\nfashion took the spotlight again in 2015, when katy perry wore four jeremy scott outfits on stage. the looks were a perfect marriage of katy perry's over-the-top cartoonish-ness and scott's penchant for bedazzled americana and pop culture.\n\none of the highlights? a metallic skirt-and-jacket combo covered in flames worn during the first number, inspired by a pair of shoes from the designer's archive. perry wore it to perform her song roar atop a metal lion.\n\nexclusive documentary: around the world with jeremy scott\n\ni love pop culture, and for me that's one of the things that's so exciting about this opportunity, scott told the now-defunct fashion news site style.com. the audience is so vast, it's so much more outside our nuanced world of high-fashion lovers.\n\nthat vast audience ended up encompassing 118.5 million tv viewers -- the standing record for a super bowl halftime show.\n\n2016 - beyoncé gets political\n\nsanta clara, ca - february 07: beyonce and bruno mars perform during the pepsi super bowl 50 halftime show at levi's stadium on february 7, 2016 in santa clara, california. (photo by ezra shaw/getty images) credit: ezra shaw/getty images\n\nsuper bowl weekend was a busy one for beyoncé. on saturday, she released the video for her new single, formation, a visual exploration of southern black femininity and the aftermath of hurricane katrina, which ripped through predominantly black new orleans neighborhoods in 2005. on sunday, she took to the stage to perform in one of the year's most-watched televised events.\n\nher performance was unabashedly politically. she opened the show with an all-black dance troupe donning afros and black berets, an obvious reference to the way the way black panther party members dressed in the '60s. (forgoing the beret, beyoncé tipped her hat to michael jackson with a black-and-gold military jacket recalling his own super bowl look.) the dancers also assumed an x formation at one point, a reference to malcolm x.\n\nwhile fans and critics praised the performance, and the audacity of making such a powerful statement in front of her entire country. new york times magazine staff writer jenna wortham put it well: i think she wants us to know that even though she's headlining a mainstream event like the super bowl, she has opinions and isn't afraid to share them, nor is she afraid to do it on a national and global scale.\n\n(it's worth noting this was in february 2016, seven months before colin kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem in protest against police brutality and racism in the us.)\n\nothers took offense at what they perceived as an anti-police sentiment. some were so upset that they organized a poorly attended anti-beyoncé rally at the nfl's new york headquarters. rudy giuliani, the outspoken former mayor of new york mayor and donald trump's attorney, called it outrageous.\n\nthis is football, not hollywood, he told fox news , and i thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive.\n\n2017 - lady gaga takes to the skies\n\nlady gaga performs during super bowl li halftime show at houston's nrg stadium in 2017. credit: kevin c. cox/getty images\n\nleave it to lady gaga to take the super bowl halftime show to new heights.\n\nthe singer started her set with god bless america and this land is your land before being lowered into the stadium on cables to sing, dance and play piano to her greatest hits.\n\nsurprisingly, she wore only two outfits throughout: an iridescent, crystal-embellished bodysuit (which she later covered with a spiked golden jacket); and a white jacket that resembled football shoulder pads with matching hot pants. both were designed by atelier versace, so subtle they were not.

(cnn) each week, sheri mcgregor gets hundreds of emails from parents shut out of their children's lives. every story is different, she said. what the parents have in common is a profound sense of isolation.\n\nthey say, 'i thought i was the only one,' said mcgregor, founder of a website for estranged parents who lives in the foothills of california's sierra nevada mountains. a lot of these people have been suffering alone for years. ... you feel like you're the only one, so you don't tell other people.\n\nafter being cut off by her own adult son, mcgregor had felt the same. in the years since, she has written extensively about the healing process, and heard from countless families coping with similar losses.\n\nfamily rifts between parents and adult children are the most common, according to the cornell university survey.\n\nmcgregor, and the people who write to her, are not alone in their rifts with family members. it's something they have in common with millions of people.\n\nin one recent high-profile case, multiple family members of republican rep. adam kinzinger of illinois released a letter shunning the politician for his criticism of then-president donald trump. what a disappointment you are to us and to god! they wrote . it is now most embarrassing to us that we are related to you.\n\nover a quarter of adults responding to a us survey by the cornell family reconciliation project reported being estranged from a family member. the representational survey, which is the first of its kind, suggested by extension that tens of millions of americans may be estranged from at least one relative.\n\nthat number is probably low, said karl pillemer, professor of human development at cornell university, who led the study and explored his findings in the recent book  fault lines: fractured families and how to mend them .\n\npeople find this to be an embarrassing problem, he said, noting that even in a confidential survey, some topics can simply feel too shameful to share.\n\nthe groundbreaking survey sheds light on a topic pillemer said is poorly understood by scientists, given how widespread and painful estrangement is. no more than 20 reliable scientific articles about estrangement exist, he said, and those are all based on small and non-representative samples.\n\ntoday, however, researchers and mental health professionals are tuning into the problem. here's what experts say about why estrangements happen, why they may be rising and how families can begin to heal.\n\nwhy family estrangements happen\n\nevery family is different, but there are six main paths to estrangement between family members, pillemer said.\n\ndivorce can have long-term impacts on families. conflict over money and inheritance can play a major role in blowups.\n\nrelationships with in-laws can cause tension, sometimes to the point of estrangement. a family member might also have unmet expectations, seeing their relatives as failing them in some crucial way.\n\nfor example, tennis champion naomi osaka 's japanese mother, tamaki osaka, was estranged from family members for over a decade because they disapproved of her relationship with naomi's haitian father, leonard francois.\n\nthe most prominent path, though, may be a painful history that proves just too hard to move on from, pillemer said.\n\nproblems in childhood, problems in the family of origin were a main cause in many estrangements, he said. in some ways, that reflects how what he calls positive shared history can provide a buffer against the stress of normal conflict, pillemer explained.\n\nimagine a pair of siblings facing a conflict about money, for instance. or a parent-child relationship strained by a difference in values, like the family situation faced by tamaki osaka.\n\nremembering a lifetime of positive, loving interactions could see the family through a rocky patch.\n\nif there's been this long and solid basis of childhood attachment and affection, you're more likely to reconcile. it's more likely to be a temporary thing, pillemer said.\n\nwhy family estrangement may be rising\n\na family rift is intensely personal, yet each story plays out against a broader cultural backdrop of values and behavioral norms. while no historical data exist to demonstrate a clear rise, pillemer said he suspects estrangements have gone up over time.\n\nsomeone feeling comfortable saying 'i never want to speak to my family members again,' is probably increasing, he said. divorce, which correlates to likelihood of family estrangements, has risen dramatically over past decades.\n\nthere is also a change in perspective, pillemer said. the sense that 'i will stick with my relatives no matter what' ... i think that's still there to some extent. but i think there's a lower-threshold breaking point, for younger people in particular.\n\nmany americans now place a greater emphasis on individual well-being, said psychologist joshua coleman, author of the new book  rules of estrangement: why adult children cut ties and how to heal the conflict .\n\nstaying in contact is much more tied to identity, to personal growth, to the pursuit of happiness, he said. in the past, coleman explained, such bonds were more likely to be grounded in a sense of duty or obligation.\n\nthat's different now, said coleman, whose focus is mainly on estrangements between parents and adult children. such ruptures are particularly painful, and the cornell university survey found they're the most common of all.\n\ntoday, parents are held to a much higher standard, coleman said. the only thing that keeps an adult child tied to a parent is whether the adult child wants the relationship.\n\nthat's not necessarily a bad thing, he said. the cultural shift makes it easier for adult children to separate from parents who have been abusive , or who reject their sexuality, gender identity and basic values.\n\nprior generations of parents had too much power in terms of relationships with their children, while today it's much more equal, he said. in some cases, though, coleman thinks us culture has swung too far away from family cohesion to support overall social well-being.\n\nthe equilibrium between cohesion and individual happiness varies between cultures and families. in the cornell university study, for example, participants from families who immigrated to the us from the caribbean, africa and latin america reported feeling strong social pressure to repair any rifts with estranged relatives.\n\noverall in the us, though, we're wedded to this more individualistic narrative of personal happiness, coleman said, that if a relationship doesn't make you feel good, or makes you feel bad in any way, then you should consider this person toxic and cut them out of your life.\n\nthat, in turn, might not actually make us very happy, coleman said. there's enormous loneliness in our culture, he said.\n\nolder adults tend to be especially isolated, a situation that has been aggravated by the pandemic. being part of a group — caring about what other people think, feel and need — is important.\n\nhow estranged families can find healing\n\nsome estranged families make their way to coleman's oakland, california, therapy practice , where the psychologist works with parents hoping to reconcile with their children. it's a predicament he can relate to, because he, too, has experienced such loss firsthand.\n\ni had an estrangement with my daughter, which has made this kind of a mission, said coleman, who has since reconciled with his child. the parents i work with are heartbroken, they're miserable.\n\nreconciliation is possible for many families, coleman said, but it's not easy. in most cases of successful reconciliations between parent and child, he said parents initiate the process.\n\nparents must show empathy for the adult's child's perspective, they have to take responsibility. coleman often invites parents to write their children a letter that does just that, acknowledging why the child felt they needed to cut off the relationship.\n\nit's not all about making amends, he said. it's also important to signal that you're ready for a relationship that respects your family member's ideas of what a healthy connection looks like, even if that differs from your own expectations.\n\nnot all parents, frankly, are capable of doing that, coleman said. and sometimes parents may do all of these things and the child is still not willing to reconcile.\n\ncoleman underscores empathy when he's talking to adult children, too. if they were open to reconciliation, i would pursue with them a different way of looking at their parent, one that's borne more of compassion and empathy, he said.\n\nget cnn health's weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr. sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team.\n\nsuch a shift in perspective can be difficult for people on each side of a rift. for many families, though, he said the benefits of reconciliation means it's worth the hard emotional work.\n\npeople sometimes say, 'how successful are you?' coleman said. we're very successful when both people are willing to come to the bargaining table and are open to change. but both people have to be willing.
(cnn) america faces 13 days of danger before the departure of an unhinged commander-in-chief who set his mob on the us capitol in an act of insurrection that shattered a more than 220-year tradition of peaceful transfers of power.\n\npresident donald trump's seditious behavior has provoked a full crisis inside his white house bunker in his final days, following a fracture with his ultra-loyal vice president mike pence , who refused to join the futile but destructive effort to overturn the result of the election.\n\nafter orchestrating one of the most notorious days in us political history and trashing democracy by refusing for weeks to accept his defeat, trump suddenly issued a dead-of-night statement belatedly pledging an orderly transition of power to president-elect joe biden on january 20.\n\nbut as usual, the move appeared motivated by self-interest rather than a sense of duty as it appeared to be an attempt to stem a wave of west wing resignations amid talk of a snap impeachment or effort by the cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment to force him from office.\n\nin unspeakable scenes on wednesday, marauding thugs marched from an incendiary trump rally to storm the capitol. their aim was to stop lawmakers finalizing president-elect joe biden's victory ahead of his january 20 inauguration. but the bedlam, which saw rioters smash windows, lay siege to lawmakers and reach the house and senate chambers, had the opposite effect, hastening the moment of final repudiation for the president and his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\na number of senate republicans who had been minded to drag out the president's stunt flipped in revulsion at the storming of their citadel of democracy in an ugly culmination of a lawless presidency. but despite the outrage perpetrated by trump supporters, more than 100 of his allies in the house -- a majority of republicans -- still voted to uphold totally fraudulent claims of election fraud.\n\nbut shortly before 4 a.m. et on thursday morning, pence read out the final tally of electoral votes — 306 to 232 in the president-elect's favor — as the constitution and the will of the people triumphed over trump's stunning attempt at a coup.\n\nshortly afterward, the president issued a written statement pledging an orderly transition on january 20 even though he said he disagreed with the outcome of the election, once again repeating false claims about how the facts were on his side.\n\nwhile this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to make america great again! trump wrote.\n\nthe breaching of the capitol for the first time since 1814 overshadowed hugely significant results of twin runoff elections in georgia that handed democrats control of the senate. the victories of raphael warnock and jon ossoff will transform prospects for biden's presidency, which will begin in a nation ripped in two by trump's seditious behavior and consumed by a murderous and worsening pandemic that produced a new daily record of more than 3,800 covid-19 deaths.\n\nbut before then, there is growing concern about the stability of a president who has had his twitter and facebook accounts suspended because of incitement but retains the full power of the presidency and the nuclear codes.\n\ninside his white house bunker on wednesday night, trump was fulminating about his defeat and what he sees as the treachery of pence.\n\nsome officials were considering resigning, including national security adviser robert o'brien. his deputy, matt pottinger had already gone wednesday afternoon, sources told cnn. a gop source said that some cabinet members held preliminary discussions about invoking the 25th amendment to force trump's removal from office on the grounds he is not fit to serve. there were demands from some house democrats to trigger immediate impeachment proceedings. however the tumult is resolved, there is the alarming prospect of an uncontrollable president running rampant and a splintered chain of command at the white house that will have grave national security implications and could create a vacuum conducive to further unrest.\n\nit is not clear how much momentum efforts to expel the president will gather with trump so close to leaving office. but they reflect extreme concern of even those officials and republicans who have appeased his wild impulses and abuses of power for four turbulent years.\n\nafter all, a president who has already been impeached once, who was caught on tape trying to steal the election in georgia last weekend and who has never recognized the guardrails of his office, is acting in a way that suggests he thinks he has nothing to lose.\n\nhe's out of his mind, one source who is in frequent contact with trump told cnn's jim acosta.\n\npresidential historian douglas brinkley expressed concern about the damage that an unchained and angry president could wreak in the next two weeks.\n\nanybody in any federal bureau has to be keeping a close eye on donald trump because he is acting and thinking in an irrational way, brinkley said.\n\na surreal moment\n\nthe most terrifying truth revealed by the assault on the capitol was not the act itself. it was the mania of a president who turned his insurgents on the nation's legislature and who has immeasurably deepened political estrangements that will fester long after he has left office.\n\nthe spectacle of rioters, waving trump flags and wearing make america great again hats piling up the steps below the glorious dome that shines as a beacon of self-government was too surreal to believe at first. but while shocking, the unprecedented scenes of an american horde rampaging through the halls of congress, of police guns drawn in the house chamber and of rioters smashing windows cannot be said to be a surprise.\n\nthey were, in fact, a logical climax to a presidency steeped in demagoguery, conspiracy theories, incitements to violence and a strongman's contempt for the constitution. they were the inevitable result of years of misinformation and instigation by trump, his aides and his lie-pumping media propagandists that have left millions of americans believing his false claims of a rigged election. the shame of a dark day in american history is shared by all those who mocked warnings that trump's political treachery was brewing an explosion -- including republican lawmakers, who have abetted his ludicrous claims of voter fraud after enabling his malignant presidency.\n\nwe are going to walk down ... to the capitol, trump said in a rally near the white house that lit the touch paper for a day of mayhem as congress met to finalize biden's election victory.\n\nyou'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength, you have to be strong.\n\nthe appalling scenes horrified an incredulous watching world and recalled the revolts and palace rebellions of unstable banana republics rather than the stately rituals of the supposed last best hope for democracy on earth.\n\nthis is not america, josep borrell, a top european union official, said on twitter.\n\nsadly, and to the contrary, this is the america wrought by the country's most vengeful president whose abominable four years in power have stoked an american carnage more dangerous than the economic blight he decried in an inaugural address delivered nearly four years ago from the same steps overrun by his thugs.\n\na day of infamy actually began with the fbi opening an investigation into an apparently fake threat broadcast on air traffic control frequencies to fly a plane into the capitol to avenge the us killing of a top iranian general last year. the day's peril came not from outside but from within, as the trump mob pulled off an incursion previously only managed by british armies 200 years ago.\n\nthere has been a recent debate among journalists on how to refer to trump's bid to steal a free and fair election he lost, his refusal to honor a peaceful transfer of power, and his incitement of angry supporters to disrupt the constitutional process.\n\nthis is as close to a coup attempt as this country has ever seen, former washington police chief charles ramsey told cnn.\n\ntimothy naftali, a cnn presidential historian from new york university, said that trump had broken a golden thread of democracy that has sustained american freedom.\n\ntoday was the first time in our history that a president has opposed a peaceful transfer of power, naftali said.\n\na 'shameful' episode\n\nthe question now is whether wednesday's outrage will be a one-off eruption, that once quelled, will become an awful memory of a presidency that tore the country apart.\n\nbut the bitter feelings unleashed by trump are not confined to the tens of thousands of supporters who flocked to washington, dc. the president and his media shills have seeded a pernicious mistrust of democracy across vast swathes of the country. the majority of trump voters are not violent. but millions of them believe his poison about the election being stolen — and think their country is being taken away from them. this raises the possibility that wednesday's unrest is more than the violent death throes of a failed presidency, but a venomous force that will not only thwart biden's hopes of healing corrosive divides but will fester once trump leaves office and offer him a platform for continued extremism.\n\nutah republican sen. mitt romney said that the best way to show respect for voters who are upset at the election result is not to perpetuate trump's lies but to tell them the truth.\n\nthose who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy.\n\nseveral republican senators were angered by wednesday's events -- despite sending a signal of impunity for trump's previous abuses of power by voting to acquit him in his impeachment trial and forging a marriage of convenience with trump to pursue shared goals like confirming conservative judges.\n\ntrump and i have, we've had a hell of a journey. i hate it to end this way. oh my god, i hate it, south carolina sen. lindsey graham said. all i can say is count me out. enough is enough, graham said.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell condemned the violence and reinforced his opposition to efforts to block biden's victory.\n\nwe will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats, mcconnell said. we will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\neleventh hour resignations and acknowledgments of biden's victory, however, are hardly profiles in courage following the indulgence granted by republicans to trump's anti-democratic conduct and weeks of appeasing his denial of biden's victory.\n\ntrump silent amid the mayhem\n\nwhile members of congress took cover beneath their seats, and his supporters roamed though leadership offices, trump did nothing — but watch the mayhem that he had triggered unfold on tv.\n\none source told cnn's kaitlin collins that trump was more preoccupied with what he sees as pence's political apostasy after the vice president announced he would not seek to disrupt the certification of biden's victory — a step he had no power to take in any case. eventually, trump issued a video telling protesters to go home but exacerbated the situation by making more disgraceful and false allegations about a stolen election.\n\nthe president's silence when real violence was raging contrasted with his incessant and false pre-election claims that leftist mobs were running rampant through us cities and his calls for the restoration of law and order.\n\nand the apparently meager us capitol police forces that were overwhelmed in congress contrasted sharply with the heavily armed phalanxes of security forces trump poured onto streets filled by black lives matters protests over the summer. on that notorious occasion, the justice department sent federal troops into lafayette square with tear gas to clear protesters ahead of an absurd presidential photo-op.\n\nit was left to biden , who will take office in a country brought to its knees by trump's divisiveness and a pandemic that is now claiming more than 3,000 american lives per day, to offer the steady hand of leadership.\n\nthis is not dissent. it is disorder. it is chaos. it borders on sedition, biden said in a speech in delaware.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional reporting.
(cnn) transportation secretary nominee pete buttigieg said thursday that the biden administration will look at all relevant authorities at its disposal toward a federal mask mandate on all forms of transportation, part of his confirmation hearing that could put the former south bend, indiana, mayor on the path to becoming the first senate-confirmed lgbtq cabinet secretary.\n\nwe are prepared to make sure that we use all relevant authorities to enforce the president's executive order to ensure that across all modes of transportation, workers, passengers, commuters are protected, buttigieg told democratic sen. ed markey of massachusetts during his confirmation hearing before the senate's commerce, science and transportation committee.\n\nbuttigieg, who gained national attention during his upstart presidential campaign, is also expected to play a central role in president joe biden's push for a bipartisan infrastructure package. during the campaign, biden proposed spending $1.3 trillion over 10 years to build schools , roads, bridges, railroads and pipes, expand broadband access and usher in a 100% clean energy economy .\n\nwe need to build our economy back, better than ever, buttigieg said. the department of transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing president biden's infrastructure vision creating millions of good-paying jobs, revitalizing communities that have been left behind, enabling american small businesses, workers, families and farmers to compete and win in the global economy, and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nbuttigieg often spoke about infrastructure on the campaign trail from the perspective of a small-town mayor, arguing that local governments like the one he once ran needed people in washington who understood their needs and issues.\n\nread more
robinson signs autographs before the start of the old timers game between the angels and dodgers at anaheim stadium in 1969. three years later, he died of a heart attack at age 53. his legacy lives on in countless ways: his number has been retired by every baseball team, and jackie robinson day is celebrated every april 15 in honor of his first day in the majors. rachel robinson founded the jackie robinson foundation, which gives scholarships and leadership training to minority youths, in 1973.\n\nrobinson attends a meeting for freedom marchers in williamston, north carolina, in 1964. he was there to lend his name to the integration efforts in the city.\n\njackie and rachel robinson had three children, from left: jackie jr., david and sharon. they're shown at their home in stamford, connecticut, in 1962. jackie jr. died in a car accident in 1971 at age 24.\n\nrobinson retired after the 1956 season and became active in other pursuits. he became an executive for the chock full o'nuts coffee company, spoke out on civil rights -- and occasionally popped up on television, as with this appearance with ed sullivan in 1962.\n\nrobinson was a terrific base runner, leading the national league twice in stolen bases and upsetting pitchers' rhythms on a regular basis. he also stole home 19 times in the regular season, and in the 1955 world series, his steal of home in the eighth inning of game 1 helped ignite brooklyn to its only world series victory (though they lost the game).\n\nrobinson played several positions for the dodgers: mainly second base but also third base, first base and a little outfield. here he leaps into the air in an attempt to make a double play as the cubs' hank sauer slides into second in a 1952 game.\n\ndodgers shortstop and native kentuckian pee wee reese was a supporter of robinson in the latter's first rough year in the majors, refusing to sign a petition from teammates for a boycott and -- according to some stories -- showing his solidarity by putting his arm around robinson's shoulders. he became one of robinson's best friends. the two are pictured in 1950 with their children, cooking soup.\n\ndodgers executive branch rickey eyed robinson as the right man to break the color line and signed him to his first major league contract. the two are shown here in 1950.\n\nrobinson married rachel in 1946. through his years in baseball and afterward, she was his partner and sounding board, a steady companion when he was the subject of criticism and worse. she's still a vibrant presence at age 93.\n\nrobinson was born in cairo, georgia, but raised in pasadena, california. he was a formidable athlete, lettering in four sports at ucla and leading the nation in rushing as a football player. after a short stint in baseball's negro leagues, he signed a contract with the dodgers organization and spent his first season with its montreal royals farm club. here, he crosses home plate after hitting a three-run home run on opening day 1946.\n\njackie robinson, who broke the color line in major league baseball by becoming the sport's first modern-day black player, had a rich life beyond the game. no wonder: a life, he said, is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. click through for a look at robinson's life.\n\nstory highlights jackie robinson, a sweeping documentary about the baseball star, airs monday and tuesday the film shows echoes between robinson's life and events of the present\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe story of jackie robinson isn't just the story of a pioneering baseball player.\n\nit's also, says ken burns, a story that says much about race and america – as well as the complicated man at its center.\n\nrobinson is the subject of jackie robinson, a documentary from celebrated filmmaker burns, his daughter sarah burns and her husband, david mcmahon. it airs monday and tuesday on pbs.\n\nrobinson's life paralleled, and sometimes intersected with, events in the life of the country. he was born in the jim crow south, the son of sharecroppers and the grandson of a slave. he grew up in california, the state to which so many would migrate in the coming decades.\n\nhe served in the military – and fought its discrimination. he played in new york in the 1950s when it was the capital of baseball.\n\nhe was a republican who attended the 1964 gop convention but then supported democrats as the political parties' makeup changed. he struggled with the social tumult of the 1960s, a conflict poignantly reflected in his relationship with his son, a vietnam war veteran who overcame a drug problem only to die in a car accident. he had a rich and devoted marriage to his wife, rachel, his partner and sounding board.\n\nin other words, there's a much bigger picture than the one you'll find on a baseball card.\n\nthis is a multigenerational portrait of an african-american family, burns said.\n\nhe added, in some ways, knowing the full, complex picture of jackie gives you a greater perspective on what's going on today, from trayvon martin and ferguson to the presidency and even the rollback of some of the essential liberties given to african-americans in the mid-'60s that now seem to be in jeopardy.\n\nfire and competition\n\nthere are any number of stories in jackie robinson that echo events of our time.\n\nfor example, the image of robinson entering the major leagues is of a man who kept his temper in check, engaging in the christ-like gesture of turning the other cheek, in burns' words. certainly, he was encouraged to do so by branch rickey, the dodgers executive who signed him, and robinson did largely channel his aggression into his play.\n\nbut there was a great deal of anger underneath.\n\nin one instance, as an officer stationed at fort hood, texas, during world war ii, robinson was told to go to the back of a desegregated army bus. he refused, the driver called the mps, and robinson was taken into custody. he was later booked on some trumped-up charges (though most were eventually dismissed) and court-martialed. he was acquitted, but the event left its mark.\n\nmoreover, as a black ballplayer, he was sometimes unfavorably compared with dodgers catcher roy campanella, an easygoing sort praised by the press as much as the fiery robinson was criticized. robinson was accused of being a rabble-rouser and of insolence – terms that attempted to define him as an angry black man.\n\ni think if you understand the more complicated person – the sort of driven, competitive, impatient person who was asked to (break the color line) – you have an even greater appreciation of what it must have been like to withhold his response, burns said.\n\na love story\n\nthe documentary also puts robinson's marriage to rachel at the center. rachel robinson, now 93, is revelatory: a sharp, vibrant presence and guide.\n\na really telling moment is when there's the discussion in the first episode about how smart he was in picking rachel. and i think it's really true, that (if) there's no rachel, then there's no jackie, burns said.\n\nrachel robinson wasn't just an adoring wife, burns observes. she sent back an engagement ring when she was unhappy with his behavior. she had her own job, as a nurse, and insisted that her husband stay active after his playing career ended.\n\nin their dynamic, there are parallels with another couple burns interviewed for the film: barack and michelle obama.\n\nthere's the president and first lady, another couple hurtling through time and space – seemingly a different time and space – but experiencing the same thing, burns said. as the president said, it's really good to go home when people are giving you a lot of grief, not based on substance but on the color of the skin, and have somebody who's got your back.\n\nlegacy of a 'great american'\n\nrobinson died in 1972. he was 53 years old.\n\nin the decades since, his legacy has been secured. every april 15, major league baseball celebrates jackie robinson day to honor the hall of famer. every mlb team has retired no. 42, robinson's uniform number. the jackie robinson foundation – founded by rachel – continues to award college scholarships and provide support services for worthy applicants. the movie 42 brought the story of robinson's life to a wide audience. a jackie robinson museum remains in the works.\n\nbut for all that, jackie robinson still finds new stories to tell.\n\nafter all, robinson isn't just the most important person in the history of baseball, burns said.\n\nhe was, the documentarian added, one of the great americans of all time.
london (cnn) when an american actress marries a prince, the world watches. and meghan markle , who is soon to wed britain's prince harry , is not the first.\n\non april 4, 1956, hundreds of journalists gathered at new york's waterfront to catch a glimpse of grace kelly as the oscar-winning actress boarded the ocean liner that would take her to europe -- and to the man she was engaged to marry, rainier iii, prince of monaco.\n\nit was the harbor's biggest shipside news conference in 30 years, writes robert lacey in his biography of kelly. the whole country was mesmerized.\n\nthe couple's fairy-tale wedding two weeks later was broadcast to over 30 million television viewers in europe alone, according to lacey.\n\nmore than six decades on, a similar fairy tale is mesmerizing people around the world. unlike kelly, markle will not officially become a princess, but to most, that hardly matters.\n\nlike kelly, markle is described as passionate and beautiful -- and a woman who knows what she wants.\n\nwhat else does she share with america's most famous princess bride?\n\nthe outsider\n\nmarkle, 36, is no stereotypical princess. she's american, divorced and biracial (she has an african-american mother, doria ragland, and a white father, thomas markle).\n\nshe grew up in los angeles, 2,700 miles from kelly's home city of philadelphia. but her school, immaculate heart high school, a catholic school for girls, was just a short walk from the hollywood studios that propelled kelly to stardom.\n\nboth acted from a young age and forged successful on-screen careers before crossing an ocean and entering an entirely new world.\n\nwhen grace kelly became princess grace, she put monaco on the map, says royal historian carolyn harris.\n\nmeghan is an outsider (in the royal family), and i think that's only a good thing, says anna whitelock, royal historian at royal holloway, university of london. she has a unique perspective.\n\nkelly, who was just 26 when she married her prince, reportedly struggled to feel accepted by monaco's high society, and some of its royals.\n\ngrace kelly came up against the established traditions that existed in monaco, says carolyn harris, royal historian and author of the book raising royalty.\n\nboth as a foreigner and as an actress, she found she inadvertently offended people.\n\nin contrast, harris sees britain's royals making a big effort to create a supportive atmosphere for their newest member.\n\nmarkle herself has spoken of the warm welcome she has received from prince harry's family.\n\nthe family has been great, she said in a joint interview with her fiancé , filmed and broadcast on the day they announced their engagement, adding that she was starting to feel a part of not just the institution but also part of the family.\n\nmarkle spent christmas day with the royals in 2017, unusual for someone who hasn't yet married into the family.\n\nharris attributes this difference mostly to cultural shifts.\n\nthis marriage gives a sense of just how much social and cultural change has taken place over the course of queen elizabeth's life, says harris. the royal family is now much more inclusive in terms of who can be a member.\n\nwhitelock believes markle, as an outsider, can help push that process even further -- and likens her to harry's mother, princess diana, in that regard.\n\ndiana held a mirror up to (the royal family). she forced them to change and modernize and look outwards. i think meghan will also be a force for good.\n\nthe actress\n\nprincess or actress -- take your choice, lacey writes in his biography of kelly. grace could not be both.\n\nwhile markle has not reached the same heights as kelly -- who starred in 11 movies and won an oscar for her performance in the country girl (1954) -- she has built a successful career as an actress, most notably starring as rachel zane in seven seasons of television drama suits.\n\nmarkle played paralegal rachel zane in seven seasons of suits from 2011 to 2018.\n\nbut for markle, like kelly, relinquishing that career was a step on the path to becoming a royal. while kelly reportedly seemed reluctant to wholly give up her former life and later tried to return to acting, markle has spoken positively of the shift.\n\ni don't see it as giving anything up, i just see it as a change, she said in the engagement interview. it's a new chapter.\n\nharris says markle's experience in the world of celebrity will help both her and the royal family in the transition process. she's used to being in the public eye and that's an asset for the royal family, she says.\n\nbut meghan still faces a big transition, whitelock says. she comes from a very different world -- a world of hollywood and celebrity and acting, she says. there will need to be a pivot on her part from promotion of meghan markle to promotion of the monarchy and the royal family.\n\nkelly's performance in the country girl won her an oscar for best actress in 1955.\n\nlacey's book suggests kelly found that process a challenge. and, as markle has also remarked, a headline-making career as an actress does not prepare a person for the scrutiny and press attention faced by a princess.\n\nas naïve as it sounds now, i did not have any understanding of just what it would be like, markle said in november, adding with a nod to her fiancé: i don't think either of us did.\n\nas harry's wife, meghan will never be off the press radar -- especially if the couple start a family, as they say they intend to. they will have to try to strike a balance between public and private, says harris. there will be tremendous public fascination if they have children.\n\nthe feminist\n\ntalking to lacey, actress rita gram described kelly as one of the first independent women in america... she left her home, she earned her own living, she made the bed.\n\nthe biography tells of a woman who sought to be self-sufficient and self-determining, a daunting prospect in 1950s america. while many battles for female independence have since been fought and (largely) won, markle shows a similar disinclination to bow to patriarchal norms.\n\nshe's a mature, very independent, very articulate woman, says whitelock, who notes that markle spoke more than her fiancé in their engagement interview and showed great self-assurance. it's a partnership of equals.\n\nmarkle seems to have a strong sense of self, says harris.\n\nmarkle has also been a vocal advocate for gender equality since childhood and in february declared her intention to hit the ground running with her work to empower girls and women across the uk.\n\nindeed, with the passage of 60 years and the accompanying cultural shifts, princess meghan finds herself with far more freedom than princess grace, both as an individual woman and in her female advocacy projects.\n\nof course, kelly was marrying the monarch, while markle will be wife to a man who is unlikely ever to be king (harry is sixth in line to the throne). markle can speak, dress and act more freely than her philadelphian counterpart.\n\ngrace saw her royal duty as being the model corporate wife to her husband, wrote lacey. and later: she was very good at smiling, at being dignified and stylish... but that, grace now knew, was just about all that being a princess had to offer.\n\nprincess grace of monaco and prince rainier iii of monaco meet the media during a trip to atlantic city, five months after their wedding.\n\nwhile markle will have scope to be far more than her husband's accessory, she does also face a raft of unavoidable new restrictions and protocols. her entire life will be scheduled well in advance, says harris. that reduces the scope for spontaneity.\n\nand what markle can say -- and where -- is now much more limited. her days of winning fans by documenting her life on a blog are over, whitelock observes, adding that the act of closing down her lifestyle website the tig last year is indicative of a bigger closing down.\n\nthe humanitarian\n\nlacey recounts how kelly threw herself into charitable work in the years after her wedding, making frequent visits to monaco's orphanages, hospitals and homes for the elderly, becoming president of monaco's red cross and founding a charity that lobbied for the rights of children.\n\nfor decades, royals across the world have used their unique position to shine a spotlight on particular causes -- and the uk's young royals are no different. it's a role markle is well prepared for.\n\nin 2016 she became a global ambassador for world vision and traveled to rwanda to see the impact of the charity's clean-water initiatives. a year earlier, she was named the un women's advocate for political participation and leadership.\n\nwhitelock believes markle is showing the right character for charitable work too. she's shown a real sense of ease with people. she doesn't have the kind of stuffiness or the nervousness of the other royals on their early outings... she will reach out to people.\n\nmarkle clearly connects with people, says whitelock. on this occasion, she was meeting members of the public during a trip to northern ireland with prince harry.\n\nand while kelly seemed to do most of her charitable work alone, harry and meghan are clearly planning a joint assault on the world's problems.\n\nit was really one of the first things we connected on, markle recalled in the engagement interview. one of the first things we started talking about when we met was just the different things we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.\n\nthat's what got date two in the books, she added, smiling.\n\nand since date two, back in july 2016, the pair have had a lot of time to get to know each other, to become the fantastic team harry says they are, and for meghan to acclimatize to the reality of her new role.\n\nmarkle is entering this open-eyed, says whitelock. she's coming to this as a very well-equipped princess.
(cnn) the shocking invasion of the us capitol by a mob of supporters of us president donald trump is proof that the anger and frustration that divides america politically has reached a boiling point.\n\nwhile only a radical few may condone violence, disappointment and animosity over the outcome of the election -- fueled by false tales of election fraud -- is widespread among trump supporters.\n\nthat bitterness could threaten relationships with family, friends, colleagues and loved ones, as many find themselves on opposite sides of a seemingly unbridgeable ideological chasm.\n\nisn't there a way to communicate that allows both sides to be heard without further tearing these relationships apart?\n\ncnn put that question to experts before the november presidential election. the answer: absolutely. here are 10 suggestions on how to de-escalate angry conversations and begin to bridge the gap.\n\nask yourself: why am i doing this?\n\nit's important to know why you want to reach out.\n\nin terms of deciding whether or not you want to have a conversation with somebody across political lines, it is important to be aware of what your own motivations are, said tania israel, author of  beyond your bubble: how to connect across the political divide: skills and strategies for conversations that work .\n\nif your goal is to change the other person's mind in one conversation, you're going to be really disappointed, because you're not likely to be that effective, cautioned vaile wright, american psychological association's senior director of health care innovation.\n\nit can help to keep your relationship with that other person top of mind, suggests jacksonville, florida, clinical psychologist nina silander, who has written about the lack of conservative views in the field of psychology\n\nthink about why it is you care about this person or why you like them or appreciate them, silander said. that can soften your response and help you better articulate your perspective and lend credence to their viewpoint.\n\ndealing with 'fake facts'\n\nyou may find it difficult to acknowledge a perspective that you know to be based on disinformation. entrenched views among certain age groups have become more common as people share exaggerated or falsified news via social media.\n\nlists of fake news sites are available, such as this one by snopes or this tip sheet from melissa zimdars, an associate professor at merrimack college in massachusetts, but shoving those in front of your friend or relative isn't likely to elicit a positive response.\n\ninstead, try to approach the issue by acknowledging the emotions of the person who has chosen to believe fake news, even as you gently discuss the facts.\n\nit's clear that we need healthy and productive ways to engage across different opinions, but we should never have to accept false information. we can and should challenge non-factual statements. as we approach these engagements, it is more productive to not challenge each other's emotional reaction to a situation, said caroline hopper, managing director of the citizenship & american identity program at the aspen institute, which oversees the better arguments project along with the allstate corporation and educational nonprofit facing history and ourselves\n\nthe better arguments project wants to teach us how to have more productive arguments. these conversations don't have to drive us apart, the group says. in fact, by learning to argue better, we can come together.\n\nwe need to be interacting within a realm of fact, but we also need to leave room for human emotion, feelings like hope and fear, which we know can absolutely steer discourse in this country just as much as facts can, hopper added.\n\nfor example, a person should not challenge someone telling them: 'i am upset about the outcome of this election because it makes me feel afraid.' rather, we should seek to understand more about why that opinion is held.\n\ntry curiosity first\n\nto de-escalate ill will, avoid approaching the exchange with a list of talking points or facts in mind, experts suggest. instead, you want to ask questions and truly understand the response.\n\nthe most important thing you can do is to listen to the other person, advised israel, a professor in the department of counseling, clinical and school psychology at the university of california, santa barbara.\n\nto do that, enter the conversation with simple curiosity, she advised.\n\nbeing curious about where they're coming from and trying to understand where they're coming from helps set people's expectations (about the outcome of the talk) more appropriately, israel said.\n\nbe prepared to listen, not talk\n\nto do that, you may have to learn and practice some new (or rusty) skills, the type taught in marriage counseling, for example.\n\nrepeating back what you think you heard and asking questions are techniques known to elicit clarifications, as your loved one realizes either they misspoke or you misunderstood.\n\nminimizing misunderstanding is incredibly important -- repeating back what we think we've heard, asking questions to clarify, looking and really striving for opportunities to share and find common ground can go a long way, silander said.\n\nit helps you to really listen if you know that you're going to need to summarize, israel added. it's also going to help them to feel more understood, and that's going to help to create that connection and keep the entire conversation on a calmer level.\n\ngo a step further and acknowledge the other position, silander suggests.\n\ntrying to understand someone else's position, or trying to see the world through their eyes is what we call in developmental psychology, 'theory of mind.' it's something we learn to do between four and five years of age -- understanding that other people can see things differently, silander said.\n\nusing i statements instead of you statements is another important way to facilitate dialogue, wright said.\n\nusing i statements to express how you feel may foster communication with someone with opposing political views.\n\nfor example, you could say 'i have a lot of concerns about this election, and how it might affect health care because i have a preexisting condition.' keep it about you and your feelings and about the policies, not the people, wright added.\n\nexperts cnn spoke to point out that these skills not only will help better our dialogue across political lines, but in our daily lives as well.\n\nthey're also going to help us to be better parents, better partners, better community members and coworkers, wright said.\n\nbeware the minefield of human nature\n\nexpect to feel an emotional flare-up when you hear things you don't like. it's part of being human, an ancient and automatic reaction to any perceived threat to our well-being.\n\nit turns out that our bodies don't necessarily know the difference between the saber-toothed tiger and a shocking news event or a heated conversation with another person, israel said.\n\nour sympathetic nervous system goes into action when we perceive a threat, flooding the body with adrenaline and other stress hormones. key signs of that reaction can be a racing heart, tense muscles, even a flushed face.\n\nwe are ready to fight or to run away from the threat, israel said.\n\nsuch reactions to politics can even harm our health, research has found.\n\nthe hospitalization rate for heart attack and stroke in a major california health system was 1.62 times higher in the two days immediately after the 2016 presidential election than the same two days the week before, a study released in late october said.\n\nthis is a wake-up call, said study author david williams, chair of the department of social and behavioral sciences and a professor at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, in a statement.\n\nwe need to pay greater attention to the ways in which stress linked to political campaigns, rhetoric and election outcomes can directly harm health.\n\nground yourself\n\nit's possible to interrupt our natural tendency to become stressed and anxious by using grounding techniques as soon as we feel ourselves tensing, psychologists say.\n\n'we can do deep breathing, israel said. we can physically ground ourselves by noticing the feeling of the chair underneath us or by touching our own arm and paying attention to that.\n\nset yourself up for success by making sure you're in top mental shape for the conversation, wright suggests.\n\nit's not great to have these conversations at the end of a long, hard day, or when people have been drinking or a situation where you're not as emotionally in control as as you'd like to be, she warned.\n\nbeware of tribal urges\n\nit's natural for people to want to be in groups with similar viewpoints, or to find our tribe, experts say.\n\nduring an election year, we can become rather tribal, and that can be inflamed by media, it can be flamed by special interest groups, and it caters to our own human nature, silander said.\n\nthe people media choose for spokespeople usually are more extreme in their views, but it's also our basic psychology that we tend to have these distorted perceptions of people who we see as being different from ourselves, israel said.\n\nthis instinctual feeling of us versus them intensifies with divisive rhetoric, wright said, which can lead us to label people in ways that make it difficult to find common ground.\n\nit isn't just that you and i have differences on how the educational system should run, wright said. it becomes 'you don't care about teachers, you don't care about kids.' it becomes not about the issue, but about you as a person and your values.\n\ntry to find common ground\n\nto combat that, silander suggests learning about the fundamental value differences between liberals and conservatives in an objective and considerate way.\n\nit really enables us to better understand and empathize with one another, silander said. and we can start to see that maybe we often share concerns that are more similar in nature than we would have thought, even if we disagree with what solutions to those concerns would look like.\n\nas an example, silander points to civil rights issues as a way for liberals to try to understand why some conservatives believe mandates to wear masks are an infringement on personal liberties.\n\nthe underlying theme or principle can at least be one way to relate even if we disagree, she said.\n\njoin a group and practice\n\npractice makes perfect, as they say. over the last four years, groups of people dedicated to bringing political opposites together have sprung up around the country.\n\njoining a training -- such as those offered by the better arguments project -- can jump-start your skills for that all-important talk with a loved one.\n\nthe concept of a better argument is really all about caring more about one another than we do about our opinion on a specific subject, hopper said.\n\nif we politely ignore our differences -- especially with those closest to us -- we are giving up our public discourse, our family discourse, to the voices that are the most polarized, she said.\n\nwe're not going to be able to seek any kind of informed solutions together because we're not getting the full scope of information that we need, she added.\n\nbe human first\n\nto have a better argument, one has to care about the other person, not just their opinion about the issue.\n\nwe ask participants to 'be human first.' what we mean by that is you shouldn't only engage with each other about your opinions; share more about yourself and seek to learn more about the person with whom you are engaging, hopper said.\n\nget cnn health's weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr. sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team.\n\notherwise, you will only see one another only as opponents, rather than as people representing very full lives and experiences that are shaping those opinions, she said. the priority is to walk away from that interaction caring more about that other person than about whether or not you won that argument -- be human first.\n\nthis also means that you have a right to expect that your own humanity should be acknowledged and respected. there is no room for hate and bigotry in a 'better argument.'\n\nthis story is updated from a story that originally published on november 4, 2020.
(cnn) -- polygamist sect leader warren steed jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from arizona in two separate cases, authorities said thursday.\n\npolygamist warren jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor.\n\na grand jury indicted jeffs may 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by mohave county attorney matthew j. smith.\n\non thursday, another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest. those offenses took place in colorado city, arizona, in 2003, according to the indictment.\n\nboth indictments state that jeffs, leader of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (flds), committed the offenses as an accomplice.\n\naccording to arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison. incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2½ years in prison.\n\nthe cases involve two separate victims, smith said in the statement. mr. jeffs will not come to mohave county to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his utah case is resolved.\n\njeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in washington county, utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.\n\nthe trial initially was set to begin in april, but fifth district judge james shumate postponed it earlier this year, and a new date has not been set. at the time, shumate said the delay was due to recent information in the case, but he did not elaborate.\n\nthe judge in march refused a defense request to move the trial out of washington county because of press coverage, but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection.\n\nutah prosecutors say that because jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because jeffs insisted she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape.\n\nduring his preliminary hearing in december, jeffs' defense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and, if it was, whether the sex was consensual.\n\nthe girl, identified only as jane doe, testified at the preliminary hearing that she was so scared during the forced wedding.\n\nthe whole time i was crying, she said. i wanted to die.\n\nthe rape as an accomplice charge is a first-degree felony in utah, carrying a penalty upon conviction of five years to life in prison.\n\njeffs previously was charged in arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy.\n\nthose charges, from 2005, were put on hold while jeffs faces trial in utah.\n\njeffs was captured august 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near las vegas, nevada. at the time, he had been on the fbi's 10 most wanted list for months.\n\nthe flds freely practices polygamy in the towns of hildale, utah, and colorado city, arizona, which straddle the state line. the sect maintains groups of followers in texas, south dakota, nevada, british columbia and mexico.\n\nthe offshoot sect broke from the mainline church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, based in salt lake city, utah, over the practice of polygamy.\n\nthe mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to jeffs' group. e-mail to a friend\n\nall about fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints

(photo by frederic j. brown / afp) (photo credit should read frederic j. brown/afp via getty images)\n\n'those at the top are not doing their part:' wh looks to raise taxes on wealthy\n\neditor's note: joey jackson is a criminal defense attorney and a legal analyst for cnn and hln. the views expressed here are solely his.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nrobert wagner, the actor and husband of the late actress natalie wood, has been dubbed a person of interest in her death. an investigator for the los angeles sheriff's department made this claim in an interview on cbs's 48 hours, as part of a special titled natalie wood: death and dark water. in a press conference monday afternoon, the los angeles sheriff's department outlined their suspicions about the facts and evidence, and asked the public for help. this is laudable, as they are still making efforts after almost 37 years to crack the case. however, there is no smoking gun.\n\ni give a tremendous amount of credit to the show's producers for trying to untangle the mystery surrounding natalie wood's death. they put forth various facts and information that were both compelling and engaging that may well lead the viewer to conclude that robert wagner is responsible for wood's death. this includes an alleged domestic incident between wagner and wood prior to being on the boat and an alleged argument between them the night of her death. that said, we are no more certain about what actually happened to her than we were in 1981.\n\nit should be noted that a person of interest designation is merely the tag ascribed to an individual who is under investigation by police, and is being looked at very closely. it falls short of officially being named a suspect or an actual defendant, who is the person being directly accused of committing the crime.\n\nwas it a shocking, unfortunate, and tragic accident? or was it something more sinister – like murder? that's what investigators are endeavoring to determine some 37 years after the fact.\n\nit was november 29, 1981, when the beautiful and talented actress, then 43, went missing from her family yacht, the splendour, off california's santa catalina island. her body was found a short time later floating only a mile away in the pacific. a spokeswoman for the los angeles sheriff's department issued a statement thursday night that wagner is now a person of interest because new witnesses have provided statements that portray a new sequence of events on the boat that night.\n\nrumors swirled at the time about how it happened, why it happened, and whether someone — other than wood – might be responsible for her demise. the focus immediately turned to her husband, then-51-year-old actor robert wagner, with whom she was married twice. the first marriage, in 1957, lasted only five years — while their second marriage, which began in 1972, appeared solid and loving, at least until her untimely death.\n\nan investigation ensued but was closed only two weeks later, when the coroner, thomas t. noguchi, found that wood slipped and subsequently drowned.\n\nat the time she went missing, there were only three other people on the yacht – her husband, wagner; fellow actor christopher walken; and yacht captain dennis davern. all three were interviewed and told investigators what they knew. though suspicion and speculation continued, there was no basis to conclude that wood's death was anything other than an accident.\n\nwagner initially gave his rendition of events to investigators when the incident occurred. he has denied any involvement in wood's death.\n\nfast forward 30 years to 2011.\n\nwhen the case was reopened in 2011, wagner's publicist issued a statement saying that wagner's family trusted that the la sheriff's department would evaluate whether any new information relating to the death of natalie wood wagner is valid, and that it comes from a credible source or sources other than those simply trying to profit from the 30-year anniversary of her tragic death.\n\nto date, they have not arrested wagner – though los angeles county sheriff's department lt. john corina told 48 hours that i think he's constantly changed his story a little bit. and his version of events just don't add up. investigators are also placing reliance on davern, who admitted in 2011 in an interview on nbc's today show that he lied during the initial investigation. his new story has been that there was a fight on the boat that somehow resulted in wood's death. when asked why he was coming forward after, at the time, 30 years, he said i've been trying to tell information about this for many, many years, but there wasn't really anyone listening until now.\n\nfor those wondering how this case could potentially be prosecuted now, remember, there is no statute of limitations on murder – the state can pursue a case at any time. but no matter how many years later such a case may be presented, the evidentiary rules remain the same: first, it would be necessary to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. that is, speculation, innuendo, and shifting hypotheses just won't do. second, although the state never would have to prove motive, inquiring minds always want to know. a jury would wonder why a man who married a woman twice would want her dead. and if authorities haven't been able to answer that question for nearly 40 years, it's unlikely a compelling reason will magically surface now.\n\nthird, juries like to hear credible evidence. and while davern changed his story 30 years later, during the 2011 investigation to point to nefarious conduct, he would open himself up to a bevy of questions by skilled defense attorneys: were you lying then, or are you lying now?\n\nand by the way, how many times have you been interviewed in the last 30-plus years? do any of those stories match the one you're deciding to reveal now?\n\ni can't imagine that the former captain's answers to these questions would be too persuasive. the other problem with the captain's story is that he sold information to tabloids and co-wrote a book about wood's death. but now, he claims he wants to clear his conscience. nevertheless, his credibility issues would most certainly doom any potential prosecution against wagner – no matter what the los angeles detectives might hope to the contrary.\n\nthe cbs special made for great tv, and the press conference appears to have certainly been held with the best of intentions. that said, the only thing clear to me is that the police are no further along in solving this case than they were in 1981. back then, they closed it after just two weeks citing an accidental drowning as the cause of death. without more, they should do likewise now.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nand as to wagner, he's simply not talking. there's something called the fifth amendment that gives him the absolute right to remain silent – lest he incriminate himself. while investigators might not like it, and even deem it suspicious, no jury will ever be permitted to infer that his silence equates with guilt. in fact, a judge will specially instruct the jury not to do so. so while investigators may be upset, and the public may look at wagner cross-eyed, his silence is the most appropriate legal course of action to take and can't be used against him.\n\nhere's the most pertinent fact that i can direct a reader to remember: hollywood theories and courtroom convictions are about as far apart as the conflicting stories davern told investigators in 1981 and in 2011.\n\nand so while any murder may be prosecuted at any time, i doubt the case of natalie wood's death will see a courtroom anytime soon. and in the unlikely event that it does, reasonable doubt will rule the day.
(cnn) internal rifts in both political parties are threatening to derail an effort to renew a set of powerful surveillance tools prized by law enforcement ahead of their expiration next month.\n\nwhite house officials are aligning with gop rep. jim jordan of ohio against attorney general bill barr and senate judiciary chairman lindsey graham, a south carolina republican, over the best legislative strategy to renew the authorities. divisions among house democrats caused an abrupt decision to scrap a key committee vote on wednesday. and a number of influential democrats, including house judiciary chairman jerry nadler, stiffened their opposition to barr's and graham's call for a quick extension of the authorities to avoid a lapse in the surveillance law.\n\nthe growing divisions over both the policy and the legislative strategy are raising the prospects that congress might not reach a deal by a critical march 15 deadline when the authorities are set to expire.\n\njordan, after meeting with white house officials on wednesday about the matter, told cnn that he differed with barr's strategy of a straight extension, arguing changes must be made now to the law.\n\ni think barr has done a great job as attorney general, but i don't think we can do a clean reauthorization, jordan said.\n\nat issue is a trio of expiring authorities of the foreign intelligence surveillance act , or fisa, that have been caught in a proxy fight over the future of the wider national security wiretap program in the wake of cutting criticism from the justice department's inspector general over the bureau's use of fisa in the russia investigation. the house judiciary committee had been set to hold a hearing wednesday afternoon to review legislation that would extend the authorization of some of the expiring provisions while also adding in limited reforms, but the hearing was canceled after a last-minute move by a democratic lawmaker to propose more radical changes.\n\nthis week senate republicans seemed to be coalescing around their own strategy -- a clean reauthorization of the provisions followed by broader reform down the line -- further complicating the environment in which lawmakers are acting.\n\npartisans on both sides of the aisle had dug into their opposition of the bill ahead of the house judiciary committee hearing. rep. zoe lofgren , a democrat from california, had said she wanted to add amendments to the legislation that would inject more civil liberties protections, and georgia rep. doug collins , the committee's top republican, had said on tuesday that the proposal failed to protect american citizens -- including future presidents and presidential campaigns -- from unlawful spying.\n\nafter the committee vote was postponed, collins slammed the democrats in a statement for stall tactics.\n\ndemocrats are yet again putting our national security at risk with their stall tactics, collins said. critical counterterrorism provisions are hanging in the balance because democrats chose to delay an already ill-timed markup.\n\ncollins and jordan are among a group of house republicans who have clamored for even more sweeping changes to the broader fisa system after the justice department inspector general reported in december that the fbi had made a series of errors as they sought to wiretap carter page , a former trump campaign adviser.\n\nreform of the secretive surveillance court where national security officials obtain wiretaps in terrorism and espionage cases has long been a goal of civil liberties groups like the aclu. the addition of conservative lawmakers inspired by the inspector general report and the president's criticism of the fbi has created an unusual marriage amid the current debate.\n\nthe surveillance bill that had been set to be marked up before the house judiciary committee wednesday afternoon had been crafted over months of careful negotiation with the judiciary and intelligence committees, house leadership and outside civil liberties groups like the aclu, but was scrapped at the last minute after lofgren said she planned to introduce a group of amendments that were seen as making the legislation's eventual passage untenable, a committee aide said.\n\nthe committee aide said lofgren's office had been included early on as the bill was being written, but after this report was published wednesday, lofgren denied that in an interview, saying her office had not been part of the negotiation process, had only been shown the text of the bill earlier this month and had expressed around that time that they were interested in making amendments.\n\nsome of the reform provisions from a bipartisan reauthorization bill lofgren had co-sponsored in january were included in the bill eventually put forward by the judiciary committee, though lofgren had wanted deeper reform, like the expansion of the role of an outside attorney to challenge the government's evidence before the fisa court.\n\nthey're simple things to protect the civil rights of americans. there's no poison pill in there. if the constitution is a poison pill we've got bigger problems, lofgren said.\n\ntuesday afternoon, lofgren told committee leadership that she would be introducing the amendments, the aide said. nadler decided to scrap the markup wednesday afternoon after consulting with house speaker nancy pelosi and rep. adam schiff, a california democrat who leads the intelligence committee, the aide said.\n\nthe republican fracture on the issue appears to have reached the white house, where influential factions have been pushing the divergent strategies. a number of house conservatives met earlier wednesday with jared kushner and white house counsel pat cipollone on the fisa fight, two sources familiar with the situation told cnn.\n\nafter the meeting, jordan, who's close to the president and set to take over gop leadership of the house judiciary committee with collins running for the senate , told cnn that he didn't support simply passing a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions and saving the structural reform for a future date.\n\n(doj inspector general michael) horowitz just told us that (the fbi) lied to the fisa court 17 times -- 51 mistakes that they made in the whole process, 17 misstatements, omissions, better known as lies, in the carter page fisa, jordan said. so we have to reform. there are some good reforms i think we can do.\n\nschiff is also resisting a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions, according to a committee official.\n\nno, nadler said wednesday when asked if he would back a straight extension of the three expiring provisions.\n\namong the committee's rank-and-file members, feelings about the bill were even further mixed.\n\nrep. pramila jayapal, a washington state democrat, suggested in an interview that she would be fine with letting the three fisa provisions lapse, though she added the committee was working to find an agreement with significant reforms that would make it palatable to a wider group of lawmakers.\n\ni'm one of those individuals probably that reflects concerns that society has, which is privacy, how much power do we give government and at what expense do we have additional security, said rep. lou correa, a california democrat who sits on the committee and was supportive of changes to the bill that was set to be voted on during the wednesday meeting.\n\non tuesday, barr was on the hill to lobby for his own plan for the surveillance reform. in a closed-door meeting, barr urged gop senators to extend the expiring provisions while he takes steps within the justice department to begin reforming elements of the law administratively, according to several senators and a senior justice department official.\n\nbarr also indicated that congress could work on broader reforms to be enacted at a later time, and said he supported the effort by graham to hold hearings on the issue in future weeks, the senators said.\n\nbarr told the lawmakers that his approach had the support of the national security council, the intelligence community and the fbi, although he acknowledged that there are differing opinions within the white house, including at the domestic policy council, the doj official said.\n\non wednesday, republican sen. john cornyn of texas warned nadler that it would be a mistake to block a clean extension of the expiring provisions.\n\ni don't know if he wants to be responsible for the expiration of some essential tools for anti-terrorism investigations, said cornyn, a member of the senate intelligence and judiciary committees. i would be surprised if he wants to bare that responsibility but i think that's where we are right now.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments including comments from rep. zoe lofgren.
two women in northeastern nepal on their way to see doctors, on may 14, 2015, after earthquakes killed over 8,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless .\n\nstory highlights child trafficking often increases after natural disasters such as earthquakes the disruption of institutions means the usual child protection systems aren't in place, writes anna childs exploitation of trafficked children can take many forms -- forced prostitution, labor, marriage, militia and more\n\neditor's note: anna childs is academic director for international development at the open university. the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. cnn is showcasing the work of the conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. the content is produced solely by the conversation.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nwhen a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck nepal in april 2015, it killed well over 8,000 people and turned much of the country into a disaster zone.\n\n17 days later, as recovery operations were getting established, a 7.3 magnitude quake caused further destruction.\n\nin the desolation, chaos and widespread panic that followed, a surge in child trafficking was inevitable. just as it was after the 2004 tsunami in southern asia, the 2010 earthquake in haiti, the 2011 drought in horn of africa, the 2013 typhoon in the philippines, and many other natural disasters besides.\n\nso why do these disasters make children so vulnerable to trafficking – and what can be done about it?\n\nunicef defines child trafficking as the act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation either within or outside a country.\n\nthe exploitation of trafficked children can take many forms – forced prostitution, labor, marriage, militia, domestic servitude and more – but nearly always means dirty and dangerous work for little or no pay, often involving sexual abuse and enforcement through threat and violence.\n\naccording to the u.n. office on drugs and crime (unodc), the most common form of human trafficking (79%) is trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation.\n\nit's difficult to get accurate and current statistics on trafficking because generally only those survivors who are identified and rescued can be counted, and there is no single monitoring organization.\n\nphoto: noel celis/afp/afp/getty images children swim on a flooded street in manila on september 23, 2013, after monsoon rains and typhoon usagi caused floods and landslides.\n\nin 2001 the international labour organization estimated that worldwide there are some 2.5 million people who have been trafficked. the unodc suggests that an average 20% of these are children, with a much higher fraction in many developing countries and regions.\n\npoverty plus disaster\n\nin nepal, as in other developing countries, birth registration is poorly enforced, making children difficult or impossible to track in any system.\n\npeople living with poverty are especially vulnerable to the false promise of a better future, and in an economy that depends heavily on dividends from migrating workers, desperation can lead people to consider risky opportunities.\n\nfamilies are often enticed by the offer of well-paid work for their child in another region or country.\n\nthey may even be given an advance against the child's anticipated earnings, and trafficked children hope to improve their lives and send money back to their families. but when they arrive at their destination, they find that the situation is very different.\n\nin most poor societies, it's the girls who are more readily taken out of school (or never sent in the first place). parents may believe that education is wasted on a girl whose destiny is to marry and leave home.\n\nthat leaves them open to persuasion that the opportunity to go away and gain life experience is in their daughter's best interests. girls – especially those with disabilities or from ethnic minorities or certain castes – are therefore particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\n\na 2001 estimate suggested that 12,000 girls are trafficked from nepal to india annually for prostitution, a horror highlighted in the book and movie sold.\n\nthis number took no account of any other trafficking from or within nepal. current estimates put the annual total at around 20,000.\n\nvulnerability amplified\n\nit's easy to see how a natural disaster can amplify the conditions that enable and attract traffickers. the immediate disruption of state and civil society institutions, particularly schools, means the usual child protection systems aren't in place. regulatory mechanisms and border controls are also in chaos.\n\nunder the cover of rescue efforts, traffickers (often women) can pose as religious leaders, relief workers or representatives of government-accredited employment agencies promising jobs. sometimes these tricks are mere opportunism, but sometimes they are the well-organized work of national and transnational criminal groups.\n\nphoto: handout/getty images south america/getty images a mother shelters her children from the sun in a tent city in the commune of cite soleil after the earthquake in haiti in 2010.\n\nthe people they exploit are extremely vulnerable. with family breadwinners killed or injured, land and livelihoods destroyed and food and shelter hard to come by, people are more inclined than ever to take desperate actions.\n\nchildren separated from their families may be believed missing or dead. the assumption, genuine or otherwise, that a child is an orphan makes them especially vulnerable. sadly some families even send their children to orphanages because they can't afford to care for them.\n\nthese orphans may be trafficked directly or otherwise subjected to illegal adoption, sold to well-intentioned families from richer nations.\n\nthis typical story from nepal tells of seven children who have disappeared from a small village. their parents believed they were sending them to a buddhist monastery in india:\n\nwe had to lie to police so that my son could leave the village with the lamas, said a parent of one of the children. we are happy because the lamas had promised to educate my son and send him home after three years.\n\nnone of these children have been heard of since their departure shortly after the quakes, and their location remains unknown.\n\nwhat can be done?\n\nless than two months after the nepal quakes, unicef reported that 245 children had been intercepted and saved from trafficking. that number has shocking implications for how many might not have been so lucky. dr tshering lama of childreach nepal recently estimated that hundreds if not thousands of children will have been trafficked as a direct result of conditions caused by the earthquakes.\n\nin the direct aftermath, unicef worked in collaboration with the nepali government on a range of responsive and preventative measures, and with civil society and a number of national and international ngos to prioritize getting children back into school as quickly as possible.\n\na fundamental strategy to fighting child trafficking in nepal is to keep children in schools, protecting their right to education and a safe environment.\n\ncampaigns such as taught not trafficked, working in partnership with survivors' group shakti samuha, promote crucial awareness and have been providing education, shelter, legal aid, vocational training and counseling before, during and after the period of the quakes.\n\nbut more than that, it's essential that child trafficking everywhere is not treated as a symptom of crisis during times of natural disasters.\n\nit must be recognized as a scourge that requires coordinated international action, including advocacy and awareness integrated across all programs that work with vulnerable children and their families and communities. in this way, agencies will be prepared to respond quickly and effectively when – not if – the next disaster strikes.
(cnn) a jewish shopkeeper standing proudly outside his store, a wry smile on his face and an iron cross pinned to his lapel.\n\njust a meter away is a nazi guard.\n\nit is an notorious image of the nazi era, replicated in museums and institutions across germany.\n\nuntil now little was known about the man photographed outside his cologne bedding store on april 1, 1933 -- the day the nazis launched a boycott of jewish businesses.\n\nthe boycott saw guards stand outside jewish shops in a bid to deter customers from entering. many stores were subsequently vandalized.\n\nas many countries around the world commemorate holocaust memorial day on monday, the incredible story of one jewish shopkeeper, whose defiant picture has been shown around the globe, has been uncovered by researchers at genealogy site myheritage\n\nhis name was richard stern.\n\nif you look closely it seems the nazi party agent feels uncomfortable, eike stegen, a historian at the house of the wannsee conference, told cnn.\n\nyou realize that he is wearing a fantasy uniform -- he has never been to war, while the soldier in the picture is the jewish german who is proudly showing his iron cross.\n\nthe power is with the soldier from the first world war.\n\nthe iron cross, once a military decoration, was considered a top honor in germany during both world wars.\n\nstern's fight against his oppressors went even further than this image. he would later receive another award for his outstanding military contribution -- this time from the us army in world war ii.\n\nrichard stern earned the prestigious iron cross for his distinguished service during world war i.\n\nthe photo of defiance\n\nresearchers at myheritage uncovered a wealth of information about the german jew who earned the prestigious iron cross for his distinguished service during world war i.\n\nthey sifted through hundreds of online documents to uncover his incredible story.\n\nresearcher nitay elboym told cnn that he and his team became interested in the 1933 photo after seeing the image online and learning that it hangs in the house of the wannsee conference, at which the nazis devised the final solution, which the nazis used to describe their genocide of jews in europe.\n\nit's his body language that got our attention, elboym said. not only is he standing there with the iron cross on, but the look on his face says 'i was a german hero in world war one, i'm wearing the medal that you gave me, so how dare you do this?'\n\njack romberg, a florida-based rabbi, is the grandson of stern's sister martha.\n\nthe eldest of three brothers, romberg recalls his quiet relative with affection. now retired, the 65-year-old is writing a book about his great uncle, whom he says was more like his grandfather.\n\nromberg was able to shed light on the 1933 photo, which is also on display at berlin's jewish museum as well as the city's german historical museum, the ns documentation center in cologne and the nearby roonstrasse synagogue.\n\nat wannsee and the jewish museum in berlin, the picture is displayed alongside a pamphlet written by stern.\n\njust watched drone video shows scale of auschwitz camp replay more videos ... must watch drone video shows scale of auschwitz camp 01:12\n\naccording to romberg, stern's brother-in-law heinz flögerhöver produced the leaflets in his print shop next door, distributed them to passers-by and took the photo. the shop was forced to close following kristallnacht in 1938. this rampage of state-sponsored violence by the nazi regime against jewish communities caused widespread looting and destruction of jewish properties across germany and austria.\n\naddressed to all front comrades and germans, the document states that hitler and the nazis repeatedly declared: anyone insulting a combat veteran is punishable by imprisonment!\n\nstern said in the pamphlet that he had enlisted as a teenager and served during world war i.\n\nhis brother and father also served. taking a stand against the boycott, he wrote: has the german jew become a second class human, only tolerated as a guest in his fatherland?\n\nwe see this action against german judaism as an insult to the memory of 12,000 german combat soldiers of the jewish faith killed in action.\n\nin 2012, romberg visited the jewish museum in berlin and was taken aback by what he saw.\n\ntheir version of the photo is huge and the picture of the leaflet is very close. i stood there and i couldn't stop staring at it even though the same picture hangs in my office. i couldn't say anything -- it was unbelievable.\n\non his most recent visit to germany in september, romberg met with archivists at the various museums and institutions.\n\nthey were shocked that they'd met a living relative of richard stern -- it blew them away, he said.\n\nstegen told cnn that stern's image features in the house of the wannsee conference's permanent exhibition, the meeting at wannsee and the murder of the european jews.\n\nthat is why we portray richard stern. he does not 'simply' suffer from persecution, he is not merely a victim of discrimination, hatred, racism, but he acts, stegen said.\n\ntwo world war medals, given either side of the atlantic\n\nrecords unearthed by myheritage show that stern left germany and arrived at ellis island, new york, aged 40 in may 1939 -- just four months before war broke out. it stated that the first person he met up with in the us was his brother-in-law ludwig walker.\n\nthe research carried out by myheritage did not uncover a wife or children. romberg explained that the reason was because in 1927 stern had promised his dying father that he would look after his sister martha, whose marriage had broken down, and her son rudolf.\n\nstern became the boy's legal guardian and worked to guarantee their safe passage to america, together with his own. but problems with martha's paperwork delayed their escape until the very end of august -- just days before war broke out.\n\na census the following year revealed that stern was working as a bus boy and lived in queens with two of his sisters, walker, a niece and a nephew.\n\non october 13, 1942 -- less than a year after america joined the war -- stern enlisted in the us army.\n\nthen on october 13, 1942 -- less than a year after america joined the war -- stern enlisted in the us army.\n\nhe was aged 43 and still not a citizen.\n\nscott daubert, director of the national infantry museum in columbus, georgia, told cnn that a german national being recruited by the us at the time would have been quite rare but that soldiers were sometimes recruited for their language skills.\n\nbeing a non-citizen and german would have certainly raised an eyebrow or two, but there would have been many questions early on in the training stage to gauge loyalty, daubert said.\n\nin 1944 stern was awarded the silver star, which is the third-highest military combat decoration that can be awarded to a member of the us armed forces.\n\nmyheritage researchers discovered a newspaper clipping from july 6, 1944, detailing stern's service in italy.\n\nthe long island star-journal reported: the victim of german brutality, 45-year-old sergeant richard f. stern, earned the silver star for gallantry in action during an assault jan. 7 on the slopes of mount porchio when in the face of heavy enemy fire he addressed the germans in their own tongue and demanded that they surrender, convincing them they were hopelessly outnumbered.\n\ntoday, the medal holds pride of place in romberg's home, alongside a treasure trove of documents and letters from stern.\n\nwhen i was about seven my dad told me the story of uncle richard and what he did in world war ii, so that summer i went running in to the house and said 'uncle richard can i see the silver star?' it was in a box at the bottom of a drawer in a back bedroom, romberg told cnn.\n\nthe iron cross, however, is missing.\n\nromberg told cnn: in 1942 the usa were collecting metal to melt down and make into ammunition.\n\nso uncle richard turned it in to create bullets to shoot the nazis. he made it very clear in january 1942 that he had to enter the us army. he was 43 but determined to do it.\n\nmonday, january 27, 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp.

(health.com) -- lana, a 38 year-old publicist in los angeles, california, was diagnosed with genital herpes in 1997.\n\nsince then, she has kind of been hiding from the dating scene.\n\nlet's face it: how do you drop that bomb on a potential love interest? and when?\n\nshe considered a number of online dating venues, but she says match.com asked too many questions on its enrollment form, eharmony was too religious, and myspace was too much of a hookup zone.\n\ni wanted to meet men with my same diagnosis so we wouldn't [need to] have 'the talk,' or fear of rejection and transmitting, she says. most of us with this don't wish to spread it.\n\ndespite -- or perhaps because of -- the economic downturn, the billion-dollar online dating industry has been booming. but not everyone has felt welcome at the party.\n\nwhile sites like match.com and eharmony don't discriminate, they also don't cater to people like lana who are coping with sexually transmitted diseases, disabilities, or mental health conditions. all of these can make dating -- often an ego-shattering minefield for those in perfect health -- even trickier.\n\non bigger dating sites the competition is tremendous, says jim houran, phd, a clinical psychologist and columnist for online dating magazine. and let's face it, depending on what [the illness] is, it could very well make you uncompetitive in the larger dating pool.\n\nhealth.com: 28 days to a healthier relationship\n\nfortunately, there are a number of alternatives. a new breed of dating sites has emerged to play cupid for people with chronic diseases and disabilities.\n\nover the past five years, several sites -- such as prescription4love.com, nolongerlonely.com, and cisforcupid.com -- have launched to serve the needs of people with conditions ranging from bipolar disorder to crohn's disease. together these sites now boast tens of thousands of members.\n\nin addition to providing their users with a more hospitable environment, these websites defuse the tension over how and when to disclose an illness, which is often an issue for people with diseases and disabilities who venture onto mainstream dating sites.\n\nwhen health problems equal heartache\n\nafter some horrible results on other dating websites, lana joined prescription 4 love and the std-specific site positivesingles.com.\n\nboth sites require members to disclose their illnesses upfront, clearing the air for what might be a deal-breaking revelation later. within her first week on positive singles, she went on three dates and has since gone on seven more, which fostered one romantic relationship and a friendship over the past two years. she's even rejected a couple dozen guys.\n\nhealth.com: how to tell your partner a health secret\n\ni don't think i would have been able to have 10 dates without the site, says lana. it's easier to get rejected via email, and you can take baby steps online without hunting outside.\n\nthough prescription 4 love didn't yield any dates for lana, this fast-growing online community offers an alternative to mainstream dating sites for thousands of singles.\n\nnow three years old, the site currently has 8,000 members who represent nearly 40 health conditions ranging from genital herpes (2,425 members) to tourette's syndrome (32 members).\n\nricky durham founded prescription 4 love in 2006, inspired by his late brother keith, who lived with crohn's disease for 15 years before passing away in 2004.\n\nhe was a good-looking boy, and he could find dates, but when do you tell someone you have a colostomy bag? the night you go out? two weeks after you go out? durham asks. he was having a hard time with that, so i thought if he could find someone who had the same disease, or someone with a colostomy bag, he wouldn't really have to discuss that.\n\nsince launching the site, durham, 48, who previously dabbled in the stock market and worked as a bartender, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. though he doesn't find it appropriate to be a member of a community he founded, he says he can empathize with his members.\n\nit's nice to find someone who's going through what you're going through, he says.\n\nlove for less\n\nniche sites are also a lot less expensive. prescription 4 love, which started charging in may 2009, is $9.95 per month, while most of the features on no longer lonely (including the dating service and chat rooms) are still free.\n\n(access to the site's full features is available for $24 per year. that's substantially cheaper than sites like match.com and eharmony, which can cost upwards of $35 per month.)\n\nto me, that's pressure right there, says robert watson, the executive director of the nonprofit dating service dateable.org, which caters primarily to those with physical and mild psychiatric handicaps. if it's the 30th day of the month, you're thinking, 'i've got one more day to find someone or it's another $35.'\n\ndateable, which was founded in 1987 by a washington, d.c., doctor who wanted to give her patients a way to combat the isolation that accompanied their physical disabilities, charges a $125 initiation fee for the first year and $25 every year thereafter.\n\nfor that fee, members get a more personalized experience, as dateable is more akin to an old-school matchmaking service. the organization has been responsible for almost 1,000 marriages, according to watson. as one of its first members, he should know: he met his wife, lynn, at a dateable valentine's day party in 1988.\n\ni didn't want to try it, says watson, who has moderate cerebral palsy and was working as a national project director for the united cerebral palsy association at the time. but i probably knew everybody in my community and nobody i knew wanted to date me or vice versa. lynn lived 60 miles away, but we made it work.\n\nby pushing a friends first concept, which has been emulated in the communal blog and forum features of prescription 4 love, no longer lonely, and other illness-specific sites, dateable members can get up to speed on the dating world in a familiar environment without the prying eyes of the web.\n\npeople with disabilities, especially developmental disabilities, are typically behind the eight ball because they haven't had the practice of dating in college or their young adult life, says watson. many of them never had the puppy love, been broken up with, experienced the fights, or the good stuff.\n\nto make up for this lost time, his best bit of advice is to be totally honest. even in our post-americans with disabilities act society, notes watson, failing to mention that you're confined to a wheelchair or dealing with another type of handicap might bring a first date to an abrupt end after a courtesy i'm sorry drink.\n\nthe stigma of mental illness\n\npeople with physical disabilities aren't the only ones who face stigma while dating. people with mental health problems, from chronic depression to schizophrenia, have also benefited from specialized sites.\n\njim leftwich, 39, a college librarian from white plains, new york, has lived with schizoaffective disorder, a condition that combines features of schizophrenia and mood disorders (such as depression), since 1992. in 2004, after years of brushing up against the harsh realities of the dating scene, leftwich founded no longer lonely, a dating site that caters to the mentally ill.\n\ni thought to myself, 'there should be something like this out there,' and i was surprised to find there wasn't, says leftwich. if you're mentally ill, it's kind of a hostile world out there. i thought by taking down that whole bugaboo of having an illness, making it all open with everyone knowing, it would facilitate things. people would be more trusting and relationships might be more successful.\n\nno longer lonely now has 16,000 members and a brand new interface (similar to those of social-networking sites) that allows users to upload poems, art, videos, and blogs. the site has been responsible for more than 20 marriages.\n\ni find with my clientele, they're more willing to get to know someone remotely and they're more open, he says. they don't have the same kind of prejudices that people in general tend to have.\n\neven though most mental illnesses can be controlled with medication, therapy, or a combination of the two, some people still view conditions such as bipolar disorder as a mark of weakness or instability.\n\neven in today's enlightened society, where acceptance and diversity are hailed as the right thing to do...mentally ill people tend to be outcasts. it's terrible, says houran, who is also a former instructor of clinical psychiatry at the southern illinois school of medicine.\n\nthe minute someone knows you have a certain mental disorder, they assume it means that you're not capable of love, or that you're dangerous or unstable. those are myths. given the right care, people with mental illnesses and other medical conditions can lead very normal, functioning lives.\n\nsome mental illnesses -- certain mood or personality disorders, for instance -- could cause problems in fledgling relationships, houran acknowledges. and especially if the relationship progresses to thoughts of marriage and kids, two partners who each have bipolar disorder, for example, could find themselves debating whether it's safe or wise to have children.\n\nhowever, says houran, in most cases these considerations aren't enough to forestall a relationship. even under the best of circumstances, people still have major relationship challenges, he says.\n\nfor houran, this outgrowth of illness-specific dating sites and services is a boon. niche sites are growing in popularity because they allow people with these very specific needs or interests to connect in a way that's not possible on the big dating sites, he says.\n\nthe big dating sites are akin to wal-mart. you have a lot of quantity, but that doesn't mean you're going to find people with a lot quality in the way you define it. that being said, niche sites by their very construction tend to be very small. so i always advocate [that] people use both.\n\ncopyright health magazine 2011

(cnn) —\n\nhome is where the heart is…and where we currently spend the vast majority of our time. in addition to navigating an ongoing global pandemic, the winter is also a time when hibernation is normal. however, endless hours spent underneath the same roof and the same four walls can make anyone grow weary and, at times, bored.\n\nthat's why it's essential to fill your space with life's essential ingredient: happiness. of course, joy looks and feels differently to every human. (after all, marie kondo taught us this years ago.) however, there are some universal ways to interject calm, color and bliss into your abode.\n\nby chatting with a plethora of experts, from life coaches and home organizers to nutritionists, doctors and therapists, we've gathered the ultimate ways to make your home a place you want to be — and, hopefully, a spot that stimulates your mood and optimism.\n\ndisplay your fruits and vegetables\n\nfor kati carrapa, a professional organizer, life coach and pastor, happiness comes through aliveness. the most straightforward (and easy!) way to invite color and life into your kitchen is through displaying your fruits and vegetables. stay simple with standard red apples or lemons, or go bolder with pineapple, dragon fruit or persimmon.\n\nthe colors are all up to you. if you long for exotic fruits and tastes, then go for it, she suggests. [if] you think you need more grounding energy, then go for kale, purple cabbage and carrots. she recommends trying various color combinations to see which ones make you the happiest, and taste the best too.\n\ntry these: simple houseware 2-tier countertop fruit basket ($21.87, originally $27.99;

most had little clue about valentine's day unless i told them.\n\nof course, they also did not really know me. falling in love in those pre-instagram, pre-cell phone days was understood as a mysterious matter, where facts and the onerous getting to know each other played little part. some of this was understandable. where marriage was a matter of careful arrangement, love had to be left wild and chaotic, without being hemmed in by the constraints of data or some similar bubble-bursting encumbrance.\n\nthings have changed in pakistan. not only is valentine's day a pretty big deal now – there are specials at florists and displays at stationery shops and tinsel-wrapped candy everywhere – the encroachment of the semi-arranged marriage, on the realm between love and arranged marriage, seems to have altered the path and pattern of both. these semi-arranged marriages, particularly popular among the growing urban middle class, seek to add a little of love's mystery to the once standard arranged marriage, whose closely chaperoned interactions leave little room for romance and where the two being wed do not know each other at all.\n\nin the semi-arranged marriage, there may be room for a few solo coffee dates. and the newly paired duo can announce to their friends that they are in love, while their parents can insist that the match was entirely arranged. in other words, parents can find possible spouses who meet a certain combined checklist of qualities identified by both the bride or groom-to-be and the parents. veto power, however, lies with the young couple.\n\nadded volume to the valentine's day business comes from the virtual realm that has made most everything including love and/or marriage a competitive sport. cheaply available cell phones are everywhere in pakistan, and nearly all are equipped with social media, such that everyone can see the presents that those in love are bestowing on one another.\n\nin addition, celebrating valentine's day gives the upwardly mobile urban couple's love the legitimacy of individual choice – with roses, chocolates and jewelry adding a bit of luster to the worn and antiquated patina of an arranged marriage. if the celebration is attended to with some gusto, even an entirely arranged match can be passed off as one in which the parties fell in love without any machinations of their aunt or uncle or the neighbor lady-turned-matchmaker who lives three doors down.\n\neven in rural pakistan, where marriages are still generally arranged and love is a separate realm, valentine's day is now a known, if not openly, celebrated quantity. where trysts between lovers can be arranged via the ubiquitous cell phone, any excuse to meet in the sugarcane field – including valentine's day – is used. men and women who may have to endure spouses chosen by mothers, fathers and the village council, one theory goes, are especially entitled to a bit of fun on the side.\n\nlove in pakistan may seem like a tale from a very distant elsewhere, but one could argue that the slightly waning popularity of valentine's day here (or at least the cynicism that hangs over some) is for reasons remarkably similar, if reverse, from those seen in pakistan.\n\nwhile pakistanis may have moved from the arranged to the semi-arranged sort of marriage, americans have moved from the love by accidental chance or serendipity to a more calculated – if not algorithmic-driven – sort of love. in the data-driven, virtually-infused and forever-impatient realm of finding a partner, social media and the internet provide a ton of information faster than the spark of attraction.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nfor those actively and intentionally looking for love, a dizzying array of apps, many with the ability to match a staggering set of data points – looks, income, language, location – can help with pairing with far greater precision than the most enterprising set of pakistani parents. in some, bucket lists and credit reports can be exchanged even before the trouble of a first meeting. why waste a couple of hours when artificial intelligence can tally up the possibility of true love using hundreds of variables? mystery is the enemy here and data is the friend; love is made (like valentine's day) utterly predictable.\n\nin pakistan, the united states and likely anywhere on our data-driven globe, the role of valentine's day is changing. in the west, marketing departments of dating apps can rely on the fact that many more will sign up for their love-on-demand services on or around that day. in pakistan, even those betrothed who have spoken barely a sentence to each other will send cards, flowers and chocolates.\n\nin different ways, love is a status symbol, a badge of desirability. and valentine's day is a perfect showcase to make sure that everyone in the virtual audience knows it.

(cnn) having already aired director ava duvernay's documentary 13th, about the legacy of the 13th amendment, netflix ups the ante by devoting a six-part series to the 14th with amend: the fight for america. it's an ambitious project that mixes various techniques, stars and historians to enliven the history and connect it to the present, with its most conspicuous weakness being the contributions of host and producer will smith.\n\nenacted in 1868, the 14th amendment has become one of the most-litigated amendments in us history. its key provisions , promising equal protection for all persons, have proven remarkably elastic, becoming the foundation not only for civil rights but women's rights, marriage equality (both involving mixed-race and gay couples) and immigrants.\n\namend employs multiple methods in bringing that history to life and powerfully connecting it to the battles of the 21st century, with the rise of extremist forces rooted in white supremacy. those narrative wrinkles include animation and dramatic readings, with a gaudy list of actors like mahershala ali and samuel l. jackson presenting the words of frederick douglass and martin luther king jr., respectively.\n\nthe early episodes take a deep dive into reconstruction, the rise of ku klux klan and the jim crow era installing a form of legal apartheid, as naacp legal defense and educational fund president sherrilyn ifill notes.\n\nthe timeliest material charts a direct path from the racial backlash then into the heart of modern politics, detailing the importance of the supreme court in codifying (and later overturning) discrimination, the use of home-grown american terrorism against african-americans and the extent to which violence was used to mount a political counter-revolution against reconstruction, as historian david blight explains.\n\nread more
london (cnn) britain's royal family was facing a once-in-a-generation crisis on monday after prince harry and meghan, duchess of sussex, rocked the institution with a litany of devastating allegations in their eagerly awaited interview with oprah winfrey.\n\nover the course of the two-hour special , the couple -- who despite their royal split still sit five relatives away from the throne -- painted a picture of a family so stubbornly rooted in its ways that it left a young, bi-racial couple alone to fend off racist abuse and their own troubled mental health, forcing them into silence and ultimately leaving them with no option but to flee the palace's clutches.\n\nmeghan said she was so isolated and lonely while working as a royal that she contemplated suicide , telling winfrey she just didn't want to be alive anymore. the couple were intensely critical of the way the institution treated them, and meghan revealed a staggering allegation of racism from a member of the clan that threatens to throw its reputation into crisis.\n\nharry meanwhile admitted his relationships with his father and heir to the throne, prince charles , and his brother, prince william , have come under severe strain in recent years, and suggested the institution may have planted stories in the media that cast him and meghan in a negative light.\n\n'i just didn't want to be alive anymore'\n\nthe palace faced storms on multiple fronts by sunrise in london on monday.\n\nthe interview had been relentlessly previewed in the media over recent days, drawing comparisons with a royal tell-all given by harry's mother, princess diana , in 1995, which shed light on the breakdown of her marriage to charles.\n\nbut the revelations in sunday's broadcast may have dwarfed even those in magnitude, as harry and meghan's scorched-earth confessional posed problem after problem for palace staffers and senior royals.\n\nperhaps the most pertinent was meghan's allegation that an unnamed family member had asked about archie's skin color and what that would mean or look like. she said those discussions were relayed to her from harry.\n\nharry declined to name the family member but said he was a bit shocked by the conversation. winfrey said on cbs on monday morning that it was not his grandmother nor his grandfather that were part of those conversations. in britain, the shadow education secretary, kate green, said buckingham palace should launch an investigation.\n\npalace officials are also scrambling to respond to claims from both duke and duchess that their pleas for help with their mental wellbeing and security were ignored by the institution.\n\nfighting back tears at one point, meghan said her thoughts of suicide were incredibly difficult to bear, and she was reticent to share them with her husband. but i knew that if i didn't say it, that i would do it -- and i just didn't want to be alive anymore, she said.\n\nharry , whose mother diana was killed when he was a boy, said he was terrified by his wife's admission. the prince, who is sixth in line to the throne, said there is a culture of suffering in silence in the royal family. but meghan's race and the abuse she endured made the situation even more difficult for the couple, and their perceived lack of support ultimately led, above all other factors, to their dramatic decision to quit as working royals in january 2020.\n\nhow to get help: in the us, call the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. the international association for suicide prevention and befrienders worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nthey described in emotional detail the most difficult moments -- meghan revealing her thoughts to harry hours before they were due to go to an event; the prince arriving home from work each day to find his wife crying while breastfeeding their newborn -- and said a lack of support and lack of understanding were the reasons they chose to step away.\n\nmeghan said the situation was exacerbated by often racist and outdated, colonial undertones that repeatedly appeared in coverage of the couple in britain's notoriously vitriolic tabloids . both described a toxic blend of press intrusion, bitterness on social media and isolation from a support structure.\n\nharry added that he pushed the issue with the royal family. he told winfrey he believed there were many opportunities for the palace to show some public support in the face of continued racial abuse in the press, yet no one from my family ever said anything. that hurts.\n\ni regret believing them when they said i would be protected, meghan told winfrey.\n\ncnn has reached out to the royal family for comment.\n\nharry reveals serious rifts in the family\n\nif there was even the faintest suggestion that harry and meghan could someday rejoin the royal family's mission, sunday's broadcast likely extinguished it for good. the interview laid bare the depths of division between the pair and the rest of the family, a chasm that would have been unimaginable when they married in windsor just three years ago.\n\nthey told winfrey that the family had been welcoming towards meghan at first, and that when they married, they were committed to their roles.\n\nbut things quickly changed. harry told winfrey his relationship with his father charles reached the point where the heir to the throne stopped taking his calls, so angered by the pair's decision to leave as working royals in 2020. there's a lot to work through there, harry said. i feel really let down, because he's been through something similar -- he knows what pain feels like.\n\non his brother, william -- with whom harry grew up, and whose shared childhood was meticulously followed by the media -- the prince implied that communication is virtually non-existent. we're on different paths, he said, adding that the relationship is space at the moment, and that time heals all things -- hopefully.\n\nperhaps the only silver lining for the family is that its leader survived the interview relatively unscathed. harry and meghan both spoke effusively of the queen, describing her as caring and kind from the beginning.\n\nmy grandmother and i have a really good relationship, and an understanding and i have a deep respect for her, harry said. meghan said she has spoken to her frequently in the past year, including on the day that prince philip was admitted to hospital last month.\n\nmeghan added that despite the ordeal, it was important to differentiate the royal family from the people running the institution.\n\nshe discussed rumors of a dispute with catherine, duchess of cambridge. meghan said reports she made kate cry over the dresses of flower girls at her wedding were untrue, and it was in fact the duchess of sussex who cried. but there was no confrontation, meghan said, describing her sister-in-law as a good person.\n\nbut the evidently strained family dynamic will overshadow the royals' upcoming engagements. no statements have yet been issued by any of their communications teams in the wake of the interview.\n\nmeghan and harry (right) with the queen, prince charles and other royals in 2019. during their oprah interview, harry detailed a breakdown in relationships with several of his senior relatives.\n\nbreathless reaction in britain\n\nas the hours ticked by and the dust from the broadcast settled on monday, buckingham palace remained silent. but the british media leapt to cover the fallout, with some newspapers publishing extra early editions overnight in order to feature the interview on their front pages.\n\nas has so often been the case with the couple, coverage ranged from the measured to the hysterical. the daily mail ran a headline reading kate made me cry on its 2 a.m. edition, before leading on meghan's accusation of racism later in the morning. the tabloid's website also included a prominent banner that read: i wanted to kill myself.\n\nthe sun featured a new nickname for meghan amid her rift with the royal family: megxile, and the daily express dismissed the broadcast as a self-serving tv chat with oprah.\n\na selection of front pages in the uk on monday.\n\non monday afternoon, several journalists used boris johnson's press conference on covid-19 to ask for his thoughts on the oprah interview. the prime minister declined to weigh in, aside from saying he'd always had the highest admiration for the queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country.\n\nthe media's treatment of the royal couple formed a significant part of the interview, with the pair both taking aim at sections of the press.\n\nharry said the palace is in fear of its media coverage, meaning they had little freedom while part of the family.\n\nto simplify it, it's a case of if you as a family member are willing to wine, dine and give full access to these reporters, then you will get better press, harry said. there is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations.\n\nthe interview was broadcast in britain at 9 p.m. monday, with terrestrial broadcaster itv winning the race to acquire rights. but its main talking points were already being dissected in detail by brits and in the media long before its uk airing.\n\ncharles anson, a former press secretary to the queen, said on monday the couple raised issues that need to be looked at carefully, but claimed to the bbc that there wasn't a strand of racism within the royal household.\n\nbut julie montagu, viscountess hinchingbrooke, told the bbc that their revelations were astounding, and that as an american woman who married into british aristocracy, she could relate to meghan's descriptions. you don't really know until you're in it, and i think that she made that very well known last night in her interview, she said.\n\ncnn will soon launch royal news, a weekly newsletter bringing you the inside track on

(cnn) the brother of the stepfather of two missing idaho children released a statement asking for him to come forward and cooperate with police.\n\nchad daybell and his wife lori vallow, the children's mother, left the state. vallow has refused to cooperate with authorities, police said in a statement on december 30. the children, joshua jj vallow, 7, and tylee ryan, 17, have not been seen or heard from since september\n\ndaybell's brother, matt daybell, said in a statement to cnn affiliate east idaho news friday that he has not been close to chad daybell since they were children.\n\nmy immediate family has had little association with chad the last many years due to our concerns with his religious claims and particular books he had chosen to publish, including his own, matt daybell's statement read. i plead again for chad to come forward and cooperate with the investigation so that this very difficult situation might be resolved.\n\nmatt daybell said in a statement friday he has neither seen nor directly spoken to his brother since the memorial of chad daybell's previous wife in october.\n\nrelatives of missing kids offer $20,000 reward\n\njj's biological grandparents, kay and larry woodcock of louisiana, held a news conference last week in idaho to offer a $20,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of jj or tylee ryan.\n\nkay woodcock made a public plea to their mother.\n\nplease, just let us know where the kids are, she said. it's not difficult. it will end all this, as far as the kids are concerned.\n\nkay and larry woodcock are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of their grandson, joshua jj vallow, and his sister, tylee ryan.\n\nthe children's disappearance is part of a complex past 12 months for the family -- a time frame in which police have investigated two deaths, one of which authorities say still is under investigation.\n\npolice determined the children were missing in late november -- four months after lori vallow's estranged husband was shot dead in their former home state, arizona, and shortly after vallow moved with the children to idaho and remarried.\n\nvallow's estranged husband was shot and killed in july during a fight with vallow's brother. according to a petition for dissolution of marriage filed in february , vallow's former husband said vallow recently become infatuated and at times obsessive about near death experiences and spiritual visions.\n\npolice conducted a welfare check for jj -- vallow's adopted son with her late husband -- on november 26 at their home in rexburg, idaho, after relatives raised concern about not hearing from him since september.\n\nduring the welfare check, both vallow and her new husband, chad daybell, told investigators the boy was staying with a family friend in arizona, police said.\n\nbut police determined that he wasn't staying with a family friend. when police returned november 27 to execute a search warrant, investigators determined daybell and vallow had fled the home, and also didn't appear to have taken jj with them, according to authorities.\n\ninvestigators learned that tylee hadn't been seen since september, though she'd most recently lived with vallow and jj in rexburg.\n\npolice investigate whether the disappearances are connected to a woman's death\n\nthe case is complicated further by the death of daybell's previous wife, tammy daybell, in idaho in october. her death initially was believed to be natural, but rexburg police announced last month that it was suspicious, and her remains were exhumed.\n\ndaybell and vallow married a few weeks after tammy daybell's death, police say.\n\nrexburg police have said they're investigating whether that death and the kids' disappearances are connected.\n\ninvestigators don't believe the children are with lori vallow, but they think she knows where they are or what happened to them, rexburg police said.\n\nan attorney for the family, sean bartholick, released a statement to east idaho news on december 23 saying that while he is in contact with vallow and her husband, chad daybell, he does not have information about the children. cnn has made multiple attempts to reach bartholick but has not received a response.\n\nlinks to a religious content website\n\nchad daybell had connections to a website called preparing a people, a religious content provider that describes itself as as series of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation, featuring several latter-day saints speakers.\n\npublishers of the site, michael and nancy james, released a statement december 26 emphasizing that while daybell, and to a lesser extent vallow, were featured in the series, neither was an owner or a founder.\n\nmichael and nancy james said they decided to pull content featuring either daybell or vallow in light of tammy daybell's death and the disappearance of the children.
(cnn) the world bank has postponed its decision on granting tanzania a $500 million loan, following pressure from activists who oppose the country's policy of banning pregnant girls and young mothers from attending state school.\n\nthe bank's executive board was meant to meet on tuesday to consider the loan, but the meeting was postponed after one member requested a delay on monday, a source at the bank told cnn.\n\nsources did not say why the meeting was postponed. however, the request to delay came in after the bank held a last-minute emergency meeting with tanzanian activists and international human rights organizations earlier on monday.\n\nlast week, tanzanian civil society groups sent a letter, seen by cnn, to the executive board urging them to stop the loan until the country passes a law that guarantees the rights of pregnant girls to attend regular secondary schools and ends mandatory pregnancy tests.\n\ncnn visited three tanzanian schools in 2018 where girls from grades eight and up were given compulsory pregnancy tests\n\nread more

stimulus check tracker: why you may see 'payment status not available'—or a pending direct deposit in your bank account
(cnn) —\n\nour weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next democratic presidential race:\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren says – present tense – she's not a 2020 candidate. i am not running for president in 2020, she told cnn's jim acosta this weekend.\n\nbut many of her recent actions suggest otherwise.\n\nwarren announced last week at a democratic national committee gala that she'd sent a check for $5,000 to all 50 state parties – $250,000 total. i want a democratic party strong enough to compete for every vote, in every race, at every level, in every state, in every election – and i'm willing to do my part to help make that happen, she said.\n\nwhile warren was bolstering her state-level ties, she was warring with fellow democrats on capitol hill.\n\nfighting against a bank bill tuesday, after the vote to advance the legislation, she retweeted a list of democrats who backed it, adding: senate republicans voted unanimously for the #banklobbyistact. but this bill wouldn't be on the path to becoming law without the support of these democrats. the senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again.\n\nthe upshot: warren is certainly aware that the short-term awkwardness with colleagues could pay off in 2020, when the party's primary electorate is likely to be well to the left of the senate democratic caucus.\n\nnews and notes:\n\ndnc moves to curb superdelegates: the fight over exactly what role superdelegates should play in the 2020 nominating process won't be resolved until this summer – but the democratic national committee voted over the weekend on a big-picture goal: reducing them. the full dnc accepted a recommendation to revise the role and reduce the perceived influence of superdelegates. what that means, exactly, will be sorted out by the rules and bylaws committee ahead of a june deadline to prepare a final proposal for the august dnc meeting.\n\nwhat to watch: the 21-member unity reform commission recommended a 60% reduction in superdelegates – binding dnc members to their states' results on the first ballot but allowing elected officials and former presidents and vice presidents to retain their unpledged status. vermont sen. bernie sanders' allies are pushing to go further – doing away with unpledged delegates altogether, at least on the first ballot.\n\nthe campaign that never ends: sanders on friday told cnn's jake tapper that superdelegates should be eliminated entirely. in a statement on the dnc's moves saturday, hillary clinton praised other reforms but didn't mention superdelegates at all.\n\nbernie sanders in trump country: since donald trump's election, bernie sanders has visited 28 states (not counting his home in vermont), often headlining multiple events in different cities over the course of just a few hours. he's keynoted events with progressive groups opposing obamacare repeal and the gop tax bill, done a book tour, and – increasingly as the midterms near – endorsed and stumped with congressional candidates.\n\nthe reasoning is simple, sanders said this week before heading for texas and arizona: we have put a significant effort into going into states that trump won. not exclusively, but most of the states that i've visited have been states that trump won. the reason for that is, i think it's important for people who voted for trump to understand that many of the promises that he made on health care, on taxes, on many other issues, are promises that he did not keep.\n\n– on trump's new tariffs – 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports – sanders, who campaigned on protectionist policies like trump, said: do we need radical changes in our trade policy to rebuild american manufacturing and protect the american worker? absolutely, positively. that's exactly what i campaigned on. do i think that trump's approach of just putting tariffs on steel and aluminum, is gonna solve the problem? the answer is no, it is not. we need a more comprehensive approach.\n\n– asked if congress should get more involved in the process, he said: absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. i will credit trump, which i very rarely do, to put his finger on a real problem. i do not want to see the continued de-industrialization of the loss of good paying jobs, whether it's steel, aluminum, or any other industry. we need serious legislation.\n\nbiden isn't slowing down: former vice president joe biden's busy week began with campaign stops in pennsylvania, where he stumped for democrat conor lamb before tuesday's special election in pennsylvania's 18th district. it ended on friday with a speech at the kellogg school of management at northwestern university in evanston, illinois, where he spoke about economic opportunity.\n\nbiden's stop in western pennsylvania was not just a stump speech, but an opportunity to offer a glimpse of how he'd approach 2020 if he runs for president again: by working to rebuild a democratic coalition that includes white, rural, blue-collar voters. he slammed trump for the tax bill, saying it would lead to cuts in medicare and social security, and tried to appeal to voters dissatisfied with the president in a district he won by 20 points in 2016.\n\nkamala's plans: in a politico dive into california sen. kamala harris's positioning in the senate, she discussed being approached to run in 2020 – without actually tipping her hand about whether she'll do it. i have seen so many people along the way focused on that thing out there, and they trip over the thing in front of them. and the thing in front of us is so important, harris said. i'm going to let everybody else sit around and think about things that have yet to approach.\n\nmerkley 'keeping the option open': oregon sen. jeff merkley told local radio station koin he is keeping the option open for a potential 2020 run – but that his planned march 24 trip to new hampshire doesn't mean he's in. my main focus is the fight for 51, to get a democratic majority in the senate that can stop some of the worst of trump's policies and also the packing of the courts, merkley said.\n\na nixon to excite the left? cynthia nixon, that is. the actress and activist, a staple of new york city progressive politics for some time now, is inching closer to a primary challenge to gov. andrew cuomo, who's seeking his third term – and could, with a rout, put himself in a position to run in 2020. but nixon, who's getting advice from strategists rebecca katz (a longtime top aide and ally of new york mayor bill de blasio) and bill hyers, poses two kinds of threats to cuomo: 1) to actually beat him. she has the name recognition and the right politics to flank him on the left; and 2) by coming close, to put a major dent in cuomo's standing with liberals, who already have their qualms.\n\nasked on a conference call last week whether he thought de blasio was encouraging nixon into the race, cuomo offered this: i think it was either the mayor of new york or vladimir putin. i am going to leave it to you great investigative reporters to follow the facts and ferret out the truth.\n\ngarcetti on late night: los angeles mayor eric garcetti was on late night with seth meyers on tuesday and spoke about his passion for local politics – and slammed national politicians in washington, which is something he's been repeatedly doing through his stops and visits around the country in early primary states. he specifically called out washington for not acting on the issues of homelessness and daca – both of which strongly impact his city.\n\nmeyers did ask him about his 2020 prospects, and what he would say about the attacks on him from the right calling him the hollywood candidate. we do have more kardashians than anywhere else, but most of us are not kardashians … so i can relate to that conversation on a local level with the mayor in dayton, a mayor in columbia, south carolina, mayor in south bend, indiana, like mayor pete (buttigieg) … and we speak the language i think of america. it's washington that's that swamp and it's only getting swampier.\n\nellison grabs the single-payer torch: minnesota rep. keith ellison, the dnc deputy chair, is the new lead sponsor of the house single-payer health care bill, taking over the title from former rep. john conyers. the house allowed the largely symbolic switcheroo by unanimous consent on wednesday, but it was an important one for folks who didn't want the legislation attached to conyers' name after his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations last year. the movement carries on, ellison said in an interview that afternoon. i remain a staunch advocate of the aca, but we can imagine a world in which we can have universal health care styled on a 'medicare for all' bill.\n\nwhat now? we are in the middle of a very critical national conversation and we're going to incorporate into the next iteration that which we learn – so we expect the bill to get better, with more flesh on the bones, he said. (the text of the bill remains unchanged.) you can also expect republicans to use ellison's title with the dnc – which is also mostly symbolic – to allege the party is moving too far left. it's worth noting, though, that single-payer is a long ways away from being adapted by a dnc platform committee.\n\nfrom the right:\n\nflake calls for a trump challenger: during an appearance on nbc's meet the press on sunday morning, arizona sen. jeff flake again called for a republican to challenge president donald trump in 2020. flake has long been a trump critic, and has said he himself would not rule out a 2020 challenge to trump.\n\nflake's upcoming visit to new hampshire next weekend is stoking speculation that flake is considering being that republican challenger to trump in 2020. the senator will address the new hampshire institute of politics at their politics & eggs event on friday, which has become a popular stop for potential presidential contenders.\n\nbefore you go:\n\ncontinuing his re-entrance into the political world, former massachusetts gov. deval patrick will be speaking at the national constitution center in philadelphia on thursday at an event called renewing the founders' promise.\n\ncnn's sophie tatum, ashley killough, saba hamedy, david siegel and betsy klein contributed to this memo.
story highlights many doctors know that such talks are important but aren't sure what to say medicare covers advance planning conversations only 14 percent of doctors surveyed have billed medicare for such discussions\n\n(cnn) —\n\ndoctors know it's important to talk with their patients about end-of-life care.\n\nbut they're finding it tough to start those conversations – and when they do, they're not sure what to say, according to a national poll released thursday.\n\nsuch discussions are becoming more important as baby boomers reach their golden years. by 2030, an estimated 72 million americans will be 65 or over, nearly one-fifth of the u.s. population.\n\nmedicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. known as advance care planning, the conversations can also be held in a hospital.\n\npayment for such discussions was initially included in the affordable care act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.\n\nthe poll of 736 primary care doctors and specialists, including 202 in california, examined their views on advance care planning and end-of-life conversations with patients. among the findings:\n\nwhile 75 percent of doctors said medicare reimbursement makes it more likely they'd have advance care planning discussions, only about 14 percent said they had actually billed medicare for those visits.\n\nthree quarters also believe it's their responsibility to initiate end-of-life conversations.\n\nfewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.\n\nmore than half said they had not discussed end-of-life care with their own physicians.\n\nthe survey was commissioned by the john a. hartford foundation, the california health care foundation and cambia health foundation. (california healthline is an editorially independent publication of the california health care foundation.)\n\npatients and their families increasingly want to talk about end-of-life care with their physicians well before facing a terminal illness, studies have shown. most also want to die at home rather than in a hospital, although cultural differences influence end-of-life preferences.\n\npatients want their primary care doctors to have these conversations, and the poll shows that physicians recognize that it's their responsibility, said dr. sandra hernández, president and ceo of the california health care foundation and a physician who treats hiv patients. it's wonderful that medicare is reimbursing for these discussions. now, physicians need more skills and training.\n\nhaving the patient be able to participate in defining what end-of-life looks like is where the whole health care delivery system is going, hernández said.\n\npolicy experts are urging more end-of-life conversations not just to accommodate patients' desires, but to save money on aggressive medical interventions that patients and their families don't want and that won't prolong life.\n\na recent study found nearly 40 percent of american patients dying with cancer received at least one chemotherapy treatment in the six months before they died, more than in six other countries studied. an average of about $18,500 was spent on u.s. hospital costs for patients in their last six months.\n\nnearly a quarter of the physicians in the national poll said that the electronic health records they're required to use don't have a place to include patients' end-of-life preferences. even when electronic health records signaled that a patient had an advance care directive, nearly a third of doctors reported they couldn't access its actual contents.\n\nand doctors who received their medical training years ago say they rarely focused on how to talk to patients about end-of-life care, although medical education is improving in that regard.\n\nfollow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.\n\nphysicians in large medical systems may find more support than those in private practice. at kaiser permanente in northern california, physicians receive training in end-of-life discussions and have time to carry them out, said dr. ruma kumar, the hmo's regional medical director of supportive care services.\n\nkaiser permanente uses physician extenders – nurse practitioners, registered nurses and social workers – to work with patients on various stages of what the hmo calls life care planning. the hmo also offers a website to guide people through the process.\n\nkumar said kaiser encourages both doctors and patients to think of end-of-life planning as a routine part of care, just like you'd get a mammogram or colon cancer screening.\n\n(the general survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. for the internist/primary care provider sample, margin is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. for specialists, plus or minus 6.0.)\n\nthis story was produced by kaiser health news, which publishes california healthline, a service of the california health care foundation.
return to transcripts main page\n\nstate of the union\n\ninterview with texas senator ted cruz; interview with hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard; interview with virginia senator tim kaine; interview with u.s. secretary of homeland security jeh johnson; jordan targets isis in syria\n\naired february 8, 2015 - 09:00 et\n\nthis is a rush transcript. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n\n\ndana bash, cnn anchor: a triple threat to u.s. security: atrocities from isis, a land grab by vladimir putin, and washington politics that could shut down the department charged with keeping america safe.\n\n\n\nthis is state of the union.\n\n\n\nannouncer: this is cnn breaking news.\n\n\n\nbash: good morning. i'm dana bash.\n\n\n\nand we begin with the war on isis, jordan carrying out new airstrikes on isis targets inside syria. on the ground, there's a tense standoff between the isis fighters and the kurdish peshmerga in northern iraq.\n\n\n\ncnn's phil black is in irbil.\n\n\n\nphil, what's the latest there?\n\n\n\nphil black, cnn correspondent: dana, everything we have seen and everything we have been told by front-line fighters on the ground here near mosul suggests that there has been a significant uptick in airstrikes on isis positions in and around that isis-controlled city.\n\n\n\nwe were at a distance of some 10 miles from the southern gates of mosul. we heard, saw multiple detonations. the sound of fast-moving aircraft overhead was pretty constant, this as kurdish fighters on the ground are really digging in and holding defensive lines a small distance away from that city.\n\n\n\nthat's what they call phase one of this operation, to contain isis within that city. phase two will be hard. it will be dislodging isis from that city. the kurdish fighters say they will be ready to take part. the time frame is not yet clear. some u.s. officials have suggested it could be as early as april. kurdish officials think it's going to be longer than that.\n\n\n\nbut, ultimately, it comes down to when the iraqi army controlled by the government in baghdad is ready to go. and that's no small task, rebuilding, retraining, remotivating the army. it is the same force that ultimately abandoned mosul when isis first invaded this region, dana. bash: phil, no small task, that is an understatement. thank you\n\n\n\nvery much for that report.\n\n\n\nand here in the united states this sunday morning, there is deep skepticism over the isis claim that the u.s. hostage kayla mueller was actually killed by a jordanian airstrike inside syria. a spokesman says her family remains hopeful.\n\n\n\ncnn's kyung lah is prescott arizona, where her -- where she is from.\n\n\n\nkyung, what are you hearing?\n\n\n\nkyung lah, cnn national correspondent: well, dana, everything that we have been told by people who are in touch with the family is that they still do not have confirmation. they do not know the status of their daughter.\n\n\n\nand it is simply agony for the people of this town, as well as her family, made worse as we learn more about kayla mueller. she is a girl who grew up here, became a very dedicated woman to social justice. she went to syria to try to help the refugees.\n\n\n\ni spoke with a professor of hers who was a mentor. and that professor says that mueller was very sober about the risk. she knew profoundly what was at stake here. she still went. and her family now also knew. they are still awaiting word. they have reached out in a public statement to her captors, urging them to reach them -- dana.\n\n\n\nbash: kyung, thank you very much for that report.\n\n\n\nand a member of the senate intelligence committee tells cnn there's no reason to believe isis is, in his words, moving beyond what until now have been aspirations to attack the u.s. homeland.\n\n\n\nbut, as the threat grows, the department of homeland security may shut down in a matter of weeks because congress is blocking its money in a partisan fight over immigration.\n\n\n\nwe're joined now exclusively by the u.s. homeland security secretary, jeh johnson.\n\n\n\nand, mr. secretary, thanks for coming in.\n\n\n\nbefore we get to that, i want to ask about what you just heard the report about kayla mueller. you heard her say that she knew the risks of going into a place like syria. the state department advises u.s. citizens not to do that.\n\n\n\ngiven that, what should the u.s. responsibility be to go in and get hostages?\n\n\n\njeh johnson, u.s. secretary of homeland security: well, obviously, we're learning as much as we can as quickly as we can about ms. mueller's situation. our thoughts, our prayers, our concerns are with her family right now.\n\n\n\nyou're correct. the state department advises against travel in that particular part of the region right now. it is dangerous. people need to be cautious. and we do what we can to ensure the safety of americans who travel. that part of the world right now is obviously a very, very challenging situation.\n\n\n\nbash: should the u.s. be responsible for going and rescuing hostages who are going, even though the u.s. state department says it's just too dangerous?\n\n\n\njohnson: well, we know from prior examples that, where we can, we do our best to secure the safety of americans held hostage by terrorist organizations.\n\n\n\nand so it's something that we continually evaluate our ability to do in this region, but it is a very, very challenging situation, obviously.\n\n\n\nbash: ok.\n\n\n\nso, let's talk about the jihadists overall. americans looking at this, looking at the fighting, you know, probably constantly saying, how does this affect me, how does this affect the united states, and say, why does it matter?\n\n\n\njohn (sic) steinbach, who is the fbi's counterterrorism division head, told cnn's pam brown about an example of why it should matter. listen to this.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\npamela brown, cnn justice correspondent: there are isis cells in the u.s.\n\n\n\nmichael steinbach, fbi assistant director of counterterrorism: there are individuals that have been in communication with groups like isil who have a desire to conduct an attack, yes.\n\n\n\nbrown: that are living in the u.s. right now?\n\n\n\nsteinbach: correct.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nbash: people who are in contact with isil living in the u.s. right now. how many are we talking about?\n\n\n\njohnson: well, dana, i would put it this way. we have evolved to a new phase in the global terrorist threat, in that, 13 years ago, when we were attacked on 9/11, we had a relatively conventional command-and-control structure from core al qaeda that would dispatch, deploy operatives to commit terrorist acts.\n\n\n\nthe situation now is more decentralized, more diffuse, and frankly more complex, in that terrorist organizations such as isil or al qaeda in the arabian peninsula use the internet, use social media to communicate and to inspire acts of terrorism in individuals' home countries.\n\n\n\nand for that reason, we need to be particularly vigilant here at home, working with state and local law enforcement, working with the public through campaigns such as if you see something, say something.\n\n\n\nbash: but...\n\n\n\njohnson: it is a more complex situation, very clearly.\n\n\n\nbash: certainly complex, but, if i may, can you shed more light on what we just heard? do you have a handle on who the individuals are and how many there are in the united states who are in contact...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\njohnson: the fbi and the department of homeland security do a pretty good job of tracking the travel of individuals of suspicion, of investigating potential acts of terror or material support to terrorism.\n\n\n\njust this past friday, there were arrests of five individuals who were providing material support, allegedly, to isil. so, our law enforcement community does what i believe is a pretty good job of tracking these individuals. and we work with them to track the travel of individuals of suspicion.\n\n\n\nbash: can you give us a sense? are we talking about five, 10, 100, 1,000? what's -- give us the context of the...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: ... that we're talking about.\n\n\n\njohnson: well, what i can say is this.\n\n\n\nthe numbers that we see are larger in european countries. and that's one of the reasons why we're concerned about travel to and from europe and making sure that we have got the appropriate security assurances from countries from which we -- for which we do not require a visa.\n\n\n\nbut here at home, we do a pretty good job of tracking these individuals. and we have, in a number of instances, arrested people for material support, for attempting to travel to syria, for example.\n\n\n\nobviously, there's an unknown factor, but i believe we have the systems in place to do a pretty good job of tracking these individuals through law enforcement, through -- through travel, through our efforts to monitor what they're doing.\n\n\n\nbash: so people should feel you have got it covered?\n\n\n\njohnson: people should be vigilant right now. yes, we should have a lot of confidence in our homeland security\n\n\n\nlaw enforcement capabilities. we have come a long way since 9/11. but this also requires working with the public in campaigns through if you see something, say something, working with state and local law enforcement, the cop on the beat working in the communities, which is why we're working more closely now with municipal police departments, county sheriffs, state law enforcement, through fusion centers, task forces, and so forth.\n\n\n\ngiven how the homeland security challenges we face are evolving, it's becoming all the more important to do that.\n\n\n\nbash: ok.\n\n\n\nlet's turn to the department of homeland security and the fight that's going on right now that could potentially shut down your department or at least keep funding out of your department.\n\n\n\ni also want you to look at the calendar to -- so people understand how close we are to the deadline for that happening. it's february 27. here we are, just a little more than two weeks away, and we should note that, by the way, congress is out of town. they're not working for one of those weeks, so it makes it incredibly difficult.\n\n\n\ntell us where things stand right now. it is a standoff over the idea that republicans are trying to push funding this bill along with making sure that the president's executive order on immigration doesn't happen.\n\n\n\njohnson: dana, i am on capitol hill now virtually every working day talking to democrats and republicans about the importance of a fully funded department of homeland security in these times in particular.\n\n\n\nwe're on a continuing resolution right now, which, as you point out, expires on february 27, which is less than 20 days at this point. and, as long as we're on a continuing resolution, that, in and of itself, creates uncertainty about how we go about our homeland security missions.\n\n\n\nand, if we go into government shutdown, for example, that means furloughing employees, furloughing homeland security officials. as craig fugate, the administrator of fema, pointed out the other day, if we go into government shutdown, he's got to furlough something like 80 percent of his fema work force.\n\n\n\nand so i'm on the hill every day stressing the importance of a fully funded department of homeland security, separate and apart from riders to try to defund our efforts to reform the immigration system.\n\n\n\nbash: and are you getting...\n\n\n\njohnson: if people in congress want to have that debate about immigration reform, let's have that debate, but don't tie that to funding public safety at homeland security for the american people. we need a fully funded department right now. bash: actually, since you mentioned the -- the potential risks,\n\n\n\ni just also want to point out that, in your own contingency plan in 2013 if there were a shutdown then, nearly 90 percent of border patrol agents would still have to work, 85 percent of ice agents, and 93 percent of tsa officials. they would have to come to work without pay, but they would have to come to work.\n\n\n\nso, is it really going to be that big of a deal to most of your agency to -- when it comes to the risks to this country?\n\n\n\njohnson: yes, it is that big of a deal.\n\n\n\nlet's not forget the department of homeland security interfaces with the american public more than any other department of our government at airports, at ports. and so to just say, well, we will just make them come to work without pay, first of all, is a real challenge for the working men and women of my department.\n\n\n\nsecond, it means furloughing at least 30,000 of our department and cutting back very significantly on our operations, our operations to pursue homeland security. so, this is not a situation to make light of. in these challenging times, we need a fully funded department of homeland security right now.\n\n\n\nbash: and you mentioned the continuing resolution. that's sort of official washington-speak for the fact that this -- that your department has -- they have kicked the can down the road for many years, and not started -- started anew.\n\n\n\nand what has that meant for your ability to face new threats? because threats change every day.\n\n\n\njohnson: as long as we're on a continuing resolution, we are, first of all, restricted to last year's spending levels. but we are not allowed to fund new initiatives, new initiatives for border security, for example, new initiatives to hire more secret service agents for the coming presidential election cycle, new initiatives to fund grants.\n\n\n\nwe fund in excess of $2 billion a year in grants to state and local law enforcement for homeland security, for surveillance equipment, for communications commitment. and, as long as we're on a c.r., i cannot fund those new initiatives, which should be of serious concern to sheriffs, police chiefs, mayors, and governors.\n\n\n\nbash: before i let you go, i have to ask you about the secret service, which is underneath your department.\n\n\n\nit seems like, every week, there is some kind of breach at the white house. this past week, we saw what happened with the drones. the secret service is now acting without an actual director. how far away are we from your interview process finishing up on that?\n\n\n\njohnson: we're not far away.\n\n\n\nwe're taking a serious look at candidates for permanent director. and the president and i recognize that the secret service is the finest protection service in the world, but we -- we need significant change in how the agency conducts business.\n\n\n\nthat was one of the findings of the independent panel. and i thought that their work was fair and thorough. and so we're looking at a new permanent director. and i think we will have one pretty soon.\n\n\n\nbash: and, as somebody who oversees the secret service, when you hear a drone has landed at the white house, do you say, are you kidding me? again?\n\n\n\ni mean, what is your reaction when you hear this kind of breach? because the public is also -- is obviously saying, how does this kind of thing...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\njohnson: in the last couple of months, we have added security to the white house compound, in light of the fence-jumping incident.\n\n\n\nit's important to remember that securing the white house compound, the protection of the first family and other national leaders is a balance between providing for their physical safety, but we live in democracy where people want transparency, they want access to their national leaders and the buildings and the structures of government. and so it means striking the appropriate balance.\n\n\n\nbash: mr. secretary, thank you so much.\n\n\n\ni think i'm going to see you roaming the halls of congress, looking for some kind of solution to your funding problem in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\n\njohnson: you certainly will. thank you.\n\n\n\nbash: when they're working, at least.\n\n\n\nthank you. thank you so much.\n\n\n\nand up next, republican senator ted cruz on this homeland security fight, the war on isis, and getting tough with vladimir putin.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nbash: top officials from the united states and europe are in germany this sunday for urgent discussions about security and the growing threat posed by vladimir putin's russia.\n\n\n\nvice president biden is there. and he's sounding and talking tough, sort of like ronald reagan.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njoseph biden, vice president of the united states: given russia's recent history, we need to judge it by its deeds, not its words. don't tell us; show us, president putin.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nbash: republican senator ted cruz, a member of the armed services committee, is also at the conference.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\nbash: senator, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n\n\nlet's start with the fight over what to do about the ukraine. the german chancellor, the french president have been trying to negotiate some kind of an agreement. and angela merkel of germany has specifically said she does not think it is time to arm the ukrainians yet.\n\n\n\nwhy do you think she's wrong?\n\n\n\nsen. ted cruz (r), texas: well, what she said at this conference is that she did not believe there was any prospect for ukraine to be successful in defending itself against russian aggression. i think that's mistaken. but, at the same time, i think chancellor merkel's position is not surprising, given where president obama's position is.\n\n\n\nwhat we're doing with regard to ukraine and with regard to russia makes no sense, and it isn't working. it is long past time for us to step forward and provide defensive weapons, so that the men and women of ukraine can defend their nation.\n\n\n\nthey are our allies. in the budapest memorandum, we committed ourselves to standing with ukraine to defend themselves -- to defend their territorial integrity.\n\n\n\nbash: you mentioned the fact that you think that the german chancellor is wrong. there seems to be a pretty significant rift here between -- within the western powers on how to deal with this.\n\n\n\ndo you think that the u.s. should just arm the ukraine over the objections of the germans?\n\n\n\ncruz: well, look, there isn't a rift.\n\n\n\ni mean, what we're seeing is, when america doesn't lead, europe can't be expected to step into the breach. what is missing from this is the president of the united states. and i have got to tell you, dana, i'm part of a large bipartisan congressional delegation here. and it is striking that, across bipartisan lines, the delegation is united on the need for us to get serious and provide defensive arms to ukraine.\n\n\n\nbash: the president wasn't there speaking out this weekend, but the vice president gave a very strong speech. he even got applause from some of your fellow republicans, the secretary of state as well, with a pretty robust message toward the russians in defense of ukraine.\n\n\n\nisn't that leadership?\n\n\n\ncruz: look, the vice president, i thought, gave an effective speech, but i have got to tell you, in the room, what everyone kept saying is, interesting speech. we have no confidence that president obama is listening to the vice president.\n\n\n\nlisten, what we needed here and what we have needed for six years is strong american leadership. the obama-clinton-kerry foreign policy has been consistently wrong. it's been wrong on russia. it's been wrong on isis. it's been wrong on iran.\n\n\n\nwhat we needed today with regard to ukraine was presidential leadership that stood up and said, we're going to honor our treaty commitments. we're going to provide defensive weaponry for the ukrainians who are fighting to defend their own nation, to stand up to russian aggression. that's a message that would be heard by our allies.\n\n\n\nbut it's also a message that would be heard by our enemies, nations like iran, who are looking at the weakness of this administration and viewing it as an invitation for them to move even faster towards acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, you mentioned isis. let's turn to that.\n\n\n\nlindsey graham, your colleague who's there with you in munich, has called for 10,000 u.s. troops on the ground back in iraq to confront isis. is that a good idea?\n\n\n\ncruz: well, you know, we met today with the president of kurdistan. and the kurds on the ground are fantastic fighters.\n\n\n\nthe peshmerga have been our allies. they have been our friends. and they're actually fighting every day to stop isis. now, dana, what makes no sense whatsoever is, the obama administration is refusing to directly arm the kurds. we need to arm the kurds now because they are our boots on the ground.\n\n\n\ni don't believe it is necessary to put american boots on the ground if we are arming the peshmerga. they're fighting there. just today, they didn't ask us for boots on the ground, but what they did say is they need the weaponry to stand up and destroy isis. and the peshmerga on the ground, combined with overwhelming american airpower, can take out isis.\n\n\n\nbut we're not seeing leadership from the administration to get that done. instead, they continue to send weaponry to baghdad, who doesn't pass it onto the peshmerga, and it doesn't get put to use effectively.\n\n\n\nbash: so, you're saying lindsey graham and even some in the pentagon who apparently are considering about 10,000 u.s. troops on the ground, that would be a bad move?\n\n\n\ncruz: in my view, american boots on the ground should always be the last step, and we need to exercise other steps before that. we have the availability of overwhelming airpower, and we have\n\n\n\nboots on the ground that are ready and eager to fight the peshmerga, and they lack sufficient tools and equipment to do so.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, i want to turn to the plight of the u.s. aid worker kayla mueller, who is allegedly -- according to isis, they say that she died at the hands of a jordanian airstrike.\n\n\n\nwe don't know the -- her fate. but, big picture, do you think it should be the position of the united states to negotiate in order to get aid workers or americans who are hostages of groups like isis? because, currently, it is not.\n\n\n\ncruz: well, look, the reports coming from the ground are murky right now. we don't know her fate. certainly, our prayers are with her and her family. we hope these early reports that she was killed are inaccurate.\n\n\n\ni don't think it is a wise policy to be negotiating with terrorists. the obama administration has gone down that road. for example, in the negotiations for sergeant bergdahl, it released five senior taliban terrorists. there are now multiple reports that one or more of them have returned to actively fighting against americans, trying to -- trying to kill americans.\n\n\n\nbash: and...\n\n\n\ncruz: it doesn't make sense to -- to negotiate with terrorists.\n\n\n\nbash: and real quick, when i said negotiate, what i meant was, what they want is money. they want ransom. and it is the united states' policy not to do that.\n\n\n\nfamilies are very frustrated, because they want to do whatever they can to get their kid back. as a parent, do you understand that?\n\n\n\ncruz: oh, look, of course we all understand the agony of the families.\n\n\n\nbut giving money to terrorists that are using rape as a weapon of war, that are crucifying christians, that are crucifying and beheading children, giving money just buys additional arms for them to kidnap more americans, for them to murder more. that doesn't make any sense. the answer is to have serious leadership to defeat them.\n\n\n\nbash: ok, senator, we're going to take a quick break.\n\n\n\nand when we come back, we are going to talk about politics back home. and, believe it or not, there is another potential shutdown of part of the government looming. senator cruz is part of this debate.\n\n\n\nand we're going to talk about that after the break.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nbash: and we are back with senator ted cruz of texas who is joining us from munich where there is an international security conference going on.\n\n\n\nsenator, i want to bring it back home to the stalemate in congress over homeland security funding. the government again, that part of the government, runs out of money in just a few weeks. republicans are looking at you and wondering what is your end game here because this is a strategy crafted by you, the idea of holding up funding for the department of homeland security in order to try to stop the president and his executive order on immigration.\n\n\n\nso what is your end game?\n\n\n\ncruz: well, dana, the premise of that question is not true, and it's frankly ridiculous. this is a strategy that came from republican leadership. this is the cromnibus strategy.\n\n\n\nif you'll recall i fought tooth and nail against cromnibus in december because i said in december this gives up our leverage and it puts us into effectively a boxed canyon. so i would say it's now up to leadership to lay out their strategy. i told them this was not a winning strategy and they went down this road anyway fighting tooth and nail.\n\n\n\nbut let me make a broader point. what we saw last week was stunning irresponsibility from the senate democrats. the senate democrats three times filibustered funding for the department of homeland security. we have a bill on the floor to fund dhs.\n\n\n\nbash: right.\n\n\n\ncruz: and three times the democrats stood together filibustered and said, we will not allow the senate to take up this bill.\n\n\n\nbash: senator -\n\n\n\ncruz: at a time of growing national security threats across the world, that's irresponsible.\n\n\n\nbash: ok. senator, with respect, it's not a ridiculous premise because what you wanted to do was hold up the entire government funding back in december and the cromnibus, we won't get too much in the weeds here, was a compromise to try to work around that. so, that's i think the reality of what's going on here.\n\n\n\non your point about the democrats, yes, they are holding up the bill. they're not allowing debate, but in the reality that if there were a debate, this bill still wouldn't pass and, again, when i say this bill, it's funding the department of homeland security but also stopping the president for his executive action on immigration.\n\n\n\nthe votes aren't there to pass that, right?\n\n\n\ncruz: well, dana, number one, we need to fund the department of homeland security. the democrats need to stop holding national security hostage for partisan political objectives. what they're doing is wrong and irresponsible. number two, when it comes to amnesty, amnesty, the president's\n\n\n\nexecutive amnesty is wrong, it's illegal and it's unconstitutional. and you say it would necessarily get support in the senate. well, you know, it's interesting. we don't know that seven democrats had publicly criticized it on the campaign trail. they told their constituents they didn't support the president ignoring federal law, ignoring the constitution and unilaterally and illegally granting amnesty to four to 5 million people here illegally.\n\n\n\ni think we need to tee it up and give those senate democrats an opportunity to go on record to demonstrate...\n\n\n\nbash: and senator, are you talking to those senate democrats?\n\n\n\ncruz: ...whether they were telling the truth when they were talking to the voters back home or whether they'll just stand with president obama instead.\n\n\n\nbash: have you been workings behind the scenes to try to get those senate democrats to buck their president, to vote with you all and pass a bill that stops his executive action?\n\n\n\ncruz: you know, unfortunately right now, dana, the democrats are working as a unit to filibuster funding for the department of homeland security. and it's one of the patterns we've seen the last six years that's really unusual, is that senate democrats have consistently been unwilling to take on the president. it's part of why harry reid and the democrats shut down the senate. and i got to say it's unprecedented.\n\n\n\ni mean, look, dana, if there's one thing that i think you would acknowledge i've been willing to do is take on my own party when my own party is not standing for the principles we're supposed to stand for. it is time to see some senate democrats willing to take on their own president but right now they're putting partisan politics ahead of principle and that's why they're filibustering the funding for homeland security. it's the wrong thing to be doing.\n\n\n\nbash: you are dead right. you have had your differences, it's an understatement, with your party. and there are some that we talk to who say, here we go again, ted cruz taking us into a fight that we can't win again.\n\n\n\nwhat do you say to that?\n\n\n\ncruz: well, i think it's a good talking point for people who want to shift blame. let's be clear, the cromnibus was leadership's plan. i said at the time it is a bad plan and it is a plan that is designed to lose.\n\n\n\nbash: i want to turn to 2016 politics before we go.\n\n\n\nthe former governor of your state, rick perry, gave an interview to the texas tribune and the washington post, was asked about having you as a competitor potentially. and here's what he said. it's one of the selling points, if you will, to the american\n\n\n\npeople as they decide who is going to follow barack obama. i think they're going to make a rather radical shift away from a young, untested united states senator whose policies have really failed.\n\n\n\nouch. he's calling you the republican barack obama.\n\n\n\ncruz: listen, i like rick perry. he was a good governor in the state of texas. he's a friend of mine. people occasionally throw rocks in politics. that's his choice. i'm going say i think he did a good and effective job as governor of our state.\n\n\n\nbash: ok. taking the high road there. are you going to run for president, senator cruz?\n\n\n\ncruz: dana, i'm looking at it very, very seriously. i think we're facing enormous challenges in this country.\n\n\n\nthe obama economy has led to the lowest labor force participation since 1978. ninety-two million americans aren't working. obamacare is a train wreck. we're seeing our constitutional rights under assault. and abroad the obama-clinton-kerry foreign policy is an unmitigated disaster. leading from behind doesn't work.\n\n\n\nand i think this next election, 2016, is going to be a fundamental fork in the road. and i believe the american people are looking for a new path. they want to get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that were part of the foundation of this country. and so it's something that i'm looking at very seriously. and i'll tell you, the support we're seeing both on the grassroots level and also among the donors has been extraordinary, really has been encouraging.\n\n\n\nbash: wow, that certainly sounded like you've been practicing your stump speech in the mirror. thank you so much, senator cruz. appreciate your time.\n\n\n\ncruz: thank you, dana.\n\n\n\nbash: and up next, democratic senator, tim kaine, joins me for a very different perspective on what's needed to win the war on isis.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nbash: now that senator ted cruz has given us his take on homeland security and the war on isis, let's get a democratic perspective from the senate. senator tim kaine of virginia is also a member of the senate armed services committee.\n\n\n\nand senator, i want to start with what appears to be the question of the day, ground troops. do you believe that there should be ground troops in iraq to go after isis, as many as 10,000 as some are calling for?\n\n\n\nsen. tim kaine (d), virginia: dana, i actually believe there should be ground troops but they should be ground troops from the region and not u.s. ground troops.\n\n\n\ni heard the interview with senator cruz, the peshmerga, that is the fighting wing of the kurds, the iraqi security forces, other regional actors. i think we've just got to be candid. we cannot police a region that won't police itself and so the ground troops need to be from the region but the united states' strong support via the air campaign, via training and equipping, via helping guide, via air campaign to make that effective, that's what we should do. that's what we are doing and we can do more of it.\n\n\n\nbash: wow, first let's just say that you just agreed with senator cruz. i'm not sure that you expected to do that on many issues. but --\n\n\n\nkaine: no, on this one -- on this one we're in the same place because, again, we can't police a region that won't police itself.\n\n\n\ni was with king abdullah earlier this week. very emotional after the death of this jordanian pilot in a horrible way. even (ph) he said this fight against isil, it is our fight. it is the region's fight. the u.s. can help us but you can't do it for us. we've got to speak out against the regional terrorism and it's up to us to do it.\n\n\n\nbash: do you agree that the u.s. is not doing enough to fund and train the peshmerga to go ahead and help those in the region who do have the capability but need more?\n\n\n\nkaine: well, first, dana, i'll say we're doing a lot. today is the six month anniversary of the president starting the war against isil with this significant american air campaign. i have visited al udeid air force base in qatar where we're directing the campaign. and we provided significant assistance to the kurds and others. but i do think we can do more.\n\n\n\nso, in terms of providing more arms and assistance to the kurds, that's something that we should do. we should be building up the capacity, especially of the kurds and the iraqi security force, and also sunni tribal leaders in iraq because we've been able to kind of slow the advances of isil in iraq but we have to push back and then move on to the tougher aspect of how to take the fight to isil in syria.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, you mentioned it's been six months, which is kind of hard to believe, since the airstrikes have started. it's been happening without a new authorization from congress, which you have been calling for since day one. we now think that it's actually going to at least -- the wheels are going to start moving this coming week.\n\n\n\nkaine: yes.\n\n\n\nbash: what took so long?\n\n\n\nkaine: well, dana, it is -- it is not a pretty sight and i'm really sort of very discouraged, frankly both by the administration and by congress. when the president started this war on the eighth of august i\n\n\n\nindicated right from the start that there were not existing legal authorities from 2001 and 2002 that would justify this action and as soon as we decided to engage in a war on isil, and that's what the administration has called it.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, what --\n\n\n\nkaine: congress needed to weigh in.\n\n\n\nbash: and what is the administration saying to you, a fellow democrat who's been very outspoken about why they dragged their feet so long?\n\n\n\nkaine: well, partly because the congressional leadership went to the administration in july. both houses in both parties and i'm sad to say this, dana, but the leadership went to the white house and said, do what you need to do. we would rather not take this up before a mid-term election.\n\n\n\nso, i introduced a resolution in september authorizing limited military action against isil but congress wouldn't vote on it before the mid-term. and then i pushed it after november and i was able to get a vote in the senate foreign relations committee defining this mission in a limited way. we voted out a bill in the senate foreign relations committee in december but the house hasn't even been willing to talk about this in a committee.\n\n\n\nand i'll tell you what offends me about this. we've already lost american service members lives in this operation and we've done it without congress being willing to do the job of having a vote. if we're going to ask people to risk their lives, then congress ought to do our job and put our thumb print on this mission and say, it is in the national interest.\n\n\n\ni think the white house will send an authorization up. there's going to be some hard questions about it, but i think the president will find strong support in both houses for taking appropriate military action.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, let's just quickly drill down on the content of this resolution. there are differences over how specific congress should be about the question ever boots on the ground because...\n\n\n\nkaine: absolutely.\n\n\n\nbash: ...there's a lot of gray area there of what that actually means. i know that you support only having boots on the ground in limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nkaine: yes.\n\n\n\nbash: do you think that is (inaudible)?\n\n\n\nkaine: well, i think that congress in both parties would significantly support it. you heard senator cruz. he's not the only republican who has\n\n\n\nsaid to me that american boots on the ground is sort of a last resort. and so the resolution that i introduced that was passed, a version of it in foreign relations said, no combat troops except in following instances, the rescue of hostages or any americans that are captured. some directing of the airstrike campaigns to be more effective.\n\n\n\nso i think the right answer -- and there is a difference of opinion about this, but the right answer is only combat troops in limited circumstances, and then there's some other differences of opinion, too, that we're going to have to work through in hearings in the foreign relations committees.\n\n\n\nbash: ok. well, people are looking for bipartisanship on capitol hill. we saw some here just this morning. unlikely bipartisanship in opposition to ground troops but we heard it nonetheless. senator, thank you so much for your time. appreciate it.\n\n\n\nkaine: absolutely, dana.\n\n\n\nbash: and up next, the ever present backdrop of washington's politics. when homeland security becomes a political football, does everybody lose? a current member of congress and a former member of the intelligence committee joins us next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nbash: in war and in peace, the one constant here in washington is politics.\n\n\n\njoining me now congresswoman tulsi gabbard, an iraq combat veteran who is now a democrat from hawaii on both the armed services and foreign affairs committee, and mike rogers, cnn national security commentator and the former chair of the house intelligence committee. thanks to you both.\n\n\n\ni actually want to start with kayla mueller, the u.s. aid worker whose fate is unknown, and diane foley, who is the mother of one of the man who was beheaded, one of them, said this, kayla, along with our son and others were held for nearly two years and there were many opportunities along the way, several times when the captors reached out, several times when returning hostages brought sensitive information. and yet nothing was done to save our young americans.\n\n\n\nknowing what you know, i'll start with you, congresswoman, do you think that's true or is this understandably distraught feeling of a mother who lost her son?\n\n\n\nrep. tulsi gabbard (d), hawaii: well first of all it's unimaginable to try to put ourselves in her position or in the position of the parents of each of these people who have either been beheaded or slaughtered by this radical islamic extremist, terrorists.\n\n\n\ni think it's important for us as a country, as leaders of this nation, to not allow ourselves to be terrorized by these radical extremists, not allow ourselves to fall into the trap that they are trying to set up. and understand that when these very difficult things happen, just as we've seen most recently in jordan, that we must strengthen our resolve, we must strengthen our focus and commitment, understanding exactly who our enemy is, why they are perpetrating these horrific acts and then come up with an effective strategy to defeat them.\n\n\n\nbash: and you were in congress chairing the intelligence committee when a lot of these issues were coming up. is the u.s. doing enough? i mean --\n\n\n\nmike rogers, cnn national security commentator: it's a very difficult circumstance, obviously for the mother. i think she is distraught. she is trying to find rational thought in something completely irrational, the beheading of her son. that's set aside.\n\n\n\nthe united states took a pretty significant risk in sending a pretty daring rescue mission. now, the intelligence proved to be able old. they were a little slow in implementing. but the fact that they would risk these soldiers and special forces community's -- personnel's lives in the rescue attempts shows, i think, that there were good faith efforts.\n\n\n\nremember, in the foley case, the amount of money was something like $132 million, if my memory serves me correctly. that is not a realistic number for negotiation. they really never intended to turn foley over. they were using all of this for propaganda and that, i think, adds also to the difficulty.\n\n\n\nbash: so, that' a -- i mean, that's an interesting point, because some of these parents and family members, are saying the u.s. -- it's the u.s. policy law to prevent us from giving money and paying the ransom to get our family members back. i'm assuming that you think that that is a good policy to stick with particularly since you think it's just a ruse propaganda.\n\n\n\nrogers: i even think smaller amounts cause trouble. and remember, this is those hard decisions but that -- is that one person at risk really if you do this do you put -- how many other people do you put at risk? how many other americans do you make targets on their head who (ph) were operating in that region? that's the problem. and so it is horrific because you get to know this person but think of the people who are exposed if you make these ransom payments.\n\n\n\nbash: yes. congresswoman, i want to ask you about what to do now with regard to isis.\n\n\n\nyou are somebody who actually has been there. you were in combat in iraq. do you think it is the right thing to be sending in as many as 10,000 ground troops that some are calling for in order to just try to completely annihilate isis once and for all?\n\n\n\ngabbard: well first of all, in the question of ground troops, i agree with the two people, senator kaine as well as senator cruz who just spoke earlier that, yes, there do need to be ground troops on the ground to work in conjunction with the airstrikes that we and jordan and some of the other coalition forces are conducting in order to be effective. but i think we also need to take it one step previous.\n\n\n\nwe need to start with the basics, which is, first of all, identifying who are enemy is, understanding that this war cannot be won, this enemy and threat cannot be defeated unless we understand what's driving them, what is their ideology. and the fact is when you look at what is happening today, we have over 40 different islamic extremist terrorist groups going by different names. you look at the vast majority of terrorist attacks that are being committed around the world, there's one common element here and it is this radical islamist ideology. and in order to defeat it, we have to do so militarily but simultaneously, it has to be an ideological defeat as well as a political solution that's offered.\n\n\n\nbash: and on that note, you know, we've been hearing so much talk over the past couple of years about the fact that you've got to have a strong leader in the region to do the things that you just talked about. now, unfortunately because of what happened to the jordanian pilot, you have the king of jordan now being able to rally his people.\n\n\n\nis he the leader that the united states and western world has been looking for in order to combat the islamic extremists?\n\n\n\nrogers: the king who spent a lot of time of washington, d.c. over the last few years really talking about this growing extremist problem for the region in eastern syria. so he's been laying out plans literally for three years on how he thought that the united states should help the region. this could act as the catalyst for discussions that have already happened.\n\n\n\nand i think the king believed he couldn't wait any longer. and this was, in an odd way, his permission to engage in the very plans he's been laying out. he understood probably more than any other leader in that region the danger of this extremist group and what it meant to all of the leadership to simulate (ph) (inaudible).\n\n\n\nbash: and having been on the ground there, do you think that this was an unfortunate but maybe --\n\n\n\ngabbard: galvanizing...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: galvanizing and turning point?\n\n\n\ngabbard: ...were not only for the leadership of some of these more moderate muslim and arab countries but also for the people there to be able to support those actions.\n\n\n\nand i think, again, going back to my last point, the king of jordan when he was here just a few days ago, he made that point that this is about having a decisive military strategy coinciding with and ideological war that's existing now within islam. and this is something the king of jordan said has been going on now for the last 1400 years. and it's time for leaders to step up and take action.\n\n\n\nbash: congresswoman, thank you so much. former congressman, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n\n\ngabbard: thanks and aloha.\n\n\n\nbash: we will continue this discussion for sure. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nbash: thank you so much for watching state of the union. i'm dana bash in washington.\n\n\n\nfareed zakaria, gps, starts right now.
a little more than one month since president joe biden entered office, his cornerstone legislative priority -- a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package -- is on the path to passage by the deadline his administration set, largely mirroring the key elements he originally proposed.\n\nwhile biden's hope for gop support on capitol hill has all but disappeared in the last several weeks, his enthusiasm for the proposal -- and his view that despite its high price tag it will only serve to bolster democrats as they remain unified -- has hardly waned.\n\nasked what he learned from his efforts to sell the proposal at a cnn town hall in wisconsin earlier this week, biden didn't hesitate.\n\ni learned based on the polling data that they want everything that's in the plan, biden said. not a joke. everything that's in the plan.\n\nas house democrats prepare to push through the legislation next week, with senate democrats set to follow suit in short order, it's a moment that underscores a confluence of factors on politics, policy and quiet, but wide-ranging, behind-the-scenes work that has nearly all gone biden's way.\n\nit was equal parts an inside- and outside-the-beltway effort by the white house, aided by congressional democrats involved early, and often, on both the substance and politics of the proposal. supporters were boosted by a continuous run of positive public polling -- which white house officials and congressional leaders made a point of regularly putting in front of their members -- all as they sought to capitalize on state and district-level officials and advocacy groups they knew would hold sway on capitol hill.\n\nthe effort to sell the proposal started early in the process with biden's transition team regularly consulting with top democratic lawmakers as they constructed their plan. key elements, like the emergency expansion of the child tax credit -- a potentially transformative plank of the plan -- came directly from legislation drafted by democrats that held wide-ranging support in their congressional ranks. there was a recognition, multiple people directly involved said, that the cascading crises meant now was the moment to go big.\n\nby the time biden took office, his legislative affairs team -- made up of several former capitol hill hands who brought with them significant bipartisan credibility from their past staff work -- was already deeply engaged in the process.\n\nthat has carried on through the opening weeks of the administration. since february 5, the team has met with house and senate leadership multiple times a week, directly with 33 house members and held talks with more than 100 key congressional staffers.\n\nbiden's aides were also ever present as the dozen house committees moved through the process of considering each piece of the legislation, there for technical guidance, and on some of the thorniest issues like the qualification threshold for stimulus payments, even more than that, sources say.\n\nthe white house was bolstered by a pervasive posture from democrats on capitol hill: that letting the new president down in his first legislative push was never an option. even as democrats have privately grumbled about certain aspects of the bill -- whether it be the overall scope, the eligibility for who receives stimulus checks or the rise in the minimum wage -- most members acknowledge they'll ultimately vote for it.\n\neveryone is in the same place, one house democratic lawmaker told cnn. there are things we want fixed, but we aren't aggressively opposed. it is the president's first major package, and there are a lot of people who feel like this is his first ask, so for all those factors people are not aggressively threatening not to vote for it.\n\non top of that, multiple senators and aides point to polling showing the bill with overwhelming popularity even among some republican voters. they also argue the onslaught of local support from mayors, governors and county governments has made it hard for republicans to effectively message against it at home.\n\ndemocratic senators meet with president joe biden and vice president kamala harris to discuss his $1.9 trillion american rescue plan in the oval office at the white house on february 3.\n\nthe gop opposition\n\nin the senate, republican leaders are expected to make the case that the process of writing the bill has been flawed. while the bill went through house committees, it's expected to go straight to the floor in the senate.\n\nwe understand that, instead of building senate bills through regular-order deliberation, the democratic majority instead intends to bypass their own committees and bring the house bills straight onto the senate calendar and the floor. this would make senate democrats' first legislative act of the 117th congress the outsourcing of their own committee gavels to the house, a group of republican senators wrote to majority leader chuck schumer and minority leader mitch mcconnell.\n\nin the house, gop leadership has urged their conference to vote no on the package, pointing out a series of issues with abortion-related language and the bill's overall effect on the federal deficit.\n\nbut democrats argue it's easy to defend themselves on legislation that gives people direct checks, access to paid leave, an extension of unemployment insurance and doesn't create new or controversial programs. much of the bill is bolstering or a continuation of programs that many republicans already voted for.\n\nseveral democratic sources pointed out that there has been no significant opposition effort mounted to the plan -- no big outside spending to attack the plan, no unified push by gop campaign or advocacy groups to puncture the growing bubble of momentum.\n\nit stands in sharp contrast to the multi-group, multi-million dollar efforts put together by democrats as they sought to sink former president donald trump's top legislative priority -- the repeal and replacement of obamacare in 2017.\n\nmultiple gop officials noted the difference in circumstances: while health care is a highly polarizing issue, poll after poll has made clear that relief for a country struggling through dual economic and public health crises simply isn't.\n\nit's not like we're looking around and saying, 'hey, you know what would be a great idea? attacking stimulus checks to people,'  one senior gop official told cnn.\n\nrepublicans will oppose the bill for a series of reasons, from the topline cost on down, but the combination of a party still finding its way in the wake of trump's loss, along with a series of proposals that have maintained popularity, has stunted the force of the opposition, the official said.\n\nthe fact trump himself was the genesis for the $1,400 direct payments included in the democratic proposal is also not lost on republicans, multiple officials said.\n\ngop sens. susan collins and mitt romney lead a group of 10 fellow republican senators out of the west wing after meeting with president joe biden and vice president kamala harris at the white house earlier this month.\n\nthe outside game\n\nas washington was inundated with the impeachment trial of biden's predecessor, the white house took pains to make clear they both weren't involved and weren't paying attention. it wasn't entirely true -- biden was kept abreast of the trial and took to watching highlights each night, two sources said.\n\nbut what was true was the blitz biden's team was deploying outside of the beltway.\n\nthere were 70 local television appearances by senior administration officials and surrogates during a three-week period. an oval office meeting between biden and a bipartisan group of governors and mayors garnered major local coverage.\n\nthe white house office of intergovernmental affairs held a series of briefings with hundreds of state, local and tribal officials.\n\nall of that has contributed to a firm sense inside the white house that the politics are firmly in their favor, several aides made clear. and not just that supporters would be rewarded politically, but that those who opposed it -- congressional republicans -- would take a hit.\n\nin a memo to senior white house staff detailing several recent public polls, mike donilon, one of biden's closest advisers, said of the opposition: rather than being cost free, this approach has been quite damaging to them.\n\nvoters are hurting -- and they're looking for leadership that comes forward with plans and solutions, donilon wrote in the february 16 memo obtained by cnn. this is not a moment in the country when obstructionism will be rewarded.\n\nit's a position with which republicans disagree. there has been little hesitation from even moderate republicans to reject biden's plan, and the unbending nature of the white house's posture has led many gop senators to question whether biden was ever serious about bipartisanship to begin with.\n\nwhite house officials say he is, and will continue to be, on the lookout for opportunities to negotiate with republicans. but they see little sign that moving without republicans on their first legislation out of the gate will somehow poison future negotiations.\n\nthe hurdles ahead\n\nin order to build consensus quickly, aides and members say that a decision was made early to write a bill that tracked very closely with biden's own american rescue plan. the thinking from the start was that beginning from the ground up in committees could take too much time and potentially result in unnecessary democratic infighting in a moment when unity was paramount.\n\nstill, democratic leadership has worked closely with members in an effort to try and build a coalition of support. schumer has been having one-on-one conversations with individual members, trying to do the work ahead of time on what they need to support the bill.\n\nthe benefit is chuck's leadership style is through that flip phone. chuck is constantly in informal conversations with members, which makes moving a package like this a lot easier, said one democratic senator who spoke on background to discuss the ongoing caucus discussions about the covid relief bill.\n\nsenate majority leader chuck schumer in the capitol.\n\nsuccess still isn't guaranteed. a handful of moderate members have made it clear privately and in public statements that they can't support legislation that includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and schumer will need every single one of his members to back the bill in order to pass it.\n\nthere are not 50 votes signed on the dotted line, the democratic senator told cnn on the state of talks right now. i have still got changes to this package that i want.\n\nthe expectation among many democratic aides and members is that the $15 minimum wage, which is currently the biggest obstacle to getting the bill across the finish line, won't be allowed under the guardrails of reconciliation, a budget process that requires each provision to adhere to a strict set of rules but that could ultimately allow democrats to pass the legislation on a party-line vote.\n\nmy question is why are we including it and burning up time and promising people they will get a $15 minimum wage increase when we know it is not going to happen, one democratic member told cnn.\n\nif the senate's parliamentarian allows the provision to remain in the bill, it could force leadership to have to make tough political decisions about whether now is the time for that intra-party fight.\n\nthe perils of the high-wire act of relying solely on democrats in the senate was put on display friday, when sen. joe manchin, a west virginia democrat, announced he would oppose biden's pick to lead the office of management and budget, neera tanden. if tanden is unable to secure republican support -- something democrats have been exceedingly skeptical of up to this point -- manchin's no vote would effectively kill the nomination.\n\nit's a dynamic the white house is keenly aware of -- biden and his team have stayed in close contact with manchin and his aides in recent weeks.\n\nthe dashed hopes of bipartisanship\n\nat various points, the biggest threat to democratic unity was the desire among some members to fight for bipartisanship. many rank-and-file members sought to hold onto the idea that there was a middle ground, potentially willing to reshape the ultimate direction of the bill. biden himself had made clear before he took office that, as a 36-year veteran of the senate, he would seek bipartisan consensus.\n\nthey were encouraged by the president's own outreach directly to republicans and a high-profile oval office meeting where biden invited 10 republicans to discuss their own ideas directly with him.\n\na group of moderate senate democrats met frequently with republican counterparts to try and find a bipartisan compromise, holding out hope in happy hour settings, phone calls and zooms that the relief bill could be crafted in a way to attract gop support like the previous pandemic relief bills.\n\nbut after a group of senate republicans came out with a roughly $600 billion proposal that didn't include any direct state and local funding, many democratic senators immediately torpedoed the proposal, forcing even the moderates to evaluate how hard they ultimately were willing to push for bipartisanship or wait for it, and whether there was too much of a risk of losing votes on the progressive side of the caucus.\n\nat the same time, the message directly from biden was clear: bipartisanship would be ideal, but it wasn't a necessity, particularly given the bill's perceived popularity outside of washington.\n\nstill, a bipartisan group of house members took longer to convince. the problem solver's caucus -- a bipartisan group -- and the blue dog coalition -- a group of moderate and conservative democrats -- pushed separately behind the scenes for leadership and the white house to separate out vaccine funding from the larger coronavirus package as a way to move the funding faster and to provide a way for at least part of the relief bill to be bipartisan.\n\nother moderate democrats agreed. the argument was that the white house could move the package in two steps. but in conversations with biden's team, including chief of staff ron klain, the reality of the situation began to come into focus. separating out the bills could take time and potentially take the pressure off republicans to back the larger package altogether.\n\ndemocratic leaders and the white house made it clear: the package was going to stay together and so did democrats.

(photo by aaron p. bernstein/getty images)\n\nstory highlights cruz is widely expected to run again for president in 2020 if donald trump loses a general election match-up if trump loses, cruz could make the case that the outcome would have been far different with him as the nominee\n\n(cnn) —\n\ntexas sen. ted cruz promised his party tuesday that he is not suspending our fight for liberty.\n\nand that is precisely what many senate republicans fear.\n\nas he returns to capitol hill after ending his presidential campaign, cruz has grown more powerful and influential with core gop voters, giving him a major platform to upend his party leadership's most carefully constructed plans. and as congress prepares to deal with major national issues – including a rescue plan for puerto rico requiring immediate action and government funding in the fall – many believe cruz could use his new bully pulpit to wreak havoc on capitol hill should he want to.\n\nwith cruz widely expected to run again for president in 2020 if donald trump loses a general election match-up with hillary clinton, the texas freshman could once again use his fights with senate republicans as the basis of his run. and that is enough to unnerve many republicans.\n\nasked about cruz over the next four years, retiring indiana sen. dan coats – a leading cruz critic – said: all i know is i won't be here to enjoy the theater.\n\na big question for cruz now is whether he'll run for reelection for a second senate term in 2018. while he would be heavily favored to win in texas, he'd have to intensify his focus on local issues over the next two years and build a war chest in case a threat to his seat emerges.\n\nwhile he'd likely keep his seat, worrying about reelection could undermine his effort to build a national campaign and run again for president in 2020. and an upset could end his white house hopes.\n\ntwo gop senators who also ran in 2016, sens. rand paul of kentucky and marco rubio of florida, have not ruled out a repeat presidential run and both are viewed as likely to do so again. paul, however, is running for reelection this year, hoping to use the senate as a springboard to a possible future candidacy – while rubio is quitting the senate at year's end, planning to stay visible outside of government.\n\nand though many in the party establishment don't like cruz, some top republicans argued that the texas senator would have been a better general election nominee than trump. not only is he a disciplined candidate with views more in line with traditional republicans, but there would be a silver lining, they believed, if he lost: it would be hard for cruz to revive his political career.\n\nnow if trump loses, cruz could feel emboldened, making the case that the outcome would have been far different with him as the nominee. and as the runner-up in 2016, cruz would be viewed as a formidable candidate heading into 2020.\n\nstill, part of cruz's ability to rebound depends on whether he helps unify the gop or keeps his distance from trump after a bitter campaign. while cruz plans to be active as a surrogate in down-ticket races, he could anger trump supporters if he declines to help the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nat tuesday night's concession speech, cruz touched on a wide array of issues, from obamacare to national security, but he avoided one topic: donald trump.
but first, the bill has to go back to the other side of the capitol, where the house -- which already passed its own version of the bill -- is scheduled to vote tuesday to approve the changes made in the senate. that vote is expected to succeed on a party line, as it did in the senate, with a narrow democratic majority.\n\nonly after the house passes the senate version would it land on biden's desk.\n\nafter that, the turnaround time -- between it being a more than 600-page bill and money in people's pockets -- could be relatively quick. people could start seeing the $1,400 stimulus payments hit their bank accounts within days of biden signing the bill -- which is expected to happen soon after the house votes on tuesday.\n\nfor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the internal revenue service started sending out the second round of payments -- that were worth up to $600 -- three days after then-president donald trump signed that billn late december. but it's possible that tax filing season , which is currently underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nthe payments do not go all out at once. those whose bank information is on file with the irs would likely get the money first because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nstill, millions of people could be at risk of missing out because the irs does not know how to reach them. an estimated 8 million eligible people did not get the first stimulus payment, worth up to $1,200, which was approved last year and delivered over the spring and summer. while most people received the money automatically, very low-income people who don't normally file tax returns may have to take an extra step to register online or file a 2020 tax return.\n\nthis time, individuals earning less than $75,000 and couples earning less than $150,000 would receive the full $1,400 payment, plus an additional $1,400 per dependent. but the third round of checks would phase out faster than earlier payments -- completely cutting off individuals who earn more than $80,000 a year and married couples earning more than $160,000, regardless of how many children they have. payments would reach about 90% of families, according to an estimate from the penn wharton budget model.\n\nunemployment benefits\n\nas for unemployment benefits, the senate and house bills differ on the provisions.\n\nif the house approves the senate's changes and the bill is signed by biden in coming days, the jobless may see little or no break in payments. but it depends on their state.\n\nthe senate bill would continue the existing $300 weekly federal boost and two key pandemic unemployment programs through september 6. the house bill would provide a $400 weekly enhancement and continue it and the two pandemic programs through august 29.\n\nthe pandemic unemployment assistance program provides benefits to freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors and certain people affected by the pandemic, while the pandemic emergency unemployment compensation program increases the duration of payments for those in the traditional state unemployment system.\n\nunlike the relief package congress approved in december, this legislation should be signed before any laid-off workers run out of benefits, and there are far fewer changes than in the prior bill, said andrew stettner, senior fellow at the century foundation. still, some states will wait until the us department of labor releases all the necessary guidance to reprogram their systems.\n\nmost states should start sending out the jobless benefits in less than three weeks, he said.\n\nan estimated 11.4 million would begin to see their benefits without an extension of the programs,an estimated 11.4 million would begin to see their benefits start to lapse after next weekend and phase out over the next month, according to the century foundation. the $300 enhancement is also set to end next weekend.\n\nwhen congress passed the last relief bill extending the unemployment programs, some of the jobless had already started exhausting their pandemic benefits, which were created last march.\n\nalso, lawmakers added the $300 weekly enhancement and made changes to the pandemic programs. and trump waited to sign the bill until after benefits had lapsed for millions more out-of-work americans.\n\nsome states were able to enact the new provisions swiftly, but others took more than a month. the delays left the unemployed waiting for $17.6 billion in benefits in january, according to a separate analysis by the century foundation.\n\nchild tax credit\n\nother measures in the package, however, are new or involve larger changes to existing programs — including temporary enhancements to the child tax credit and federal premium subsidies for affordable care act plans, as well as for cobra policies for laid-off workers who want to keep their employer health insurance coverage.\n\nthese would take longer for federal agencies to implement so it could be several weeks, or even months, before americans receive them.\n\nfor instance, families may not see the boost in the child tax credit until the summer.\n\nthe house and senate bills call for increasing the credit to $3,600 for each child younger than 6 and to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 in 2021. it is currently a $2,000 credit for kids between the ages of 6 and 16.\n\nthe credit would also become fully refundable for the year and may be paid out monthly, rather than as a lump sum at tax time.\n\nfamilies could receive half their total credit as a periodic payment starting in july and running through the rest of the year, according to the legislation. they could then claim the remaining half on their 2021 tax returns.\n\nhealth insurance subsidies\n\namericans who would qualify for the relief package's heftier federal premium subsidies for affordable care act policies would need to wait until the new regulations are programmed into the obamacare exchanges, which might take a few weeks.\n\nenrollees would pay no more than 8.5% of their income towards coverage, down from nearly 10% now. also, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- would become eligible for help. the provision, which is retroactive to january, would last for two years.\n\nlower-income enrollees could have their premiums eliminated completely for the same period, and those collecting unemployment benefits could sign up for coverage with no premiums in 2021.\n\nthe adjustments to the existing subsidy programs could be done rather quickly, but the provision for the unemployed may take longer to implement since it is new, said larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation.\n\nonce the systems are updated, those who already have affordable care act policies could return to the exchange to see if they now qualify for assistance or larger subsidies. also, the uninsured have until may 15 to enroll in 2021 coverage on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and have extended sign-up periods in most states that run their own marketplaces. biden directed the reopening of the federal exchange through an executive order in late january.\n\nalso, the senate legislation provides a full premium subsidy through the end of september to laid-off workers who want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through cobra. the house bill would require them to pay 15% of the premium, which could still prove costly.\n\nthis provision could take longer to roll out since it's an entirely new benefit.\n\nmeanwhile, food stamp recipients would continue to get a 15% increase in benefits, but the boost would last through september, instead of expiring at the end of june, under the bills passed by both the senate and house.
new failures are piling up among the member-run health insurance co-ops carrying out one of obamacare's most idealistic goals, leaving just seven remaining when the health law's fourth enrollment season starts in the fall.\n\nthere were 23 in 2014.\n\nthe public knows them as co-ops. they're officially called consumer operated and oriented plans in the health law. eleven are still in business, but four in oregon, ohio, connecticut and illinois will disappear by fall due to financial insolvency. oregon's health co-op and connecticut's healthyct were told to close by their state's regulators last week. tuesday, the land of lincoln mutual health insurance co. in illinois was ordered to close by state regulators.\n\nfor the rest — which all posted annual losses in 2015, according to the national alliance of state health co-ops — survival is job no. 1. some are diversifying to serve larger employers, no longer limiting themselves to their aca mandate to offer health plans to individuals and small businesses. a maryland co-op has sued the federal government to avoid paying millions of dollars to other insurers under the aca's complex formula to keep premiums stable by balancing risks among insurers and helping ailing ones. other co-ops are trying to renegotiate contracts with hospitals and other providers.\n\na year ago, when more than 20 co-ops were up and running, about 1 million americans were insured through these plans. by contrast, the alliance says the seven co-ops that will remain in 2017 have about 350,000 members. their supporters continue to tout them for cost-effective coverage, pointing to sources such as a recent report by the government accountability office that found co-ops' average monthly premiums in 2015 were below the averages for other plans in most areas.\n\nthey are not essential for the success of the affordable care act, but they do offer an important alternative to commercial insurers, said timothy jost, a law professor at washington and lee university in virginia and an expert on the health law.\n\nrelated: health care spending expected to climb as america ages\n\noperated as nonprofits and seeded with federal loans, co-ops were conceived as an alternative to commercial insurance. co-ops' members serve on the board. advocates envisioned co-ops spurring competition by giving americans a way to buy health insurance from companies with a strong consumer focus.\n\nbut many struggled early — and their problems became part of the highly politicized debate over the law on capitol hill. either they increased enrollments too fast, and then could not keep up with rising health costs, or they could not gain enough members to help spread their costs.\n\nshortfalls in anticipated levels of federal funding contributed, too. at the end of 2014, for example, insurers got blindsided when money they had counted on to offset losses was cut sharply from the obamacare's risk corridor program. that program transfers funds from participating insurers with high profits to those with high losses. the move disproportionately hurt small insurers, according to the nonpartisan commonwealth fund.\n\nrelated: obama calls for 'public option' for obamacare\n\nfor the 2017 enrollment season, most co-ops have proposed increasing premiums, often by at least 10%. but raising premiums is only part of the solution.\n\nmaine's co-op, maine community health options, has contracted with a new pharmacy benefit manager, express scripts, with the aim of saving about $14 million annually by paying lower drug prices.\n\nit has 80,000 members, about 60% of the obamacare marketplace in the state. but the co-op estimated it has less than 5% of the market when large employers are included, a group it now will court for new customers.\n\nmaine community health is on track to make money, but not until 2017, said ceo kevin lewis.\n\nrelated: unitedhealth to exit california's obamacare market\n\nnew mexico health connections, a co-op with 47,000 members, is seeking to raise money from investors, which the obama administration only recently allowed co-ops to do, said the ceo, dr. martin hickey. it's also adding larger employers and labor groups, including some teacher unions, to its client base.\n\nthe only way to survive is to diversify, hickey said.\n\nmontana health co-op, which has about 35,000 members in idaho and montana, is focused on holding down administrative costs. it has about 20 full-time employees and hasn't replaced some that left. some people we had during our startup mode we figured we can now work without them, said spokeswoman karen early.\n\nmontana health, which lost about $40 million in 2015, also has requested an average premium increase of 21% in idaho for next year and 22% in montana, she said.\n\nmaryland's co-op, evergreen health, is challenging the federal government's decision last week ordering it to pay $24 million to other state insurers whose members had higher health risks in 2015.\n\nin addition to the health law's risk corridor program, which partially reimburses insurers for extreme losses, another provision requires insurers to make payments to competitors with sicker and costlier members. that is a sore point for evergreen. the co-op, which has about 40,000 members, sued the government in june, alleging that the risk-adjustment system is flawed because it does not adequately measure risk. the lawsuit is pending in federal court and a decision is expected this summer.\n\nthis story was produced by kaiser health news, which publishes california healthline, a service of the california health care foundation.

(ap photo/andrew harnik)\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump's vague platitudes about beautiful and very special health care for everybody are not going to cut it in his 2020 re-election race – after he was left exposed on the most urgent issue in american politics.\n\nan ill-timed move by the justice department to back the invalidation of the entire affordable care act offered a huge opening to democrats and inadvertently revealed a gaping political vulnerability for trump on tuesday.\n\nthe sudden pile on by democratic presidential candidates over the controversy, and the hurried scramble by trump and his aides to clean it up, offered an eloquent forecast of just how important health care will be in 2020.\n\na court fight led by republican attorneys general that precipitated the justice department policy shift could cause devastation in the health care market place and hit real-life coverage benefits for millions.\n\nit could also explode into the most heated months of the 2020 presidential showdown if obamacare's fate – for the third time – ends up before its previous savior, chief justice john roberts and his supreme court.\n\nwhite house counselor kellyanne conway tried the first damage control tuesday on an issue suddenly rocking washington, insisting that trump's budget would preserve coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nby lunchtime, trump's electoral antennae were twitching as the return of obamacare as a driving political issue trampled all over his end-of-the-mueller investigation victory party and hinted at trouble ahead.\n\nlet me tell you exactly what my message is: the republican party will soon be known as the party of health care, trump told reporters in a senate corridor during a visit to consult republican lawmakers. you watch.\n\nit was the kind of sweeping, non-specific promise that helped trump ride out the 2016 presidential race combined with base-pleasing threats to eradicate the proudest domestic accomplishment of his predecessor barack obama.\n\nbut tuesday's events were the first real sign that such an approach will not sustain trump in his re-election race.\n\nthat's partly because trump is now the personification of the government – he bears responsibility for the state of the health care industry and the struggle many americans are facing in affording spiraling costs of treatment.\n\ntheir plight has hardly been eased by the gop, which wasted two years of ultimately futile efforts to completely repeal obamacare when it enjoyed a monopoly on power in washington.\n\ngiven how entrenched obamacare has become, he is also in the position of looking like a leader trying to eradicate benefits – not provide new ones.\n\ntrump's unwillingness or inability to offer a comprehensive plan of his own to improve the health care of americans, other than his campaign trail hyperbole, hampered the repeal efforts to the gop in the house and the senate.\n\nwhen trump does talk about health care, it's mostly when he's lashing out at the late republican sen. john mccain for casting a crucial vote against repealing obamacare, rather than offering a comprehensive plan.\n\ntrump's 2020 campaign website boasts about promises kept – including the repeal of obamacare's individual mandate requiring the purchase of health insurance. but the listed achievements include plans like the multi-billion dollar effort to combat opioid abuse, which though worthy, does not come close to an explanation of how the health care system would work if the aca is finally killed off.\n\nvoters want answers\n\nit's a big risk for trump because voters are hungry for health care solutions.\n\nin the midterms, 41% of voters said health care was the most important issue facing the country. three-quarters of that number said they supported democrats. obamacare, so long an albatross for democrats during the previous administration, is now much more popular than it was, despite its failure to provide all middle-income americans with affordable options.\n\na recent kaiser family foundation survey found that in 21% of counties in the nation, a 40-year-old earning $50,000 would have to spend 10% of their income just to pay for aca premiums.\n\nsuch headaches are helping to drive the early stages of the presidential race and help suggest why trump, while currently vulnerable on the issue, could reap some political advantage with a serious effort to address the crisis.\n\nfrom a political perspective, the administration's revival of the health care debate was a disaster.\n\nit did not just distract from the president's attempt to make political capital out of an apparently favorable result from special counsel robert mueller's russia investigation, at least according to a summary by attorney general bill barr. it must also have irked trump that he was still being forced to deal with obamacare itself.\n\nhis frequent references to his predecessor leave no doubt about the importance he attaches to destroying obama's legacy.\n\nbut through successive elections, supreme court challenges and during the gop capitol hill majority, obamacare stubbornly clung to life.\n\nif trump fails to win a second term, the law will likely outlast his political career.\n\nsince there is little prospect of serious health care reform – possibly with the exception of a bipartisan bid to lower the cost of drugs – in the current divided government in washington, health care is sure to dominate the 2020 campaign.\n\na win-win for democrats\n\ntuesday's wrangle over the aca also had another political dimension – it let democrats off the hook.\n\nthe push left by democratic presidential candidates and the embrace by some of single-payer proposals like medicare for all opened a lane for the gop to use health care to claim their opponents had embraced socialism.\n\nbut the justice department changed the shape of the health care debate and allowed democrats off the defensive. they again stressed the mantra that trump is bent on ripping health care away from americans.\n\nthe steep cuts to medicaid and medicare unveiled in trump's 2020 budget unveiled this month only bolstered the attacks of eager presidential candidates.\n\nsen. bernie sanders of vermont tweeted that trump wanted to throw millions of americans off health insurance and put lives at risk, and pledged to fight back.\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren tweeted, health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. former texas rep. beto o'rourke vowed on twitter to protect the care of those whose lives depend on it.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi also may not have been able to believe her luck – as the administration handed her a way out of her dilemma of how to balance the apparently inconclusive outcome of the russia probe with demands by a small but vocal faction of her caucus for impeachment.\n\nshe could simply talk about something else – health care – which is all but certain to be more important to voters come 2020 than russia.\n\nlast night in federal court, the justice department of the trump administration, you'd think they'd have more to do, decided not only to try to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions, but to tear down every last benefit and protection the aca affords, pelosi said.\n\nthe gop will never stop trying to destroy the affordable health care of america's families.\n\nwere it not for the justice department's move, pelosi's dance would have been far more delicate as she unveiled a new plan on tuesday to strengthen the aca and to reverse some changes made to the law by trump.

(cnn) adapted from  the chief: the life and turbulent times of chief justice john roberts  by joan biskupic. copyright © 2019. available from basic books.\n\nchief justice john roberts arrived at the valletta campus of the university of malta on july 3, 2012, to teach a class on supreme court history. as he emerged from the back seat of a black sedan, he held his brown leather briefcase in front of him, almost as a shield. he wore a blue blazer, striped button-down shirt, and tan khakis. his clothes looked crisp, though his face was haggard. he was as exhausted and distressed as he had been in years.\n\nroberts had left behind a storm in washington over his opinion upholding president barack obama's health-care overhaul -- the affordable care act -- a stunning validation of obama's signature domestic achievement that transformed public perceptions of the chief justice.\n\nrepublicans in congress had been fighting the law dubbed obamacare at every turn for two years, and all the gop presidential candidates in 2012 had vowed to repeal it. and now roberts, a nominee of president george w. bush, had saved it.\n\ngoing forward, the chief justice would be viewed with skepticism by conservatives, despite also having taken the lead on limiting racial remedies and voting rights, helping roll back campaign finance regulations and voting for stronger second amendment gun rights.\n\nroberts' moves behind the scenes were as extraordinary as his ruling. he changed course multiple times. he was part of the majority of justices who initially voted in a private conference to strike down the individual insurance mandate -- the heart of the law -- but he also voted to uphold an expansion of medicaid for people near the poverty line.\n\ntwo months later, roberts had shifted on both.\n\nthe aca, signed by obama in 2010, followed decades of failed attempts in washington to control spiraling medical costs and provide americans with higher-quality health care. it created a marketplace where the uninsured could buy coverage and protected people from being unable to get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and other chronic illnesses. to support the system and draw in the healthy as well as the sick, the law required that most uninsured people obtain coverage (the individual mandate) or pay a penalty, to be collected as part of an individual's annual taxes -- a provision critical to the final ruling.\n\nthe law also expanded medicaid benefits to a wider range of needy individuals. the money for about 90% of that expansion would come from the federal government. but it would come with a strict condition: if states did not broaden their programs as dictated they would lose all medicaid funds.\n\nthe first meeting -- 5-4 against the mandate\n\nafter an unusual three full days of oral arguments in late march 2012 (a typical case gets one hour on one day), the nine justices gathered in a private conference room off the chief's chambers to cast initial votes. they were alone, with no law clerks or administrative staff.\n\nthe discussion focused on the individual insurance mandate and congress' power to regulate commerce. roberts went first, as was the custom, laying out his views. he emphasized that he believed the constitution's commerce clause never was intended to cover inactivity, such as the refusal to buy insurance.\n\nafter the chief, conservative justices antonin scalia, anthony kennedy and clarence thomas offered their views. like roberts, they thought congress' commerce authority did not cover an individual's decision to forgo -- rather than obtain -- health insurance. there were thus four immediate votes cast to invalidate the mandate. no one at the table was surprised, based on the questions during oral arguments and word from law clerks inside the building circulating intelligence among the justices' chambers.\n\nphotos: chief justice john roberts

22 of 22\n\nthe votes of the liberals were known, too. justice ruth bader ginsburg, fifth in seniority, was the first to cast a vote to uphold the individual mandate. she believed supreme court precedent demanded the law be found constitutional. she was followed by justice stephen breyer, who agreed with her. next in seniority was conservative samuel alito, who cast the fifth and final vote to strike down the law. the eighth and ninth justices at the table, liberals sonia sotomayor and elena kagan, joined ginsburg and breyer in voting for the law as part of congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.\n\nthere was no sign on march 30, 2012, that any of the nine would defy the usual ideological and partisan alignment. that political division bothered roberts, but he felt just as strongly about boundaries on the commerce power as the other four in the majority did.\n\nregarding medicaid, all four liberals voted to uphold the program, and roberts joined them. at the same time, he expressed some tentativeness.\n\nno vote had been taken related to congressional taxing power. it did not seem to matter, because the individual mandate was going to be struck down. the only uncertainty was whether any of obamacare would survive.\n\nroberts did not want the entire law to fall. a pro-business conservative, he understood the importance of the insurance industry to us businesses, and he was genuinely concerned about invalidating an entire law that had been approved through the democratic process to solve the intractable health care problem.\n\nbut his four fellow conservatives believed that if the individual mandate was going down, it should take the whole law with it. they believed all the pieces were interlocked. roberts thought the individual mandate was entwined with only two other provisions, those known as the community rating and guaranteed issue. the community-rating section prevented insurers from charging some individuals higher premiums than others based on health status. the guaranteed-issue section required insurers to cover people regardless of pre-existing conditions.\n\nas was his prerogative as chief justice, roberts chose to write the majority opinion, giving him the ability to shape what the court would ultimately say. senior liberal justice ginsburg was ready to write for the dissenting foursome.\n\nsoon after, roberts began trying to persuade kennedy to find that the unconstitutional insurance requirement could be severed from the rest of the law. but kennedy -- often a swing vote on high-profile cases -- was firm in his position. he was puzzled, and then put off, by roberts' view that the aca provisions could be severed.\n\nthe deal is struck\n\nlater in april, roberts tried another path. he began exploring whether, as the obama administration had argued, the individual mandate could be upheld as a tax. (cbs's jan crawford reported earlier on roberts' reversal on the mandate, but the full story of roberts' switch, including on medicaid expansion, and the changed votes of two liberal justices is detailed now for the first time.)\n\nthe chief justice then turned to breyer and kagan, the liberals most likely to work with him on contentious issues, to see if they could find common ground.\n\nat the same time, roberts began incorporating arguments that would invalidate the medicaid expansion. this was a strange turn. none of the lower courts that had taken up the aca had rejected the medicaid expansion, and it wasn't seen as controversial in terms of constitutional debate and public controversy.\n\nroberts posited in a draft opinion that congress had in effect held a gun to the head of the states by conditioning all medicaid money on the expanded coverage. yet he was not prepared to find that the expansion had to be scrapped altogether, only that states could not be forced to join through the leverage of losing all medicaid funding.\n\nbreyer and kagan had voted in the private march conference to uphold the new medicaid requirement, and their votes had been unequivocal. but they were pragmatists. if there was a chance that roberts would cast the critical vote to uphold the central plank of obamacare -- and negotiations in may were such that they still considered that a shaky proposition -- they were willing to meet him partway.\n\nwhen ginsburg found out about roberts' new position, her first thought was, it ain't over till it's over. she understood that the process could continue to be fluid, especially in such a monumental case.\n\npeople change their minds about what they thought. so it isn't at all something extraordinary, and that's how it should work. we're in the process of trying to persuade each other and then the public, she told me in a 2012 interview in her chambers.\n\nat the time, ginsburg knew that roberts was not deviating from his view of limited commerce clause power, and she wanted to make her dissent as persuasive as possible.\n\ni was forcing myself to stay awake and work on the opinion, ginsburg said.\n\nanother complication for ginsburg was that in late spring she had fallen on the marble floor of her bathroom and cracked several ribs. there was nothing to be done except to work through the pain.\n\nscalia and the other conservatives were livid at the development. scalia believed the taxing-power possibility had never truly been discussed in court, calling it a fly-by-night briefing. kennedy thought roberts had presented his interpretation as judicial modesty, when it amounted instead to a vast judicial overreaching.\n\njust watched trump fires back after roberts rebukes him replay more videos ... must watch trump fires back after roberts rebukes him 02:57\n\nthe announcement\n\nthe decision was revealed on june 28, the last courtroom sitting of the 2011-12 session. as roberts began reading his opinion from the bench, he tried to speak steadily, but he was nervous. about 13 minutes into the 20-minute announcement, after he had summarized various legal rationales, he misstated the overall judgment. few noticed the slip because he had already laid out the reasoning.\n\nas roberts spoke, he occasionally looked out at the spectators. among them was retired justice john paul stevens, who later said he thought the chief had shown integrity.\n\nhe had to be thinking he did the right thing, stevens said in a 2016 interview in his chambers, because he certainly made himself very unpopular with the conservatives.\n\nperhaps roberts' move was born of a concern for the business of health care. perhaps he had worries about his own legitimacy and legacy, intertwined with concerns about the legitimacy and legacy of the court. perhaps his change of heart really arose from a sudden new understanding of congressional taxing power. however the chief would explain it -- and he has not explained it beyond his written opinion -- the case added a new dimension to a man who insisted that he always decided cases based on the law.\n\nviewed only through a judicial lens, his moves were not consistent, and his legal arguments were not entirely coherent. but he brought people and their different interests together. his moves may have been good for the country at a time of division and a real crisis in health care, even as they engendered, in the years since, anger, confusion and distrust.\n\ncriticism on the right -- from insiders and outsiders -- was swift, including from the wall street journal editorial page, which described the decision as shot through with confusion.\n\ndonald trump, three years from launching his presidential run, went right to twitter: wow, the supreme court passed @obamacare. i guess justice roberts wanted to be part of georgetown society more than anyone knew.\n\ntrump later added: john roberts arrived in malta yesterday. maybe we will get lucky and he will stay there.\n\nwow, the supreme court passed @obamacare. i guess @justiceroberts wanted to be a part of georgetown society more than anyone knew. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june

mccain was a hero whether you liked some of his approach is or not. i liked them and i'd be for that, hatch said.\n\nothers, like mccain's longtime best friend in the senate, sen. lindsey graham also proposed naming the capitol visitor's center, within the capitol complex, after him.\n\ni'd name the capitol after him, if i could, graham told reporters last year, noting though that an important piece of this was the mccain family's input in how they wanted to see mccain memorialized.\n\nformer sen. jeff flake, who co-sponsored schumer's resolution to rename the building back when he was still in office, retweeted schumer's tweet wednesday.\n\nit would be a fitting tribute to john mccain, flake wrote in his retweet. kudos to senator schumer for reintroducing it.\n\nlawmakers defend mccain after latest criticism from trump\n\na number of senate republicans, including mitt romney, martha mcsally and graham, have spoken out in recent days in defense of mccain after the president once again targeted him for criticism.\n\nmccain was a frequent critic of the president while he was alive and the president often lashed out at the senator, once famously saying that mccain – a vietnam war veteran who was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years – was not a war hero.\n\nin one tweet over the weekend, the president attacked mccain for opposing a republican effort to repeal obamacare, describing it as a stain against the late senator.\n\ni can't understand why the president would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend john mccain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and god, romney tweeted on tuesday.\n\non wednesday, gop sen. johnny isakson called the president's criticism of mccain deplorable.\n\nit's deplorable what he said, isakson told georgia public broadcasting on wednesday afternoon when asked about a series of critical comments trump has made about mccain. that's what i said on the floor of the senate seven months ago. it will be deplorable seven months from now if he says it again and i will continue to speak out, he said.\n\ncnn's lauren fox and ted barrett contributed to this report.

[it] helps a lot of people who don't have adequate health care coverage — and i don't know what they would do without it.\n\naside from providing health care to a largely poor population, it provides hundreds of jobs in a town that locals say never recovered after industries such as coal mining and glass manufacturing disappeared.\n\nbut in the wake of this fall's presidential election, highlands — like many other rural hospitals — will likely face new financial challenges that will intensify longstanding struggles, experts say.\n\nthe affordable care act, which president-elect donald trump has vowed to repeal, threw a number of life-savers to these vital but financially troubled centers. and its full repeal, without a comparable and viable replacement, could signal their death knell.\n\nhighlands provides one window into how some of these shifts could reverberate in small towns across the country. and ironically, 64 percent of people here in fayette county — one of the state's poorest — voted for trump. pennsylvania, which has the third largest rural population in the nation, played a pivotal role in his upset victory this fall.\n\nthe health care law expanded medicaid to tens of thousands of previously uninsured patients, providing new revenue streams for rural hospitals, which often serve a poorer, sicker patient population. the law also created a program that allowed some of these facilities to buy prescription drugs at a discount, though highlands qualified for that program independently of obamacare.\n\nall these rural hospitals are operating on thin margins. the removal of any income source or coverage, or expansion of bad debt, is going to create significant financial hardship, said alan morgan, ceo of the national rural health association.\n\nrural hospitals have long operated on the edge. in the past six years, more than 70 such facilities have closed, citing financial duress. almost 700 more have been deemed at risk of following the same path.\n\nmeanwhile, the need for reliable health care remains pressing. conditions such as heart and lung disease (pdf) are widespread in rural areas. addiction to the prescription painkillers known as opioids is acute. nationally, the medicaid expansion offered a bit of stability for some rural hospitals at risk of closure.\n\nresearchers say it disproportionately benefited such facilities — particularly here and other states with large rural populations, such as illinois, kentucky and michigan.\n\nin pennsylvania, 625,000 people enrolled in the expanded medicaid program. close to 300,000 came from rural areas, said andy carter, president of the hospital and health system association of pennsylvania.\n\nas of october, about 42,700 of fayette's residents had medicaid, according to state data, an increase of about 8 percent from 39,460 in june 2015. (pennsylvania's medicaid expansion took effect in january of that year.) that's close to one-third of the county's population.\n\ndespite that, highlands cfo andursky said he barely noticed the increase — the threat of closure is a daily concern, he said. it seems like you're taking two steps forward, three steps back, andursky said. it's not like i can look to five years out — because i have to worry about tomorrow. i can't worry about next year.\n\nphoto: shefali luthra/khn john andursky, cfo of rural highlands hospital, says that making ends meet is a daily struggle.\n\nthat pessimism can be heard throughout this town of about 7,600 residents. while the law was described as historic, many here do not perceive that it helped them. like many other states, pennsylvania re-branded their expanded offering of federal insurance program for the poor, fearing that medicaid which is also often referred to as medical assistance would be off-putting; now it is called healthy pa.\n\nbryan mcmullin, a 47-year-old who works in connellsville's river-rafting business, got coverage last year but said good health care remains hard to come by. in this area, nothing's changed in 40 years, no matter who is president, he explained from a barstool at a pub near the now-vacant glass factory.\n\ndaniel martin, a 28-year-old highlands patient who also works in the rafting trade said he uses his new coverage for his monthly blood medication. a trump voter, he hadn't realized that coverage now could be in jeopardy.\n\nand small towns like this tend to be far sicker than the norm. in fayette, more than 1 in 10 people is estimated to have diabetes. out of 67 counties in the state, fayette ranks 66th for health outcomes and more than a third of its residents are obese.\n\nit's tied with northern potter county for the second-highest teen birth rate in the state. between 2014 and 2015, the county saw about 31 people overdose for every 100,000, according to an analysis by the federal drug enforcement administration (pdf).\n\nplus, the hospital is connellsville's second-largest single employer (pdf), after the school district. it contributes an estimated $15 million to the local economy, andursky said. that's in a town where unemployment's already at 7.6 percent — up from last year and higher than the state and national averages.\n\nwhen i was a kid, everybody had a job, everybody had health care. now, look at the statistics, said mcmullin, one of the rafters.\n\nthere are other hospitals in the region.\n\nphoto: shefali luthra/khn with 64 beds, highlands hospital is a crucial economic engine and a key source of local health care.\n\nuniontown, about 15 miles away, is also in fayette county. it has 175 beds — more than double highlands — but no behavioral health services to treat problems like addiction. frick, another small rural hospital about 12 miles away, technically serves neighboring westmoreland county. for more serious conditions, and trauma care, university hospitals are about an hour away — in pittsburgh on one end, and morgantown, west virginia, on the other. patients in extremis often get stabilized at the local hospitals before transfer.\n\nfollow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.\n\nbut rain and snow, combined with mountainous terrain and limited public transit, mean traveling even short distances poses hardship. it is still challenging to have to travel even 20 miles to get your care, said lisa davis, director of pennsylvania's office of rural health and outreach associate professor of health policy and administration at pennsylvania state university. it could take you all day to get to a one-hour appointment.\n\nin a medical emergency, getting care quickly can mean the difference between life and death\n\nso far, the incoming trump administration hasn't released its health plan to replace obamacare. but, experts say, it is likely to give the states less federal money for treating the poor. it is unclear how rural hospitals will compensate for the financial benefits they are likely to lose — or how many more rural hospitals will fall.\n\nwhat they need to do is be sure to protect the government programs: medicare and medical assistance, andursky said. we can't put them at risk.
president obama joined the chorus of democrats calling for the creation of a government run health insurance program as obamacare is facing growing problems.\n\nin an article published monday in the journal of the american medical association, the president called for congress to revisit the public option for obamacare in areas where few insurers offer coverage.\n\nsome parts of the country have struggled with limited insurance market competition for many years, which is one reason that, in the original debate over health reform, congress considered and i supported including a medicare-like public plan, obama wrote in the piece.\n\na public option would mean a government run health insurance plan.\n\nadding a public plan in such areas would strengthen the marketplace approach, giving consumers more affordable options while also creating savings for the federal government, the president wrote.\n\nobama's call comes days after presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton voiced support for a public option, in a nod to supporters of bernie sanders, who wanted the federal government to take over providing health care coverage for all americans.\n\nrelated: hours before debate, sanders releases medicare-for-all plan\n\nsome democrats have long wanted to develop a government-sponsored health plan that would insure americans under the age of 65, but they have never succeeded.\n\ninstead, obamacare funded the creation of non-profit co-op insurers to provide consumers with alternatives. but more than half of them have failed since their debut in 2014, undone mainly by enrollees' unexpectedly high medical use. other insurers -- particularly unitedhealthcare (unh) -- have announced they are pulling out of obamacare, further restricting consumers' choices.\n\nresidents in 664 counties, most of them rural, may only have one insurer to choose from in 2017, according to a kaiser family foundation review. that's up from 225 counties this year. obama notes that 12% of enrollees live in areas with only one or two insurers.\n\nthree years after obamacare's exchanges opened for business, the program is facing challenges.\n\nmany insurers found enrollees have higher health care needs than expected, forcing them to hike rates. a recent kaiser study found the benchmark silver plan premiums are projected to rise 10% for 2017, on average, for a 40-year-old consumer in 14 major cities. that's double the 5% increase for 2016 policies, but it could change since state regulators often reduce insurers' rate requests.\n\nrelated: insurers want to hike obamacare premiums 10% for 2017\n\nin the jama article, obama made several other recommendations for improving obamacare. he called on the 19 states who have not expanded medicaid to do so and on congress to increase financial assistance to make obamacare coverage more affordable. and he said congress should help reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring drug makers to disclose their production and development costs, increasing the rebates manufacturers must give for drugs prescribed to certain medicare and medicaid beneficiaries, and allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for certain high-cost medications.\n\nthe president hailed obamacare for reducing the uninsured rate from 16% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015 and providing more comprehensive coverage for millions of americans. he also credited health reform for helping slow the growth rate of health care costs in recent years.

source: cnn watch the entire donald trump news conference\n\ntrump during his campaign, and after being elected, asserted over and again the us, mostly because of obama, had been diminished in the eyes of the world. he pledged to reverse that and restore those purported losses.\n\nwhile it's unclear exactly how outsiders' views of the us have shifted over the past three weeks, gallup found that only 29% americans believe other countries around the world have respect for the president. two-thirds of respondents said they did not.\n\nhere's how those numbers stack up against presidents obama and george w. bush at similar stages of their first terms:\n\ntravel ban and a reckoning with the courts\n\nanother central tenet of his campaign, the ban – proposed at first to target all muslims, then reframed after his swearing-in to focus on citizens from seven majority muslim nations – has been the administration's most controversial initiative so far.\n\nthe executive order, which also paused the us refugee program and halted the entry of syrian refugees indefinitely, set off mass protests around the country. within 24 hours, judges were hearing arguments against it. now, after seeing it blocked in multiple venues, trump will have to decide if he wants a supreme court showdown or to go back to the drawing board.\n\n00:54 - source: cnn trump hints at new security measures\n\non friday, he signaled both options remained on the table. and more pointedly, doubled down on his argument in favor of some kind of ban.\n\nthere are tremendous threats to our country, he said during a joint press conference with japanese prime minister shinzo abe, eschewing specifics but suggesting that he, as president, was privy to information that would shake the broader public.\n\nhowever it plays out, what's clear now is that trump's december 2015 announcement calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on is a long way off – and even more measured versions have significant challenges ahead.\n\nsanctuary cities no harbor for trump's policies\n\nin another early executive action, trump signed an order seeking to ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive federal funds, except as mandated by law.\n\ndelivered days before the travel ban, this too set off an avalanche of protest, both in the streets and among mostly democratic leaders in major urban centers like new york, chicago and los angeles. smaller cities like new haven, connecticut, and austin, texas, have also threatened to fight back in court.\n\n02:03 - source: cnn mayors fight trump's sanctuary city order\n\nand in an ironic twist, los angeles mayor eric garcetti (among others) pointed to a 2012 supreme court case to explain why they're so confident. the ruling in nfib vs. sebelius, which allowed states to reject medicaid expansion without the threat of losing pre-existing funds, set a precedent trump's opponents say will prevent him from using federal money as a tool to coerce local governments.\n\nin the private dealings of his family business, trump's decision-making went unquestioned – at least publicly. but the presidency is ruled by a different calculus, one its new resident, three weeks into his four year term, is struggling to command.
el republicano agredió tanto a sus contrincantes como a uno de los asistentes en un acto en nevada, de cara a las primarias de su partido el próximo martes. (crédito: getty images)\n\n(cnn) — donald trump soltó una fuerte retórica contra sus rivales así como contra un manifestante que estaba en una congregación del lunes por la noche, en el crepúsculo antes de las asambleas electorales de nevada.\n\n«me gustaría darle un puñetazo en la cara», dijo trump al hacer la observación de un hombre que creó problemas en su concentración y que fue acompañado hasta afuera con una sonrisa en su rostro. «él está sonriendo, está pasando un buen rato».\n\ntrump afirmó que el manifestante era «desagradable como el infierno» y acusó al hombre de intentar pegarle a los agentes de seguridad que le forzaron a salir de la concentración, aunque no parecía que el hombre estuviera peleando contra esos agentes.\n\n«en los viejos tiempos», añadió trump, los manifestantes eran «sacados en camillas».\n\n«ya no se nos permite hacer retroceder más», dijo trump.\n\npublicidad\n\nmientras que trump en ocasiones ha instado a no lastimar a los manifestantes, también ha sugerido repetidamente que los manifestantes deberían ser manejados de manera más brusca.\n\ncuando un manifestante de black lives matter fue golpeado y pateado por los asistentes en una manifestación de trump en el otoño pasado, el día siguiente trump observó que «quizás le deberían haber dado una paliza».\n\npoco después de ese incidente, la campaña de trump comenzó a hacer un anuncio al principio de sus manifestaciones mediante el que instaba a los partidarios a no lastimar a ningún manifestante, sino que en lugar de eso, gritaran: «trump, trump, trump» y que esperaran que los agentes de seguridad acompañaran a los manifestantes hasta afuera.\n\nla campaña de trump no hizo el anuncio antes de la concentración del lunes. no estaba claro qué era lo que protestaba el hombre que causó la interrupción.\n\nmomentos antes, otro hombre levantó una pancarta que decía: «los veteranos le dicen a trump: termina ya tu discurso de odio contra los musulmanes».\n\ntrump contra cruz: 'algo está mal con este tipo'\n\nel favorito del partido republicano también incrementó sus ataques contra el senador ted cruz, refiriéndose a su rival presidencial republicano como «enfermo».\n\ntrump apuntó contra las tácticas de campaña del senador cruz, entre ellas los anuncios que cruz y sus aliados han levantado contra trump.\n\n«este individuo está enfermo, hay algo mal con este tipo», dijo trump.\n\nla campaña de cruz ha dirigido varios anuncios que examinan el historial de trump en una variedad de temas importantes para los conservadores, entre ellos el apoyo de trump hacia el derecho al aborto y las medidas más estrictas de control de armas.\n\n«¿acaso me perdí la parte en la que donald desafía nuestros hechos?», le dijo la portavoz de cruz, catherine frazier, a cnn. «él no puede, porque nuestros anuncios hablan la verdad… él no es un verdadero conservador. él no puede defender su historial, así que como un niño frustrado, él recurre a los insultos».\n\ntrump ha criticado en repetidas ocasiones a cruz ya que el senador de texas subió en las encuestas antes de las asambleas electorales de iowa y desde entonces ha incrementado sus ataques contra él puesto que cruz venció a trump en la contienda de iowa.\n\nel senador de texas, por su parte, ha criticado a trump en una gama de temas, desde cuando trump apoyó el derecho al aborto en 1999 hasta el uso que trump ha hecho de las leyes de dominio eminente para obtener beneficios personales. él también ha sugerido que trump, quien se ha comprometido a revocar el obamacare, apoya esa ley distintiva del cuidado de la salud, pues apunta a la entrevista de trump del mes de septiembre con «60 minutes», en la cual trump dijo: «todos tienen que ser cubiertos», cuando se le preguntó si apoyaba la atención de salud universal.\n\ntrump: '¿qué diablos es una asamblea electoral? '\n\nla concentración del lunes de trump viene en la víspera de las asambleas electorales de nevada, y trump usó mucho tiempo de su discurso instando a sus partidarios para que se dirigieran a las asambleas electorales para darle lo que sería su tercera victoria consecutiva en las primarias del partido republicano.\n\n«todos dicen que trump va a ganar mañana. solo suponemos que vamos a quedar empatados», le dijo trump a sus partidarios el lunes por la noche.\n\ny trump, quien ha criticado el proceso de las asambleas electorales desde que perdió frente a cruz en iowa, le dijo a sus partidarios que se olvidaran del proceso –un poco más arduo– de las asambleas electorales, el cual implica que los votantes se reúnan en una ubicación para la asamblea y que escuchen discursos para cada candidato antes de emitir su voto.\n\n«olvídate del término asamblea electoral, solo ve y emite tu voto, ¿de acuerdo?», dijo trump. «¿qué diablos es una asamblea electoral? nadie sabe siquiera lo que significa».\n\nbeck, partidario de cruz, denuncia a trump como un 'acosador'\n\nen una concentración de cruz, en elko, el lunes más temprano, el partidario glenn beck condenó ese tipo de arranques de trump… refiriéndose a él como un acosador y pidiéndole a los votantes de nevada que rechacen ese tipo de retórica.\n\nbeck criticó a trump por amenazar a los manifestantes en las concentraciones anteriores, y señaló que trump emitió un tuit amenazante el lunes dirigido a la familia ricketts, la cual ha sido activa en el área política en los ciclos recientes.\n\n«escuché que la familia (ricketts), que es la propietaria de los chicago cubs, en secreto está gastando dólares en mi contra. ellos deberían tener cuidado porque tienen mucho que esconder», tuiteó trump.\n\ni hear the rickets family, who own the chicago cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. they better be careful, they have a lot to hide! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) february 22, 2016\n\n«cuando tenemos un candidato que amenaza a las personas», dijo beck, «esto no es algo estadounidense, esta no es justicia igualitaria, esto no es lo que nosotros somos».\n\n«si cedemos a nuestra ira, si empezamos a ir por ese camino y empezamos a escuchar a los acosadores, entonces perdemos lo que no hizo grandes», dijo beck antes de presentar a cruz.
(cnn) sixty-one: that's the number of arrests washington, dc, police made the day rioters laid siege to the capitol in protest of president-elect joe biden's electoral victory.\n\nmore have been arrested since, and several jurisdictions are now involved in hunting down the supporters of president donald trump who invaded and ransacked the capitol during a joint session of congress to affirm biden's win. some are already facing federal charges\n\nyet during an episode described as insurrection and an attempted coup, police made only 61 unrest-related arrests that day -- and only about half of those were on capitol grounds, metropolitan police department chief robert contee said last week.\n\nnumerous media outlets, including cnn , have provided comparisons between the arrests during wednesday's siege and those made during the summer's black lives matters protests in the capital.\n\nit's valuable context, for sure, and raises important discussions about police and race, but a longer view shows the blm protests were but one example where police in the nation's capital seemed ready to respond with the full force of the law.\n\nhere are some examples, by the numbers:\n\n133 lgbtq activists, october 8, 2019\n\nlgbt protesters perform a sit-in outside the us supreme court.\n\njust across first street from the capitol, the us supreme court was set to hear arguments in three cases that many gay rights supporters felt would dictate the level of protection they'd receive under the 1964 civil rights act and title vii's employment rules.\n\nactivists sat in first street in an act of civil disobedience, reported the washington blade , an lgbtq news outlet that quoted us capitol police saying the demonstrators were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.\n\n147 climate change protesters, january 10, 2020\n\npolice move back protesters at a climate change demonstration on capitol hill.\n\nactor jane fonda's fire drill fridays produced numerous arrests -- many of them celebrities -- in late 2019 and early 2020, as the ex-wife of cnn founder ted turner took her anger over climate change inaction to the capital.\n\nin the 14th week of protests, joaquin phoenix and martin sheen were among the stars who found themselves in custody, as capitol police verified scores of people were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding.\n\n181 obamacare supporters, september 25, 2017\n\ncapitol police arrest protesters from disabled rights groups as they interrupt a senate hearing.\n\nthe affordable care act in the summer of 2017, protests erupted week after week in the capital, spurring several days of arrests. on two separate days in july, capitol police confirmed to cnn when the gop began attempts to dismantlethe affordable care act in the summer of 2017, protests erupted week after week in the capital, spurring several days of arrests. on two separate days in july, capitol police confirmed to cnn officers had arrested 80 and then 155 protesters who had entered the halls of congress to engage in peaceful protests -- sit-ins, chanting, lying on the ground and the like.\n\nthe largest single-day arrest count from the protests, however, came in september, when demonstrators -- many of whom, reuters reported, were in wheelchairs (most of them belonged to a disability rights group ) -- delayed a senate hearing. capitol police began rounding them up en masse.\n\nfifteen were charged with disrupting congress and 166 were charged with crowding, disrupting or incommoding, with 23 of those facing an additional charge of resisting arrest, according to capitol police\n\n217 trump inauguration protesters, january 20, 2017\n\npolice officers pepper spray protesters before the inauguration of president-elect donald trump in 2017.\n\nas demonstrations broke out across the country, police in the nation's capital dealt with ugly street clashes between police and antifa in downtown washington.\n\nsix officers were injured, and police deployed pepper spray after, cnn reported , bursts of chaos erupted on 12th and k streets as black-clad 'antifascist' protesters smashed storefronts and bus stops, hammered out the windows of a limousine and eventually launched rocks at a phalanx of police lined up in an eastbound crosswalk. officers responded by launching smoke and flash-bang devices, which could be heard from blocks away, into the street to disperse the crowds.\n\n302 brett kavanaugh opponents, october 4, 2018\n\ncapitol police arrest demonstrators protesting us supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh.\n\nseveral days of protest over the nomination of kavanaugh to the us supreme court yielded hundreds of arrests, but many of them came on a single day, as lawmakers reviewed an fbi report outlining allegations against the would-be justice.\n\nit was another star-studded affair, as comedian amy schumer and model emily ratajkowski were among those taken into custody.\n\nthe arrests began mid-afternoon with 293 people arrested for unlawfully demonstrating in a senate building and nine more arrested later in another senate building, a capitol police spokeswoman said. all were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, the department said\n\n316 black lives matter protesters, june 1, 2020\n\na police officer charges forward during black lives matter protests in front of the white house.\n\nmany found themselves asking wednesday: where are the police and military?\n\nno one asked such questions in june, when black lives matter protesters, decrying the deaths of george floyd and other african americans at the hands of police, took to the streets to find military helicopters hovering over the city, national guard troops patrolling the streets and tear gas filling the air.\n\nan analysis of metropolitan police department data shows local police arrested five times as many people during the floyd protests as they did during last week's insurrection.\n\n372 keystone

protesters from several groups marching 150 miles south to stage a sit-in on the capitol steps, denouncing the influence of big money on politics and congress' refusal to reverse it. on a single day of the lengthy protests, capitol police arrested more than 400 people for unlawful demonstration activity, and they were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.\n\nwhile the progressive change campaign committee cast the demonstrations as nonviolent civil disobedience, aimed at starting conversations on key democracy issues, numerous media outlets reported more than 900 arrests during the protests. salon pegged the final tally at 1,240 over a week of protests.\n\n575 immigration policy protesters, june 28, 2018\n\nprotesters line up as they're arrested in the hart senate office building.\n\nmore than 1,000 women marched through washington, protesting the trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the us-mexico border. rep. pramila jayapal, a democrat from washington, was among the hundreds arrested , according to capitol police.\n\nthe demonstrations were largely peaceful. protesters scarcely argued with the officers arresting them, who in most cases declined to even employ handcuffs in taking the women into custody. several democratic lawmakers -- including sen. tammy duckworth, who arrived with her infant in tow -- showed up to express their support for the demonstration.\n\n12,000+ vietnam war opponents, may 1, 1971\n\npolice in riot gear surround protesters in hippie attire during the 1971 may day protests.\n\nthis isn't officially included on this list. it isn't the fairest comparison, given that half a century has passed and the country looks markedly different than it did in 1971. but the may day protests against the vietnam war have been described as the largest mass arrest and largest mass acquittal of demonstrators in us history.\n\nfive thousand police, backed by 1,400 national guardsman, greeted the 35,000 protesters descending on washington that day, according to the american civil liberties union\n\nanyone and everyone who looked at all freaky ... was scooped up off the street, one

story highlights supreme court set to hear huge case that pits religious liberties against discrimination and gay rights the timing of the flynn plea deal is key: john king explains why\n\n(cnn) —\n\na major white house foreign policy decision, a giant supreme court case, what dems want out of a shutdown deal, and why the timing of the michael flynn plea deal matters: it's all a part of the inside politics forecast, where you get a taste of tomorrow's headlines today.\n\n1) jerusalem decision has washington – and the middle east – on edge\n\npresident donald trump's busy week ahead includes a major foreign policy decision designed to show solidarity with a key ally, but one that also has washington and the middle east on edge.\n\nthe early word is that the president will state publicly that the united states is officially recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, but is holding off, for now, on moving the us embassy from tel aviv.\n\na fair compromise, is how team trump advocates of such a move characterize it. it allows the president to edge closer to his campaign promise to relocate the embassy but stops short of a move that would anger palestinians – and upend years of us policy treating jerusalem as a so-called final status issue to be settled by the israelis and palestinians through negotiation.\n\nthe lobbying over the speech and its exact wording will continue up to the moment of delivery. julie hirschfeld davis of the new york times underscored how complicated – and consequential – this moment is.\n\na lot of his pro-israel and religious conservative supporters wanted to see him [move the embassy]. he's punting on it a second time. and i'm hearing he's getting a lot of pressure to actually say in this speech this is the last waiver he'll sign, this is the last time he'll delay the decision, davis said.\n\nit's not clear that they've actually laid the groundwork in the arab world or in the middle east at all for this kind of a speech, which is going to be a very significant statement. there's a possibility, too, that it could actually violate some un security council resolutions that do not recognize the sovereignty of israel.\n\n2) wedding cake case makes it to the supreme court – gay rights v. religious liberty?\n\non the official supreme court docket, it is masterpiece cake shop ltd., v. colorado civil rights commission. in shorthand, it's the wedding cake case.\n\nand the outcome will set a major precedent in finding the dividing line between religious liberty and discrimination. at issue: a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple on the grounds that it violated his religious convictions.\n\nit's one of the major issues facing the high court in the current term, and julie pace of the associated press noted it is also a legal ruling that will shape an often contentious political debate.\n\nthe couple is really worried that this will open up the door to a wide range of discrimination from businesses against same-sex couples, pace said. the baker argues that he's an artist and he shouldn't be compelled to make a cake that violates his religious views … there's a lot of interest from both sides here; [it's] a big argument to watch this week.\n\n3) decision time: spending debates will force strategy decisions by democrats\n\nrepublicans control both the house and the senate, but democrats have some leverage in the year-end spending and policy decisions that have to be made on capitol hill – on issues ranging from children's health care and obamacare fixes to efforts to protect the so-called dreamers.\n\ndemocrats may have leverage, but do not have the sway to get everything they want. some might also object to what conservatives demand in exchange.\n\nsahil kapur of bloomberg discussed how democrats are debating what is worth the most effort – and whether they are prepared to withhold their votes, and perhaps trigger a government shutdown, if they can't get what they want.\n\ndemocrats are debating amongst themselves how far to go, how hard to push and force this battle, reveals kapur. there are three things they want: obamacare stabilization, they want to extend the children's health insurance program and they want a daca fix. republicans need their votes to keep the government funded … we'll see what happens.\n\n4) a big year one priority slips to year two\n\nit is take two for the president's big infrastructure promise. or, to be more exact, take one will wait until year two.\n\nremember, a giant public works spending package was a key trump promise for the first year of his presidency. but it never moved from talking point to policy proposal so – along with obamacare repeal – will be high on the list of promises not kept when the president's first year in office is scored.\n\nbut the white house is now promising it will be a 2018 priority. the details, though, remain murky. michael warren of the weekly standard said the vague signals – and mixed signals – are creating some confusion in congress.\n\nmaybe we're actually going to get something in the next year, before the midterms, on infrastructure. the administration has got a goal, i'm hearing, of something like early summer, warren said. what i'm hearing from capitol hill is some complaints that the administration's a little vague, not entirely clear about what they want. general idea is, though, more flexibility to states – and that means of course more money to spend on roads, bridges, these sorts of things.\n\n5) timing is everything! ripple effect of the flynn deal\n\nif you believe the old line that timing is everything in politics, the timing of the michael flynn plea deal interesting – in at least a couple of ways.\n\none: special counsel robert mueller's spending comes into public view in the days ahead. you can be sure some trump allies will make the case that enough is enough, and that it's time to wind down and stop spending taxpayer money.\n\na guilty plea and promise of cooperation from the president's former national security adviser makes it difficult to challenge mueller from a productivity standpoint.\n\ntwo: as the legal fallout from the flynn plea agreement rattles the west wing, the timing also could impact administration morale – which in turn can have an impact on personnel decisions. working in the white house or other major agencies is exhausting in normal circumstances. then there's the first year factor, and the fact that team trump has not fully staffed many offices and agencies. it all adds to the burden of those who are on the job. we are already seeing a trickle of departures, and the end of the year is the traditional time for people to decide to move on.\n\nmany veterans of white house work see the anxiety over flynn's decision to cooperate with investigators as perhaps tipping the scales a little for those who are torn between departing at year's end, or staying on.\n\nthe biggest issue on flynn is the impact on staff morale and the effect on departures, said a veteran washington hand plugged in to the trump white house. the legal issues aside.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\njust 24 hours removed from arguably his best day as president, donald trump picked a political fight he cannot win.\n\non monday night, the trump administration announced that it now supports a ruling from a texas judge that would invalidate the entire affordable care act – aka obamacare – a move that almost certainly will push the fight over how health care is delivered in this country to the supreme court.\n\nthe department of justice has determined that the district court's comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal, said kerri kupec, a spokesperson for the justice department.\n\nthat decision, which caught even many trump allies by surprise, again thrusts the health care issue to the center of the political debate, and virtually ensures that the 2020 election – like the 2018, 2016, 2014, 2012 and 2010 elections before it – will turn on the aca.\n\nit's a baffling move for trump, who spent most of monday basking in the glow of a series of conclusions, according to attorney general bill barr, in special counsel robert mueller's report that were about as favorable as the president could have hoped for: that the special counsel did not establish that anyone in trump's campaign conspired with the russian government in 2016 election interference, and that there was not sufficient evidence for barr to establish an obstruction of justice charge against the president.\n\nswitching the spotlight of the national debate from russia to health care so quickly would be risky under any circumstances but is particularly problematic given that a) the past five elections have shown that people care deeply about and vote on the issue of health care and b) getting rid of obamacare is not a broadly popular view with the american public.\n\ntrump indicated tuesday that he planned to take that view head-on: the republican party will become 'the party of healthcare!' he tweeted.\n\nin a february, kaiser family foundation poll on the aca, 50% approved of it while 37% disapproved. in fact, since president barack obama left office in january 2017, his signature legislative accomplishment – and the one that bears his name – has grown steadily more popular. since may 2017, according to kaiser data, more people have approved of obamacare than disapprove – a sea change from most of the previous five years, when the law was consistently underwater in terms of approval. many of the provisions of the law that have long been the most popular – allowing kids to stay on their parents' insurance through age 26, no discrimination by insurance companies because of a patient's preexisting conditions – remain in effect. the least popular provision – the individual mandate that forced everyone in the country to have some sort of health care – was effectively eliminated by congressional republicans (and trump) in their 2017 tax law.\n\nthose numbers explain why house democrats ran hundreds upon hundreds of tv ads during the 2018 midterm elections making the case that republicans, if they had their way, would have eliminated obamacare altogether. republicans will do absolutely anything to divert attention away from their votes to take away americans' health care, then house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-california) said in the days leading up to the midterms. and, following democrats' takeover of the house in 2018, pelosi was just as clear; health care was on the ballot, and health care won, she said.\n\nthe data back up pelosi's position. more than 4 in 10 voters in 2018 said that health care was their top priority in the election, according to exit polling. democrats won those health care voters by 52 points. 52!\n\nthat massive edge for democrats reflects just how much the political landscape has tilted on the issue over the past decade. opposition to what many conservatives viewed was a massive government overreach into what should be best handled by the private market led to republicans winning control of the house in the 2010 midterms. by 2012, public opinion on the law had stabilized somewhat and obama was re-elected relatively easily. two years later, however, amid implementation problems and the famous/infamous backtracking on if you like your health care plan, you can keep it, republicans again ran on their opposition to the aca and made more seat gains in congress. in the 2016 presidential election, trump ran explicitly on a plan to repeal and replace the aca. by 2018, democrats were able to capitalize on the fact that house republicans had approved a repeal and replace package that never became law because it failed in a late-night vote in the senate.\n\ntrump's decision to pick this fight at this moment is, therefore, tough to understand. there's no question that his base hates obamacare and would like to see it gone. and that he believes that at least part of his 2016 victory – and maybe his chances at re-election in 2020 – hinge on him making good on removing the most visible footprint of his predecessor. at rally after rally during the 2018 campaign, trump re-told the story of john mccain's decision to vote against the so-called skinny repeal of obamacare, a line that always drew boos and jeers directed at the late arizona senator from the crowd.\n\ntrump has spent the entire first two years of his presidency playing to his hardcore base – and, seen through that lens, the decision to re-litigate the aca fight makes some sense. but trump won't win a second term solely on the strength of his base. and by picking the obamacare scab, trump is energizing and inflaming democrats and many independents. and that is a major political mistake.

how is mr. trump making his final push?\n\n\n\nsara murray, cnn national political correspondent: wolf, i think that everyone is realizing this could be a truly incredible night. and that counts donald trump as well. they do not want the take anything for granted.\n\n\n\ndonald trump held two campaign rallies today, which is a bit of an unorthodox move for a candidate on caucus night. and we're also expecting him to appear at some caucus sites. which ones, we don't know. and the same goes for his children. they have been all over the state today, doing some retail stops. and they too will appear at caucus sites.\n\n\n\nwolf, this is a shrewd move. a lot of people have said will donald trump supporters turn out? going out to caucus is not the same as going to a rally, where donald trump is the entertainment. but by fanning himself and his children out to these caucus sites, they're guaranteeing some celebrity appeal, at least at a couple of the precincts around the country, wolf.\n\n\n\nblitzer: sara, how confident are they that trump will emerge the victor tonight?\n\n\n\nmurray: when donald trump was holding his rallies earlier today, he said he wanted to emerge victorious. he has made it clear that he really wants to win this state. but i would say that he and his team are cautiously optimistic right now. they know that the poll numbers look good for them. they feel confident in their ground game, even though they have been really tight-lipped about it. it's been very much behind the scenes.\n\n\n\nbut i think they feel like they are in a good spot heading into this night. as you know, though, better than anyone here, it all just depends on who shows up tonight. and there is no guarantee until they open those doors at the caucus sites, wolf.\n\n\n\nblitzer: and so far the weather is pretty good, so that should encourage turnout. sara murray, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nted cruz is holding a pre-caucus rally right now at a baptist church in marion, iowa. he is counting on a big evangelical turnout this evening, but not a high overall turnout. a lot of experts believe that would mean a surge of first-time caucus-goers who would be expected, many of them at least, to go with trump.\n\n\n\nour sunlen serfaty is in des moines at cruz headquarters tonight.\n\n\n\nsunlen is joining us now.\n\n\n\nthis is cruz's last push for voters, sunlen. what is his game plan? what has it been like so far today on the ground there in iowa?\n\n\n\nsunlen serfaty, cnn national correspondent: well, wolf, the cruz campaign is touting that they have blanketed this state; 12,000 volunteers were deployed today to really get out the vote.\n\n\n\nfor the candidate himself, i think that it's no coincident that his last formal event before coming here to this rally later is about evangelicals, speaking and rallying evangelical voters at a baptist church nearby. this is where he needs to perform well tonight. he has always been about appealing to evangelicals.\n\n\n\n[18:05:03]\n\n\n\nbut he needs to see those numbers perform for him tonight. in his final pitch, it was a very direct message to evangelical voters, all about character, questioning to point-blank to people out there on the trail saying the person you plan to caucus for, do they have integrity? do they have character? really trying to make that direct contrast with donald trump with evangelicals out here on the trail -- wolf. blitzer: sunlen, you're there in des moines where cruz will be\n\n\n\nrallying as the votes come in. what is the campaign expecting tonight realistically?\n\n\n\nserfaty: well, they have been really, i should say, wolf, downplaying expectations for days. and this is significant and a notable shift, because for months ted cruz himself predicting a win here in iowa, saying that he didn't even think he had peaked at one point in december.\n\n\n\nso it is a pretty significant shift that they're now kind of downplaying expectations. ted cruz himself today, you can sense a little bit of doubt in his voice today. he said he is at peace where he is in iowa. he's saying, although he does feel good, he went on to say this is in god's hands. this is in voters' hands. he says if donald trump wins here tonight, he will happily congratulate him and then move on -- wolf.\n\n\n\nblitzer: sunlen serfaty, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nnow to marco rubio. he is running a third in most of the polls, contending at least in the eyes of election watchers to be the leader of the alternatives to both trump and cruz. he will be campaigning right to the very end with a string of visits scheduled tonight to caucus sites, even as the voting again.\n\n\n\ncnn's manu raju is over at rubio caucus night headquarters in des moines. he is joining us now.\n\n\n\nmanu, several of rubio's opponents are having rally-type events today, but rubio's final push for iowa voters is a face-to-face approach. is that right?\n\n\n\nmanu raju, cnn senior political correspondent: that's right. in addition to that, wolf, he has also dispatched hundreds of volunteers to make thousands of phone calls to uncommitted voters. and what the campaign is hearing back is good news, according to campaign officials that i speak with.\n\n\n\nthey feel like they're doing well in the polls, probably even better than what the des moines register said that they were at last week, which is about 15 percent of the vote. they think that they will probably surpass that. but they are still managing expectations. they believe that they are probably almost certain to get third place. they do not think they are going to get into second place at this point, wolf.\n\n\n\nand it's notable where marco rubio is going tonight. he is going into polk county. that's here in des moines, that county a very populous part of the state in which they believe they need to do very well here in order to get that strong third-place finish.\n\n\n\nblitzer: what are they really realistically expecting in the campaign, manu?\n\n\n\nraju: they believe if they have a third-place finish and are much higher than the other establishment type favorites in this race, the governor specifically, if they are 10 points, 15 points higher than them, they will have a very strong message to tell out of iowa and they can go into new hampshire trying to be that unity candidate. we will see if they're able to do that just in a few hours -- wolf. .\n\n\n\nblitzer: all right, manu, thanks very much.\n\n\n\ncooper: i want to get a first quick take from our panel, wolf, on just what to look for in this next hour as the doors open at caucuses one hour from now.\n\n\n\nkevin, in terms of, you look at donald trump. you look at ted cruz. they have campaigned so differently in iowa. ted cruz has gone to all 99 counties, really reached out to evangelicals, reached out to local officials. donald trump has had big events there, obviously. he has been spending more time there lately, but has not spent the time that ted cruz has and has not really advertised until just the last couple of weeks.\n\n\n\nkevin madden, cnn contributor: that's right.\n\n\n\nand i think what he is trying to do is that he is taking a new approach to what is usually a traditional process, which is trying to build up a whole lot of buzz, trying to get a whole lot of free media, and then build a new coalition, some evangelicals, some independent voters, new voters that he expects to come and support him, because he is a very untraditional candidate, someone who can challenge the status quo.\n\n\n\nand that's what is going to be put to the test, is whether or not -- it think this is a big test on whether or not momentum is going to be able to beat grassroots infrastructure.\n\n\n\nchairman rogers, how effective do you think donald trump's attacks against ted cruz have been just in the last couple weeks? ted cruz was higher up in the polls, according to a lot of different polls. he then went after -- donald trump suddenly pivoted, went after him on the canadian birth issue and other issues.\n\n\n\nmike rogers, cnn contributor: i think it leaves a bit of a mark, but i don't think it's fatal by any means.\n\n\n\nand, again, it's going to come down to turnout. i think that rallied ted cruz voters to go out and grab a friend and bring them to the poll. i'm not sure that was helpful in that round of attacks. but beyond that, donald trump did something pretty interesting. about a few weeks ago, started having smaller group meetings where he was walking people through exactly, his campaign team, taking those new voters and walking them through exactly what to expect, how you go into a caucus, how you vote and how it works, because that can be very intimidating if you have never participated in politics to any degree.\n\n\n\nthat could be a switch that you're going to see here in little bit. but as far as the give and take on cruz and trump, most of those folks, no, i think most of those folks have already committed. it may fire up the wrong crowd in some of those cases. [18:10:05]\n\n\n\ncooper: amanda, your former boss, ted cruz, in order to win, he doesn't just have to get his largely evangelical supporters to come out. he has to hope the donald trump's new people don't come out, right?\n\n\n\namanda carpenter, former ted cruz communications director: yes.\n\n\n\nand i think that's why ted cruz has made such an aggressive play to go to those 99 counties, to pick up and win the places that huckabee and rick santorum have won before. he has been very up front saying that i want to be the candidate that conservatives coalesce behind.\n\n\n\nhe is not necessarily interested in taking on and stealing voters from donald trump, but everyone else in the field. think about ben carson. cruz went up in the polls when carson went down. and cruz could still benefit a lot from the demise of ben carson.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncooper: you think a lot of carson supporters would go to cruz?\n\n\n\ncarpenter: yes, i think it's very likely. huckabee, santorum, even rand paul people, if they're in that caucus and they see where the momentum is and they want to get behind a candidate to win, cruz can be their guy.\n\n\n\ncruz has been very up front in the race, saying this is between me and donald trump. if you don't vote for me, a candidate who has a chance of at least slowing down his momentum, you're voting for...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nmadden: amanda makes a good point, real quick. there is an anybody but trump caucus out there. and who can finally get them in the last...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngloria borger, cnn senior political analyst: rubio. i think rubio.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nmadden: because you know what? they don't want their vote wasted.\n\n\n\nborger: here is the fascinating thing about ted cruz. here is a man who was against nsa surveillance. and he is the most data-driven candidate, bar none, even including barack obama. this is somebody who knows everything about every voter in all of the 99 counties of iowa.\n\n\n\nhe knows where you shop, what you do, who you're likely to vote for, whether you go to church every sunday or just twice a month. he is so data-driven. and that will in the end i believe help him if he is close to trump. (crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncarpenter: one of the things, i think they have learned a lot of lessons from the barack obama campaign, which one thing broadly i think we should all recognize. before it was conventional wisdom a senator could not win. now we have not only ted cruz doing well, but also senator sanders.\n\n\n\nand i think it's because the senate has become a proving ground of sorts, where people can show where they are on the positions and prove to voters where they stand.\n\n\n\ndavid gergen, cnn senior political analyst: i guess ted cruz knows almost as much about us as google. so, we have to assume...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nborger: more.\n\n\n\ngergen: yes, probably so.\n\n\n\nbut what i find fascinating about this is that ted cruz is playing the game that barack obama did to a very large extent. he is running a terrific ground game. and trump has been engaging in an air game. and that's very new to politics.\n\n\n\nbut there was a really interesting story came out of politico today that he got together with people back in christmas of 2013 and started planning this out and said, i'm going to do an air war. i can keep the media's focus.\n\n\n\nbut there is an interesting question. i don't want to stretch this analogy too far. but if you're running an air game, do you need boots on the ground to win?\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\ngergen: do you need boots on the ground?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nborger: well, he needs a lot more boots. let's put it that way.\n\n\n\nmichael nutter (d), former mayor of philadelphia: you always need people on the ground.\n\n\n\ngergen: yes.\n\n\n\nnutter: the air game gets you the attention. the ground game wins elections. that's really my perspective.\n\n\n\nmadden: and if trump wins tonight, it will be because he has a better ground game than any of the people that you have seen in iowa before.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nmadden: if trump wins tonight, it will be because he had a better ground game than many people thought.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbill press, radio talk show host: this is a time -- this is a time, organization, organization; 100 years ago, i was democratic state chair of california. i learned the hard way.\n\n\n\nyou can do all the advertising you want, all the rah-rah-rah rallies. when it comes to election day, it's all over. and if you don't have the old gotv, people, they know -- you have to know who your voters are. and you have got to get them out. it's as simple as that.\n\n\n\nand if bernie has got it, he wins tonight. but just one other quick point. as complicated as the democratic caucuses are, it's even more complicated than we learned, because they're weighted. so based on the turnout the last time, if you have 200 people at once caucus, you don't get as many delegates as you do if you have 200 people at a different caucus.\n\n\n\nso, bernie has to get his young people not in the college towns. but he is asking them to go home.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncooper: explain that, because that's very confusing.\n\n\n\npress: well, again, they're weighted based on how they did, how they voted, how many turned out the last time.\n\n\n\nso bernie supporters are mainly in these -- a lot of them in these college towns, right? the college towns, you could have 500 people. you will not get -- even if you win it, you don't get as many delegates as if you have maybe 300 people back home. so he has been telling his students go home and caucus. don't stay in your college town.\n\n\n\ncooper: wow.\n\n\n\nborger: but the republican caucuses...\n\n\n\npress: that's a tough challenge.\n\n\n\nborger: but the republican caucuses are much more straightforward.\n\n\n\npress: right.\n\n\n\nborger: they're different. we should point that out. they are different from the democratic caucuses, right. you vote and leave.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngergen: won't we get two sets of results tonight? we will get a delegate count, plus we will get a voter count?\n\n\n\nborger: eventually.\n\n\n\ngergen: won't we get a voter count?\n\n\n\nborger: eventually. it takes long time.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\njeffrey lord, cnn political commentator: ... county level and work their way up.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngergen: right. but won't we know sort of how many votes were cast and who they went for? one person could win the delegate count and somebody else could win the popular count on that basis.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nborger: i doubt it.\n\n\n\ngergen: but if the college kids all...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\n[18:15:00]\n\n\n\nrogers: one note of caution on this. remember, they are folding up pieces of paper with names written on them and putting them in a shoe box. some of them are bedazzled with those little jewels. i'm not kidding.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nrogers: they will have to open the box and count them. if you remember the santorum-romney issue in the last presidential race came down to a few problems in actually folding out the pieces of paper and counting them. this is not going to be instantaneous, electronic...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncooper: chairman rogers, i just love that you know what a bedazzler is.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\ncooper: we're going to take a break. you have been watching infomercials.\n\n\n\nwe have got to take a quick break. a lot more to get to. we will get the latest from clinton caucus night headquarters, where the pressure could not be any higher, and late reporting from the sanders and o'malley camps as well. we will also be joined by a top cruz campaign official about expectations for his candidate, the senator now doing a little q&a with voters in marion as we speak.\n\n\n\nwe will be right back. (commercial break)\n\n\n\n[18:20:15]\n\n\n\nblitzer: to give you some idea of how drastically the race in iowa has changed since the outset, hillary clinton once held a nearly 30- point advantage over bernie sanders in the polls.\n\n\n\ntonight, they're neck and neck. and because senator sanders holds a big polling edge in new hampshire, it really puts a lot of pressure on secretary clinton to secure a victory tonight.\n\n\n\ngiven that, are they feeling that pressure over at clinton caucus night headquarters?\n\n\n\nlet's check in with our brianna keilar, who is there.\n\n\n\nbrianna, what is the latest? what is secretary clinton's final push looking like?\n\n\n\nbrianna keilar, cnn senior political correspondent: well, wolf, today is so much about the waiting game after hillary clinton made her case last night for why she thinks iowans should caucus for her, where she said that she is basically more electable and that she's more capable of getting things done.\n\n\n\nwe saw a number of events yesterday. today was about going out, seeing volunteers. she brought them treats on the south side of des moines, thanking them for all of the work that they have put in for her.\n\n\n\nand then she relaxed a little bit, had some coffee with her daughter and her son-in-law, some coffee and pastries, before getting ready to wait for these results to come in tonight, wolf.\n\n\n\nblitzer: brianna, secretary clinton, i know you ran into her earlier today. how is she feeling about tonight?\n\n\n\nkeilar: yes, i ran into her. i wasn't expecting to see her, wolf. and she was in really great spirits. she was smiling. so it seems like certainly she seemed relax and perhaps confident going into this, which is really what we're hearing from some of her aides.\n\n\n\nthey feel good. they're looking at the indicators. they're looking at the polls over time here in the last couple of weeks. and they feel like the numbers are on their side. they feel like they have done everything they can when it comes to organizing, when it comes to getting people out to caucus. but so many of them also remember back to 2008.\n\n\n\nand this is what they say, wolf. they say, we thought things were good going into that night too. and then, of course, she was given a stinging third-place defeat. so there is really, i think, this sense for them of anxiety a little bit, that even though they're feeling good, they don't quite trust it. they want to see what the results are before they're really going to feel confident. blitzer: yes, barack obama came in first. senator, former senator\n\n\n\njohn edwards came in second. she came in third. brianna, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nworkers at the sanders headquarters got a pep talk today from the boss. listen to this.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsen. bernie sanders (vt-i), presidential candidate: we will struggle tonight if the voter turnout is low. that's the fact. so what is our job today, is to make sure that we have the highest voter turnout possible. that happens, we win. let's good get them. thank you all.\n\n\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nblitzer: all right, jeff zeleny is there for us tonight.\n\n\n\njeff, what is the sanders campaign telling you about how they will determine if iowa turns out to be a success?\n\n\n\njeff zeleny, cnn senior washington correspondent: wolf, in a word, it is turnout again, which is even more important in these caucuses than the elections.\n\n\n\neveryone who has come to see senator sanders in the closing days of the campaign has been contacted by text, by e-mail, by phone call. they're trying to turn out their number ones, they call them. they organize people by one, two, three. one is the most committed supporter. they believe that they have enough number ones to have a big turnout here. the number that they're eying is this. if it's more than 160,000 people who turn out tonight, they believe that they're in good shape.\n\n\n\nif it's more than 170,000 people, the clinton campaign, i'm told, believes that that is essentially or close to being out of reach for them. to put it in some context here, this would be in between the 2004 turnout and the 2008 turnout, when there were some 240,000 people here. but the sanders campaign is doing something new.\n\n\n\nthey're trying something new, wolf. and this will be a test of it tonight. social media. will social media through snapchat, through facebook, through instagram be able to turn out supporters, rather than a brick and mortar organization that they have used so many years here?\n\n\n\nso, in a word, it is turnout, getting these younger and newer voters out to caucus in about an hour-and-a-half's time -- wolf.\n\n\n\nblitzer: what else are they trying to do, jeff, to get people mobilized and get out there and caucus?\n\n\n\nzeleny: well, one of the things that they're trying to do is just sort of the supporter-to-supporter network. there are so many volunteers here from outside of the country for all campaigns.\n\n\n\nbut the sanders campaign in particular is using a lot of out-of-state volunteers, as well as in-state volunteers, to go back and redouble up their effort here. the specter of 2008 is not hanging over them. a tiny specter of 2004 is hanging over them. that was howard dean. we famously saw him crash in the iowa caucuses.\n\n\n\nhe won -- finished third place. he was soaring for so long and crashed. but all the sanders advisers believe that so much is different now, because the social media, how we communicate is different now.\n\n\n\n[18:25:03]\n\n\n\nso that is one sort of benchmark that bernie sanders wants to beat, that howard dean crash here in iowa.\n\n\n\nblitzer: yes. and the hillary clinton campaign is doing that social media, new development as well since then. all right, jeff, thanks very much.\n\n\n\ncooper: wolf, thanks very much. i want to talk our panel.\n\n\n\nmy understanding on the howard dean thing is that that campaign did not sort of in the final moments continue to check in with their caucus-goers and kind of push them to go. and a lot of people they thought were going to come out to caucus actually didn't. and that lesson has been learned by all of these candidates.\n\n\n\nborger: right. absolutely. they had a lot of younger voters from out of state who came in and didn't really organize the way they needed to.\n\n\n\ni remember them walking around in their bright orange caps. remember that? and so a lot has been learned from the mistakes of howard dean by the bernie sanders campaign. what was interesting about what jeff was just saying is that they're figuring it's around 160,000 that they need to get out.\n\n\n\ni mean, barack obama had 239,000 people turn out in 2008. so they don't need anything like, they believe -- this is their analysis -- what obama had to beat hillary clinton last time around.\n\n\n\ngergen: but that suggests it's going to be a much lower turnout overall.\n\n\n\nborger: right. well, they believe that.\n\n\n\ncooper: but to bill's point earlier, the fact that if you have all these younger voters, if they're voting by their college, that's not a good thing. or if they're caucusing by their college, that's not a great thing for bernie sanders. he has got to get them to go to their home districts.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nborger: to spread it out.\n\n\n\npress: you have got to get the right number of people in the right caucuses to really -- to get the delegates that you need and to win these caucuses.\n\n\n\nand in the course of the campaign, look, tad devine and jeff weaver are real pros. they know this. and the clinton people know it too. but enthusiasm, as you said, gloria, is great. and bernie's got it. but that's not enough.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nnutter: you have to show up.\n\n\n\ncooper: mayor nutter, you're a clinton supporter.\n\n\n\nnutter: yes.\n\n\n\ncooper: the clinton campaign says they have learned the lessons of 2008. they have focused -- they have taken iowa a lot more seriously. they have had a lot of small meetings in smaller groups where they felt she really shines as a candidate. she has said she is a different candidate.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncooper: do you think, though, voters in iowa see her as a different candidate or do they see the same person she was back in 2008?\n\n\n\nnutter: well, as they say, you only get one time to make a first impression. they know senator clinton.\n\n\n\nthey know first lady clinton. they know secretary clinton. she is not a new person. but you can change campaign styles, campaign tactics, and the things that you do on the ground. and, again, as has been one of the themes of this campaign, i think experience does matter. and you learn from the things that have happened in the past, and see what others have done. secretary clinton knows how to do that.\n\n\n\ngergen: she is more experienced. but there is a fascinating generational split here...\n\n\n\ncooper: divide, right.\n\n\n\ngergen: ... in hillary's case. it was really, really interesting, that des moines register poll over the weekend, that she does so well with people -- women over 45.\n\n\n\nbut under that, sanders beats her heavily.\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\ngergen: and it does really raise questions. will -- the obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 depended heavily on the youth vote.\n\n\n\ncooper: in iowa.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngergen: and everywhere, and in the general election. it was hugely important in both general elections. can she bring that along, or is the generational difference such that she is going to have a harder time with that...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncooper: the thing that she has, the part of the obama coalition she has in other states, because there is not as big an african-american population, is african-americans in south carolina and elsewhere, as we have talked about. the question is young people.\n\n\n\ngergen: absolutely. yes.\n\n\n\nbut it's also, is age going trump -- or is it going to overtake the question of her being a woman, being the first woman? and the younger voters don't seem...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nborger: to bernie?\n\n\n\ngergen: no, young women don't seem to -- it doesn't seem to matter to them as much.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\npress: people under 45, bernie sanders leads her 78-21.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nborger: and among young women too.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngergen: it's extraordinary.\n\n\n\npress: under 45, men and women.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\npress: that's why i think, tonight, we will see what happens. but i really believe hillary has much, much, much more at stake than bernie does. she has to win tonight.\n\n\n\nshe lost to barack obama, fine. but he was a rock star. bernie is a 74-year-old socialist from vermont, you know, who is an outsider. and for her to -- if she were to lose to bernie, i think it would be a real...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nnutter: i love that. great spin. (crosstalk)\n\n\n\nnutter: the reality is that senator sanders has run a philosophical campaign. he wants an ideological debate about a lot of things.\n\n\n\nsecretary clinton is practical, pragmatic, knows how to get stuff done. and people will make a decision about those kinds of things. but i want to go back to one of the points that david made very, very early on, about 1,680-plus caucus locations. this is iowa. great state, great people. and it's kicking off this incredible big night.\n\n\n\n[18:30:11] we have about 1,680-plus voting divisions in philadelphia. it is as if the citizens of philadelphia were kicking off the national campaign and directing the momentum for what's going to happen over the course of the next, you know, eight, nine, ten months.\n\n\n\ncooper: right. that's the context.\n\n\n\nnutter: that's the context with which we're operating here.\n\n\n\ncooper: we're going to take a quick break. before we do, a reminder. we've got something special in store wednesday night, a 360 democratic town hall. clinton, sanders, o'malley, all will be there. i'll be moderating. eight eastern time, wednesday night in new hampshire. no matter what the results are tonight, they will all be there. it's going to be a fascinating night. tune in for that.\n\n\n\ncoming up next, about a half hour from opening time at the caucus locations throughout iowa. and about 90 minutes from the actual caucusing,/ we'll check back in with the democratic and republican caucus site for a closer look at what is about to unfold. the first real contest in this amazing presidential election. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nblitzer: senator ted cruz just wrapped up a pre-caucus rally at a baptist church in marion, iowa. earlier today he spoke with the town of jefferson, where he explained an accomplishment that he called the full grassley.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsen. ted cruz (r-tx), presidential candidate: we are, with this stop, completing the very last stop of the full grassley. we have now been to all 99 counties in the great state of iowa.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nblitzer: grassley, of course, being the long-time iowa senator chuck grassley, who visits every county in the state every year.\n\n\n\njoining us now, the full tyler. cruz campaign communications director rick tyler. rick, thanks very much for joining us. so what's your prediction? how is the senator going to do tonight? rick tyler, cruz campaign communications director: well, i think\n\n\n\nhe'll do very well. we'll either win or we'll come in a close second. and i'm confident that our turnout operation is as good as it gets. we've had 12,000 volunteers working. we're making over 20,000 calls a day. i guess there have been 24,000 calls, knocking on 2,000 doors a day. that's been going on for weeks now.\n\n\n\nand so i feel pretty good. i feel like it's all come to this. a little nervous. but we've got about a half hour till caucus time starts. and so hoping that iowa will bring it home for us.\n\n\n\nblitzer: listen to what donald trump says about senator ted cruz's suggestion about his policies. listen to this.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ndonald trump (r), presidential candidate (via phone): ted cruz is a total liar. i am so against obamacare. i've been saying it for two years in my speeches. i'm going to repeal and replace obamacare. i don't even know where he gets this. but he is a liar.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nblitzer: all right. so why does the senator insist that donald trump would be -- supports obamacare?\n\n\n\ntyler: because he has said that he would -- he would fund single- payer health care system, which is where obamacare is leading to. and senator cruz didn't say he supports obama care. he said he supports an obamacare-like system of where obamacare is taking us, which is single payer.\n\n\n\nwe all know what happens with single payer. you get -- you get lower quality, higher costs, less choices, less innovation; and it costs lives and money. and so that's his -- those are donald trump's words.\n\n\n\nyou know, it's kind of sad, really, actually, that donald trump, you know, wants to do name-calling and invective and insults and thinks that that's really effective. and i just don't think -- i think the voters of iowa are just kind of sick of that behavior.\n\n\n\nand so their campaign attacked congressman king today. it went over like a lead balloon. it was just not well-received by the iowans, who were there, actually, to see donald trump.\n\n\n\nand so, you know, i just think it's sad that he's going to stoop to this level.\n\n\n\nblitzer: so how bitter is this relationship? now they used to have a so-called bromance. but it's really deteriorated.\n\n\n\ntyler: well, ted cruz has said over and over again he likes donald trump. he has not returned the invective. in fact, he never has. lots of people called him lots of names, because he doesn't want to get along with washington. he wants to change washington. but he never returns it in kind. so i think that speaks to the character of ted cruz.\n\n\n\nso, look, it's going to be a -- i think it's a two-person race. and i hope to come out on top tonight. we'll see how donald trump reacts to actually losing. we'll see what happens.\n\n\n\nblitzer: was that the full tyler, rick?\n\n\n\ntyler: i guess so.\n\n\n\nblitzer: all right. the full tyler. rick tyler, thanks very much for joining us.\n\n\n\ntyler: appreciate it.\n\n\n\ncooper: wolf, doors open in about 20 minutes for the iowa caucuses. i want to check in with jim sciutto, who's at a republican caucus site in greenfield, iowa.\n\n\n\nwhat's happening there, jim?\n\n\n\njim sciutto, cnn national security correspondent: how you doing, anderson? we're at notaway (ph) valley high school. this is the southwestern corner of iowa. it is rural. it is agricultural. corn is king, they say, here.\n\n\n\nthere's also a strong evangelical streak here, which would seem to break in favor of a ted cruz, perhaps a donald trump with a falwell endorsement. but other candidates not leaving it to chance. darrell issa, who's a surrogate for marco rubio, he's come all the way down here to the southwestern corner of the state to speak here tonight to try to peel away some of those cruz and trump supporters to go the way of marco rubio.\n\n\n\nblitzer: do we know how large of a turnout they're expecting there tonight?\n\n\n\nsciutto: well, i spoke to the precinct chair, and he says they're expecting a record turnout tonight. in fact, they're prepared to accommodate as much as twice as many voters as they had just four years ago. it doesn't mean they'll get there. but they're prepared for it.\n\n\n\nbut at the same time, it's very unpredictable. they've said that here in notaway (ph) valley, in springfield -- greenfield, rather, they correctly predicted, correctly voted for the winner of the iowa caucuses going back to 1996. precinct chair says, though, tonight completely unpredictable. he doesn't have a real sense of who's going to come away a winner tonight.\n\n\n\n[18:40:27] cooper: right. a potential with a lot of new caucus goers. jim, thanks.\n\n\n\nlet's go now to a democratic caucus site. pamela brown joins us from des moines. so what's happening there, pamela?\n\n\n\npamela brown, cnn justice correspondent: already, people are starting to come in. they just walked into the church, anderson. they've been registering here.\n\n\n\nand we've already seen both bernie sanders supporters as well as hillary clinton supporters who have arrived tonight. in fact, the hillary camp set up shop where barack obama's group was eight years ago when barack obama won this caucus site. and hillary obviously did not. so they're hoping that this will give them good luck, and that things will change this time around.\n\n\n\nwe're expecting a huge turnout here tonight. eight years ago there were a little more than 100 people. there were a lot of first-time caucus goers. tonight we're expecting even more people. there are around 600 democrats registered here in this precinct. a little over 400 independents.\n\n\n\nand of course, the bernie sanders camp is hoping to get the young people in, those first-time caucus goers to cast their vote.\n\n\n\nthe hot commodity, of course, tonight will be those who haven't decided yet, who are coming here, floating in between candidate, and who are here to be swayed. we're told that those that have made up their minds will be swarming around those who haven't, trying to get them into their groups. we're going see a lot of action here very shortly -- anderson.\n\n\n\ncooper: and the weather in that area, is that going to be a factor tonight?\n\n\n\nbrown: only in a good way, anderson. and that's one of the reasons they think the turnout is going to be so high tonight. it's because it's a nice day here. it's not even that cold here in iowa. the snowstorm hasn't set in yet. and so as one person we spoke to said, there is no excuse for people not to come out and caucus here, particularly in this precinct.\n\n\n\ncooper: all right. good to know. pamela brown, thanks.\n\n\n\ncoming up, the latest polls in iowa show bernie sanders just barely behind hillary clinton. her lead within the poll's margin of error. that's why tonight is so fascinating, so important. the question is can sanders pull out a victory in the heartland? i'll speak with someone who wrote the book on him, next.\n\n\n\nalso, take a look. two gop candidates who have already jumped ahead to new hampshire, john kasich and jeb bush.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njeb bush (r), presidential candidate: he had written two memoirs. because it was all about him and his ambitions. and he's, as i said, an extraordinary, extraordinary speaker. and he was there for two years as the united states senator when he lost his campaign.\n\n\n\nthere was nothing in his background about whether he could forge consensus, unite around the things that we agree on. nothing. and the net result is we have suffered as a...\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[18:47:25] blitzer: the iowa caucuses are about to get under way, the first big test for the presidential election and for senator bernie sanders. the question tonight is whether he can overcome what seems to be hillary clinton's razor-thin lead over him in the polls in iowa.\n\n\n\njoining us now is political strategist jonathan tasini. he's the author of the book the essential: bernie sanders and his vision for america.\n\n\n\njonathan, thanks very much for joining us.\n\n\n\ni know you're hoping for a sanders win tonight in iowa. but if hillary clinton does win and he loses, how does that affect his strategy moving towards new hampshire and beyond?\n\n\n\njonathan tasini, political strategist: well, look, i think the reality is that we're sort of getting into the weeds with iowa. there's 44 delegates at stake. we feel very confident about the work that's been done. but this fight is going all the way to the convention.\n\n\n\nwolf, if you had told me back in may that bernie sanders, who was at 3 percent in the polls, within seven months would essentially be tied with the presumed front-runner in iowa and be closing fast in national polls, have raised $20 million just in january, which means he will be competitive in all the super tuesday states on march 1st, you would have said, you know, what are you smoking? you wouldn't have believed it.\n\n\n\nso, this campaign is just started. we feel very, very good about the number of volunteers that are out there, the energy, the enthusiasm that's going to spread all across the country. and this will go all the way to the convention.\n\n\n\nblitzer: i remember. i agree with you. six, seven months ago when he announced, it would have been amazing if somebody had made those predictions. so, what do you attribute to that success?\n\n\n\ntasini: well, frankly, and with all due respect, the media did not catch this. it's very simple: bernie sanders is calling for political revolution. he is running against somebody who represents the status quo.\n\n\n\nthe status quo is something that nobody in the democratic circles really likes, and doesn't want to embrace. the status quo represents the banks that we have to break up, the health care system that isn't working for people, and trade agreements that aren't working for people.\n\n\n\nbernie sanders represents something completely different. and he has ignited people all across the country. i've travelled to all the early states, to florida. the enthusiasm is just incredible. people sense a chance of supporting bernie sanders is changing the future of the country.\n\n\n\nblitzer: so, hillary clinton says she wants to pursue the strategies laid out by president barack obama. bernie sanders, though, he has a different idea, right?\n\n\n\ntasini: yes, absolutely. look, there are a lot of good things that barack obama has done. at every rally i've ever been to and heard bernie sanders speak, he said barack obama has done very good work and again, in the face of almost united republican opposition.\n\n\n\n[18:50:00] but bernie sanders wants to expand that and essentially take apart a system that is not working for people. so, health care is a great example. he says thank god that barack obama got the affordable care act passed. that still leaves 29 (inaudible) people not covered by that health care plan and we're still paying premiums and co-pays that are outrageous.\n\n\n\nbernie sanders' plan will save people thousands of dollars. that's completely changing the health care system and that's just indicative of the way he looks at the economy in general and again, it's a political revolution and people are thirsty for that. they really understand that the system is corrupt and they want to change that, and bernie sanders represents a movement.\n\n\n\nhe says it's about a movement. it's not just about him. he will be elected, but people have to stay engaged.\n\n\n\nblitzer: jonathan tasini, supporter of bernie sanders -- jonathan, thanks very much for joining us.\n\n\n\ntasini: always a pleasure, wolf.\n\n\n\nblitzer: all right. take a look at this. these are live pictures coming in. john kasich, jeb bush, they're at events in new hampshire right now. both candidates putting in a lot of work in there.\n\n\n\nanderson, they're already looking way beyond iowa. they're not going to do well in iowa, so they're looking to the next contest a week from tomorrow in new hampshire.\n\n\n\nanderson cooper, cnn anchor: and it's interesting. i mean, a lot of people are saying, even at the last debate, the gop debate on fox, that a lot of the candidates were -- they were in iowa, john kasich in particular, they were focused on how they are going to do in new hampshire and trying to appeal to a new hampshire audience, and here on this incredibly important day in iowa. these folks are already in new hampshire trying to get out the vote there.\n\n\n\nblitzer: they're trying desperately to get out the vote.\n\n\n\nall right. we're getting closer and closer to the big moment right now.\n\n\n\ncooper: that's right. caucus sites around the state of iowa opening at the top of the hour. coming up next, john king lays out what to look for as the night unfolds. the crucial clues that could spell victory or defeat of a candidate.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: you and your campaign speak in general terms about how ohio has 400 new jobs that's been created.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[18:56:33] cooper: just minutes from now, doors will open at caucus sites across iowa. this is what it looks like. iowa voters arriving to their designated meeting places where they'll cast the first ballots in the 2016 presidential race. voting begins about an hour from now.\n\n\n\nnow, you've heard it before, we're going to say it again. turnout is obviously key to who wins over the next couple of hours. we're going to start to see the first signs of how the night might end.\n\n\n\njohn king is here to brief us for what to watch for -- john.\n\n\n\nking: so, we watch those lines outside. then, we get the early entrance polls, and we get a little sense of the composition of the electorate, how many young people turned out, how many evangelicals turned out. and then, anderson, finally, after all this talking, the wall will start to fill in with the results.\n\n\n\nwhat we're looking for? on the republican side, remember, it's complicated because we have so many candidates. we're expecting, of course, marco rubio to be in play tonight if you believe the polls. one of the big question is how does donald trump do? and obviously, ted cruz, they're in alphabetic order right now, the senator here.\n\n\n\nso, let's go back to 2012 to say what are we going to look for. see all this gold? this is when rick santorum, remember how late that night was, iowa 2012. rick santorum won very late because like mike huckabee in 2008, that green is mike huckabee, in 2012, rick santorum won almost all the small rural counties. that's where you find your evangelicals, your social conservatives, to a degree, the tea party voters.\n\n\n\nted cruz needs to copy the santorum map if he is to beat donald trump in iowa tonight. then you look for trump. number one, can he steal some of this? romney won a few of them, but can ted cruz -- ron paul won a few too. that's the light orange here.\n\n\n\ncan ted cruz essentially infiltrate the evangelical turf and take some of that -- i mean, can donald trump, excuse me, do that to ted cruz? and then the battle will be on the romney map. the dark red is where mitt romney won in 2012 in the population centers, polk county, ames, cedar rapids, davenport and dubuque.\n\n\n\nbetween des moines, cedar rapids, davenport and dubuque, you have the biggest cities in iowa, they're not huge, but they're the population centers. can donald trump win those area areas? that's the fight for the suburbs or that's where marco rubio is organizing the hardest, along the romney map. so, watch out and see here. and then, of course, we're going to look for surprises.\n\n\n\ncooper: what about on the democratic side?\n\n\n\nking: when you get to the democratic side, let's start in 2008, to make it easier to go back, because if you look now, on the democratic side now -- let's come over to d's here. right now, of course, hillary clinton, martin o'malley, bernie sanders have a blank slate.\n\n\n\nfor bernie sanders, number one, we're going to look in the college towns. we're going to look in iowa city. we're going to look in ames. we know young people are for bernie sanders.\n\n\n\none of the challenges for the sanders campaign, anderson, though, could he get them to leave the college towns and increase his odds in other parts of the state. but let's go back in 2008 because it's instructive. the dark blue is hillary clinton.\n\n\n\nwhere did obama win? obama won big in the east. just a little bit of clinton over here, dubuque, cedar rapids, iowa city, davenport. this area is critical. can hillary clinton hold her own in the east, even just splitting this with bernie sanders?\n\n\n\nand then in the central part of the state, again, obama won in ames, which is where you fin the college towns right there. he was huge. that's about 3 percent. and you find traditional democrats. they tend to be for hillary clinton, older democrats, people involved.\n\n\n\nthis is where to the degree labor union fight will play out here in polk county. barack obama won it big eight years ago, hillary clinton was actually third, just behind john edwards. hillary clinton needs to turn the des moines area, the dark blue, and she needs to compete with bernie sanders out here in the east.\n\n\n\none thing i know when i was out there, anderson, hillary clinton the remembers the pain of this.\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\nking: and they're much better organized. the question is, can organization overcome the sanders' passion?\n\n\n\ncooper: we'll be watching this as the votes start to come in late into the morning. doors are about to open at caucus sites. again, the caucusing itself is just an hour away. and then it all becomes real, the first votes of this primary election, the first chance to see not just what people will tell pollsters but what they're willing to do about it when it actually counts. tonight for the first time in this election, it really does count, which makes this a very big night.\n\n\n\nour coverage continues right now.

(the federal government picks up at least 90% of the tab.)\n\nin utah, where past attempts to expand medicaid failed in the state's lower chamber, organizers had only three months to gather at least 113,000 signatures. they easily cleared that bar by going to community events, knocking on doors and turning to social media, said rylee curtis, campaign manager for utah decides healthcare. the group will start running television and radio ads next month in hopes of convincing voters to support the measure at the polls.\n\nphoto: utah decides healthcare utah residents will decide whether to expand medicaid in november.\n\nadvocates are calling attention to the fact that 150,000 residents will gain coverage, and utah will receive $800 million in federal funds for expansion annually, curtis said. the ballot measure also calls for raising the sales tax on non-grocery items by 0.15% to pay for the state's 10% share of the expansion.\n\nthis campaign is about letting utahans decide, curtis said. it transcends politicians.\n\nnebraska organizers also collected far more signatures than they needed using similar tactics. some 90,000 residents will gain coverage, more than two-thirds of whom work but their jobs don't provide health insurance, said meg mandy, campaign manager for insure the good life, which is promoting expansion in the cornhusker state. also, expansion will bring the state $1.1 billion in federal funding over four years and sustain 10,000 jobs, many of which are in rural areas.\n\nthe ballot measures do have their opponents. in nebraska, a republican state senator and a former legislator unsuccessfully challenged the expansion initiative in court. the idaho republican party passed a resolution in june opposing the ballot measure.

thing i've ever seen' on 'the bachelor:' lemon reacts to finale twist\n\nstory highlights the senate majority leader has had tense relationship with donald trump after the senate failed to pass health care, trump criticized mitch mcconnell\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump said monday he feels closer than ever before to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a man he's publicly criticized for his handling of the gop agenda and on whom the president is relying for getting a legislative accomplishment in the first year of his term.\n\nwe have been friends for a long time, trump said from the white house rose garden with the kentucky republican at his side. we are probably now, despite what we read, we are probably now, i think, at least as far as i am concerned, we are closer than ever before and the relationship is very good. we are fighting for the same thing, we are fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation. we are fighting for tax reform as part of that.\n\ntrump's comments followed a lunch meeting with mcconnell, and come after the president's former chief strategist, steve bannon, has pledged to wage a war on the republican establishment and cited the senate majority leader by name.\n\ntrump said that he would try to talk bannon out of declaring war on some of his primary targets saying, i'm going to see if we can talk him out of that, because i think they're great people.\n\nmcconnell responded to bannon's criticism by citing past republican primary challengers who failed to make it into the senate and stressing his relationship to trump.\n\nwe are together totally on this agenda to move america forward, mcconnell said.\n\njust before sitting down to lunch with mcconnell earlier monday, trump said he understands the frustration behind bannon's mission.\n\nphoto: cnn president donald trump (right) and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell speak monday in the white house rose garden.\n\nwe are not getting the job done, trump said after a reporter asked him about comments bannon made at the value voters summit in washington on saturday. and i am not going to blame myself, they are not getting the job done. we had health care approved, and then you had the surprise vote by john mccain. we have had other things happen and they are not getting the job done and i can understand where steve bannon is coming from.\n\nthe trump-mcconnell meeting comes as pressure on the senate intensifies to pass tax cuts and give trump at least one major legislative victory before the end of the year. the senate will move this week to pass a budget, the first step in its effort to overhaul the tax code.\n\non saturday, bannon further grilled the gop establishment and called out mcconnell by name.\n\nit's not my war, this is our war and y'all didn't start it, the establishment started it, bannon said.\n\nhe added, right now, it's a season of war against a gop establishment.\n\nrelated: washington is turning against the us senate\n\nmcconnell and trump's relationship has been fraught ever since the senate failed to repeal and replace the affordable care act in july. over the august recess, trump publicly bemoaned mcconnell's leadership.\n\ntrump successfully ran for president by demeaning his enemies and rallying his base to deride his opponents. those habits have followed him to the white house, and mcconnell has regularly been that punching bag.\n\ncan you believe that mitch mcconnell, who has screamed repeal & replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done, trump tweeted in august. must repeal & replace obamacare!\n\nmcconnell has declined to publicly respond directly to the president, instead telling reporters that he isn't a fan of the daily tweets.\n\ni've been pretty candid with him and all of you that i'm not a fan of the daily tweets, he said earlier this year.\n\ntrump's own aides, many of whom are tasked with working with congress to turn trump's campaign promises into legislation, have privately lamented that the president's attacks against members of his own party – most importantly mcconnell – have made it more difficult to win over skeptical lawmakers.\n\nlast week, some conservative outside groups, including the senate conservatives fund and freedomworks, called on mcconnell and other leaders in the senate to step aside.\n\nrelated: these are the gop sticking points on tax reform\n\neven rank-and-file members say that mcconnell's in a tough position if he cannot find a way to convince a majority of senate republicans to back a tax cut proposal. mcconnell can only lose two republican senators and still pass a bill.\n\nif we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace obamacare, then we're going to lose across the board in the house in 2018. and all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat, south carolina sen. lindsey graham said on cbs' face the nation over the weekend. it will be the end of mitch mcconnell as we know it.
washington (cnn) judge justin walker , now nominated to a powerful federal court dubbed the second highest in the nation, remains bitter that the supreme court upheld the affordable care act eight years ago.\n\nwalker was serving as a law clerk at the time of the 2012 blockbuster ruling and was infuriated at its resolution. he has continued to reveal disdain for the decision written by chief justice john roberts and offer details about his inside dealings with justice anthony kennedy, one of the dissenters.\n\nthe greatest words you can hear from justice kennedy are: 'you're hired,' walker said at a march 13 investiture ceremony for the district court position he currently holds. and the worst words are: 'the chief justice thinks this might be a tax.'\n\nwhen roberts cast the decisive vote to uphold the landmark health care law in 2012, he linked its penalty for people who refused to obtain insurance to congress' taxing power. roberts' final decision, which came after multiple changes in his reasoning, saved obamacare but generated intense friction inside and outside the court.\n\nthe views of walker will be spotlighted wednesday in the us senate during his scheduled nomination hearing for the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.\n\nthe dc circuit stands out among us appeals courts of because of its important regulatory caseload and that it has served as a launching pad for many supreme court justices, including roberts, kavanaugh, and current justices clarence thomas and ruth bader ginsburg.\n\nthe 37-year-old walker, who was a university of louisville law professor before becoming a us district court judge last fall, has drawn opposition because of his limited legal experience and for his firebrand conservatism even after donning the robe. the american bar association rated him not qualified for his current judgeship.\n\nin a recent move, walker issued an opinion related to drive-in church services and the louisville mayor's social-distancing order, without hearing first from the mayor. on holy thursday, an american mayor criminalized the communal celebration of easter, walker declared as he opened his opinion.\n\nfront-row seat to the court's obamacare drama\n\nsigned by president barack obama, who later embraced the obamacare name, the affordable care act required all americans to obtain coverage and created a marketplace for purchasing insurance. it also expanded medicaid for poor people and protected diabetics, cancer patients and other individuals with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage.\n\nrepublicans opposed the legislation from the start, saying it infringed on individuals and businesses as it aimed to insure millions more americans and control spiraling medical costs. texas and other gop states, which joined the national federation of independent business in the first obamacare suit known as nfib v. sebelius, have continued to challenge provisions of the law.\n\ntrump ran against it as a presidential candidate and his administration is still seeking to void the law, which after a decade has affected nearly every corner of the health care system.\n\nwalker has called roberts' 2012 opinion indefensible. in his recent remarks at the march investiture, he further revealed an us-versus-them mindset. after thanking mcconnell, kavanaugh and other supporters, he referred to his nomination's opponents, including, he said, the american bar association.\n\nthank you for serving as an enduring reminder that although my legal principles are prevalent, they have not yet prevailed, walker said. and although we are winning, we have not won, and although we celebrate today, we cannot take for granted tomorrow, or we will lose our courts and our country to critics who call us terrifying and describe us as deplorable.\n\nhis demeanor belied roberts' constant admonition that judges are impartial and non-partisan, ruling without fear or favor.\n\nbut he has enjoyed the longtime backing of mcconnell, a louisville family friend who persuaded trump to nominate walker. mcconnell has been an unyielding partner to trump in stocking the federal bench with conservatives.\n\non april 3, three weeks after the louisville investiture and six months after he first took the federal bench, trump announced that he would elevate walker, a harvard law graduate who still serves as a part-time law professor at the university of louisville, to a coveted seat on the dc circuit.\n\nwalker did not respond to a cnn request for an interview.\n\nendorsing kavanaugh opinion as a 'roadmap'\n\neight years ago, during the supreme court's heated deliberations over the constitutionality of the aca, the five conservative justices, including roberts and kennedy, believed that the individual insurance mandate exceeded congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. but roberts thought the invalid provision could be separated from much of the sweeping law.\n\nkennedy, however, joined by fellow conservative justices antonin scalia, thomas and samuel alito, believed the individual mandate was interconnected to other provisions of the new law and would entirely sink it. law clerks at the time portrayed walker as vigorously arguing the mandate central to provisions such as those guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions and expanding medicaid coverage to needy people.\n\nwhen kennedy and the other justices declined to sever the individual insurance requirement from the rest of the law, roberts turned to congress' taxing power as grounds to uphold the mandate, which carried a penalty for people who did not buy insurance. roberts was joined by the four liberal justices to uphold the law.\n\nwalker in march remarked that it was still the worst thing he ever heard from kennedy. it was not the first time walker had referred to the 2012 deliberations in a highly public way. he spoke about the experience in 2018 when he was backing kavanaugh as a successor to retiring justice kennedy.\n\nkavanaugh, as a dc circuit judge in 2011, had taken up a separate obamacare dispute that became something of a litmus test among conservatives examining kavanaugh's record. (walker was a law clerk to kavanaugh 2010-2011 but had already moved to the supreme court when the dc circuit issued its aca ruling.)\n\nin the dc circuit case, kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the aca on procedural, rather than substantive, grounds. yet kavanaugh commented on obamacare at length, calling it unprecedented and deeming the administration's justification for the individual insurance mandate jarring. he said it could extend to other mandatory purchases such as of college savings accounts and disaster insurance.\n\nduring right-wing skirmishes over who might succeed kennedy, walker vigorously defended kavanaugh's credentials, especially regarding his ambiguous aca opinion. in one article, walker referred to kavanaugh's thorough and principled takedown of the mandate and asserted that it had even guided dissenting justices in the supreme court's 2012 decision.\n\ni am very familiar with that opinion, because i served as kennedy's law clerk that term, walker wrote. i can tell you with certainty that the only justices following a roadmap from brett kavanaugh were the ones who said obamacare was unconstitutional.\n\nsome legal observers today say walker's comments reflect a lack of judiciousness.\n\nusually the clerks are extremely circumspect about their time working on cases, said josh blackman, author of the 2013 book unprecedented: the constitutional challenge to obamacare and a professor at south texas college of law. i was very stunned about how cavalier he was with that issue.\n\nfatima goss graves, president of the national women's law center, said his remarks suggest a disregard for precedent. when you put on a robe, there is an expectation for people, and part of that expectation is around the rule of law and a consistency in approach, she said.\n\nduring the senate's consideration of walker for the us trial court spot in 2019, he was guarded about his aca views.\n\nsen. dianne feinstein, the senior democrat on the senate judiciary committee, asked walker in a written question about his praise of kavanaugh for providing a roadmap to strike down the aca's individual mandate and about walker's own assertion in a 2018 article that the supreme court's ruling was an indefensible decision.\n\nwalker responded in august 2019 that he was opining as an individual outside of the judiciary.\n\ni understand that the role of an academic and a citizen engaged in the political process is different than the role of a judge or a judicial nominee, walker wrote. the canons of judicial conduct preclude me, in my role as a judicial nominee, from going beyond what i said in the 2018 article.
in the latest blow to obamacare, aetna is vastly reducing its presence on the individual exchanges in 2017.\n\nthe insurer will stop offering policies on the exchanges in 11 of the 15 states where it currently operates, according to a press release it issued monday evening. aetna (aet) will only sell obamacare products in delaware, iowa, nebraska and virginia.\n\naetna said earlier this month that it was halting its exchange expansion plans for 2017 and reviewing its participation in president obama's signature health reform program. the company noted monday that it has lost $430 million in its individual policies unit since the exchanges opened in january 2014.\n\naetna, which had 838,000 exchange customers at the end of june, said its policyholders are turning out to be sicker and costlier than expected. the company, along with its peers, has criticized the federal program designed to mitigate those risks.\n\nproviding affordable, high-quality health care options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool, said aetna ceo mark bertolini.\n\nthe company will continue to offer individual policies outside of the obamacare exchanges in the vast majority of markets where it now does business. off-exchange products are not eligible for federal subsidies.\n\nthe obama administration said monday the exchanges are serving 11 million people and have brought down the uninsured rate to the lowest on record.\n\naetna's decision to alter its marketplace participation does not change the fundamental fact that the health insurance marketplace will continue to bring quality coverage to millions of americans next year and every year after that, said kevin counihan, the exchanges ceo. it's no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality rather than by denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions.\n\naetna's announcement comes a month after the department of justice blocked its merger plans with humana, as well as anthem's (antx) purchase of cigna (ci). anthem has linked its merger with its obamacare participation.\n\nlike aetna, a growing number of insurers on the obamacare exchanges are voicing concerns about the viability of the program as they run up big losses. many say that their premiums were too low and didn't cover the cost of care because their consumers are far sicker than anticipated.\n\nrelated: obamacare patients sicker and pricier than expected\n\nsome 11.1 million people are enrolled in obamacare this year, according to the latest federal statistics.\n\nunitedhealthcare (unh), the nation's largest insurer that is expecting to lose about $1 billion on obamacare policies in 2015 and 2016, is exiting most obamacare exchanges in 2017. humana (hum) announced last month that it was pulling out of nearly 1,200 counties in eight states next year. afterward, it will only be selling insurance on the exchanges in 156 counties in 11 states. others, including several blue cross blue shield companies, are also scaling back.\n\nit seems increasingly clear that big, national insurers are having trouble competing in the obamacare marketplaces and making money, said larry levitt, senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. some insurers are still doing well, particularly those that historically served medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nrelated: unitedhealthcare to exit most obamacare exchanges\n\nlarge insurers aren't the only ones running into trouble. more than half of the co-op insurers, created and funded by the health reform law, have failed. this means consumers in a growing number of areas have only one or two insurers to pick from.\n\nto cover these sicker patients, many insurers are requesting big premium hikes for 2017, some in the high double digit percentages.\n\ninsurers are requesting premium increases of 9%, on average, for the benchmark silver plan -- upon which federal subsidies are based -- in major cities in 16 states plus the district of columbia, according to the latest review by the kaiser family foundation. but this masks substantial variation, with requests ranging from a drop of 13% to an increase of 25%. states still have to review the requests and could change them.\n\nlast year, premiums for the benchmark silver plans in these areas increased 2% following the state reviews.\n\ninsurers, including aetna, have been pressuring the federal government to make changes to the risk programs meant to help insurers that cover high-cost patients. the program requires insurers with healthier-than-average customers to fund payments to peers with sicker-than-average enrollees. aetna had to pay into the risk adjustment program in 2014 and 2015.\n\nunder the program, customers' health status is based on diagnoses of chronic costly conditions, such as diabetes and hiv. but insurers argue that enrollees' use of prescription drugs, particularly expensive specialty drugs, should be included in the formula.\n\nthe department of health & human services is starting to make changes, including taking drug utilization into account. last week, it said it will propose modifying the risk adjustment program to absorb some of the cost for claims above a certain threshold, funded by payments from all insurers.\n\nobamacare's biggest problems lie in the risk mitigation efforts, said timothy jost, an emeritus professor at washington and lee university school of law. in addition to the risk adjustment program, there were two other initiatives aimed at helping insurers cover high-cost patients. but both are ending this year.\n\ni think the market will stabilize, and perhaps aetna and united will come back, said jost. but the market really needs support for another few years until it does, and since the majority in congress is rooting for [the affordable care act] to fail, it seems unlikely that the support will be forthcoming.\n\nin announcing the withdrawal, bertolini left the door open for aetna to return to the exchanges if the federal government makes improvements to the program.\n\n[we] remain hopeful that we can work with policymakers from both parties on a sustainable public exchange model that meets the needs of the uninsured, he said. the company may expand our footprint in the future should there be meaningful exchange-related policy improvements.
(cnn) democrats' slim majorities in both the house and senate are testing president joe biden's ability to get his priorities through congress, as lawmakers turn their attention to legislative work beyond relief from the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nbiden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package , was voted out of the house wednesday and onto biden's desk, after a difficult passage in the senate, while democrats are also still working to confirm his nominees for key administrative posts.\n\nas a 36-year veteran of the senate and former vice president, biden has maintained that he will work with both sides of the aisle. although the president has already taken a flurry of executive actions , some priorities need to be cemented with legislation to avoid possible reversal by his successors.\n\nhere are some key legislative issues congress and biden are likely to confront in the days ahead:\n\nminimum wage\n\njust watched top house progressive: minimum wage must be in relief bill replay more videos ... must watch top house progressive: minimum wage must be in relief bill 06:20\n\ndespite some state and local governments increasing their minimum wages, the legislative drive to increase the wage has stalled in congress, where democrats were in the minority in either the house or senate, or both, from 2010 until this year.\n\nnow, with narrow majorities in both chambers and biden in the white house, democrats are renewing the push. vermont sen. bernie sanders' proposal to get a federal $15 minimum wage increase from $7.25 back into biden's covid relief bill failed last week, with eight democrats siding with republicans to vote down the amendment. the senate parliamentarian had ruled the hike could not be included in the measure under the strict rules of budget reconciliation.\n\narizona sen. kyrsten sinema, one of the eight democrats who voted against sanders' amendment, said in a statement that she is open to having a separate debate in congress over the minimum wage, just not through this reconciliation process being used to pass covid relief.\n\nbut the defeat shed light on the hurdles progressives will face in passing a $15 minimum wage legislation and a new path forward is unclear. an unlikely option is to introduce a separate bill and try to get enough senators on board to clear the 60-vote threshold, but democrats are not fully united behind the proposal. an even more difficult option would be to eliminate the filibuster, which would lower the 60-vote threshold, and therefore require fewer votes to pass the minimum wage legislation.\n\nwhite house senior adviser cedric richmond said during a cbsn interview on monday that the white house will keep pushing for the $15 minimum wage increase and that biden believes he can work with both sides to get work done, preferring not to change filibuster rules.\n\ninfrastructure\n\ntalks for bipartisan legislation on improving roads, railway systems and other infrastructure needs could be back on the table, especially due to the climate crisis and after winter storms crippled southern states and texas.\n\ninfrastructure has been viewed as a bipartisan opportunity by both sides, but the issue faltered during the trump administration. talks around an infrastructure plan with trump and republicans broke down in 2019 and the repeated claims by the white house that the coming week would be infrastructure week became a running joke for democrats and republicans alike. the former president tweeted at the beginning of the pandemic that he was open to an infrastructure package to boost the economy, but the house passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill in july with only three republicans supporting it and the measure stalled in the then-gop controlled senate.\n\nstill, infrastructure is widely seen as the most likely area where the two parties could strike a deal.\n\nsenate majority leader chuck schumer told reporters sunday that the next legislative objective would be to pass biden's build back better plan, calling it a massive infrastructure bill.\n\nrep. john yarmuth, chairman of the house budget committee, said tuesday that democrats will use every option available to them to pass the upcoming infrastructure bill, but the hope is they will be able to build a bipartisan package that can be passed without using reconciliation. that would mean the legislation would need to garner at least 10 republican votes in the senate.\n\nafter a meeting with a bipartisan group of senators and biden, vice president kamala harris and transportation secretary pete buttigieg last month , sen. jim inhofe, an oklahoma republican, told reporters it was a very good meeting and that there are mutual interests among both sides as long as no one tries to take the bill hostage.\n\nimmigration\n\nbiden took sweeping executive action on immigration shortly after being sworn in, moving swiftly to undo many trump administration policies. but he told reporters at the time, there's a long way to go on the issue, and acknowledged that legislation was needed for a lot of his priorities.\n\nimmigrant advocacy groups are urging the biden administration to move quickly, and the white house announced last month an immigration bill that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of immigrants already in the country and provide a faster track for undocumented immigrants brought to the us as children. biden's proposed bill, if passed, also would remove the word alien from us immigration laws, replacing it with the term noncitizen.\n\nthe legislative effort comes as there are multiple standalone bills in congress aimed at revising smaller pieces of the country's immigration system -- and the administration has said they'd leave it up to congress whether it passes a standalone bill or break it up into multiple pieces. senate majority whip dick durbin, an illinois democrat, and sen. lindsey graham, a south carolina republican, for example, have reintroduced their dream act, which would provide a path to citizenship for immigrants who came to the country illegally as children.\n\nbiden's legislation faces an uphill climb in a narrowly divided congress, where house speaker nancy pelosi has just a small margin and senate democrats do not have the 60 democratic votes needed to pass the measure with just their party's support.\n\nthe administration is also grappling with a surge of unaccompanied migrant children at the us-mexico border that are being held in us border patrol facilities. richmond said during an interview on msnbc tuesday that he is hopeful republicans will work with democrats on addressing immigration, but the administration will not let obstruction get in the way of values and progress and this is something we're going to have to work on.\n\ngun safety\n\nbiden campaigned on strengthening gun safety measures, and on the third anniversary of the deadly parkland shooting earlier this month, biden called on congress to enact commonsense gun law reforms, including widespread firearm sales background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\n\ncongress has long struggled with addressing gun violence in america, even in the wake of mass shootings going back to columbine in 1999. but democrats reintroduced the background check expansion act, gun control legislation which would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. the likelihood of actually passing the bill remains small and it would need significant republican support to overcome a legislative filibuster.\n\ndemocratic sen. chris murphy of connecticut, who is sponsoring the senate version of the plan, told cnn in a phone interview last week, obviously this isn't going to be easy and we're gonna need the white house's help to get it across the finish line, but i truly believe this is the year to get it done.\n\nand democratic rep. mike thompson, who reintroduced the house version of this legislation, told cnn in an interview he hopes this legislation would actually reach biden's desk.\n\ni'm hopeful. sen. murphy, i'm working closely with him. he's working real hard over (in the senate), thompson said.\n\non thursday, the house will vote on legislation aimed to expand background checks on all commercial gun sales, including the bipartisan background checks act of 2021 and the enhanced background checks act of 2021.\n\nreauthorizing the violence against women act\n\ncongress took another step on monday toward reauthorizing the legislation biden cosponsored as a senator in 1994 and expired in 2018.\n\ntexas rep. sheila jackson lee, a democrat, introduced the violence against women reauthorization act of 2021 along with fellow democratic rep. jerry nadler of new york and pennsylvania rep. brian fitzpatrick, the only republican supporting the bill so far and who also co-sponsored the house-passed bill in 2019.\n\nreauthorizing the vawa had stalled in both chambers since it expired, with republicans and democrats introducing their own versions of a reauthorization bill during the previous congress. both sides have accused each other of playing politics with it and the sensitive issue of domestic abuse.\n\nthe new bill builds upon the previous versions of the vawa by providing grants and support to various groups that work on issues relating to sexual assault, domestic violence and prevention, expanding protections, among other things.\n\na provision that would close the  boyfriend loophole , prohibiting dating partners convicted of assault or stalking from purchasing firearms, has been a sticking point between democrats and republicans. the new bill would prohibit those convicted of misdemeanor stalking from buying a firearm and makes it illegal for a person to transfer or sell a firearm or ammunition to a person they believe has been convicted of misdemeanor stalking.\n\nbiden, who campaigned on enacting reauthorization of the vawa, applauded reintroduction of the bill in a statement monday night, urging congress to come together in a bipartisan manner to ensure swift passage in both chambers. sens. patrick leahy of vermont and dianne feinstein of california, both members of the judiciary committee, said in a joint statement that they support the house version of the bill and look forward to working with durbin to advance this important legislation.\n\nhealth care\n\nthe president pledged to make health care more affordable and available for all americans. last month, he signed an executive order that gives uninsured americans who want to buy affordable care act coverage another three months to do so, opening the federal obamacare exchange for a special enrollment period, which he tied to the pandemic.\n\nbut although he can implement some of his health care plans with the stroke a pen, other issues he campaigned on -- like instituting a government-backed public option and increasing federal premium subsidies -- will take congressional action. that will be a challenge since biden can't afford to lose a single democrat in the senate -- and few in the house, after his party lost seats in the chamber.\n\nbut among his top priorities is first saving the affordable care act, on which his health care promises rely.

from miami to washington, hoping to arrive in time for the women's march the next morning. our flight attendant leaned over to me and asked, do you think it's going to make any difference, this march? she wore a pin commemorating her 20 years of airline service, and i could hear the skepticism in her voice. i understood her uncertainty – was the anger and passion shared by so many women across america in the wake of the 2016 presidential election enough to inspire real change?\n\nthe truth was, i had no idea.\n\ncecile richards\n\nas we found out, no one could have predicted the magnitude of the next day. marches erupted across the country and on every continent. several reports said it was likely the largest demonstration on record in the united states, dwarfing the inaugural crowd the day before. by some estimates as many as 4 million people just felt they had to march. so they picked up their signs, left home and spoke with their feet.\n\nso many people remember where they were that day. in washington, marchers packed the national mall for as far as the eye could see. and it wasn't just women, either. folks from every walk of life came out to say, this is my issue, too. a young man carried one of my favorite posters: i'm proud to be marching with the future president of the us – i don't know who she is, but i know she is here!\n\nbeyond washington, thousands of people held up signs in salt lake city, record-breaking crowds gathered in texas, and alaskans of all ages weathered subzero temperatures in fairbanks to show their support. the best part is that these marches were just the beginning.\n\nin the 12 months since january 21, 2017, women have been organizing and agitating like never before. the pussy hat has become an international symbol of the resistance. homegrown women's groups are popping up everywhere, from phoenix to kenosha, wisconsin. tried and true political organizations such as emily's list have seen record numbers of women expressing interest in running for office – more than 26,000 since the 2016 election, according to emily's list president stephanie schriock. and women have been a driving force behind scrappy startups such as swing left and run for something, which are changing the electoral landscape by bringing in new candidates with fresh perspectives.\n\nphotos: women's march on washington photo: mark

nicole monceaux joins in the march. prev next\n\nfueled by the energy of that day – and this administration's unrelenting assault on the rights of just about anyone not deemed white or male or straight enough – women are feeling their power in ways unimaginable the day before the marches.\n\nthe first test came when president donald trump and congress pledged to repeal obamacare and defund planned parenthood. house speaker paul ryan promised it would happen by early february, just days after trump would take office. any other year, with republicans controlling both chambers and the executive branch, that might have happened. but women and young people led the revolt, knowing that trumpcare would take aim at maternity benefits, family planning and affordable health care.\n\nwomen in pink hats and t-shirts flooded town hall meetings, demanding answers. members of congress couldn't handle the heat and started avoiding their own constituents. an avalanche of angry callers bore down on the congressional switchboard. an analysis by democratic pollsters lake research partners examined the usage of the popular app daily action, which directly connects people to their representatives, and showed that 86% of calls made to lawmakers in the months immediately after the march were coming from – you guessed it – women.\n\nthe idea of defunding planned parenthood and repealing obamacare was so unpopular that, just before the legislation came to a vote, a usa today/suffolk university poll found that only 12% of americans supported trumpcare.\n\ntwelve months after this fight began, not only are planned parenthood's doors still open across the country, but millions in america have kept their coverage. it's no coincidence that two republican women, sens. susan collins and lisa murkowski, held strong with the entire democratic senate caucus (and were then joined by sen. john mccain) to stop the legislation that would have ended affordable health care for so many.\n\nwomen aren't only affecting policy; they are determining election outcomes. in the two most closely watched races since the 2016 election, women of color turned out and made history. the democratic sweep in virginia and the election of sen. doug jones in alabama – after a race in which his opponent was accused of sexually abusing young women (allegations he denied) – defied what many believed was possible a year ago.\n\ndemocrats flipped 15 seats in the virginia house of delegates. eleven of those races were won by women, including the first openly transgender state legislator, the first vietnamese-american legislator, and the first two latinas to serve in the house of delegates.\n\nmore broadly, women are shaking the foundations of our culture. since day one of this administration, women have been persisting, reclaiming our time and saying once and for all that #timesup. the radical power of the #metoo movement has demonstrated that we are done accepting the status quo. it's time. an america where everyone has an equal shot at success means our country is more likely to live up to its promise.\n\na year after the women's march, i wish i could find my flight attendant friend and ask her what she thinks. i hope she's seen for herself the power of women standing up and taking charge. i hope she exercises her own power to vote. and i hope she knows that when she does, she won't be alone.\n\ntoday, women are the most potent political force in this country. the women's march sparked a movement, and an unstoppable one at that. we're changing everything: our policies, our culture and our media – and come november, we're going to change our representatives in office.
(cnn)– hillary clinton abrazó el legado político del presidente barack obama el domingo, tratando de detener una oleada de feroces ataques de su rival, bernie sanders, en el debate presidencial demócrata.\n\ncon sanders amenazando con trastornar a clinton en las dos primeras elecciones primarias del próximo mes, la ex secretaria de estado trató de detener su impulso, mermar sus credenciales progresistas y plantear interrogantes acerca de si el autoproclamado socialista tiene las habilidades y la experiencia para ser presidente.\n\nclinton utilizó el último debate antes de las votaciones en iowa y new hampshire -el 1 y el 9 de febrero respectivamente- para dirigirse a los fieles partidarios de obama, quienes según algunos aliados de clinton podrían estar cambiando sus preferencias hacia sanders.\n\nsanders, por su parte, estuvo mucho más cómodo en el ataque a clinton que en sus anteriores encuentros, y la noche en charleston, carolina del sur, fue notable más por sus enfrentamientos personales que por los ataques contra los republicanos. él se defendió de clinton insistiendo en que obama era su amigo y le dio un golpe a la precandidata por sus relaciones con wall street desde que dejó el departamento de estado.\n\n«no recibo dinero de los grandes bancos, que no recibo pagos personales de goldman sachs por discursos», dijo sanders.\n\nchoques sobre programa de salud y armas\n\npublicidad\n\nclinton advirtió que el plan de sanders de un medicare para la atención universal aumentaría los impuestos a la clase media, reabriría el amargo debate con los republicanos y podría poner en peligro el obamacare.\n\nsanders respondió furioso, ya que después de luchar por la atención sanitaria universal durante décadas, ahora estaba siendo acusado de sabotear el obamacare.\n\n«nadie está destruyendo esto, vamos a seguir adelante», dijo sanders, quejándose de que 29 millones de estadounidenses todavía carecen de atención sanitaria.\n\nclinton también atacó a su rival por votar «con la nra –la asociación nacional del rifle-, con el lobby de las armas, en numerosas ocasiones», y desgranó una lista de ocasiones en las que dijo que el senador de vermont se puso del lado de los fabricantes de armas.\n\nsanders rechazó su lista de cargos. «creo que la secretaria clinton sabe que lo que dice es muy falso», dijo.\n\nel intercambio fue un momento de gran tensión, en un escenario ubicado muy cerca de la iglesia en charleston donde un autoproclamado supremacista blanco mató a nueve afroamericanos en un tiroteo el año pasado.\n\nla carrera\n\nla estrategia de clinton de aproximarse al legado de obama se dio, irónicamente, en un estado donde ambos se enfrentaron amargamente durante la campaña de 2008. ocho años más tarde, los votantes afroamericanos en el estado podrían proporcionarle un cortafuegos contra la subida de sanders en las encuestas.\n\nrecientes encuestas en iowa y new hampshire muestran a clinton en una posición cada vez más precaria. una encuesta de des moines register / bloomberg política colocó a clinton a solo dos puntos en iowa la semana pasada. una encuesta realizada por la universidad de monmouth en new hampshire puso a sanders por delante con una ventaja de 14 puntos.\n\nsanders intentó desbalancear a clinton sobre su rápido aumento en las encuestas en el último mes, desatando los temores entre algunos partidarios de clinton de que la historia se repita, después de que su campaña de 2008 fracasó cuando el entonces senador obama ganó en iowa.\n\nel senador señaló que cuando comenzó la campaña, «ella estaba 50 puntos por delante.\n\nclinton aún mantiene una amplia ventaja sobre sanders a nivel nacional. una nueva encuesta nacional de nbc / wall street journal el domingo mostró clinton sobre sanders con el 59% y el 34% de las preferencias respectivamente, y con el tercer candidato en la carrera, el exgobernador de maryland, martin o'malley, con el 2%.\n\nla decisión de clinton de unirse tan estrechamente a obama podría ser arriesgada si clinton gana la nominación y llega a enfrentarse a los republicanos. mientras que los índices de aprobación del presidente son muy altos entre los demócratas, la mayoría de los estadounidenses todavía desaprueba el trabajo que está haciendo, por lo que los acontecimientos en la economía y en todo el mundo podrían dejar a clinton vulnerable por la asociación con su legado.

season are cast, and cnn's reality check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.\n\nthe team of reporters, researchers and editors across cnn selected key statements and rated them: true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated.\n\njeb bush\n\nreality check: bush on authorization of force against isis\n\nby kate grise, cnn\n\nformer florida gov. jeb bush said the senate did not give president barack obama the authorization he asked for to use military force against isis.\n\nwe shouldn't have the warfighters have their arms tied behind their back as president obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time, bush said.\n\nlast february, the white house proposed a resolution which asked congress to authorize the limited use of the united states armed forces to fight isis alongside the anti-isis coalition, but did not go so far as to authorize putting american soldiers on the ground.\n\nneither the senate nor the house brought the resolution up for a vote – and it is still sitting on capitol hill.\n\nlast month, the president once again called upon congress to vote on his resolution.\n\nif congress believes, as i do, that we are at war with isil, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists, he said, using an another term for isis.\n\nit should be noted that the actions that the president's resolution would legalize were already underway and will continue whether or not congress votes on this draft.\n\nwe rate bush's claim as true because congress did not bring the resolution up for a vote.\n\nflorida sen. marco rubio then pushed back against bush, saying, the authorization that barack obama asked for was not against isis, it was against (syrian president bashar al-) assad. john kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small. i don't think the united states should be engaged in symbolic military activity. it was not against isis, it was against assad.\n\nobama did, in fact, go to congress in august 2013 to ask for authorization to strike the government of assad in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. that resolution was never passed by either chamber but was presented to the senate after passing through a senate committee.\n\nwe rate rubio's claim that obama's resolution was not about targeting isis as false, but we also rate his claim that obama also asked congress to authorize the use of force against assad as true.\n\nreality check: bush says you can buy his book for $2.99 on amazon\n\nby gisela crespo, cnn\n\na quick look on amazon shows the kindle version of bush's 2013 book, immigration wars: forging an american solution, goes for $11.99. the hardcover is priced at $18.78 and the paperback is $13.17. however, you can get a used copy for as little as 50 cents.\n\nwhen it comes to the price of his book, at least used, we rate bush's statement as true.\n\nas for immigration wars not being a bestseller, it's true: it ranks #346,025 on the amazon bestsellers list.\n\nrand paul\n\nreality check: paul on bulk data intelligence program not stopping terrorism\n\nby ryan browne, cnn\n\nkentucky sen. rand paul said, the bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy, did not stop one terrorist attack. i don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security. when we look at this bulk collection – the court has looked at this – even the court declared it to be illegal. if we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way. let's use the fourth amendment.\n\nthe national security agency's bulk collection of american telephone metadata, which included the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls, as well as the time and date of those calls but not their content, has proven controversial. there has been robust debate as to whether it has actually contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks.\n\nobama had strongly defended the internet and phone data collections, saying in 2013 the programs have saved lives and thwarted at least 50 terror threats. however, in testimony to the senate judiciary committee, former nsa deputy director john inglis admitted that the number of cases where the program was used was actually 13. the program was terminated last year.\n\ngeoffrey stone, a member of the review committee appointed by the white house to examine the program, said in an interview with nbc news that the committee found that the bulk data collection program by itself could not be credited with stopping any really big attacks.\n\nthe new america foundation conducted an in-depth analysis of 225 terrorists that had been apprehended since 9/11, and the study found that the contribution of nsa's bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal.\n\nbut experts caution that that's the way intelligence works: many intelligence collection operations operate with multiple intelligence techniques that serve as redundancies.\n\nno one program is typically responsible for stopping an attack, so it is impossible to say with certainty that the program by itself stopped an attack that could not have been prevented with more conventional methods.\n\nverdict: true.\n\nchris christie\n\nreality check: christie on new jersey job growth\n\nby tami luhby, cnnmoney\n\nnew jersey gov. chris christie, who has been attacked on his stewardship of the garden state, bragged that in 2015, new jersey has had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.\n\nhe's correct. the garden state added 65,200 jobs last year, according to federal bureau of labor statistics data. the next best performance was in 2012, when new jersey employers added 44,000 jobs.\n\nstill, new jersey's job growth was rather mediocre when compared to other states. in december, the state ranked 24th in year-over-year job growth, according to arizona state university's school of business.\n\nverdict: true.\n\nben carson\n\nreality check: carson on absurd government regulations\n\nby marshall cohen, cnn\n\nretired neurosurgeon ben carson had a lot to say about the far-flung reach of the federal government.\n\nwell, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, i'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, carson said. last year, there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. if you stack that up, it would be a three-story building. this is absolutely absurd.\n\naccording to the competitive enterprise institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, there were in fact 81,611 pages of new government rules, proposed rules, regulatory notices and executive orders in 2015. the group, which says it opposes onerous government regulation, notes that 2015 set a record for pages of new federal regulations.\n\nso, would all those pages really stack up as tall as a three-story building?\n\nwe borrowed a ream of paper from the newsroom copier (500 sheets) and measured it to be two inches thick. the average building story height is 10 feet. so, if you do the math, a three-story building would be about as tall as 90,000 sheets of paper. that's pretty close to the height of an imaginary stack of new regulations.\n\nverdict: true.\n\nmarco rubio\n\nreality check: rubio on cruz's budget votes\n\nby kevin liptak, cnn\n\nrubio sought to discredit the national security record of his republican colleague sen. ted cruz by claiming the only budget that ted has voted for is a budget that rand paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.\n\nrubio's claim harkens back to a 2013 amendment introduced by paul that would have set defense spending levels at what, on paper, was a lower level than in previous years.\n\npaul, who has warned against big government and overspending, did tout the measure as a way to shrink the military.\n\nthe budget seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment, he wrote at the time.\n\nbut the bill came after mandatory across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, were enacted that slashed defense spending. taking into account the lower levels under the sequester, paul's plan actually increased spending on the military.\n\nrubio's claim that the 2013 vote is the only budget cruz has supported also begs scrutiny. when rubio made a similar claim in a fox business debate, cruz fired back that he supported one of rubio's own budget amendments that increased military spending to $697 billion.\n\ncruz was right: he voted for the measure in march 2015, though it ultimately failed to garner enough support for passage.\n\nrubio's claim that cruz supported paul's budget – which was advertised as reducing the size of the military, but which actually increased defense spending – is true. but his assertion that cruz hasn't supported other measures is false, since he supported rubio's own bill that increased spending.\n\nreality check: rubio claims he never supported cap-and-trade\n\nby marshall cohen, cnn\n\nasked about environmental policy, rubio said he has never supported cap-and-trade, a policy designed to drive down pollution by creating a regulated market for carbon emissions.\n\nif they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it, rubio said, referring to efforts in florida to create a cap-and-trade program. i have never supported cap-and-trade, and i never thought it was a good idea, and i was clear about that at the time.\n\nhis record at the time is clear – but it's not what he claimed thursday night at the debate.\n\nin march 2008, rubio told a local tv station that he believed cap-and-trade was inevitable on the federal level, and therefore, florida should act quickly to become an early complier so it can help influence what that cap-and-trade looks like.\n\nhe went on to propose giving the florida department of environmental protection a mandate to design a cap-and-trade, or a carbon tax program, and bring it back to the legislature for ratification. months later, rubio presided over a unanimous vote in the florida house to do just that, according to the tampa bay times.\n\nso, rubio's claim at the debate that he never supported cap-and-trade is false. he might not support the idea now, but he helped pave the way for florida to create a cap-and-trade system when he was a state lawmaker.\n\nted cruz\n\nreality check: cruz on obamacare as a job-killer\n\nby tami luhby, cnnmoney\n\nblasting obamacare fell to texas sen. ted cruz on thursday night.\n\nit is the biggest job-killer in this country, cruz said. millions of americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work.\n\nin fact, obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the 2015 kaiser family founation/health research and education trust survey released in september 2015.\n\nthe report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.\n\nan adp research institute study had similar findings. one reason may be that the economy has been improving. some companies interviewed by adp said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.\n\nas to whether employers are cutting jobs because of obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from labor department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. the number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.\n\nverdict: false.\n\nreality check: cruz on naval power\n\nby jamie crawford, cnn\n\nclaiming that the united states military has been dramatically downgraded during the obama administration, cruz said that when the first gulf war began in 1991, the united states had 529 ships. today, we have 272.\n\nthat figure appears to be correct, according to the navy's naval history and heritage command website, which tracks the size of the navy going back to the 19th century.\n\nunder the section u.s. navy active ship force levels, the site says there were 529 active ships in the navy as of september 30, 1991. the gulf war took place in january 1991. for the record, the site claims there were 570 active ships as of september 30, 1990, less than two months after saddam hussein invaded kuwait and launched the international crisis that eventually led to the war.\n\nthe navy's website keeps tabs on the current force structure and says there are currently 273 deployable ships in the u.s. arsenal.\n\naccording to the navy, the navy decommissioned many older ships after the end of the cold war in 1991, a decision that led to a smaller overall fleet. ship levels also were not greatly increased in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks as older surface warships have been replaced at a less than one-to-one ratio.\n\nwhile the numbers cruz cited of naval power are correct, the decline of ship power took place over the course of two decades and multiple presidential administrations, and not just the past seven years, as cruz posited.\n\nverdict: true, but misleading.\n\nreality check: cruz on carpet bombing\n\nby lisa rose, cnn\n\nduring a discussion of isis, cruz offered a military history lesson: you want to know what carpet bombing is? it's what we did in the first persian gulf war. one thousand, one hundred air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.\n\ncruz is wrong in his characterization of the gulf war bombing campaign. the air attacks conducted during the gulf war were precision-targeted, with laser-guided bombs designed to hit enemy fighters and minimize collateral damage. that is the mirror opposite of carpet bombing, which is an indiscriminate attack blanketing an area with explosives. the united states hasn't engaged in attacks that could be described as carpet bombing since the vietnam war. in 1977, the geneva conventions adopted a protocol that banned indiscriminate air attacks of cities and towns with large concentrations of civilians.\n\nthe term carpet bombing dates back to world war ii, when the allies bombarded broad swaths of nazi germany and japan, killing thousands of civilians. as technology advanced, enabling the military to conduct more precise airstrikes, the united states shifted towards narrowly targeted attacks. during the gulf war, the united states used smart weapons systems designed to carry out attacks with surgical accuracy.\n\nthe texas senator, who has never served in the military, has used the carpet bombing line several times over the course of the campaign. during the cnn gop debate in december, moderator wolf blitzer asked cruz if he would carpet bomb the isis-held city of raqqa.\n\ncruz said, you would carpet bomb where isis is, not a city, but the location of the troops. you use air power directed and you have embedded special forces to direct the air power. but the object isn't to level a city. the object is to kill the isis terrorists.\n\ncruz is wrong that the u.s. used carpet bombing in the first persian gulf war. to do so would have been a war crime.\n\nverdict: false.\n\nmike huckabee\n\nreality check: huckabee on manufacturing jobs\n\nby tami luhby, cnnmoney\n\nformer arkansas gov. mike huckabee said the nation has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs just since the year 2000.\n\nthat's true. there were 12.3 million manufacturing workers in the u.s. last month, down from 17.3 million at the start of 2000, according to the federal bureau of labor statistics.\n\nhuckabee went on to say he visited newton, iowa, where workers lost their jobs in 2007 after maytag's washer-dryer facility went out of business. all those jobs went to mexico, he said.\n\nthat's not so true. maytag, which was headquartered in newton, was bought by whirlpool in 2006. whirlpool shuttered the maytag factory and shifted production to whirlpool's existing factories in mexico and ohio, according to a 2007 new york times story.\n\nverdict: true on the loss of manufacturing jobs, but false on all of newton's maytag jobs going to mexico.\n\ncarly fiorina\n\nreality check: fiorina on planned parenthood\n\nby sonam vashi, cnn\n\nplanned parenthood engages in partial-birth abortion, in late term abortion, former hewlett-packard ceo carly fiorina said. they alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts, they have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.\n\nover the summer, a conservative group called the center for medical progress released undercover videos and accused planned parenthood of performing partial birth abortions and selling fetal tissue.\n\npartial birth abortions are illegal, and planned parenthood has repeatedly denied that it performs partial birth abortions, or that it has participated in any illegal activity. on monday, a texas grand jury investigation into planned parenthood cleared the group, instead indicting two members of the center for medical progress who secretly recorded planned parenthood members.\n\nofficials in 11 states have cleared planned parenthood of wrongdoing, according to the organization. officials in another eight states declined to even investigate the accusations made by the center for medical progress.\n\nplanned parenthood has said that money it accepts for fetal tissue is used to cover costs, not to generate profit. in october, the group announced that it would no longer accept any reimbursements for fetal tissue used for research.\n\nplanned parenthood does not engage in partial birth abortions, and they do not sell tissue for any profit (although they have now said they will not accept any reimbursement whatsoever).\n\nverdict: false.\n\nreality check: fiorina on the department of veterans affairs\n\nby sonam vashi, cnn\n\nfiorina said, the american people got a bill passed through congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the v.a. for dereliction of duty, when we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the v.a. handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performances.\n\nlet's unpack her statements:\n\nthe bill to which fiorina is referring, the veterans affairs management accountability act of 2014, would give authority to the secretary of the va to fire about 400 senior executives for poor performance. the bill passed the house in may 2014 but has since been sitting in the senate.\n\nso fiorina's claim that the bill has passed through congress is false.\n\nthe 307,000 number comes from a veterans affairs report released last september and it represents the number of pending records that belonged to veterans who had died in previous months. however, that number does not necessarily represent veterans who were actively seeking treatment in va health care, according to the va's inspector general.\n\ndue to problems with the va database, some of those records include people who died before the va had even started its health care enrollment system, or people who did not apply for health care benefits specifically. to say definitively that 307,000 people have died waiting for health care may be a stretch, so we rate her claim as it's complicated.\n\nand in november 2015, usa today reported that the va had given out $142 million in bonuses to employees in 2014, as incentives or tied to performance reviews. that claim is true.\n\nrick santorum\n\nreality check: santorum on americans without college degrees\n\nby lisa rose, cnn\n\npresenting himself as a working class advocate, former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum said the other candidates are ignoring a large swath of the populace. he declared that 74% of americans don't have college degrees.\n\nsantorum, who has two postgraduate degrees, mentioned the same stat during the last debate two weeks ago, and our verdict was false.\n\nbut let's check our numbers again. there are 209.3 million americans aged 25 and older, according to the 2014 census, and 142.4 million of them have not attained a bachelor's degree or higher. that's 68% of americans, not 74%.\n\nduring an appearance on face the nation in april, santorum said that he would champion the 70% of americans who don't have a college degree. that was close enough to the census figure to earn santorum a true rating from politifact.\n\nunfortunately, the penn state graduate changed his calculation to 74% and has repeated the same incorrect stat at two debates in a row. perhaps it's a pennsylvania hat tip to groundhog day or maybe he needs a math refresher. our verdict was and remains false.

(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump's relationship with russian president vladimir putin is remarkable on a number of levels but none more so than this one: for a man who is ready, willing and able to attack anyone, trump never has a bad word to say about putin. and for a man who appears to have the attention span and message discipline of a toddler, trump is somehow able to stick to his say-nothing-bad-about-putin strategy.\n\nit's actually somewhat amazing when you think about it. which is what this tweet from david gelles, executive producer of cnn's political programming, got me to do over the weekend:\n\nthings trump has insulted on twitter more than putin (a partial list):\n\namazon\n\nnfl players who kneel\n\njudges\n\nrobert de niro\n\nharley davidson\n\nmitch mcconnell\n\nthe red hen\n\njeff sessions\n\nucla basketball players\n\noprah\n\nmaxine waters\n\nstunning, no? and as gelles notes, this is far from a complete list of twitter attacks from trump. to expand on gelles' list, here's some of what trump has recently tweeted about the 11 people, places or things listed above.\n\n1. amazon: the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the u.s. supreme court two months ago. next up is the u.s. post office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their delivery boy for a big percentage of their packages….in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for amazon. is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought? (7/23/18)\n\n2. nfl players who kneel: the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again - can't believe it! isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? the $40,000,000 commissioner must now make a stand. first time kneeling, out for game. second time kneeling, out for season/no pay! (7/20/18)\n\n3. judges: hiring many thousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the u.s. illegally. children brought back to their country. (6/25/18)\n\n4. robert de niro: robert de niro, a very low iq individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. i watched him last night and truly believe he may be 'punch-drunk.' (6/13/18)\n\n5. harley davidson:  harley-davidson should stay 100% in america, with the people that got you your success. i've done so much for you, and then this. other companies are coming back where they belong! we won't forget, and neither will your customers or your now very happy competitors! (6/27/18)\n\n6. mitch mcconnell: can you believe that mitch mcconnell, who has screamed repeal & replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. must repeal & replace obamacare! (8/10/17)\n\n7. the red hen: the red hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like sarah huckabee sanders. i always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside! (6/25/18)\n\n8. jeff sessions: the russian witch hunt hoax continues, all because jeff sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself…i would have quickly picked someone else. so much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined…and sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion! (6/5/18)\n\n9. ucla basketball players: do you think the three ucla basketball players will say thank you president trump? they were headed for 10 years in jail! (11/15/17)\n\n10. oprah: just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey, who at one point i knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 minutes. the questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! (2/18/2018)\n\n11. maxine waters: crazy maxine waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with nancy pelosi, the face of the democrat party. her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the democrats (7/3/18)\n\nin each of these cases, trump would say he is responding to being attacked – whether directly (as is the case with de niro) or indirectly (nfl players kneeling). they hit him. so he hit them back.\n\nand yet: the us intelligence community has unanimously concluded that russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election – a move that seems like a direct shot at, well, democracy itself. and trump remains silent on putin and the country he rules. hmmm.

(photo by cj gunther-pool/getty images)\n\nstory highlights this isn't the first time barack obama has weighed in on events during donald trump's presidency obama clearly feels these are extraordinary times, cillizza writes\n\n(cnn) —\n\nformer president barack obama had a blunt message for his successor on sunday night: i'm not letting the affordable care act go down without a fight.\n\nit is my fervent hope and the hope of millions that, regardless of party, such courage is still possible, obama said while accepting a profile in courage award at the john f. kennedy library in boston. that today's members of congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth. even when it contradicts party positions. i hope that current members of congress recall that it doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful.\n\nobama's plea comes just days after house republicans took the first step toward dismantling the aca – aka obamacare – with the narrow passage of the american health care act last thursday. it also comes on the verge of the republican-controlled senate beginning its own consideration of a plan to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nand it sends a strong signal that the 44th president isn't going to simply sit on the sidelines as the 45th president takes apart his signature legislative accomplishment. he's going to not only defend the law but also make the affirmative case for it.\n\nthis isn't the first time obama has weighed in on events during donald trump's presidency. in late january, in the wake of trump's travel ban executive order – and the protests that almost immediately sprung up – the former president released a statement through a spokesman praising the demonstrations as what we expect to see when american values are at stake.\n\nobama's willingness to wade into the national conversation – and offer not-so-oblique criticisms of trump – is something of a break from presidential tradition. typically, ex-presidents largely avoid any sort of engagement on the policies of their successor. george w. bush, for example, virtually disappeared during obama's term. (worth noting: bush's vice president, dick cheney, was an early and active critic of obama.)\n\nobama, however, clearly feels these are extraordinary times. while he worked hard publicly to ensure that the handoff of power to trump was orderly and respectful, it's obvious that obama not only disagrees deeply with his successor's worldview but that he also regards trump's approach and actions as potentially very dangerous to the country.\n\nand, given those stakes, he can't sit on the sidelines. in fact, obama said as much in the farewell address he gave in chicago in january.\n\ndemocracy can buckle when we give in to fear, he said at one point. so just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.\n\nat the end of that speech, obama promised: i won't stop; in fact, i will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.\n\nhe isn't stopping – particularly with the health care system that bears his names in peril. if the senate wants to repeal and replace obamacare, obama seemed to be saying sunday night, they're going to have to go through me.
(cnn) mike bloomberg's rivals tore into his claim to be the best candidate to defeat donald trump in november by branding him as a misogynistic, obamacare-hating, soft-on-wall-street bully -- basically the rough equivalent of that other new york billionaire.\n\nthe question now is whether the torching that unfolded after bloomberg's first turn on the debate stage in las vegas will matter more than the billions of advertising dollars he's doling out to purchase a poll surge and saturate the airwaves with a positive image of himself.\n\nthe former new york mayor knew he'd face fierce heat wednesday night from rivals who resent his stunning spending spree and his failure to take part in the first four nominating contests. bloomberg tried to keep his focus on his central argument of the night: that the presidency is a management job, and he is a proven manager, unlike trump.\n\nbut nothing could prepare him for the welcome that materialized and that left him struggling to counter attacks on his political and personal vulnerabilities.\n\ni'd like to talk about who we're running against -- a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, sen. elizabeth warren said moments into the clash.\n\nand no, i'm not talking about donald trump, i'm talking about mayor bloomberg, said warren, who drew gasps from the audience and debated with the desperation of a candidate fighting to save her campaign.\n\nthe attacks often left the former new york mayor flatfooted. he struggled to parry attacks everyone knew were coming. by appearing to mock turbo tax online preparation kits, he looked out of touch with the modest economic circumstances of regular americans.\n\nand he was unable to display empathy for women who are victims of workplace discrimination or americans who struggle through life without his riches -- as his foes slammed him over his past opposition to the minimum wage. still, he did point out that he was spending his money in philanthropic ventures -- and to get rid of trump.\n\neven bloomberg's campaign seemed to admit he underwhelmed in the hideously tough assignment of walking into a debate cold after his rivals had been waging war for months.\n\nhe was just warming up tonight. we fully expect mike will continue to build on tonight's performance when he appears on the stage in south carolina next tuesday, the campaign said.\n\nin traditional presidential politics, bloomberg's struggles on wednesday night would pitch his campaign into serious trouble.\n\nbut while millions of people watched the debate on television and will see clips on social media, bloomberg has been mounting the most concentrated cash dump in primary history.\n\nit's possible that far more americans will see his soaring ads presenting him as a moderate voice of common sense and a master manager than ever learn of his debate stage stumbles.\n\nhis $400 million push has already lifted him to second place in national polls. and bloomberg has far more cash than his rivals to play across the entire national battlefield on super tuesday.\n\nit may take a few days to find out whether bloomberg's rivals managed to carve out a contrast between the sunny image in his campaign ads and the sometimes terse figure on stage.\n\nand then there's the question of whether debates matter that much anyway. it could be that the cacophony of multiple, fierce attacks from a presidential field piling on will only underscore bloomberg's argument to centrist voters that he's different.\n\nsanders escapes without serious damage\n\nand there was another dynamic at play on wednesday that suggests that even uninspiring debate performances will not fatally hole bloomberg's campaign for weeks to come.\n\nbernie sanders seemed to escape the debate without a significant blow to his now front-running campaign -- and had the advantage at least four other centrist rivals arguing he's too radical to beat trump but who have failed to slow him down.\n\nif joe biden, amy klobuchar, elizabeth warren and pete buttigieg don't find a way to consolidate the political middle soon, bloomberg's massive resources could find him a path.\n\ni don't think there's any chance of the senator beating president trump, bloomberg said of sanders, spelling out the best argument for his candidacy, save his massive fortune.\n\nthe financial data billionaire also drew on his own professional heritage to try to defuse the attacks and to present himself as the antidote to the chaos ripping through washington.\n\nthis is a manager job and donald trump is not a manager, bloomberg said.\n\nthis is a job where you have to build teams. he doesn't have teams so he makes decisions without knowing what's going or the implications for what he does. we cannot run the railroad this way, he said.\n\nin effect, bloomberg is asking democrats to overlook the fact that he hardly touches the party's heart -- and may be an imperfect messenger for grass roots energy that is moving to the left. he's implicitly arguing that only he can beat sanders and oust trump from the oval office.\n\n'why not chose a democrat?'\n\nfrom left, democratic presidential candidates, former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., sen. bernie sanders, i-vt.,former vice president joe biden, former south bend mayor pete buttigieg, sen. amy klobuchar, d-minn., stand on stage before a democratic presidential primary debate\n\nthursday's debate also revealed another irony of the democratic race that could come down to a battle between sanders and bloomberg.\n\nmost americans don't see where they fit if they've got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power, buttigieg said.\n\nlet's put forward somebody who is actually a democrat.\n\nwarren was the candidate who seemed to realize she had most to lose after poor performances in iowa and new hampshire and failing to oust sanders as the champion of the left.\n\nat times, the massachusetts senator seemed to seize control of the night from the moderators and forensically dismantled bloomberg's answers to her attacks.\n\nwe are not going to beat donald trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against, warren said.\n\nthe former new york city mayor has been beset by accusations that he made sexually suggestive comments in the 1990s, and that bloomberg lp was a hostile workplace for women. his campaign has said that he sometimes made comments that did not reflect his values and that his company has always elevated women.\n\nbut biden also faces an existential challenge to his candidacy from bloomberg, who is essentially arguing that he's better placed to fulfill the mission around which the former vice president has anchored his campaign beating trump.\n\nbiden jabbed bloomberg over a controversial policing tactic when he was new york mayor, for which he later apologized.\n\nhe said bloomberg backed stop and frisk -- throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\n\nboth buttigieg and klobuchar also lined up bloomberg -- but also got involved in a bitter personal spat that appeared to reveal a real and growing dislike between them.

(photo by win mcnamee/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nwhen he first ran for president, donald trump blasted the obama administration for hurting senior citizens by slashing billions from medicare.\n\nnow, the tables have turned. democrats are piling on trump, accusing him of breaking his campaign promise not to touch the federal health care program for the elderly.\n\nthe trump administration unveiled a budget monday that would reduce spending in medicare as well as medicaid, which provides coverage for low-income americans, by hundreds of billions of dollars compared to current law.\n\nformer vice president joe biden, who is considering a run for the 2020 democratic nomination, told a crowd tuesday that trump is curtailing spending to pay for the tax cut he gave the super wealthy, a reference to the 2017 gop tax law.\n\ntrading medicare and medicaid for tax breaks?, he said in a speech before the international association of fire fighters. how is that going to help the people in this room or most of the people you live with? how is that going to help this country?\n\nit's notable that trump is proposing even larger spending reductions for medicare than he has over the past two years. in fact, his first budget barely touched the program at all.\n\ntrump's 2020 budget, however, reduces medicare spending by $845 billion over 10 years compared to current law. that includes shifting roughly $269 billion in funding for training medical residents and payments to hospitals for caring for the uninsured to the department of health and human services' budget.\n\nfactoring in this change, medicare spending would be $575 billion lower, said marc goldwein, senior vice president at the committee for a responsible federal budget, a think tank.\n\ntrump's budget also includes other provisions – such as medical liability reform and drug industry changes – that would indirectly affect medicare and bring federal savings down to roughly $515 billion, goldwein said.\n\nthe vast majority of the medicare changes are reductions in payments to providers, which already has several hospital groups up in arms.\n\nthe cuts proposed today raise serious concerns about how hospitals and health systems can ensure they serve as the safety net for their patients, wrote rick pollack, chief executive of the american hospital association, in a blog post after the budget proposal was released.\n\nmedicare currently pays hospital outpatient departments more than doctors' offices for certain services. the trump administration wants to eliminate that differential. it also wants to slow the growth of payments for skilled nursing, inpatient rehab facilities and home health services, said tricia neuman, director, program on medicare policy at the kaiser family foundation.\n\ndemocrats have wasted no time highlighting these cuts, with house majority leader steny hoyer of maryland accusing the president of abandoning senior citizens.\n\n2. how will republicans explain to seniors that they want to cut $845 billion from #medicare? #trumpbudget — steny (wear a mask) hoyer (@leaderhoyer) march 11, 2019\n\nthe rhetoric harkens back to earlier this decade when republicans lashed out at former president barack obama for including similar provider payment cuts in the affordable care act, saying that he was hurting the elderly.\n\nobama also curtailed payments to private insurers in medicare advantage, which trump does not do. his administration, in fact, promotes medicare advantage, but there is also less evidence these days of significant federal overpayments in the program, neuman said.\n\nwhen it comes to medicaid, trump once again floats huge spending reductions as compared to current law, though it's hard to decipher the exact amount since some are interconnected. but the budget also serves as a menu of longtime republican visions for the program, including repealing medicaid expansion and obamacare subsidies and giving states a fixed sum of money, known as a block grant, instead.\n\nplus, it would limit federal support for the traditional medicaid program by providing states either a block grant or a set amount for each participant.\n\none new proposal is requiring able-bodied, working-age medicaid enrollees to work. the trump administration is promoting work mandates and has approved requests from eight states to add it to their programs. but his budget would make work requirements mandatory nationwide, said robin rudowitz, associate director for the program on medicaid and the uninsured at the kaiser family foundation.

(ap photo/j. scott applewhite)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe current government shutdown is on track to outlast all previous government shutdowns if it extends into saturday. and with both sides still seemingly unwilling to budge on their stances regarding funding for a border wall – the chances of it rolling into saturday and its 22nd day seem likely.\n\nalthough this particular shutdown has resulted from an impasse over border security, here's a look back at a few previous shutdowns in years past and how long they lasted.\n\nfebruary 2018\n\non february 9, 2018, republican kentucky sen. rand paul blocked a spending bill in an effort to shine a light on the national debt.\n\ni can't in all good honesty, in all good faith, just look the other way because my party is now complicit in the deficits, paul said at the time on the senate floor.\n\nhis remarks on the floor prevented the senate from passing the legislation by the midnight deadline, but the shutdown only lasted mere hours as president donald trump eventually signed the legislation later that day.\n\njanuary 2018\n\ndemocrats in january 2018 refused to vote on a spending bill in an attempt to negotiate a plan for undocumented immigrants.\n\nthe shutdown ended after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and senate minority leader chuck schumer made an agreement that the senate would take up legislation to deal with individuals who were part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, which trump has sought to end. a permanent solution for daca has yet to come to fruition as the program has been in legal limbo.\n\noctober 2013\n\ntexas sen. ted cruz, a republican, helped lead the charge in october 2013 to shutdown the government as part of a protest over the affordable care act, more colloquially known as obamacare. cruz's efforts were met with no success though, as both the senate and the presidency were controlled by democrats.\n\nrepublicans ultimately caved after 16 days in their efforts to strip funding for the health care plan, and agreed to fund the government at its current levels, in addition to a small change regarding income verification for health care subsidies.\n\ndecember 1995 to january 1996\n\nthe previous longest shutdown took place during former president bill clinton's time in office – lasting a total of 21 days.\n\nclinton and congressional republicans disagreed over federal spending, and republicans refused to sign a bill in an effort to get democrats to cut funding for medicare and medicaid.\n\nthe shutdown rolled into the new year, and ended only after clinton agreed to balance the budget within seven years and submit a balanced budget plan to the congressional budget office.\n\ncnn's doug criss and z. byron wolf contributed to this report.
(cnn) —\n\nbeto o'rourke says he supports universal health care, but he wants to take a different path to get there than many of his more progressive rivals for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination.\n\nthe former texas representative is backing a little-known house democratic proposal called medicare for america, which calls for expanding government-run health coverage while keeping employer-sponsored insurance plans.\n\nfor o'rourke, the proposal's appeal is that he thinks it moves the country to guaranteed health care more quickly than the alternatives, including the signature medicare for all proposal from vermont sen. bernie sanders, an independent who is also vying for the democratic nomination. that's in part because it would maintain the private insurance industry, which is a deal breaker among progressives.\n\nwhat it says is, if you like your employer-sponsored insurance, you like the network that you're in, you like the doctors that you can see, you're happy with that, you can keep it, o'rourke said thursday in portsmouth, new hampshire. in response to an audience question. if you do not like your employer-based insurance and want to enroll in medicare, you can. if you have no insurance whatsoever or if you are under-insured today, you can enroll in medicare as well.\n\nwhile many americans like the idea of expanding medicare, their support drops when they hear private insurance would be eliminated, according to polling by the kaiser family foundation. medicare for america would address those concerns, said jen tolbert, the foundation's director of state health reform.\n\nthe bill does try to strike a middle ground, she said.\n\nthe medicare for america legislation was introduced last year by reps. rosa delauro, a connecticut democrat, and jan schakowsky, a democrat from illinois. but unlike most of the other medicare for all-type plans, it doesn't have a senate version that's supported by other candidates.\n\nthe gradual shift to a government-run program is very similar to a proposal from the center for american progress, a moderate left-leaning think tank. it provides the most politically viable path to universal coverage, while respecting those who like their employer coverage, said topher spiro, the center's vice president for health policy.\n\nfor those who are not satisfied with their employer coverage, it allows them the option to move over to the medicare plan at their own pace, spiro said. our view is that people will vote with their feet.\n\nretaining private insurance plans, however, is unlikely to win the plan many fans in the health care industry. it's still a stepping stone to a single payer system, which eliminates consumer choice and does little to address costs, said lauren crawford shaver, executive director of the partnership for america's health care future, a coalition of insurance, pharmaceutical, hospital and doctor groups, which opposes all medicare for all-type plans.\n\nhere's how medicare for america would work:\n\nmedicare for america provides comprehensive benefits – including prescription drugs, dental, vision and long-term care – to those currently on medicare, medicaid and obamacare plans, as well as to the uninsured. newborns would automatically be enrolled.\n\nprivate insurance, however, would continue to be an option. large employers could keep providing benefits, though they can also help their workers buy medicare for america coverage. employees can also choose medicare for america coverage over their work-based plan. and folks could opt to buy private policies through a medicare advantage-type plan or decide to keep their children on their work-based polices.\n\nthe legislation, however, isn't as generous as the medicare for all proposals, which essentially provides all care at no cost. enrollees would have to pay up to 9.7% of their monthly income as premiums, though the poor would pay nothing and subsidies would be available for the middle class. there would also be deductibles and co-pays, with an annual limit of $3,500, or $5,000 for families.\n\nto finance the program, the plans calls for undoing the republican tax bill, imposing a 5% surtax on adjusted gross income above $500,000, and increasing the medicare payroll tax. also, there would be levies on investment income above a certain threshold, tobacco products, beer, wine, liquor, and sugar-sweetened drinks. states would also have to contribute an amount equal to what they currently spend on medicaid.
washington (cnn) as senators decided thursday whether to call witnesses in donald trump's impeachment trial, the president did what he usually does: say numerous things that aren't true.\n\ntrump critics have warned that he would be emboldened if he were acquitted by the senate. in the hours before republican sen. lamar alexander announced he would vote against calling witnesses, likely ensuring a quick acquittal , it was at least clear that trump was not at all chastened.\n\non thursday, the president did a fox news interview, delivered a speech in michigan nominally about the new us-mexico-canada agreement, and held a campaign rally in des moines, iowa. he was dishonest in all three venues, repeating some of his favorite falsehoods in rapid succession.\n\nwe're not finished fact checking the transcripts, but here are the 27 false claims we've identified already:\n\nimpeachment\n\ntrump told fox news' peter doocy of impeachment: it's a ridiculous, horrible partisan, situation. we won 196 to nothing in the house. at the event in michigan, he said, we won 196 to nothing on a little vote a couple of weeks ago.\n\ntrump was referring to house impeachment votes he lost -- but where 196 or more republicans voted in his favor, with none against. he lost an october vote to set the rules of the impeachment inquiry 232-196 , then the december votes on the two articles of impeachment, 230-197 and 229-198\n\naccomplishments\n\nman of the year in michigan\n\ntrump said in michigan : in fact, i was honored, believe it or not. about 10 years ago, i came to michigan. i was honored by a wonderful group. i was the 'man of the year.'\n\nthere is no evidence trump ever got a man of the year award in michigan. you can read a full fact check here\n\nestate tax\n\ntrump claimed in michigan and at the iowa rally to have eliminated the estate tax, saying at the rally of his 2017 tax law: because of that, there is no death tax or inheritance tax.\n\nthe law doubled the amount of estate value that is exempt from the estate tax, but the law did not eliminate the tax entirely. and there is no basis for his suggestion at both events that small farmers and small businesspeople would especially benefit from his changes; few paid the tax even before. you can read a full fact check here\n\nhousehold income\n\ntrump claimed in michigan that real median household income had increased by $10,000 during his presidency.\n\ntrump was taking a private firm's estimate of about $5,000 in pre-tax household income gains and doubling it for reasons that do not make sense. you can read a full fact check here\n\nveterans choice\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally: i took care of the vets. we got choice. he added that people had unsuccessfully tried to get this veterans health care program approved for 52 years, claiming: what i am good at is getting things approved, and i got it approved.\n\ntrump did not get the veterans choice program passed, nor had there been an unsuccessful 52-year effort to get it passed. the program was signed into law by president barack obama in 2014 . in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the choice program.\n\nburden-sharing with south korea\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally that, under a deal with south korea about sharing the cost of the us troops in the country, they gave us $500 million a year more.\n\nas the new york times reported in february when debunking an earlier version of trump's $500 million claim: under the one-year deal, this year south korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million.\n\nthe usmca\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally: usmca: the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. ok, it is.\n\nexcept that it's not. the trans-pacific partnership included all three of the countries in the usmca -- the us, mexico and canada -- plus nine others. also, it's worth noting that the usmca mostly makes incremental tweaks to the previous north american free trade agreement. you can read a full fact check here\n\nenergy production\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally: we've ended the war on american energy. the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far.\n\nthe us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the us government's energy information administration -- under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\nmexican border\n\ntrump said of mexico at the iowa rally: they put up 27,000 soldiers on our southern border.\n\nmexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular. cnn reported on november 2 that the mexican government had reported the following: nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints. ... at the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints. you can read a full fact check here\n\nindividual mandate\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally: we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed obamacare.\n\nthe individual mandate, which required americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of obamacare -- but trump hasn't killed obamacare, essentially or otherwise. he has not eliminated obamacare's expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.\n\npre-existing conditions\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally: we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and we always will the republican party.\n\n\n\nfederal judges the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void.\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally: to uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record...and two great supreme court justices, by the way.\n\ntrump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term; jimmy carter had appointed 197 judges by late january of his fourth year in office, according to data from russell wheeler , a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments. wheeler said trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods -- two supreme court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges -- but that it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding trump's three appointments to the court of federal claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge.\n\ndrug overdose deaths\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally: drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years.\n\nthis was one of trump's trademark little exaggerations of accomplishments that need no exaggeration. the decline in overdose deaths in 2018 was the first since 1990 , 28 years prior.\n\nthe 2016 election\n\nthe electoral college margin over clinton\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally of the electoral college margin in the 2016 election: we got 306 to 223.\n\nhillary clinton earned 232, not 223, electoral votes to trump's 306. this was not a one-time slip; trump habitually says 223.\n\nthe relative size of that electoral college margin\n\ntrump said in michigan: but we had a tremendous, landslide electoral college victory, like people haven't seen in a long time.\n\naside from trump's dubious characterization of the result as an electoral college landslide -- the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections, the new york times has noted -- it's not true that people haven't seen such a margin of victory in a long time. obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections.\n\na clinton crowd\n\ntrump said in michigan that hillary clinton had a small gathering of about 400 people at her final michigan rally of the 2016 election.\n\ndemocrats\n\ntrade with south korea\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally that clinton had promised that a trade agreement with south korea was going to produce 250,000 jobs.\n\nthere is no record of clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the united states-korea free trade agreement (korus). obama said the deal would support at least 70,000 american jobs.\n\nobama said in 2009 that increasing the us share of trade with asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with south korea.\n\na biden crowd\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally that democratic presidential candidate joe biden drew a speech crowd so small that the campaign turned it into a roundtable discussion, roping in unwitting attendees to answer questions like, what do you think of socialism?\n\nthere is simply no evidence this happened. biden's campaign says it didn't, and trump's campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event he was talking about.\n\nopen borders\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally that democrats support open borders.\n\neven prominent democrats who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump regularly suggests.\n\nsocial security\n\nasked by doocy about allegations he wants to take away social security -- he vaguely told cnbc last week that entitlement programs will be on his plate at some point -- trump said i'm the one that saved it. the democrats wanted to do it last time.\n\ntrump wasn't clear what he meant by do it, but prominent democrats did not want to cut social security, much less take it away, when trump was running in 2016. clinton proposed to increase social security benefits.\n\ngreen new deal\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally that democratic hawaii sen. mazie hirono had endorsed the green new deal environmental proposal, then they started screaming at her in hawaii because the proposal would mean no more airplanes, which she had not known. trump suggested, mockingly, that she responded that we're going to build a railroad with the world's largest track.\n\nthat is not what happened; trump was twisting an exchange hirono had with a reporter. you can read a full fact check here\n\nchina and tariffs\n\nagricultural purchases\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally that the most china ever spent on us agricultural products in a year is $16 billion, claiming that secretary of agriculture sonny perdue told him this.\n\nchina spent $25.9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture. in 2017, the year before the trade war began, china spent $19.5 billion. in 2016, it was $21.4 billion. chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018.\n\ntariffs on china\n\ntrump said at the iowa rally of his tariffs on china: we never got 10 cents from china. china took from us. we didn't take from china right.\n\nnumerous studies have shown that americans, not china, are paying most of the cost of trump's tariffs. in addition, it's not true the us has never received 10 cents from tariffs on china. the us has had tariffs on china for more than two centuries; factcheck.org reported that the us generated an average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the u.s. international trade commission dataweb.\n\nthe media\n\ncnn cameras\n\ntrump criticized cnn at the iowa rally, then pointed at the back of the room and said, oops, their camera just went off. look, their camera. it just went off, cnn.\n\ncnn's photojournalists do not turn off cameras when trump insults cnn, and trump would not be able to notice even if they did: they do not use any light that goes on and off when they start and stop recording.\n\ntrump has repeatedly made this false claim at his rallies. you can read a full fact check here\n\ndemocrats and the rolls-royce\n\nat the iowa rally, trump said the media humorlessly accused him of lying when he had told a joke that california gov. gavin newsom wanted to give undocumented immigrants a free rolls-royce.
(cnn) —\n\nhouse speaker paul ryan announced on wednesday morning he would be leaving congress and it was a matter of minutes before everyone was speculating about his successor.\n\nthe speaker's decision spun the republican conference into a frenzy wednesday as lawmakers placed their own bets and weighed in on the palace intrigue of who would hold the gavel next.\n\nit's will be seven months before of any leadership race. ryan was emphatic wednesday that he plans to remain in his job, but members say even before his formal announcement, the fight for speaker was playing out in subtle ways behind the scenes. with ryan officially out, the race is expected to go into overdrive.\n\nthe conference's eyes are on two frontrunners at the moment: kevin mccarthy, the amicable majority leader who has forged a close bond with president donald trump but was unable to clinch the speakership in 2015, and majority whip steve scalise, the third in command of the house whose conservative credentials could help him win support from the right-flank of the party.\n\nthe louisiana republican became a national figure after his near-death experience last june when he was shot by a gunman targeting gop members at a morning baseball practice. his remarkable recovery was featured in a 60 minutes story and after returning and being barely able to stand, scalise now is walking with crutches and has hit the campaign trail to raise money for his colleagues.\n\nrelated: there is a wave of republicans leaving congress, updated again\n\nscalise has said publicly he won't directly challenge mccarthy in the race, but the conference remains in a holding pattern until mccarthy makes his move. he signaled his potential interest in running for the top spot recently in an interview with politico saying, i wouldn't rule it out, depending on the political environment.\n\nhe added, obviously, i've shown interest in the past at moving up. i've enjoyed being in leadership. i feel like i've had a strong influence on some of the things that we've done, and i've helped put together coalitions to pass a full repeal of obamacare.\n\na source close to scalise pointed to those public comments, suggesting that ryan's wednesday decision was something people were still digesting before making any new moves.\n\neven before today, there was speculation. obviously there are ambitions out there, one gop member told cnn, speaking anonymously to discuss the state of the race freely. scalise and mccarthy had already been positioning themselves for the next leadership race. they're already doing favors for members, hosting members, doing fundraisers for members, helping members get legislation through.\n\none leadership source told cnn that members have been approaching the leaders about what a post-paul ryan world would look like for some time.\n\nbut both mccarthy and scalise tried wednesday to redirect the ryan news away from them, downplaying questions about their futures and refusing to state explicitly their plans.\n\nwe have a speaker of the house, mccarthy said wednesday when asked if he'd be running. we have a legislative agenda, lot of months still to go. and we gotta keep the majority. … there is no leadership election. paul is speaker right now.\n\nsome republicans suggested that to avoid a messy protracted contest there may be maneuvering between the two top camps about putting together a slate for the gop conference to approve that would allow current leaders to ascend.\n\nwaiting for november\n\ntrump will likely loom large in the race. he has called mccarthy my kevin and the two have developed a close relationship. if he weighs in with an endorsement that could effectively end the race. ryan also signaled that he will talk about who he thinks should fill the post in the post, saying wednesday, i'll share those thoughts later.\n\nduring an interview wednesday, ryan said he had thoughts on who should succeed him, but he wouldn't weigh in yet.\n\ni don' think this is the time to get into it, ryan said.\n\npushed to answer when it would be time, he said, after november is when that gets decided.\n\nfor now, the conference will remain in a holding pattern, a kind of political purgatory that members aren't sure is sustainable long-term as they begin gearing up for the midterms and chart their agenda for a congress after ryan.\n\nrep. steve womack, the chairman of the house budget committee, said he worried about a long, drawn-out leadership race.\n\nwe have an election coming up in november, the midterms so i'm not really sure you're going to see a lot of productivity from the congress anyway, but you know lame duck speakers, that's an additional challenge to the conference, womack said.\n\nmany were shocked by ryan's announcement wednesday morning. while the growing belief was that ryan would step down after the midterms, few expected the speaker – a fundraising powerhouse – to announce he was stepping down before the midterms were over.\n\none gop source involved in house races said they viewed any potential leadership race between scalise and mccarthy as a financial windfall for their party, with the two men scrambling to see who can raise the most campaign cash in order to curry favor with their colleagues, adding to ryan who will continue to be a presence on the fundraising circuit, the source said.\n\nall eyes on mccarthy\n\nmccarthy's been here before.\n\nin the days that followed house speaker john boehner's retirement announcement, mccarthy, the then-majority leader, stepped up to run for speaker, but was rebuffed by conservatives who put forth a competing candidate. in a stunning move, mccarthy withdrew his name during a conference-wide election and the leadership election was postponed.\n\na source close to mccarthy told cnn at the time that the decision to drop out came down to numbers, pure and simple, adding that mccarthy had the votes to win the conference vote, but there just wasn't a path to 218 – the number of votes needed to lock down the speakership on the house floor.\n\neventually, ryan was drafted.\n\nnow, the question remains if mccarthy – who has a close relationship with trump – would be able to overcome his past obstacles.\n\na leadership source told cnn that that scalise's intention is to be ready in the case that mccarthy isn't.\n\nmembers also are eager to avoid any kind of embarrassing or dramatic leadership showdown like the one that transpired in 2015.\n\ni was very concerned when paul ryan was drafted in because we had a serious vacuum, said florida republican rep. mario diaz-balart. i think paul ryan has really put together and has been able to lead a very solid leadership team. i think again he is a huge loss, but i think the leadership team is very solid.\n\ndiaz-balart emphasized that mccarthy and scalise had learned a lot since 2015. since then, the conference has seen the election of a republican president, passed tax reform and repealed a key piece of the affordable care act.\n\nanother question remains whether republicans will even hold the majority in 2018 and need to draft a speaker at all.\n\nhere's the bottom line. anybody who starts spreading ideas about a race that we have not won is bad timing, bad behavior and bad posturing, said house rules chairman pete sessions. i would encourage my team to recognize that while the speaker has served quite admirably, we are in a very difficult position at this time.\n\ncould it be anyone's gavel?\n\nmembers are also reluctant to rule anyone out this early in the game. as the

conservative source told cnn that they viewed the seven-month window for the leadership race as a major advantage for conservatives in the house freedom caucus who might have time to organize and leverage themselves. the source told cnn that the right flank of the party might not put forth a candidate for speaker, but could do something like trade votes for speaker for assurances that one of their own would be placed in a leadership slot.\n\nour friends in the freedom caucus recognize that they have leverage here and i think the question is not necessarily which one of them is going to run but how they can maximize that leverage, the source said.\n\nhouse freedom caucus chairman mark meadows said wednesday that the freedom caucus needed a seat in leadership.\n\ni think everyone will start jockeying for position immediately, he said. they won't wait for nine months.\n\ncnn's manu raju, jeremy herb and phil mattingly contributed to this report.
washington (cnn) lawyers for the democratic-led house of representatives as well as california and other democratic-led states asked the supreme court friday to immediately step in to decide the fate of the affordable care act.\n\ncalling the law a fixture of the american health-care system donald verrilli, a lawyer for the house, urged the justices in legal briefs to review a remarkable lower court decision that threatens profound destabilization of the health care system.\n\nthe present case represents yet another effort by litigants who disagree with the policy judgments embodied in the aca to use the courts, rather than the democratic process, to undo the work of the people's elected representatives, the filing states.\n\nlast month, a federal appeals court held that the law's individual mandate was unconstitutional , but sent the case back down to a lower court to decide whether other provisions of the sprawling law should remain in effect.\n\nthe petition filed by supporters of the law is a long shot bid because the supreme court does not usually like to take up an issue until it has made its way through the lower courts. but if the necessary four justices agree to hear the case and expedite it for this term -- it would mean that the justices would render a decision concerning the fate of the controversial law this spring, just as the presidential election gears up.\n\nread more
people living in sparsely populated areas who shopped for coverage on the obamacare exchanges in 2017 frequently had just one or two insurers from which to pick and often faced significantly higher premiums than did people in more urban areas, according to a new study.\n\nas insurers finalize plans for participating in the 2018 exchanges, policy experts have speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act will lead insurers to continue to pull back from some markets or exit them altogether, leaving a growing number of people with fewer, pricier options.\n\ninsurers in most states have until mid-june to decide, but news has slowly trickled out. aetna (aet) announced earlier this week that next year the company will not participate in the individual market in delaware and nebraska, the last two states in which it currently sells exchange plans.\n\nrelated: aetna to obamacare: we're outta here\n\nthis year, about a third of the country's population live in areas where just one or two insurers sold policies on these aca marketplaces, the urban institute analysis found. that included four states — alaska, alabama, north carolina and oklahoma — as well as rural areas of several others.\n\nin regions with just one insurer, monthly premiums were $451 or higher in half of the benchmark silver plans on which premium subsidies are based. in contrast, in areas where six or more insurers offered plans, monthly premiums were much lower for comparable coverage: half were $270 or less.\n\npremium growth from 2016 to 2017 also varied substantially based on how many insurers participated in a region: median premium growth was 30% in areas with one insurer versus 5% in regions with six or more carriers.\n\nall the problems seem to be very strongly correlated with the size of the population, said linda blumberg, a senior fellow in the health policy center at the urban institute, who co-authored the analysis. if you've got a big population, more insurers are coming in to compete for that business.\n\nrelated: obamacare: what's going right. what's going wrong\n\nfor the analysis, researchers analyzed the premiums for a 40-year-old nonsmoker in benchmark plans in each of the 498 rating areas in the u.s.\n\nthe rating areas with just one or two insurers were concentrated in the south. some 82% of the rating areas with just one insurer were located in the south, as were 59% of regions with two insurers. regions with six or more insurers were concentrated in the northeast, with 30% of the total, and the midwest, with 41%.\n\nkaiser health news, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the kaiser family foundation.

(photo by drew angerer/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nas president donald trump continues to make clear that he wants to kill the affordable care act, new research suggests that a big part of the aca – the expansion of the medicaid program – was linked with fewer cardiovascular-related deaths in counties where expansion took place.\n\nbetween 2010 and 2016, counties in states where medicaid expanded had 4 fewer deaths per 100,000 residents each year from cardiovascular causes after expansion, compared with counties in non-expansion states, according to the research. the findings were presented at the american heart association's scientific sessions on friday. enrollments for insurance under the aca began in 2014.\n\nthe overall results of this study are that after expansion of medicaid in 2014, the areas in the country that did expand had a significantly lower mortality rate compared to if they had followed the same trajectory as the areas in the country that didn't expand, said dr. sameed khatana, a fellow in cardiovascular disease at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia, who was first author of the new research.\n\nit's important to study health policy in a more quantitative manner, and i think we're seeing an increasing number of research studies on these kinds of topics, he said. this research just sort of fits in with a growing trend of research in this area.\n\nanyone can qualify for medicaid based on income, household size, disability, family status and other factors, but the aca allows states to expand medicaid eligibility so that residents can qualify based solely on whether their household income level is a certain percentage below the federal poverty level.\n\nthe new research is preliminary and still in its early stages, but it comes as the trump administration appears to be doubling down on trying to overturn obamacare.\n\nin a surprise move last week, the department of justice said it agreed with the december ruling of a federal judge in texas that invalidated the health reform law. the case is now in federal appeals court.\n\neliminating obamacare could leave roughly 20 million more people without health insurance, according to a recent report from the urban institute, an economic and social policy think tank. the president said this week that he will not push for a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.\n\nthe new research included mortality data on adults ages 45 to 64, from 2010 to 2016, in all states except massachusetts and wisconsin. in those two states, there was medicaid expansion that was not related to the aca.\n\nas of 2016, after excluding massachusetts and wisconsin, 29 states and the district of columbia expanded medicaid eligibility, but 19 states had not, according to the data that came from the us centers for disease control and prevention's wonder database.\n\nthe researchers took a close look at state-by-state differences when it came to cardiovascular-related deaths on the county level, before and after medicaid expansion.\n\nthey adjusted those differences to account for factors that might skew the findings, such as unemployment rates, median household incomes and the number of cardiologists per 100,000 residents.\n\nthe researchers found that, compared with counties in non-expansion states, counties in expansion states had a greater increase in health-insurance coverage for low-income residents and a significantly smaller increase in cardiovascular mortality rates.\n\nbetween 2010 and 2016, cardiovascular-related deaths rose from 141.9 to 142 per 100,000 residents each year in the counties in expansion states, while cardiovascular-related deaths rose from 176.1 to 180.6 per 100,000 residents annually in the counties in non-expansion states, the data showed.\n\nthe research had some limitations. because it was observational, the researchers were unable to completely tease out any contributing factors that could have influenced the differences between counties in expansion and non-expansion states.\n\nmedicaid expansion was the major health policy that occurred in 2014, but there were some other things as well that weren't captured by our study, or that were happening around the same time, that could potentially explain some of these findings, khatana said.\n\nanother [limitation] is that we looked at cardiovascular diseases as a whole, so we sort of lumped everything together: heart attack, stroke, arrhythmias, et cetera. because any one cause of death causes very few deaths in individual counties, which was our level of analysis, we're not able to say which specific disease is responsible for these changes, he said.\n\npublic health experts have long known that the presence or absence of health insurance can influence death rates, said dr. georges benjamin, executive director of the american public health association, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nthis study is absolutely in keeping with that, benjamin said, but he added that a closer look at the research is needed to confirm that the correlation between reduced cardiovascular deaths and medicaid expansion is truly driven by the aca and not other factors.\n\nyet if you think about the fact that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, followed by cancer, it would not be surprising that the leading cause of death goes down when you give people health insurance, he said. we know very clearly that again, even in the medicaid program, that if you give people coverage, mortality goes down.\n\nthe new research contributes to the limited knowledge on how medicaid expansion affects health outcomes, said dr. olena mazurenko, an assistant professor in the richard m. fairbanks school of public health at the indiana university-purdue university indianapolis campus, who was not involved in the research.\n\nmazurenko was first author of a paper published last year in the journal health affairs that found expansion to be associated with increases in coverage, service use, quality of care and medicaid spending.\n\nthat finding was based on a review of 77 previously published studies on medicaid, but only 16 examined quality of care and health outcomes.\n\nthe medicaid expansion occurred only a few years prior; it was too early for studies to reliably determine the effect of medicaid expansion on clinical measures of health status and, certainly, too early to determine the impact on any long-term outcomes, mazurenko said.\n\nimportantly, none of the limited number of published studies reported poorer outcomes as a result of medicaid expansion, she said. with more time, researchers will have the opportunity to determine the effects of medicaid expansion on population health more comprehensively.\n\nget cnn health's weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr. sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team.\n\ndr. ivor benjamin, president of the american heart association, called the new research exciting and said the association has gone on the record with its support of affordable, accessible and available health care.\n\nso that is our position. the next question then is, how much does it cost? he said. what's the value that we will get from having people be able to have affordable insurance? what's the value? and what this data help to provide in that conversation is that, 'yes it matters.' \n\ncnn's tami luhby contributed to this report.
