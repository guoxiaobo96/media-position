the hidden gems from 2019\n\nthe day after robert mueller's congressional testimony, steve lohr came out with an article on how the personal data held by tech companies is not just a privacy concern but a wealth and power concentration concern, too.\n\nconsumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. so far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. but the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.\n\nthe morning after the house impeachment vote, karen weise published an investigation into how amazon controls the many businesses that rely on it.\n\nsome guy we had never talked to gave us a call and was like, 'we have changed the rules,' said charlie cole, who runs tumi's online business. he pushed back, but wasn't successful. it was like talking to a brick wall, he said. they want to be able to control everything.\n\ncade metz went to bhubaneswar, india, to show the lives of the people who are training computers to replace people. he wrote a nuanced, human piece that reveals the frenzy of work behind algorithms that seem seamless.\n\nin facilities like the one i visited in bhubaneswar and in other cities in india, china, nepal, the philippines, east africa and the united states, tens of thousands of office workers are punching a clock while they teach the machines.\n\njack nicas and keith collins exposed the way apple's algorithms kept apple services ranked high in the app store. midway through the reporting, the algorithm changed. apple representatives told jack that the change was not an admission of wrongdoing but a way to handicap themselves to make it easier for their competitors.\n\nif you searched for podcast in may 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.\n\njust as the holidays were kicking off, adam satariano had a tale from the faroe islands, at the edge of the world, a new battleground for the u.s. and china. the photos by ben quinton are especially stunning.\n\nno location is now too small for the united states and china to focus on as they tussle over the future of technology. the faroe islands, whose proximity to the arctic gives it added military importance, joins countries across europe caught in the middle of the two superpowers over huawei, the crown jewel of the chinese tech sector.\n\ndavey alba, the tech team's new reporter on disinformation, wrote about how facebook's chief executive, mark zuckerberg, told congress that the company would share a huge amount of data related to disinformation. it didn't happen as promised.\n\nas a result, researchers say, the public may have little more insight into disinformation campaigns on the social network heading into the 2020 presidential election than they had in 2016.\n\nduring summer's long vacation-filled months, brian chen wrote a confessional: i shared my phone number. i learned i shouldn't have.\n\nfor most of our lives, we have been conditioned to share our phone numbers with businesses and acquaintances without hesitation. in august, i learned this was a bad idea.\n\nnatasha singer profiled baroness beeban kidron, a member of britain's house of lords who is fighting big tech on behalf of children's privacy.\n\nthe idea that it's o.k. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons — it's not a fair fight, lady kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a facebook policy executive. it's little timmy in his bedroom versus mark zuckerberg in his valley.\n\nand last but not least, daisuke wakabayashi profiled luigi zingales, a professor from the famously free-market university of chicago who is now leading calls for regulating tech.\n\nmy conclusions may surprise some people who identify chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology, mr. zingales said.\n\nhappy new year! may all your best work go viral in 2020, if only in your heart.
the 2019 golden globes didn't want any trouble.\n\nthe previous two years, the usually bubbly event found itself responding to upheavals in politics and in the power structure of hollywood. this year a big issue hanging over the awards ceremony was another awards ceremony: the oscars, which is still without a host after a search that included the naming and quick unnaming of kevin hart, after objections to the comedian's history of homophobic jokes.\n\nthe hosts, sandra oh and andy samberg, kicked off their opening monologue declaring that they were the only two people left in hollywood who haven't gotten in trouble for saying something offensive and announcing that one lucky audience member will! host! the oscars!\n\n[read our analysis from the golden globes ceremony | browse the list of winners]\n\ntheir opener, amiable if a little stiff, played on the idea of aggressive niceness, roasting stars in the room with compliments. even one of the zingers, a joke by oh about hollywood's casting white actors as asian characters, produced a cheerfully penitent i'm sorry! from emma stone, who played a part-asian character in aloha.
previous american administrations had resisted striking general suleimani directly, either because of operational concerns or out of fear that killing him could destabilize the region further and lead to all-out war between the united states and iran.\n\nat least once, though, israeli officials ran the possibility of attacking him up their command structure. that was in february 2008, while israeli and american intelligence operatives were tracking mr. mugniyah, the hezbollah commander, in the hopes of killing him, according to senior american and israeli intelligence officials. operatives spotted the hezbollah commander talking with another man, who they quickly determined was mr. suleimani.\n\nexcited by the possibility of killing two archenemies at once, the israelis phoned senior government officials. but prime minister ehud olmert denied the request, as he had promised the americans that only mr. mugniyah would be targeted in the operation.\n\nperhaps more than any other individual, general suleimani was the foil for american plans in iraq, which like iran is predominantly shiite.\n\nafter the united states invaded iraq in 2003, iranian militiamen and their iraqi allies fought a clandestine war against american troops, launching rockets at bases and attacking convoys. the militias also played a large part in inflaming sectarian tensions that led to iraq's civil war in 2006 and 2007 between shiites and sunnis, leading president george w. bush to order a troop surge there.\n\ngeneral suleimani and other leaders of his generation were shaped by the brutal war between iran and iraq in the 1980s, a conflict so cruel, with trench warfare and chemical weapons, that some compared it to the devastation of world war i. nearly a million people died on both sides, and general suleimani spent much of that war on the front lines.
in new delhi and neighboring states, slowing winds have made air pollution worse, india's meteorological department said. in the early hours of new year's day, pollution levels in the capital soared to levels more than 20 times what the world health organization considers safe.\n\nthe fog is often so blinding that drivers cannot see cars slowing down in front of them, causing accidents and highway pileups. in december, hundreds of flights and trains were delayed or canceled because of low visibility.\n\nlast week, six people were killed in the city of noida, near new delhi, after their car skidded off the road. investigators blamed heavy fog.\n\nin neighboring bangladesh, a prolonged cold spell that started in november has left at least 50 people dead, including 17 children, according to ayesha akhter, a medical officer in dhaka, the capital.
want the latest climate news in your inbox? you can sign up here to receive climate fwd:, our new email newsletter.\n\nclimate change has made severe cold spells like the one that recently gripped the northeast far less common than they used to be, a team of researchers has found.\n\nthe reason is straightforward: the arctic has warmed so much — twice as fast in recent decades than other parts of the world — that when polar air descends to lower latitudes, the cold snaps are warmer on average. so a spell of extremely cold weather like the recent one is rare, about 15 times rarer than a century ago, the scientists said.
send your workplace conundrums to workologist@nytimes.com, including your name and contact information (even if you want it withheld). the workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. letters may be edited.\n\ni have been with the same company for 20 years, rising through the ranks in that time. however, i have been planning to leave, and even started working toward a professional certification in another field. then my supervisor got promoted, and most colleagues assumed that, based on my position and experience, i would be the replacement. every bone in my body told me not to apply — but every friend, family member and colleague (especially the ones who knew i was plotting an escape) said i would be passing up an opportunity to make my résumé look better. i applied, and got the job. i can't stand it. there are not enough hours in the week to get everything done, and i end up doing my work poorly and neglecting my family in the process. my supervisor says i knew what i was getting into. but now i want out even more. i finished that certification, but is it best to wait a year before i bail? if not, how do i explain a short stint in a new position to potential employers, without sounding negative? — anonymous\n\nif you cannot stand your job, you should be looking for a new one, as actively as possible. don't waste time being hard on yourself. it's often the case that someone who has decided to switch fields entirely must overcome the urge to delay making such a big move.\n\nand sure, in retrospect, you probably should have trusted your instinct and ignored everyone else. but that's hindsight. it's often good to get the advice of others who know you and your situation and who might be able to offer a useful perspective. maybe you would have regretted it if you hadn't given the new position a shot. who knows?\n\nthe point is that now you know: taking the promotion was a mistake. not only are you unhappy, but it sounds like your supervisor and your family aren't pleased, either. why prolong this a single minute longer than necessary? if you're really ready to jump to a new path, get on with it!\n\nto answer questions about a short stint on your résumé, just tell the truth, but with a forward-looking focus: you had been planning this change for a while and delayed it when you were offered a promotion. but that has only underscored your certainty that it's time to move on, and you're way more excited about what lies ahead in your new chosen field.
inspecting the tiny roundworms caenorhabditis briggsae and caenorhabditis nigoni through a microscope, you'd have trouble telling them apart. both are about a millimeter long and transparent. on the evolutionary tree, they're closer together than horses and donkeys.\n\nthe key distinction between the two nematodes is their sex lives. sex in c. nigoni takes place between a male and female. but only a small minority of c. briggsae are males. the rest are hermaphroditic females that reproduce by self-fertilizing, or selfing. they have evolved the ability to produce sperm that merge with their own eggs.\n\nthis sexual switch may have caused profound changes at the genetic level for c. briggsae. in a study published last week in science, biologists reported that c. briggsae lost thousands of genes — a staggering quarter of its genome — since it diverged from c. nigoni a million years ago.\n\nmany of these genes had been around, and were presumably needed, for tens of millions of years or longer, said eric haag, a biology professor at the university of maryland, college park, and an author of the paper. in the blink of an eye, they disappeared. he and his co-authors believe that a large portion of the genes shed are related to male reproduction.
patrick was/is suicidal, she wrote, adding: i am grateful that you are trying to expose this problem in these horrific times. we need not be anonymous.\n\ni had met sandy only in passing at the dunkin' donuts when she dropped off patrick for our interview, but she was clearly at her wit's end, having been enmeshed in his addiction for so long.\n\nas a reporter, i was struck not only by her pain but also by her willingness to be identified. so often, people whose loved ones are addicted are ashamed and afraid of being stigmatized. when someone decides to go public, it is a godsend, as it helps combat accusations of fake news and shows that, as sandy said in the article, we are your neighbors.\n\nfrom there, the family drama of coping with addiction overtook the original story about new hampshire. the times assigned the photographer todd heisler to work with me, and the family allowed us to witness their grueling intervention with patrick in july.\n\nseveral people have asked how that worked. journalists often worry that their mere presence will change people's behavior and render it inauthentic. in this case, the family members, all of whom were in extremis, were so focused on their own difficulties that they hardly noticed us. and we were discreet. no klieg lights. no microphones. we blended into the background and kept our mouths shut.
the white house sent congress on saturday a formal notification under the war powers act of the drone strike ordered by president trump this week that killed maj. gen. qassim suleimani, two congressional officials said.\n\nthe notification, required by law within 48 hours of introducing american forces into armed conflict or a situation that could lead to war, has to be signed and then sent to congress, according to the officials with knowledge of the plan.\n\nlawmakers expected the document to publicly lay out the white house's legal justification for the strike on general suleimani, iran's top security commander, who officials have said has been behind hundreds of american deaths over the years. but the notification first sent to congress late saturday afternoon only contained classified information, according to a senior congressional aide, likely detailing the intelligence that led to the action. it is unclear whether the white house will send a separate, unclassified document.\n\nspeaker nancy pelosi said in a statement saturday evening that the notification raises more questions than it answers, including serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification of the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against iran.
dr. berns's main research pertains to dogs and the inner workings of the canine brain, but after learning more about tasmanian tigers, he became fascinated by the beasts.\n\nwith their slender bodies, long snouts and sharp teeth, tasmanian tigers looked as if they could be related to dogs, wolves or coyotes. but actually they are separated by more than 150 million years of evolution. it is a classic example of convergent evolution, in which two organisms that are not closely related develop similar features because of the environment they adapted to and the ecological role they played.\n\nto better understand thylacines, dr. berns spent two years tracking down two preserved tasmanian tiger brains, one at the smithsonian institution and the other at the australian museum. their brains, like those of all marsupials, are very different from the brains of placental mammals. the biggest difference is that they lack a corpus callosum, which is the part of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres.

say hello to riley. he is a good boy.\n\nriley, a 12-week-old weimaraner, is hardly the first pup to have job responsibilities far beyond fetch and sit and get off the couch.\n\nbut he appears to be the first to be trained specifically to detect moths and other pests that could damage high-value artwork in a museum.\n\nit's really a trial, pilot project. we don't know if he's going to be good at it, said katie getchell, the deputy director of the museum of fine arts in boston. but it seems like a great idea to try.\n\nno technology is as powerful at detecting scents as the nostrils of dogs, which have long been trained to use their superior schnozzes to sniff out explosives, cadavers, bed bugs, ants and cancer, among other things.
find all our lessons of the day here.\n\nlesson overview\n\nin chinese restaurants are closing. that's a good thing, the owners say. amelia nierenberg and quoctrung bui look at the connection between the decline in chinese restaurants across america and the economic mobility of the second generation. in this lesson, you will consider businesses that make up your own community and ideas of success among different generations and families.\n\nwarm up\n\nscroll through the featured article and choose one of the three graphs or charts to analyze. instead of looking at the title and description to make sense of the graph, try focusing on the axes and the content of the graph itself. then, use these three questions from our what's going on in this graph? feature to help you interpret the graph:\n\nwhat do you notice? if you make a claim, tell us what you notice that supports that claim.\n\nwhat do you wonder? what are you curious about that comes from what you notice in the graphs?\n\nwhat's going on in this graph? write a catchy headline that captures the graphs' main idea.\n\nas you read the article, see if your interpretation of the graph is similar or different from how it is used in the article.\n\nquestions for writing and discussion\n\nread the article, then answer the following questions:\n\n1. what do the yelp statistics reveal about the changing number of chinese restaurants in metropolitan areas? using the graph, determine how those changes compare to the changing numbers of other types of restaurants in major cities?\n\n2. why does jennifer 8. lee, a former new york times journalist, say that it is a success that these restaurants are closing? generally, what are some of the difficulties that immigrant-owned restaurants face and how are those different from the reasons that chinese-owned restaurants are closing?
panasonic admits it struggled with how to acknowledge the sl-1200's history and fans.\n\nthere was a lot of debate, mr. morishita said. would we keep the name? would we change the design? in the end, he said, the company decided the turntable was too iconic to change drastically. the latest version, the sl-1200g, has an upgraded motor and a few other touches, but is otherwise the same as the players that technics made in decades past.\n\nthe main difference is in the marketing. instead of sponsoring d.j. contests, technics has hired a german classical pianist, alice sara ott, to be its global brand ambassador and provided an sl-1200g to abbey road studios, of beatles fame. serene connoisseurship, not sweaty nightclubs, is the theme.\n\nlistening to records is like tea ceremony, or flower arranging, said michiko ogawa, director of the technics division. she added that music recorded by live musicians showed off technics's hi-fi qualities best.\n\npanasonic is hardly the first company to try to change a product's image, though most marketing makeovers are aimed in the other direction — turning old and fusty into young and hip. think not your father's oldsmobile or the rebranding of old spice cologne for younger men. in a world where hip-hop and dance music have become worldwide phenomena, sought after by marketers of everything from energy drinks to running shoes, it is in some ways remarkable that an authentic part of the culture has turned its back.\n\nit's unusual in that you've had relatively positive associations and decided to disown that, said ravi dhar, a professor of marketing at yale.\n\nwhen the brand already has an image that is associated with certain groups, if you try to move away from it, it's risky, he said. but for them, the associations weren't positive for the market they're targeting.
what are the most important things that humans can do now in order to not destroy the planet? we have to accept responsibility for our role. i am trying to keep track of what my carbon impact is this year — america produces about 20 metric tons per person a year. we also have to encourage all sorts of people to go into science and engineering, because some of the solutions will involve new technologies.\n\nyour stance seems to run counter to the attitude that the planet is beyond help and there's not much more we can do. do you think you're more optimistic than most? being pessimistic isn't going to get us there. we have to take action. i've been helping review the national climate assessment report, which provides an in-depth look at how climate change affects the country, and it's fascinating to see how different the impact is in different regions. people are starting to organize at the level at which they live, and that's probably what gives me hope. new york and california are significant economies and have shown that their governments can act.\n\ndo you think conditions have improved for women in stem fields since you entered the arena? things have gotten better. the national science foundation has a program called advance, where instead of just trying to hire individual women, you actually try to change the culture, like instead of dropping individual salmon in the stream, we're actually trying to change ecosystems so that more salmon will survive. i did that for five years, and we managed to go from having both the teaching and research faculty at lamont go from having single-digit numbers of women to having double digits. we still don't see women in as many leadership positions as i'd like, and the harassment issue is probably one of the reasons we lose so many women in the pipeline in particular. considering the cultural conversation, this is our chance to see if we can address those problems within science and to sit down and say: what have we let go by? what have we not spoken up about? and how can we make it so we can understand what our code of conduct is going to be?\n\ndo you think you're a role model for young women entering the field? part of it is making sure people are connected sufficiently with their planet, to want to make sure it's still here as a home for us. if we're going to understand how our planet really works, we need everybody on deck to understand how to respond to it. the planet's going to survive — the question is, will we?
to the sports editor:\n\nre the american dilemma: why do we still watch football? feb. 4:\n\nlike many others, i made plans to take part in an american tradition last sunday and gather with friends to watch the super bowl.\n\nmany of my friends are guys i played high school football with in north jersey in the 1970s, including one who has been paralyzed since the age of 16, when his neck was broken on the opening kickoff of the third game of our junior year.\n\ni saw it happen from the sideline, about 20 feet away. i watched him lie on the field face down for what seemed like an eternity, not moving, until he was taken away by an ambulance. i cried in my bedroom for hours after that game, and i was numb for the rest of the weekend. but when school let out monday afternoon, i went to my gym locker, changed into my uniform, and joined the rest of the team on the field for practice.\n\nit doesn't seem logical, as i write this, that i would still be a huge fan of football, or that my disabled friend, who has lived a life of immeasurable pain and hardship because of the football injury, would be one, too. but i am, and so is he, and so is everyone else who gathered around the tv last week to watch the game.
smith, a baldheaded black man with a short, graying beard and a nose that looks as if it had been broken more than once, worked as a cook in san quentin prison. he hadn't had a serious disciplinary violation in two decades but was denied parole in each of his eight hearings since becoming eligible in 1996, receiving three-year denials each time. (every parole denial comes with a prescribed length of time — three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years — before the inmate is allowed to try again.) inmates can petition to have their hearing dates moved up; his most recent hearing was just a year and a half earlier. since then, he had studied the transcript carefully, highlighting the parts that told him what he needed to do to increase his chances of parole. he had to participate in self-help groups that focused especially on three things: gangs, overcoming criminal thinking and the suffering of crime victims. the commissioners, he felt, were trying to help him. i know exactly what she was trying to tell me, he said, referring to the commissioner who presided over his last hearing. she's trying to make sure that i don't go out there and fall into the hands of the same people that i dealt with when i came here, which is understandable.\n\nsmith had gone to some of the recommended groups, but he hadn't taken to them the way morgan had. he wasn't particularly introspective by nature, and he had trouble presenting a board-friendly narrative of his life or remembering the definition of jargony self-help words like prosocial. in conversation, he tended to skitter away from the traumatic events that might have explained how he wound up committing crimes — the best friend who was killed by a speeding car right in front of him when he was 5, his father's absence, his stepfather's emotional abuse of his mother, the varsity football career that ended when he got hit by a car in high school. the way i was brought up, some things you just don't speak on, he told me.\n\nhe preferred to talk about other matters: his plans for the future with his grown daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter and goddaughter; his ignorance of the basics of the modern world after so long in prison (he didn't know, he confessed, how to use a microwave oven); the old friends who were law-abiding citizens now. the story he had to tell was straightforward: he'd been a hardheaded young man once, but he had been a model inmate for more than two decades. now he hoped to return to his old neighborhoods and talk to youngsters who were as hardheaded as he used to be. i want to go back out there, he said. i want to help bring my community back up.\n\nneither his good intentions nor his clean prison record were enough to get him a parole date, however. i'm getting denied for what we consider as being little things — you know, insight, you're not showing remorse, he told me over the phone shortly before his ninth parole hearing. those little things, of course, were the very things the parole board considered paramount, but a lot of the board's preoccupations seemed illogical to smith. it had taken him a long time to understand why the authorities considered his group of associates to be a gang — a word he associated with large criminal organizations — or why he would be guilty of murder when the victim was shot by someone else. he said he thought about terry brown's murder every day, but it was hard to access his feelings sometimes, particularly in the hearing room. each time he went before the board, smith ended up tongue-tied and inarticulate. but was that indicative of the future danger he posed to the public?\n\nthe parole process is like threading a needle — the people who have come out through the parole board are extraordinary people, says rummel, who has represented hundreds of lifers in their parole hearings. we could swing the door a little wider. they don't have to be a-plus human beings. they could be b-plus human beings.\n\nsmith's ninth parole hearing was on may 9, 2018. he sat at a table with his state-appointed lawyer, marc gardner, his back to a window whose vertical blinds, wavering in the breeze, offered tantalizing glimpses of the sparkling san francisco bay. his feet tapped nervously beneath the table. the presiding commissioner, patricia cassady, pressed him for explanations, just as previous commissioners had: why had he been a bully in school? why had he liked fighting? why did he join a gang?\n\nsmith's answers were short and uninformative. he spoke with his forehead furrowed, his expression pained and puzzled, as the commissioners guided him through various episodes of childhood delinquency — stealing bikes, cutting school — until they arrived at the crime he was incarcerated for, the botched attempt at a revenge killing of a rival gang member. smith's crew had been trying to sneak up on the apartment where the man was hiding out, but smith, who said he didn't know much about firearms, had accidentally fired his weapon into the ground, triggering the shootout. brown was hospitalized for 15 months before he died.
durham, n.c. — the release last month of making a murderer, a 10-part documentary from netflix, capped a year in which popular culture's portrayal of the criminal justice system seems to have shifted. out with the old tropes about truth-seeking investigators and tidy resolutions; in with the disquieting, dysfunctional reality of many courtrooms and police stations.\n\nthe documentary, which has captivated viewers and critics, chronicles the trials of steven avery and his nephew brendan dassey for the 2005 killing of teresa halbach. its depiction of alleged police corruption and prosecutorial bias has inspired some viewers to quip that they hope they are never arrested in manitowoc, wis., the county where the two men were convicted. but what happened to them happens to low-status criminal defendants across the country all the time.\n\nsearing images of law enforcement abuses in chicago, cleveland and elsewhere have eroded the public's trust in police power on the street. at the same time, serialized true-crime programs, such as making a murderer and the first season of the podcast serial, are bringing the failures of due process into focus: careless police work, flawed forensics, forceful interrogations, unreliable witnesses and the woeful condition of state-funded criminal defense.\n\nit takes hours rather than seconds to appreciate this procedural violence. that hasn't stopped listeners and viewers. serial was downloaded some 75 million times. (netflix doesn't release any audience statistics, but making a murderer has generated widespread discussion in social and traditional media.) yet after the shows are over, audiences still hunger for narrative resolution. reddit users have written thousands of posts about making a murderer, weighing evidence and acting as armchair detectives trying to find the true perpetrator. petitions seeking pardons for mr. avery and mr. dassey have gathered 380,000 signatures. a spinoff from the serial podcast, sponsored by the defendant's lawyers, updates listeners on appellate claims and advocates for a retrial.
i don't think so. you couldn't help but be surprised — beyond surprised — at the response. it was a pleasurable sensation that people were talking about it, that it made an impression on people. it made a lot of people angry. sometimes i couldn't believe it was that important to people.\n\nwith the 20th anniversary coming, are you ready for another round of is tony dead or not?\n\ni've got to say i'm just bored with it. i also feel like, jesus, there were 86 episodes and you're fixated on that? can't we talk about something else?\n\nyou did an interview with the directors guild of america in 2015 that extensively broke down the final sequence. was that an attempt to just put the whole thing to bed?\n\nmight have been. i really don't recall my reasons. i was trying to provide a context.\n\nis it frustrating that even after that, many people don't seem to want to take you at your word?\n\nit's frustrating. it makes me use bad words. but it's not surprising, you know? and i don't have any statistics to prove it, but i think it's become more accepted as time has gone on.\n\ni think the point isn't whether or not tony was killed. it's the uncertainty that's the point, and the way the scene's crazy tension makes us aware of the passage of time and how choices shape the brief bit of life we get. most people can't control when or how they die, but the choices are ours. is that totally off base?
the average time of a nine-inning game last season was 3 hours 5 minutes, the highest on record and nine minutes longer than in 2015. that was manfred's first year as commissioner, when he made pace-of-play a priority. but the players quickly learned that the league and the umpires were not really forcing them to stay in the box or deliver pitches at a brisker pace. the pace reverted to a crawl.\n\nthe biggest factor, though, is that players are increasingly incentivized to take more time. in the age of analytics, teams cultivate power hitters and power pitchers, and the amateur ranks churn out plenty every year. strikeouts and homers reached record highs last season, and walks are rising again, too. that means more pitches, which means more relievers, which means more time.\n\nthe 2017 season included 1,196 more home runs, 1,756 more walks and 2,658 more strikeouts than the 2015 season. the number of pitches per nine-inning game rose from 283 to 292 in the same period. no wonder games were nine minutes longer.\n\nguys are working the count; nobody's trying to just put the ball in play. everybody wants to lift and launch and hit home runs, said jim kaat, the mlb network analyst and former pitcher. so home runs, walks and strikeouts kind of dominate the game, and that's going to make for a more boring game in terms of action on the bases. it's really a three-hour home run derby, in a lot of cases.\n\nkaat pitched 25 seasons in the majors, through 1983, when teams averaged 2 hours 36 minutes to play nine innings. it was a different game in many ways. kaat was among his generation's best pitchers but averaged only 4.9 strikeouts per nine innings for his career. last year, only one pitcher who made at least 25 starts, andrew cashner, averaged fewer. (naturally, cashner is an unsigned free agent.)\n\nbetween 1973 and 1980, kaat started 11 nine-inning games that took no more than 1 hour 40 minutes. he had 31 strikeouts and 7 walks — total — in those 11 games.\n\nour objective was to trust your stuff and make them put the ball in play, kaat said. now, you see fear of contact, deep counts, more pitches, and hitters diving into the ball and swinging at will.
a trade pact with 14 other asian nations. a pledge to join other countries in reducing carbon emissions to fight global warming. now, an investment agreement with the european union.\n\nchina's leader, xi jinping, has in recent weeks made deals and pledges that he hopes will position his country as an indispensable global leader, even after its handling of the coronavirus and increased belligerence at home and abroad have damaged its international standing.\n\nin doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. to forge a united front with allies against china's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with beijing and check its rising power. the image of mr. xi joining chancellor angela merkel of germany, president emmanuel macron of france and other european leaders in a conference call on wednesday to seal the deal with the european union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the trump administration's efforts to isolate china's communist party state.\n\nthe deals show the leverage mr. xi has because of the strength of the chinese economy, which is now the fastest-growing among major nations as the world continues to struggle with the pandemic.
i think that we can expect more of this in the future now that the line's been crossed, said peter r. mansoor, a retired army colonel and a former aide to mr. petraeus, who is now a professor at ohio state university. i'm not sure it's healthy for civil-military relations.\n\nthe risk, colonel mansoor said, is that whether the criticism is deserved or not, future presidents may be less willing to trust their senior officers, thinking they'll turn on them once they're out of uniform, or they may be less willing to promote officers who are very competent but perhaps independently minded.\n\nwhile mr. mattis's resignation was the first over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when cyrus vance quit as secretary of state, his conflict with mr. trump was hardly the first time that there have been clashes between civilian and military officials.\n\nin 2006, a number of retired military officers publicly rebuked defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld for his handling of the iraq war. in 1993, president bill clinton was at odds with military officials over allowing gay men and lesbians in the military. and there was a hefty amount of distrust between president barack obama and military officials over the administration's approach to iraq and afghanistan.\n\nduring the 2016 presidential campaign, michael t. flynn, a retired army lieutenant general, led chants of lock her up! about hillary clinton at the republican national convention, while john r. allen, a retired marine general, as a speaker at the democratic national convention, questioned mr. trump's ability to be the commander in chief.\n\nbut peter feaver, a former national security council official under mr. clinton and president george w. bush who now teaches political science at duke university, said mr. trump has taken these clashes to a new level.\n\nwe've never had a president who was as insensitive to the norms and taboos of the military, mr. feaver said. people like mcchrystal, people like mcraven and the others are responding to the president's breaking of these taboos.\n\nno american president has ever dared risk the american civil-military relationship for less cause or with such childish malice, tom nichols, a professor at the naval war college, wrote in the atlantic after the mcchrystal tweets.
speaking to reporters on tuesday, wright looked more like himself than he did after the 2016 surgery. he said he hoped his neck problem was resolved. now he needs at-bats and innings in the field to make up for the lost time.\n\nwright hit well when he returned in 2015, and displayed some power. in his limited 2016 season, he did not hit for average and struck out at an alarming rate. in addition, he was making sidearm throws from third base, with not that much velocity on the ball. although wright said he does not know how much the neck injury affected his throwing, collins said there was no doubt in his mind that wright's neck and nerve discomfort affected his shoulder — and his throwing.\n\nwright said he was now near the end of a shoulder-exercise program, designed to strengthen small muscles that atrophied after the neck surgery. he said he hoped to begin a throwing schedule this week that will gradually intensify. he knows there will be rust to knock off in all aspects of his game, he said, but he hopes he can be ready for opening day on april 3.\n\nthis is a fun time to be a met, he said, and i want to be a part of this winning season we're going to have.\n\ncollins said the mets might get wright into spring training games sooner this year than in 2016 so the team can see what he is capable of. wright said he would be forthright with collins about his physical condition to avoid potential setbacks.\n\nwright may have to try his hand at first base, depending on how much throwing ability he eventually demonstrates. for the moment, at least, he still views himself as a third baseman.
but now millions of dollars in grants are on hold after one mexican-american and two white business owners sued the state, arguing that the fund for black residents discriminated against them.\n\nthe dispute in oregon is the latest legal skirmish in the nation's decades-long battle over affirmative action, and comes in a year in which the pandemic has starkly exposed the socioeconomic and health disparities that african-americans face. it has unfolded, too, against the backdrop of the black lives matter movement, with institutions across america — from corporations to city councils — acknowledging systemic racism, and activists demanding that meaningful steps be taken to undo racial inequities.\n\npoliticians, social scientists and jurists have long clashed over how far the government and institutions should go to repair the harm caused by racial discrimination — and the extent to which past racism should influence today's decisions. in creating the oregon cares fund, lawmakers took the rare step of explicitly naming a single racial group as the beneficiary, arguing that black residents have been subjected to unique discrimination that put them at a disadvantage during the pandemic.\n\nover the decades, various remedies to address discrimination have been met with legal challenges. supreme court rulings have established that race-based policies are constitutional only if they achieve a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to do so. the court has most notably allowed race to be used as a factor in college admissions to achieve student diversity. but the court in recent decades has also sided against one of the original rationales for affirmative action policies — to undo past discrimination and its lingering effect.\n\nyou have to show that there's this really close nexus between why you're using race and the outcome you're seeking, said melissa murray, a professor of law at new york university. and i think here it's going to be a real question as to whether funding just black businesses through this cares fund is actually the only way that you could address the problems that black oregonians have experienced during this particular period.
it has not been clear how our bodies manage this trick.\n\nsome years ago, scientists did discover one of the likely mechanisms, which involves leptin, a hormone released by fat cells. in broad terms, when people add fat, they produce more leptin, which then jump-starts processes in the brain that reduce appetite and should cause their bodies to drop that new weight.\n\nbut obviously this system is not perfect or no one would hold on to added pounds.\n\nso for the new study, which was published this month in proceedings of the national academy of sciences, an international group of researchers began to wonder whether there might be other processes at work.\n\nto find out, they first gathered groups of mice and rats. they chose both species, hoping that, if any results were common to each, this might indicate that they also could occur in other mammals, including, potentially, us.\n\nthen the scientists implanted tiny capsules into each rodent's abdomen. some contained weights equaling about 15 percent of each animal's body mass. others were empty.\n\nin effect, some of the animals had just gained a big chunk of weight.\n\nthe scientists then left the rodents alone to deal with these added ounces as they would. and their bodies quickly went to work. within two days, the animals containing the weighted capsules were eating less and after two weeks, had generally lost almost as much weight as the capsules contained.
after winning the a.f.c. championship for only the second time in their history, the bengals lost, 20-16, to walsh's 49ers in super bowl xxiii. the 49ers sealed the victory when montana tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to john taylor with 34 seconds remaining. (the bengals have never returned to the super bowl.)\n\nknown as a fiery and hard-driving coach willing to go against the grain, wyche made waves for another, more embarrassing reason two years later. in october 1990, the n.f.l. fined wyche $27,000, a record for a coach, for preventing a female reporter, denise tom of usa today, from entering the team's locker room. he was unrepentant, saying that women shouldn't be able to walk in on players while they were naked.\n\nno amount of fine will force me to change my conviction on this matter, he told reporters. we need to find a way for women to have a decent and open access to all these athletes. the commissioner feels like it's more important to fine me than to seek another solution.\n\nwyche had been fined twice before, once for knocking a microphone out of a reporter's hand and once for barring all reporters from the team's locker room after a loss. the third fine, though, came just weeks after another reporter, lisa olson of the boston herald, complained that she had been surrounded by several naked players in the new england patriots' locker room and verbally abused.\n\nwyche's willingness to buck convention extended to the field. he ran up the score on opponents, once ordering an onside kick even though his team was ahead 45-0. he was also outspoken. he criticized fans in cleveland for throwing debris on the field and implored fans in cincinnati to stop throwing snowballs.\n\nafter a 3-13 finish in 1991, wyche, with several years remaining on his contract, left cincinnati for tampa, where he coached the buccaneers for four seasons. though he led the bengals during one of the franchise's more successful stretches, he had only a 61-66 record there (plus 3-2 in the playoffs) and a 23-41 record in tampa.\n\nhe was quarterbacks coach for the buffalo bills in 2004 and 2005, then moved to pickens, where he volunteered as a quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator for the town's high school team.
it seems highly unlikely that the 121.92-meter home run would gain any more traction now than it did during baseball's flirtation with metric distances on outfield fences in the 1970s. and a television audience might be more confused than delirious if it was announced that stephen curry had just hit a buzzer-beater from 10.67 meters instead of 35 feet.\n\nthe hoariest of clichés also appear safe, too. football is in no danger of becoming a game of centimeters.\n\nbut track and field long ago loosened its ties to the feet and inches of the british imperial system, and among track events, only the seldom-run mile persists as a revered imperial distance.\n\nyet within american track and field there are conflicting views about how pervasive the metric system should become. one side calls the imperial system antiquated and says it should be abandoned in favor of international uniformity. the other side says familiarity is needed to preserve history and maintain relevance for a sport that is robust in participation but struggles for spectator interest outside of the olympics.
the metropolitan museum of art has probably made itself popular with no one by announcing it will soon impose a mandatory admission fee of up to $25 on visitors who don't live in new york state. but given financial realities — a multimillion-dollar deficit that will not disappear by itself — the new policy, announced on thursday, is as understandable as it is regrettable.\n\nfor decades, the met followed a pay-as-you-wish tradition, suggesting a $25 payment from every adult but not requiring it. if you wished to put up much less, so be it. in recent years, the share of museumgoers paying the full freight shrank as the suggested price rose to $25 from $12. in 2004, 63 percent of adults paid in full. in 2017, the figure shriveled to 17 percent. the system simply isn't successful anymore, said daniel weiss, the met's president and chief executive. he said his institution is the only major museum anywhere that relies on voluntary fees and doesn't get most of its revenue from the government.\n\nso starting in march, non-new yorkers will have to pay $25, though students and the elderly will be charged, respectively, $12 and $17. the only exceptions are students from connecticut and new jersey. pay as you wish remains in place for them. the same goes for new yorkers. in effect, they will be carded, forced to produce identification — a driver's license, a library card, a bank statement — that shows their address.\n\nthe new system is in line with prices charged at some other institutions, like the museum of modern art. it's not expected to produce torrents of new money for the met, though. mr. weiss put the projected extra revenue from non-new yorkers between $6 million and $11 million. new york city's government — which has given the new policy its blessing and contributes more than $27 million a year to help cover the museum's operating expenses — spends $6 million every 35 minutes or so.
sign up to receive the at home newsletter.\n\nwelcome. a group of friends and i used to gather for brunch every year on new year's day, and at the end of the meal, we'd each write a resolution on a slip of paper and put it in a hat. then everyone drew from the hat, each receiving a random resolution, an assignment for the year from someone else at the table.\n\nthe resolution might be practical, something the person writing it hoped to do themselves: fold your clothes every night when you take them off, sign up for voice lessons. or it might be something ridiculous: one year i drew, every morning when you wake up, stick your arms out at your sides, wiggle your fingers and say, it's showtime!\n\nwe were trying to add some whimsy to resolution-making, to make entertaining a self-improvement practice that can sometimes feel punishing. as a result we were nudged out of our comfort zones (the friend who drew the voice lessons resolution actually took some lessons, something he wouldn't have done otherwise). since we hadn't come up with the resolutions ourselves, they seemed like fun challenges rather than aspirations in pursuit of which we could fall short. (it took about a month for it's showtime to fade from my morning schedule, but i still do it every now and then: a silly, theatrical flourish to start the day.)\n\nfor 2021, why not go gentle on the resolutions, keeping in mind that your nerves might be frayed, your zest for a life overhaul a bit depleted? just as, earlier in the pandemic, i suggested making tiny changes in your day in order to create a routine instead of adopting a rigid schedule, you might look at resolutions as ways to tinker with your habits, not to totally replace them.
the timing and outlook for the president's impeachment trial were already murky. in a pair of votes in december, the house impeached mr. trump for abuse of power and obstruction of congress. the charges stem from his bid to pressure ukraine to investigate his political rivals, while withholding nearly $400 million of military aid.\n\nms. pelosi has refused to transmit the charges against mr. trump to the senate, in a bid to give senate democrats more leverage as they try to force republicans to agree to call administration witnesses and gain access to more documents. the president blocked administration officials from testifying in the house inquiry and refused to turn over documents that impeachment investigators requested, prompting the obstruction charge.\n\nnow, the question is whether the coming debate on iran will affect the calculations by democrats and republicans strategizing over the terms and length of a trial.\n\ndemocrats on the left argue that the impulses that led mr. trump to strike general suleimani are themselves grounds for his removal.\n\nthe issues are connected, said representative ro khanna, democrat of california, who sponsored legislation to block mr. trump from launching an unauthorized strike against iran. it shows the same reckless pattern of policymaking that he engaged in with ukraine. it's no longer a matter of standing up for the rule of law and the constitution. this is a matter of safeguarding our national security and peace because a president that disregards constitutional processes can pose a huge risk to stability and peace.\n\nsenators spent the year-end holidays preparing for the impeachment trial, a showdown over the fate of mr. trump's presidency that could consume parts of january and february.\n\nlawmakers and aides close to ms. pelosi say she has not yet made up her mind on how or when to proceed, and said foreign policy would not affect her thinking. a decision could come as soon as this week, when house lawmakers reconvene on tuesday and the speaker holds a series of meetings with her leadership team.
i thought that i was never going to swim with my friends again, which was ridiculous, because of course climate change doesn't happen all at once. the horrors would recede, regroup and advance again with new strength, and there was no law saying we couldn't go swimming through it all.\n\nand before long we were back out there every day, in that beautiful water. it wasn't so much that i planned on swimming into mid-november in a lake in northern california at 3,017 feet, as i just kept going every single day and over time, the water kept getting colder and colder. it was around oct. 26 where i started to feel that i was doing something unusual and brave and at times painful. my first thought every morning was resentment that my day had this big hard part in the middle of it. but even as the air and water got colder, it didn't get worse, it got better. my body started to get used to it. the big hard part of my day became the best thing in it. my first thought every morning became swimming. and then i would just lie there smiling stupidly into the dark.\n\nfor the first minute in very cold water, your brain just goes on a vacation. (cue several million people googling cold water near me.) you are nothing except a body experiencing itself. i laugh at this stage, i laugh like my guts are going to fall out of my body, then scream. it's so cold, and yes, that is hard. but it doesn't last that long, and you can feel the unpleasantness of the cold melding with the pleasantness of it until it is all pleasantness, until all you feel is bliss.\n\nyour skin is cold, but inside, you are warm, and safe-feeling, so that the cold is just a sensation, and not a misery. it's unlike anything else i have ever felt in my entire life, and it is just a moment every day when i feel too good to remember that things are bad. and then, honestly, i spend the rest of the day recovering from it, not hyper-focusing on a million tasks, not being free from anxiety, not feeling ready to conquer things. i take a long bath and often fall asleep, and at some point manage to do the work required of me, but it's basically a whole day lost to 20 minutes of extreme pleasure, and that's fine with me.\n\ni think it's funny that whenever people talk about swimming in cold water they immediately start talking about how good it is for you. oh that's so good for your immune system, it's good for your heart, it's good for your skin, it's good for your circulation, good for your anxiety. maybe at another time in human history i would have cared, but at this point, i'm like, what does good for you even mean? two months ago i saw the sun disappear, and it will not be the last time, so, forgive me if i feel like the good for you ship has sailed.\n\nthe lake is not my source of strength or my fountain of youth. i swim in the cold water because it feels good, and i will keep doing it for that reason, until one of us is no longer here.
the trump administration and members of congress pressured the new york stock exchange on tuesday to remove china's three major state-run telecommunications companies from the exchange.\n\nthe stock exchange late monday had reversed its original plans, announced last week, to delist the companies to comply with an executive order from the administration aimed at stopping american investment in companies linked to the chinese military.\n\nmonday's sudden reversal by the exchange sowed confusion and reflected the ongoing fighting within the trump administration about how hard a line to take against china during president trump's final days in office. treasury secretary steven mnuchin has been pushing for greater accommodation for chinese companies, while officials in the department of defense have argued that the companies in question must be delisted for national security reasons.\n\nthe big board said late on monday that it had halted plans to delist the companies after consulting with the treasury department. the about-face came a week after the exchange said it would stop the trading of shares in china unicom, china telecom and china mobile by jan. 11 in response to a trump administration executive order that blocked americans from investing in companies tied to the chinese military.
can ballet express a modern view of the sexes? in the western contemporary world, women and men often hold equal status at work, as leaders, as voters, as breadwinners. this kind of equality, however, is precisely what ballet cannot show.\n\ninstead, it creates an either-or dualism from the difference between man and woman. he does most of the partnering (traditionally, all of it). she rises onto point. when he does the same (seldom), the effect is comic. the foot is a relatively tiny part of the body; yet its significance becomes colossal.\n\nthe meanings that flow from ballet are not only about gender. yet the use of pointwork places the woman on a different level of being.\n\nand so ballet remains a sexist view of the world — one that privileges the woman, certainly, but on terms that let her shine only by doing what no man can. should we agree with the choreographer george balanchine (1904-83) that ballet is woman? or do we qualify this, as the choreographer pam tanowitz (born in 1969) has recently done, by saying that ballet is a man's idea of woman?
change in the auto industry is merciless. several years ago, more than a few analysts and journalists predicted that volvo would go the way of plymouth, oldsmobile, mercury and scion, all shuttered brands. volvo, once an independent swedish company, was a part of ford for a spell, and during that period its designs and engineering grew old. too little change can be lethal.\n\nthen in 2010, volvo was sold to the zhejiang geely holding group, a chinese company. somehow, chinese investment has produced the most swedish volvos ever. skoal!\n\nlooking more scandinavian than a trip to ikea, the all-new s90 sedan starts with a solid foundation. it, like the company's wildly successful xc90 s.u.v., rides on volvo's innovative structural platform, called scalable product architecture, or spa. the only fixed component is the section from the front axle to the firewall (which separates the cabin from the engine bay). all other points — the wheelbase, front and rear overhangs and width — can be lengthened or shortened. think lego.\n\nnow for volvo, building many of its vehicles, from the coming midsize s60 sedan to the three-row xc90, starts with a trip to the spa for the engineers. that saves money. how swedish.
after getting just their second win in eight games, the buffalo sabres credited the victory to a solid team effort.\n\nevander kane and justin bailey scored 1 minute 42 seconds apart around the first intermission on tuesday, leading the buffalo sabres to a 4-1 victory over the rangers at madison square garden.\n\nzemgus girgensons and jack eichel also scored for buffalo, and anders nilsson stopped 24 shots for the sabres. sam reinhart had two assists, extending his career-best points streak to seven games.\n\nwe played a pretty simple game for 60 minutes and had success, eichel said. at times this season, we've gotten away from our game. you can see in the third period, we didn't really give them much at all. a lot of pucks were north and in their zone and it seemed like we played with it in their zone.
interest in their plans has been intense, given that history and the seagram building's architectural significance. the partners are best known for the lavish, sometimes over-the-top food and design at downtown restaurants like carbone and dirty french.\n\nthis much they do know: the grill, their grand, retro steakhouse in the former grill room, is scheduled to open in april, with mr. carbone as its executive chef. no firm opening date has been set for the pool, the modern, japanese-influenced seafood restaurant in the former pool room, where mr. torrisi will be the executive chef.\n\nmajor food will also renovate and reopen the more casual space downstairs, formerly called brasserie, though the group has it on the back burner for now.\n\nthe menus for the grill and the pool have been drafted, and the partners gather regularly with other members of their team to test dishes in a specially built kitchen on the ground floor of their first restaurant, torrisi italian specialties, which they closed two years ago.\n\nthey have tried several incarnations of the smoked goose and duck terrine. one was slightly leaner, the foie at its center shaped into a perfect cylinder. is there booze in the figs now? mr. torrisi asked. maybe, his tone suggested, there should be.
evernote is a good example. it includes an export notes feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other note-taking apps. microsoft's note-taking app onenote, along with apple's notes app, can easily import evernote records. but if your app of choice is something else, such as google keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app.\n\nflickr is also difficult to part ways with. getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: you have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of high-resolution images, and then upload them to a new photo service.\n\nwhen companies don't provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. there are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you.\n\nif there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn't hurt to just take out what is most important to you. perhaps you don't need five-year-old notes from evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app.\n\nfinding a new app\n\non the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app — which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement.\n\nthe biggest lessons: pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. and before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in.\n\nditching apple's calendar app was fairly easy. all my calendar data was already stored online and apple's app supports calendars from multiple online services including google, microsoft and facebook. the key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better.
michael zorc, the team's technical director, was disappointed. but he also knew such a day would come: pulisic had never been shy about his ambition to play in england.\n\nso dortmund and pulisic quickly set about moving forward with parallel goals: the club hoping to maximize the value of an attractive young asset still under its control, the player trying to make sure his dream move landed him in the right place.\n\nthere was a lot of trust in these talks, said zorc, who said multiple clubs expressed interest in pulisic and that at least one other premier league team was willing to pay dortmund's final asking price.\n\nhis transfer will bring an end to three remarkable years at dortmund. as a 17-year-old, he broke into the club's first team and promptly became the youngest non-german to score a bundesliga goal. but his rise slowed somewhat this season as injuries and the emergence of other young players diminished pulisic's playing time. zorc said he suspected the transfer negotiations had distracted pulisic this season — maybe his mind was not so clear — but hopes the resolution will have a positive effect on the field. pulisic agrees.\n\ni feel much, much clearer in my head now that all this is passed, he said about making the deal public.\n\npulisic has five more months to contribute at dortmund, which leads the bundesliga with 42 points — 6 ahead of bayern munich — through 17 games. after that, he will continue his development at chelsea, a club not particularly known for nurturing young players.\n\nstill, it was not lost on pulisic — or his father, mark, who worked closely with him to evaluate his transfer destination — that chelsea's roster situation, with several forwards potentially moving on this summer, could work in his favor.
from the minute we arrived in india, i had to let go. i had to stop worrying because i couldn't worry anymore — it is impossible to worry about everything i might need to worry about in india: contaminated water, mosquitoes that may carry dengue or malaria, traffic that often follows no rules. against all of that, did it really matter if my daughter had gained three ounces or five?\n\nthe next day, in mumbai, i went to a fancy baby shop to buy cribs, ready to spend a few hours weighing the pros and cons of various options. with the baby strapped to me in a carrier and an iced coffee in my hand, i marched in to the shop and said, i'd like to see your options for cribs, please.\n\nthis one, the salesperson said. i ordered it and left the shop within 10 minutes.\n\ni myself was born in india and had a perfectly safe and sound upbringing here but, in the eternal battle of nature versus nurture, my surroundings in brooklyn seemed to be affecting me more than my own childhood or my mother's suggestions that i calm down. her advice was impossible for me to hear in my new york environment, surrounded by my fellow mothers whose days are ruled by feeding apps. when i showed my indian grandmother the feeding app on my phone, instead of marveling at it and saying she wished she'd had such a thing when she was a young mother, she just laughed at me and took a long sip of her coconut water.\n\ni had been nervous about making this big trip with our newborn daughter because to leave our little neighborhood of brooklyn and travel across the world and set up a different life felt too daunting. babies are challenging: in a cruel failure of evolution, adults require five hours of uninterrupted sleep in order to function and newborn babies need to feed every three hours.\n\nthey say babies thrive on routine and i had just begun to find mine in brooklyn, but it was a perfectly crafted rhythm with no space for deviation or change. i have the luxury of working from home so i was feeding her as soon as the baby-feeding app beeped and i put her down for naps at exactly the same time every day.\n\nmy baby, who loved 22 out of the 24 hours it took us to get to mumbai, doesn't seem to be too bothered about her routine being disrupted so far. she loves all the people in india and reaches for them faster than i can swoop in and force them to cover themselves with antibacterial gel.\n\nshe's had a stomach upset already but didn't seem nearly as troubled by it as i was. we went out to dinner with friends who have a 7-month-old and both babies stayed awake for part of the dinner and then fell asleep in their strollers. when we got home we transferred her to her crib and she kept sleeping peacefully.
a steep stairway leads to the cramped basement, half of which once served as a drying room, mr. huang said as he walked into the room, which is still encased with metal panels. mr. hong used to hang items on rows of pegs, and used a gas stove to heat the space for drying.\n\nwith no washing machines in the shop, the huangs outsource much of the bulk laundry work. but for rush requests, ms. huang piles the clothing in a handcart and does it herself at a nearby laundromat.\n\nthe huangs have known many of their customers for decades, though usually by the ticket number stamped inside their garments instead of by name.\n\ncustomer 89, for example, is senator chuck schumer, who lives in the neighborhood.\n\non a recent weekday, customer 762 walked in.\n\nit's funny, i've been coming here all these years, and i don't even know their names, said customer 762, whose non-laundry name is sheldon jacobson. mr. jacobson, 70, a retired city worker, has been coming to the shop for 40 years, since when mr. hong owned it. i'm amazed they're still here, he said.\n\nanother customer dropped off his laundry and mr. huang said, c-20 — nice man.\n\noutside the shop, customer c-20 said that his name was mike mellor and that he had been getting his shirts done at san toy since 1974. that day, he had dropped off a bundle of sheets and shirts.\n\npeople say i'm crazy, that for the money it takes to wash them, i could buy new ones, mr. mellor, 78, said. he gestured toward the huangs in the shop. but they're a great service for the community. i have a washing machine now, but i still come here because they need the money.
in the spring, progressive said it had given customers premium credits of 20 percent for april and may, a payout totaling about $1 billion. asked about a possible second refund, a company spokesman, ronald f. davis, said in an email that progressive had lowered auto rates in more than 40 states from april through december and would continue to monitor our driving and claims data to determine where additional actions are warranted.\n\ninsurers over all have returned about $14 billion to auto customers because people are driving less, said james lynch, chief actuary and senior vice president of research and education at the insurance information institute, an industry group. the industry has been flexible about working with strapped customers on payments during the pandemic, he said, and has contributed $280 million to charitable endeavors related to the coronavirus.\n\nthe insurance industry has had a challenging year in other ways, mr. lynch said, with significant claims related to hurricanes and wildfires. yet, he said, the industry has done as much to help people out as anyone.\n\nrobert passmore, a claims expert at the american property casualty insurance association, said in an email that insurers had been responding to the change in driving patterns. an industry auto premium index was down 7 percent in october and 6 percent in november, reflecting decreases in response to the falloff in claim frequency, he said.\n\nthat means that in general, personal auto rates are lower than they were a year ago, mr. passmore added.\n\ninsurance relief offered in the spring typically shaved 15 to 25 percent off customers' premium payments for one or more months, according to a report in october from the national association of insurance commissioners, a group of state regulators.\n\nbut a report published by u.s. pirg's education fund affiliate, examining relief given by the 10 top insurers in each state, found that most hadn't given customers more than half of one month's premium. over all, they were pretty stingy, ms. murray said.
mr. gutierrez, 47, started thinking about these issues when he was a student and discovered two formative books: this bridge called my back helped him find a voice for his own rage and passion when he was part of the group queer nation; and sally banes's terpsichore in sneakers, which chronicled artists from the 1960s collective judson dance theater, got him pondering the perceived division in dance between identity and personal exploration on the one hand and abstraction and formalism on the other.\n\nusing predominantly white casts in europe changed everything. we were playing with a lot of the same formal ideas, he said, but something else was coming up for me. it wasn't that it didn't work. it was just that i realized it felt like any investigation around abstraction or improvisation or form would probably just be read as that.\n\nhe wanted to go deeper, and that's when it hit him: what it would be like to work with a group that was all latin american?\n\nin the opening section, which is improvisation based, the dancers work with materials, including a ladder, stools and clamps, as well as pieces of fabric, which they drape over their bodies and carry throughout the space. at times, it really does feel like a bridge is being built and torn down over and over again. all the while, the dancers show their skin, their flesh, their sweat.\n\nto mr. gutierrez, the pieces of fabric conjure different images, like color block painting and brazilian tropicália. sometimes they become boundaries, he said. sometimes they become a shape of a discarded thing. there's not a lot of reverence. it's not like, 'oh this beautiful canvas.' there's even a tent city illusion.\n\nwithin this painterly setting — tuçe yasak's lighting manages to change the temperature from hot to cool — the performers generate and manipulate the sound. they move speakers. they stop it suddenly by closing a laptop. is it building, is it growing? mr. gutierrez said. sometimes yes, sometimes no.
still, there are some very real consequences here.\n\nhistoric sites like the african burial ground and grant's tomb are closed. gateway national recreation area, a national park with locations in queens, brooklyn, staten island and new jersey, is open, but with no visitor services. and if you're itching for a piece of hamilton history, try the hamilton lottery, because his home in upper manhattan is closed.\n\ngerald quaye, an air traffic controller at kennedy airport, is not getting paid but still reports to work. if the shutdown extends past this week, mr. quaye said he is unsure how he will pay his mortgage. i've never been late and i've never defaulted, he said on friday, and hopefully, it doesn't get to that point.\n\nother closed historical sites: federal hall, saint paul's church, eleanor roosevelt's home, franklin roosevelt house, the vanderbilt mansion and women's rights national historical park, among others.\n\nclosed museums: national museum of the american indian heye center and cooper hewitt.\n\nopen, but without visitor services: appalachian trail, sagamore hill, and the upper delaware scenic and recreational river. enjoy those restrooms.\n\nopen, because of state funding: ellis island (where governor cuomo had his inauguration) and the statue of liberty.
which is what thompson and lowry and george and beal will be trying to do on saturday night, along with four others: devin booker, eric gordon, wayne ellington and tobias harris. the dunk contest, meanwhile, now relies on lesser-known, and often younger, players because of the longstanding reluctance of stars to participate. only one all-star, victor oladipo of the indiana pacers, is participating in the contest this year. derrick jones jr., who came in second in last year's dunk contest, had played in only seven n.b.a. games when he competed in 2017. and the 2017 winner, glenn robinson iii, was the 40th pick in the 2014 draft.\n\nin the dunk contest, if you are having lebron and paul george, it would be very popular, said clyde drexler, who, when he was an active player, took part in both the dunk and the 3-point contest. a lot of guys are afraid to get in the dunk contest because they may not win and it'll hurt their brand.''\n\nthe n.b.a. has taken steps to try to revamp the dunk contest. it has, at different times, changed the number of competitors, allowed first-round byes and then taken them away, changed the scoring system, added and then taken away a wheel that selects what dunk a player should perform and incorporated fan voting. in contrast, the rules for the 3-point competition, which began in 1986, have stayed largely the same.\n\nnevertheless, notes michael bass, the chief spokesman for the n.b.a., the dunk contest remains the highest-rated event on the saturday night of all-star weekend, even if the 3-point contest is drawing bigger-name players. maybe we will see that change over time,'' he added. the interest in the 3-point-shooting contest has certainly taken off.''\n\neven with that surge in interest, there is talk of altering the 3-point format. knicks coach jeff hornacek, a former 3-point contest participant, has suggested holding separate contests for big men and guards. fraser has wondered about the possibility of adding a deeper, half-court shot that would be worth more points. miller excitedly detailed why the league should have a former 3-point contest winner team with a current n.b.a. shooter in an old-school/new-school competition.\n\nthis is the one way you would get me out of retirement to participate: have a legend — ray allen, dell curry, dale ellis — team up with the current guys, miller said. i would go first, he would go second. people want to see ray allen. people would want to see larry bird. i think that would be hot.
ms. collins was right about the first part: mr. trump did learn a pretty big lesson. he learned that he can break the law and undermine democracy with impunity. he learned that he can do the political equivalent of shooting someone in the middle of fifth avenue, and he won't lose the support of republicans. so, naturally, he pulled the trigger again.\n\nthis time, many republicans have again swarmed to the president's defense. as of monday night, more than 140 house members and at least 13 senators were expected to object to electoral vote results on wednesday, when congress officially counts the ballots. that is, more than 150 republican lawmakers have signed on to reject the votes of tens of millions of americans.\n\non what grounds are they taking this stupefying step? overwhelming evidence of voting fraud and irregularities, they claim. when called to present such evidence in a court of law, however, they've got nothing. in dozens of lawsuits filed over the past two months, mr. trump's lawyers and allies have been unable to document more than a few isolated cases of fraud in any state, much less the hundreds of thousands of cases in multiple states that would be necessary to change the outcome. that's no surprise in an election that was praised by election officials as the most secure in american history.\n\nthere are lawmakers who understand the grave danger in what their colleagues are doing. several republican senators — including ms. collins, lisa murkowski of alaska, bill cassidy of louisiana and mitt romney of utah — have urged congress to move forward and certify mr. biden's victory. in choosing any other path, warned senator tom cotton of arkansas, congress would take away the power to choose the president from the people, which would essentially end presidential elections and place that power in the hands of whichever party controls congress. the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, has also urged his colleagues not to object.\n\nin a sense, this is all political theater. every state long ago certified its vote totals without contest. on monday, gabriel sterling, a top georgia election official, publicly and painstakingly debunked every one of mr. trump's claims of fraud. this is all easily, provably false, he said. the objectors know this; many won their own seats on the same ballots that they are attempting to invalidate. what they are really objecting to is the fact that mr. trump lost.\n\nbut there are many americans who believe their claims who are not in on this disingenuous, cynical game — and who believe that their votes for mr. trump are the ones being invalidated. that mistrust will have consequences that extend far beyond wednesday's certification, including the creation of a generational myth of a stolen election, the discrediting of mr. biden's presidency from the outset and the passage of stricter voting laws that target democratic-leaning voters, under the guise of electoral integrity.\n\nthat's a big problem, because a republic works only when the losers accept the results, and the legitimacy of their opponents. all the more reason to commend republican officials like mr. raffensperger and mr. sterling — and the handful of republican congress members who have spoken out, however wanly, about mr. trump's scheme — for resisting the immense corruption and pressure from their leaders.\n\nif only that weren't extraordinary in the republican party today.
but wait. there's more to escaped alone than this sustained backyard idyll. at regular intervals, the stage goes black, and when the light returns it's in the form of two vast, illuminated red rectangles, one within the other, crackling and burning in the dark. mrs. jarrett stands before them, all by herself, delivering reports of a future in which nature, poisoned beyond endurance, has run amok.\n\nthese bosch-like accounts are grotesque and whimsical, painting landscapes of destruction from the basic vocabularies of both contemporary culture and ages-old apocalyptic imagery. stories of life-devouring flood, famine and pestilence are woven with references to such seemingly trivial phenomena as television cooking shows and selfies.\n\nhere, for example, is mrs. jarrett on the devastation wrought by a wind developed by property developers: buildings migrated from london to lahore, kyoto to kansas city, and survivors were interned for having no travel documents. some in the whirlwind went higher and higher, the airsick families taking selfies in case they could ever share them. shantytowns were cleared. pets rained from the sky. a kitten became famous.\n\nthe reality within the surrealism of such descriptions is what makes them stick to your memory. (i saw escaped alone at the royal court theater in london a year ago, and its images seem to have been in my bloodstream ever since.) ms. bassett delivers these monologues not in the ominous style of some otherworldly oracle but in the matter-of-fact, common-woman manner of her character.\n\nas extreme as these visions are, they also feel ineffably linked to the more everyday worries and make-believe speculations (what bird would you like to be?) that have been shared by sally, lena and vi. and there turns out to be more than meets the eye (or ear) to these women, too, as we learn by carefully calibrated degrees what it is that keeps them awake at night.\n\nthe play's combination of theatrical technique and untrammeled imagination, and of the personal and the universal, make you understand why ms. churchill is regarded by many (rightly, i think) as the most dazzlingly inventive living dramatist in the english language. no one in theater these days is better at exploding and reassembling traditional modes of language and storytelling.\n\nescaped alone is a fairy tale of sorts, as were ms. churchill's earlier the skriker and far away. this magnificent writer's latest variation on that form reaffirms such tales' power to warm us even as they warn of the unspeakable dangers in the wide, dark world beyond.
stocks sink as traders eye georgia senate elections this briefing has ended. follow our latest coverage of markets, business and the economy.\n\nstocks on wall street sink in their steepest decline since october. wall street began the year with a tumble on monday, with the s&p 500 suffering its steepest decline in more than two months as it retreated from record territory. analysts traced the sell-off to a number of factors, including political jitters stemming from tuesday's runoff election in georgia — which will determine control of the u.s. senate — concerns about a resurgent coronavirus, and the simple need for investors to take a breather after a stretch of sizzling gains. it wasn't clear that the slump would continue into tuesday. stocks in asian markets were steady early on tuesday, while futures markets suggested that wall street would stabilize when it opens. the index fell 1.5 percent, its sharpest drop since late october. stocks that have been most sensitive to investor sentiment about the coronavirus pandemic led the decline. shares of royal caribbean cruises, wynn resorts, marriott international and carnival were all down by 5 percent or more.\n\n\n\nmajor benchmarks in europe also gave up most of their early gains on monday, though they managed to stay in positive territory for the day. the stoxx europe 600 index rose 0.7 percent, and the ftse 100 index in britain gained 1.7 percent. after europe's markets closed on monday, prime minister boris johnson imposed a strict new national lockdown as a more contagious variant of the coronavirus threatened to overwhelm the nation's beleaguered hospitals. the variant is now present in the united states, where coronavirus cases and deaths have reached records in recent days. monday's retreat also came after the s&p 500 rallied more than 16 percent in 2020, defying the economic crisis and the human catastrophe of the pandemic, as the federal reserve stepped in to support financial markets, congress spent trillions on unemployment and business support programs, and vaccinations began, showing a sustainable way out of the pandemic. but investors have always had to contend with the still-spreading coronavirus pandemic, the risk of new lockdowns and political turmoil in the united states. on tuesday, two runoff senate elections in georgia will settle control of the upper house of congress, and finally determine how hard it will be for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. to move forward on his agenda. in the wake of the presidential election in november, investors had begun to anticipate that republicans would retain control of the senate, giving them the ability to limit the biden administration's ability to raise taxes or increase regulation. that view had also helped lift stocks at the end of last year, but monday's trading showed investors had grown less confident in a republican win on tuesday. the market fears the democrats taking both of those seats, said julian emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at the brokerage firm btig. he said that investors have been closely watching prediction markets give greater chances to that outcome in recent days. it's basically now a tossup as to what the outcome is going to be tomorrow, after the republicans being heavily favored.\n\nnew york stock exchange pressured to push ahead and delist 3 chinese firms a china telecom office in shanghai. the new york stock exchange said monday that it had halted plans to delist china telecom, china unicom and china mobile. credit... alex plavevski/epa, via shutterstock the trump administration and members of congress pressured the new york stock exchange on tuesday to remove china's three major state-run telecommunications companies from the exchange. the stock exchange late monday had reversed its original plans, announced last week, to delist the companies to comply with an executive order from the administration aimed at stopping american investment in companies linked to the chinese military. monday's sudden reversal by the exchange sowed confusion and reflected the ongoing fighting within the trump administration about how hard a line to take against china during president trump's final days in office. treasury secretary steven mnuchin has been pushing for greater accommodation for chinese companies, while officials in the department of defense have argued that the companies in question must be delisted for national security reasons. the big board said late on monday that it had halted plans to delist the companies after consulting with the treasury department. the about-face came a week after the exchange said it would stop the trading of shares in china unicom, china telecom and china mobile by jan. 11 in response to a trump administration executive order that blocked americans from investing in companies tied to the chinese military. speculation that the reversal was facilitated by mr. mnuchin drew backlash from some china hawks in congress on tuesday. the days of wall street and china benefiting at the expense of american workers and industry has to end, senator marco rubio, republican of florida, said on twitter. he said such a move would be an outrageous effort to undermine president trump's executive order. the department of defense also assailed the decision, issuing a statement to bloomberg news on tuesday that said keeping the companies on the exchange strengthens them and promotes intelligence collection activities by the communist party of china. shortly after releasing the statement, however, the pentagon retracted it. a pentagon spokeswoman had no comment. the treasury department had no comment about whether mr. mnuchin had encouraged the exchange to halt the delistings, and on tuesday, as he was setting off on an international trip, mr. mnuchin wanted the exchange to move ahead with its plan to remove the companies. a senior administration official said mr. mnuchin called stacey cunningham, president of the n.y.s.e. group, on tuesday to voice his objection to the decision not to delist. a new york stock exchange spokesman had no comment on the call. the scope of the president's executive order has been a subject of debate. according to a person familiar with the matter, the stock exchange withdrew its plan to delist the chinese companies after determining that the language was ambiguous and that it was unclear whether the companies were required to be removed. if the treasury department clarifies that the order applies to those companies, the exchange will move forward with the delisting, this person said. another administration official said an interagency discussion was taking place on tuesday evening about updating the order to make clear that it applied to the chinese telecom companies. the stock exchange's statement on monday did not give a reason for the decision, though it alluded to the ambiguity of the order and said the move came in light of further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities. the exchange said its regulatory department would continue to evaluate the applicability of the order to the telecommunications companies. the delisting would have had little practical impact on the companies, which also have shares listed in hong kong and are state-owned. still, the disappearance from the american exchange had hefty symbolic value for worsening economic ties between china and the united states. alan rappeport and\n\nadvertisement continue reading the main story\n\nmore than 170 business executives urge congress to certify biden's win. president-elect joseph r. biden jr. boarded his plane at the new castle county airport in wilmington, del., on monday. republicans plan to attempt to disrupt certification of mr. biden's electoral votes on wednesday. credit... doug mills/the new york times chief executives and other leaders from many of america's largest businesses on monday urged congress to certify the electoral vote on wednesday to confirm joseph r. biden jr.'s presidential victory. attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they said in a statement. included in the list of 170 signers were laurence d. fink of blackrock, logan green and john zimmer of lyft, brad smith of microsoft, albert bourla of pfizer, and james zelter of apollo global management. over the weekend, president trump called georgia's republican secretary of state in an effort to subvert the election results. on the call, which was recorded, the president pressured the official to find enough votes to overturn mr. biden's victory. the president's demand raised questions about whether he violated election fraud statutes, lawyers said, though a charge is unlikely. president-elect biden won the electoral college, 306 to 232, and the popular vote was 81.2 million for mr. biden to mr. trump's 74.2 million. members of the president's party are divided over whether to accept that he lost the election: while top republicans, such as mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, have pushed back on a futile attempt in congress to reject the results, about a dozen senators and senators-elect have lined up behind president trump's bid to hold on to power. the urging from business leaders came on a volatile day for financial markets and just a day before runoff elections in georgia, which will determine whether republicans or democrats control the senate. coronavirus cases are surging, and vaccinations are taking more time than hoped. business leaders took issue with washington's new divide at a moment of grave uncertainty. our duly elected leaders deserve the respect and bipartisan support of all americans at a moment when we are dealing with the worst health and economic crises in modern history, the business leaders wrote. there should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power. the statement, which was organized by partnership for new york city, a business advocacy organization, came on the same day that thomas j. donohue, the head of the u.s. chamber of commerce, issued a statement urging certification of the vote. efforts by some members of congress to disregard certified election results in an effort to change the election outcome or to try a make a long-term political point undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation, mr. donohue wrote. the united states of america faces enormous challenges that not only require an orderly transition of administrations, but the focus of the incoming biden administration and the new congress, and cooperation across party lines, he continued. we urge congress to fulfill its responsibility in counting the electoral votes, the trump administration to facilitate an orderly transition for the incoming biden administration, and all of our elected officials to devote their energies to combating the pandemic and supporting our economic recovery.\n\nhaven, the health care venture of amazon, berkshire and jpmorgan, is shutting down. haven, the joint venture of amazon, berkshire hathaway and jpmorgan chase that was formed three years ago to explore new ways to deliver health care to the companies' employees, is disbanding, according to a statement posted on its website. it will cease its operations at the end of february. the haven team made good progress exploring a wide range of health care solutions, as well as piloting new ways to make primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use, and prescription drugs more affordable, brooke thurston, haven's spokeswoman, said in a statement. haven aimed to improve how people gain access to health care by pulling together the know-how and scale of three of the largest employers in america. its formation sent shock waves through the markets, driving health insurers' stocks lower as investors wagered that the power of the three behemoths combined would completely upend the country's health care delivery system by testing new ideas on more than a million employees. in a note to employees on monday announcing haven's end, jamie dimon, the chief executive of jpmorgan chase, said the three companies would continue to share information. we'll collaborate less formally going forward as we each work to design programs tailored to specific needs of our individual employee populations and local markets, he wrote. haven worked best as an incubator of ideas, a place to pilot, test and learn — and a way to share best practices across our companies, mr. dimon added. emily flitter and\n\n'spongebob squarepants' moves from pineapple under the sea to

platform controlled by the walt disney company, there will soon be another way to watch nickelodeon's spongebob squarepants and mtv's ridiculousness. when cbs reunited with the cable and film giant viacom at the end of 2019, after a decade apart, executives who swung the deal promised that the combined company would become a bigger player in digital media. viacomcbs took another step toward that goal on monday with the announcement that it had struck a deal to add 14 cable networks to hulu live tv. the 14 networks — a group that includes comedy central, mtv, nickelodeon, bet her, teennick and nicktoons — will join hulu live alongside corporate siblings like pop tv and the cw, which were already available on the service under a previous arrangement between cbs and hulu. when it comes to streaming, viacomcbs has mainly focused on supplying films and tv series to other companies. that strategy is expected to shift slightly this year, when the company will introduce paramount+, a platform named after the company's struggling movie studio. it will be an expanded version of cbs all access, the streamer best known for star trek: picard, jordan peele's reboot of the twilight zone, and the stand, a limited series based on stephen king's 1978 novel of survivors battling it out after a pandemic wipes out most of humanity. hulu live is a $65-a-month streaming alternative for

more time to consider the rule, arguing that difficult and momentous issues were being handled hastily. eight house lawmakers also wrote to mr. mnuchin, asking that the review period be extended by several weeks. the staggering 2020 rally highlights bitcoin's speculative appeal but also expectations of its lasting value to some investors. the run that has lifted bitcoin to its current price came as some big institutions said they would begin to buy or allow use of bitcoin. in may, paul tudor jones, one of wall street's best-known hedge fund managers, said he had put almost 2 percent of his portfolio in bitcoin. he said the cap on bitcoin production made it an attractive alternative to the declining value of traditional currencies, which he thought was inevitable as central banks printed more money to encourage an economic recovery.\n\nin july, the office of the comptroller of the currency, an american regulator, said this summer that banks would be allowed to hold cryptocurrencies for customers.\n\nin august, microstrategy, a software company in virginia, said it bought $250 million of bitcoin to store some of the cash it had in the corporate treasury.\n\nin october, square said it was putting $50 million of its corporate cash into bitcoin. in 2018, square also began offering the digital currency on the cash app, its phone app that people use to send money between friends and family.\n\nsoon after square did, paypal announced in october that it would allow people to buy and hold bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies. of course, none of that offers any indication of how high bitcoin could go, or when this rally may end. the last time this kind of speculative fever hit the cryptocurrency — in 2017 and 2018 — it doubled in value before halving again in just a few months.\n\nopec and russia fail to agree on oil production levels. an oilfield in the irkutsk region of russia. the prospect of opec, russia and other oil producing countries opening taps could quickly depress oil prices. credit... vasily fedosenko/reuters officials from opec, russia and other major oil-producing countries were unable on monday to reach agreement on whether to allow further increases in oil output in the face of reduced demand from the pandemic. the videoconference was adjourned and was expected to be continued on tuesday. the main issue in the meeting was whether to allow members of the group to raise oil production in february. during a difficult meeting in december, the group, known as opec plus, reached a compromise that permitted production to increase by 500,000 barrels a day starting jan. 1, instead of a previously agreed two million barrels a day. the group also agreed to meet monthly to consider whether further increases were warranted. the first of those monthly meetings, on monday, highlighted differences in the group. producers like russia, iraq and the united arab emirates have their reasons for wanting to lift production. but other members, led by saudi arabia, the de facto leader of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, are pushing to proceed cautiously. with the pandemic worsening in europe and the united states, the saudi-led bloc figures the demand for oil remains relatively weak, and rising production would probably lead to falling prices. in a speech opening the meeting, prince abdulaziz bin salman, the saudi oil minister and chairman of the opec plus meetings, called on officials to avoid the temptation to slacken their resolve. at the risk of being seen as a killjoy, he said, i want to urge caution, even in this generally optimistic environment. the members are still keeping about seven million barrels a day, or about 7 percent of global supply in normal times, off the market. the prospect of opening taps could quickly depress oil prices.\n\na trickle of trucks continues to ease britain into life outside the e.u. a police officer in the port of dover, england, checks a driver's coronavirus test on monday before allowing the truck onto a ferry. credit... glyn kirk/agence france-presse — getty images on the first working day after britain left the european union's single market and customs union, the traffic trickling through the country's busiest port was running smoothly. so far, the imposition of customs declarations for british exporters, the first in decades, hasn't led to the delays some had predicted. but the transition has been made easier by low levels of truck traffic. the eurotunnel and ferry operators, which carry trucks across the english channel, said boats and trains were running on time on monday. grant shapps, the transport secretary, said on sunday that 98 percent of the trucks heading to mainland europe via dover and nearby terminals had the documents they needed. but traffic numbers were low because of the new year's day holiday and weekend. the amount of goods flowing between the two countries was also low because companies had stockpiled last year amid uncertainty about whether london and brussels would sign a trade deal and eliminate potential tariffs by dec. 31, the end of the brexit transition period. much of britain is also under strict business and social restrictions to curb the pandemic. dfds, a ferry operator at the port of dover, said that on jan. 1 and jan. 2, 1,351 vehicles went through the port, about 40 percent of the volume on those dates last year. some in the logistics industry are concerned that when stockpiles have been used up and trade increases to more normal levels, the full scale of changes at the border will be revealed. even a relatively small percentage of unprepared drivers could cause disruption and congestion as drivers and the companies that own the goods on board adjust to all the new paperwork that is needed, from customs forms to safety certificates and driver permits. it is a mountain of paperwork that we have never had to do before, rod mckenzie, the managing director of the road haulage association, told lbc radio on monday. companies are saying that the forms are onerous and complicated, mr. mckenzie said. he also warned of invisible queues, in which trucks never leave the depot because companies haven't completed paperwork on time or truck drivers haven't gotten coronavirus tests, hampering supply chains. we haven't really started yet, he said. truck drivers are required to show a negative coronavirus test result, received within 72 hours, before they can cross the border into france. the british government has set up testing centers near the border and at points across the country, but some drivers have been turned away for not having the result. this testing requirement is in place until at least jan. 6 but there hasn't been a decision on whether remove it.\n\nadvertisement continue reading the main story\n\ncarl icahn sells a $600 million chunk of his stake in herbalife. carl icahn at the dealbook conference in 2015. by reducing his stake in herbalife, the investor will also give up five board seats held by his designees. credit... karsten moran for the new york times the billionaire financier carl icahn has begun to cash out of his nearly decade-long bet on the nutritional food supplements company herbalife, an investment that survived both regulatory review and a prominent — though unsuccessful — challenge by another activist investor. herbalife said late on sunday that it would buy back about $600 million worth of stock held by mr. icahn, who has been the company's biggest shareholder since 2013. doing so would also mean that he will give up five board seats held by his designees. the move, which will reduce mr. icahn's stake to 6 percent from 13 percent, caps an investment success few could have foreseen in late 2012, when the billionaire first poured money into herbalife. at the time, mr. icahn pushed back against a campaign by william a. ackman, the manager of the hedge fund pershing square capital management, who had prominently accused the company of being an illegal pyramid scheme on the verge of being shut down. mr. ackman shorted herbalife shares, wagering that their price would fall to zero, eventually pouring $1 billion into his bet. herbalife denied the accusations, and mr. icahn became one of several hedge fund managers to bet against mr. ackman. such was mr. icahn's conviction that he raised his stake in the company in 2013, becoming its largest shareholder and most vocal defender. the investment led to a memorable shouting match between mr. icahn and mr. ackman live on cnbc that devolved into a televised airing of grievances — and transfixed wall street traders. (the level of the debate's eloquence may have been encapsulated by mr. icahn likening his rival to a crybaby in the schoolyard. the two later buried the hatchet.) mr. ackman was forced to concede defeat in 2018, quietly closing out the last of his short position after a federal review of herbalife led to an enforcement action that fell far short of shutting down the company. mr. icahn, however, held onto his stake for years, selling his shares over time. it has proved to be profitable as well: the investor said in 2018 that he had collected a $1 billion return on his investment. in a statement late on sunday, mr. icahn said that the time for activism has passed at herbalife.\n\npeugeot and fiat chrysler to merge, creating the fourth-largest carmaker. a psa assembly line in slovakia last year. the merger with fiat chrysler automobiles is intended to help both companies make the transition to electric vehicles. credit... radovan stoklasa/reuters shareholders of fiat chrysler automobiles and psa, the french maker of peugeot, citroën and opel cars, voted on monday to merge as the companies try to survive a transition to electric vehicles. the new company, called stellantis, would be the world's fourth-largest carmaker based on vehicle sales during the first nine months of 2020 and would employ 400,000 people. executives of fiat chrysler and psa agreed to merge at the end of 2019 and have been working out the details and securing regulatory approval since then. but the new company faces major challenges. neither fiat chrysler nor psa has a strong presence in china, the world's largest car market, and they have been slow to introduce electric vehicles. both companies have been hard hit by the pandemic. psa's vehicle sales were down 30 percent in the 11 months through november, while fiat chrysler sold 30 percent fewer cars and trucks in the nine months through september, the most recent reporting period. the pandemic has made the rationale for the merger even more compelling, mr. elkann said. jack ewing and
istanbul — for 17 years, president recep tayyip erdogan won elections by offering voters a vision of restoring the glories of turkey's ottoman past. he extended his country's influence with increased trade and military deployments, and he raised living standards with years of unbroken economic growth.\n\nbut after a failed 2016 coup, mr. erdogan embarked on a sweeping crackdown. last year, the economy wobbled and the lira plunged soon after he won re-election with even greater powers. as cronyism and authoritarianism seep deeper into his administration, turks are voting differently — this time with their feet.\n\nthey are leaving the country in droves and taking talent and capital with them in a way that indicates a broad and alarming loss of confidence in mr. erdogan's vision, according to government statistics and analysts.\n\nin the last two to three years, not only have students and academics fled the country, but also entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and thousands of wealthy individuals who are selling everything and moving their families and their money abroad.
to make ballet contemporary again, modern music and modern sensibilities are needed. and lo! thursday night at new york city ballet brought two world premieres, entirely unalike, each to new music, each distinctly reflecting the world we inhabit today: the shimmering asphalt, choreographed by pontus lidberg to a commissioned score by david lang, and the times are racing, by justin peck (the company's resident choreographer since 2014) to recorded music by dan deacon. warm ovations greeted both.\n\ndeservedly. both are distinct, skilled, arresting. yet they're hard to grasp on a single viewing: more immediately striking as authoritative exercises in style than as absorbing worlds to inhabit. each is sophisticated; there's plenty of detail and structural complexity here to reward later visits. but are they as accomplished in substance as they are in manner? it's good that they remain in repertory into february and then return in may.\n\nmr. peck's the times are racing (24 minutes long) — an excitingly now piece in the way it catches the mood of 21st-century urban protest and the evening's biggest hit with the audience — is danced in sneakers; its dancers are otherwise dressed (by humberto leon) in a motley assortment of urban wear — shorts, jeans, raincoats, t-shirts — as well as a leotard or two. the dance style, with a strong emphasis on currents of motion through the upper body, informal posture and gesture, as well as sequences of tap, makes this work a young relation to such dances as jerome robbins's n.y. export: opus jazz and a number of early pieces by twyla tharp (deuce coupe and ocean's motion, for example).
To the Editor:\n\nRe Iowa Drive Is Opening Battle for School Choice (front page, March 22): The use of tax funds to support religious schools raises a constitutional issue, but more than that a question of fairness.\n\nAfter all, we all pay taxes. Is it fair for Protestants, Jews, Muslims and atheists to pay for religious instruction in Catholic schools? Or for Catholics to pay for Protestant instruction?\n\nThere is a reason the Constitution separates church and state, and not only to prevent state-sponsored religious indoctrination, but also to require that taxes should be religiously neutral.\n\nThe Constitution is a remarkable document, of which some parts remain opaque and in need of constant interpretation, but the question of fair use of tax dollars is profoundly clear.
American arts institutions ought not to give up their independence for crumbs. For now, especially as the pandemic subsides, the more urgent task is to encourage a richer cultural offering at the local level. A nimbler and more practicable solution to do that is with a White House Office for Culture, akin to the National Economic Council or the Domestic Policy Council, that could research and coordinate arts policy across the federal government.\n\nAn arts center inside the executive office of the president — led, why not, by a Dr. Fauci of culture — could be sharper and swifter than a full department. This team could help Treasury create cultural tax policy, advise the Education Department on music instruction, liaise with Congress on arts stimulus. Importantly, it could ensure that stimulus funds for states and municipalities, whose budgets have been pitted by shutdown-induced tax shortfalls, shore up and eventually strengthen local arts organizations. (Almost no one has been hurt more by Covid than our artists, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York this week, when he announced a public-private partnership supporting the state's arts organizations.)\n\nThe new administration should also re-establish the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, whose members resigned en masse in 2017 after Mr. Trump's response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. (The artists who resigned included the director George C. Wolfe, the author Jhumpa Lahiri, the actor Kal Penn and the architect Thom Mayne.) To use a metaphor I detest but politicians seem to like, this committee should be the sizzle to the steak that is the Office for Culture. Any transformation this large needs a sales pitch; well-known actors, writers and musicians should be the pitchmen, linking Broadway and Hollywood to the town library and the school theater.\n\nDuring last year's campaign, Mr. Biden had a phrase he invoked with almost musical regularity: the election, he always said, was a battle for the soul of America. As a piece of political rhetoric, it might have been just a platitude. How can I deny, though, that the near-sacking of the Capitol — in a week when, for the first time, the daily death toll from Covid-19 reached an unendurable 4,000 Americans — indicates that the United States has undergone, these last years, a kind of soul-death? And if you were treating a patient whose soul had curdled, what sort of medicine might you prescribe?\n\nI've always been wary of arguments about art's necessity. But a soul-sick nation is not likely to recover if it loses fundamental parts of its humanity. Without actors and dancers and musicians and artists, a society will indeed have lost something necessary — for these citizens, these workers, are the technicians of a social catharsis that cannot come soon enough. A respiratory virus and an insurrection have, in their own ways, taken the country's breath away. Artists, if they are still with us in the years ahead, can teach us to exhale.
It's time to see the numbers.\n\nInvestors are about to get a read on the health of corporate America, as businesses begin releasing quarterly profit reports and laying out expectations for the coming year.\n\nThe results may resolve a roaring debate on Wall Street that has pitted economists, who have argued that the economy remains healthy, against investors, who pushed stocks to the brink of a bear market over concerns that growth is waning.\n\nAs we hear from more companies about how the year ended, we'll get more color on which side has a better feel, the economics community or the equity community, said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nOn the whole, the numbers are expected to be solid. Analysts estimate that, when all the results are in for S&P 500 companies, fourth-quarter profits will have risen 15 percent over a year earlier. That would be the fifth-straight period of double-digit profit growth, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
How did we get into this sorry situation? A meltdown of this magnitude typically has many causes. In this case, the president's inability to reach some sort of deal rests heavily on several basic failures of understanding by him and his team. These include:\n\n1. A failure to grasp how divided government works. The president somehow came to believe that he'd have more leverage once the Democrats took control of the House. Maybe someone convinced him that, after the transfer of power, he could shift blame for the impasse onto Speaker Nancy Pelosi — a favorite villain of Republicans. Or maybe he assumed that Pelosi & Company would fold in the face of the dysfunction and public outcry a shutdown would bring. Whatever the logic, Team Trump assumed Democrats would b ecome more pliable , and a deal would emerge.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Trump has been spoiled by two years of Congress being led by weak-kneed members of his party who, even when troubled by his excesses, largely let him run amok, lest he call down upon them the wrath of the Republican base.\n\nBut for their part, Ms. Pelosi and her new majority are concerned about presenting a united front against Mr. Trump's challenges to constitutional authority. With the president's wall having become a flash point, the political costs to Democrats for cutting a deal seen as advantageous to Mr. Trump would be steep.\n\n2. A failure to understand the costs of playing only to the base. While Republican lawmakers may be awed by Mr. Trump's command of their party's troops, Democrats are more motivated by the fact that the bulk of the electorate is tired of the president's divisive demagogy. Time and again, Mr. Trump has chosen partisanship over leadership, doing nothing to expand his appeal. This puts him at a disadvantage in wooing the public to his side of the wall debate.\n\n3. A failure to understand Nancy Pelosi. Apparently, Mr. Trump never got around to reading The Art of War, or at least not Sun Tzu's admonition to know your enemy. If he had, the president would have tried to develop at least a basic working relationship with Ms. Pelosi. The White House clearly assumed that, at some point — maybe after she secured the speaker's gavel — Ms. Pelosi would bend to Mr. Trump's will. But the speaker is not impressed with bluster. She is seldom cowed by political pressure from her own team, much less the opposing one. She plays the long game, and her will is as formidable as Mr. Trump's, possibly more so. One key difference: Ms. Pelosi knows how the legislative process works.
To the Editor:\n\nRe Our Democracy, Though Resilient, Isn't Unbreakable, by Susan D. Hyde and Elizabeth N. Saunders (Op-Ed, Dec. 16):\n\nYes, President Trump tried to break our democracy and turn the United States into an authoritarian state controlled by him. He failed — because of the safeguards the founding fathers built into the Constitution. The framers were fearful of a rogue tyrant abusing the power of the presidency, as Mr. Trump did over and over during his four years.\n\nWe can be grateful that Mr. Trump failed and will be gone in a few weeks. Mr. Trump may have weakened our democracy, but whether that weakening is fatal is up to us.\n\nWe now know that it is essential to harden the boundaries that future presidents must abide by and provide specific legal remedies when they fail to do so. We must require the release of tax returns before running for president and that the president's assets be placed in a blind trust during his or her presidency.\n\nThere must be laws that limit self-dealing, executive privilege, sale of presidential pardons, and claims of absolute immunity from investigation and prosecution.
Executives used to fear the activist investor.\n\nNow, there is an activist in the White House and many of those same executives have been making pilgrimages to Trump Tower and the White House, hoping their business plans don't get swept away by the changes made by the new president.\n\nPresident Trump was clear when he met with business leaders on Monday: Bring back domestic manufacturing jobs or face punishing tariffs and other penalties.\n\nOn the same day, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, effectively declaring an end to the era of multinational trade agreements. He said the decision would protect American workers, but some worry that such moves will allow China to fill the economic vacuum.\n\nAnother big issue that these companies are likely to face is how they use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump made job creation central to his campaign, but many chief executives want to use repatriated cash to do stock buybacks and make deals instead.
Mike Lowry, a former five-term Democratic member of Congress whose one term as governor of Washington State was tarnished by sexual harassment allegations, died on Monday. He was 78.\n\nHis family announced his death, from complications of a stroke, in a statement issued by Gov. Jay Inslee in Olympia, Wash.\n\nMr. Lowry was elected to the House from Washington's Seventh Congressional District, in the Seattle area, in 1978 and was easily re-elected four times.\n\nHe was a leading Democratic critic of President Ronald Reagan's economic policies, even when they were wildly popular. He also opposed the president's arms buildup and restrictions on abortion.
Our concern is the additional costs that are starting to pop up in the process, the mayor said on Tuesday while unveiling the city's $84.7 billion budget proposal. We put forward a proposal around 421-a, with very simple standards: Reduce exposure for taxpayers, and that means city taxpayers, because we have to pay the bill; more affordable housing; and, don't fund luxury housing. It was really simple.\n\nCity officials and developers have argued that the construction of rental buildings would halt without 421-a benefits. The number of permits taken out by developers soared in the first half of 2015, in anticipation of the program's expiration.\n\nThe number of permits plummeted in the first half of 2016, but recovered some in the second half, leading some low-income housing advocates to suggest scrapping 421-a, because it is too costly and does not focus enough on the poor tenants who need it most.\n\nBut, Mark Willis, a research fellow at New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, said that property tax exemptions are essential to development of mid-rise housing in areas with moderate- to low-market rents. If fewer mixed-income units were built, he said, it could only intensify our current affordable housing crisis.\n\nUnder the governor's proposal, developers who set aside 25 to 30 percent of a project's apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants, can get a full property tax exemption for 35 years, compared with less generous subsidies in either the 2015 legislation or the mayor's proposal.
One of his targets is the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Kathleen Kraninger, whom Mr. Brown said he had advised during a phone call to resign. A bureau spokeswoman said that the two had last spoken on Dec. 10 and that Mr. Brown had thanked Ms. Kraninger for keeping him informed of the bureau's actions and rationale. Ms. Kraninger, the spokeswoman said, informed Senator Brown that she was supporting the requests from the transition team and how she would continue to carry out the bureau's mission.\n\nMr. Brown's staff, the senator said, is also compiling a list of rules made final by Trump appointees, including Ms. Kraninger, so Democrats could try to scrap them using the Congressional Review Act, a law that lets Congress vote to reverse regulators' actions.\n\nMr. Brown, who was elected to his third term in 2018, said the committee's first order of business would be to use congressional action to keep landlords from evicting people who could not pay their rent because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on their finances. He said Democrats wanted to provide additional pandemic relief and work quickly to confirm President-elect Joseph R. Biden's nominees — all while an impeachment trial of President Trump could be playing out.\n\nIn the longer term, Mr. Brown said, he wants to get the Federal Reserve to set up bank accounts for members of the public who don't have accounts at commercial banks. The so-called public option would allow users to cash paychecks and receive government benefits, such as refunds from a new child tax credit that he and other Senate Democrats have proposed.\n\nBig banks have long resisted the idea of a public alternative to their services and have explored ways to pre-empt the creation of such a system. Early last year, for example, JPMorgan Chase officials discussed placing the company's banking services like A.T.M.s in some post offices, although the plan was abandoned when the pandemic hit. Bank lobbyists have argued that the responsibilities of financial services would overwhelm public institutions like the Postal Service and that banks can carry out the duties more efficiently themselves.\n\nBut millions of people still do not have access to any kind of bank account, and Mr. Brown said the fees they paid for check-cashing services and payday loans were the kinds of expenses that kept them at the lowest levels of America's economic strata.\n\nTo help remove that burden, Mr. Brown called for a 36 percent cap on interest rates for payday loans. At the moment, rate caps vary by state.\n\nMr. Brown has already raised some of his agenda with his Republican colleagues. He said he and Mr. Toomey had taken advantage of an unexpected opportunity to discuss the committee's future: They put their heads together last Wednesday, while both were locked for hours in a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol.
After enduring years of street noise in their apartment in Flushing, Queens, Devanivas Gandham, 58, and his wife, Wilma, 55, began looking for a quieter place several years ago. We saw many, many houses, Mr. Gandham said. And we didn't like anything. Then a cousin who lived in Valley Stream, on Long Island, alerted them to a promising listing.\n\nFrom visits, they knew that Valley Stream — a village in Nassau County, in the town of Hempstead — was neat, clean and safe, Mr. Gandham said, so they arranged to see the house. With six bedrooms and three baths, it was big enough to accommodate not just the couple, but also their grown children: their son, Christi, 32, and daughter, Sherleen, 29. (It's an Indian custom, Mr. Gandham said, for unmarried children to live with their parents.) They bought the house in 2015 for $514,000.\n\nTheir new home is convenient to all of the Gandhams' jobs. Mr. Gandham, an echocardiography technician, and his wife, a laboratory technician, work in Manhattan; their children, both physicians, work in Queens. But even better, Mr. Gandham said, life in Valley Stream eases our stress and strain — it's quiet, calm, secluded.\n\nChristopher and Kristen DeVoe, both 36, were also familiar with Valley Stream before buying their three-bedroom, one-bath ranch house for $305,000 in 2010. They had been living there with their son, Tyler, then 3, in a one-bedroom apartment in the house of Mr. DeVoe's grandmother when they learned they were expecting another child. We knew we needed a bigger place, Mr. DeVoe said. And Valley Stream was affordable.

But Poly Prep Country Day School, a private school in Brooklyn with more than $114 million in the bank, got a $5.83 million P.P.P. loan. Public schools in Washington, D.C., averaged $189,000 in federal funding. But a P.P.P. loan for $5.22 million went to the Sidwell Friends School, the Washington alma mater of Sasha and Malia Obama.\n\nThis week, as the federal government releases a second round of P.P.P. loans, watchdog groups are following the money. From its start, the $659 billion program, intended to help struggling mom-and-pop businesses and nonprofits cover their payrolls with loans backed by the Small Business Administration, has been troubled by complaints that the rich and connected had crowded out intended recipients.
I.R.S. Tries to Fix Millions of Misdirected Stimulus Payments This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of markets, business and the economy.\n\nThe I.R.S. is trying to redirect millions of stimulus payments that went to unused accounts. Some Americans who used tax preparation services have temporary accounts on file with the I.R.S. Credit... Eric Gay/Associated Press The Internal Revenue Service misdirected stimulus payments for an estimated 13 million accounts, but the agency on Friday said it is trying to redirect to the money to the proper place. If you're anticipating a stimulus payment that hasn't yet landed, continue to monitor your bank accounts — and your snail mail. The I.R.S. was taking immediate steps to get stimulus payments to the correct accounts, the agency said in a statement on Friday. Many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort, the IRS added. Here's what happened: Millions of payments were sent to temporary accounts, which are often set up by companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt when they prepare returns. They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. The accounts may then be closed or become inactive — but may remain linked to the taxpayer's I.R.S. records. Tax prep companies have said they're working with the I.R.S. to resolve the issue. TurboTax said affected customers can expect to receive direct deposits starting on Friday. You can check the status of your stimulus payment through the I.R.S.'s Get My Payment tool. If it says your payment was sent to an account you do not recognize, it's not necessarily an indication of fraud, the I.R.S. said. It might just mean you were linked to a temporary account, and you should continue to watch your bank account for a deposit. More than 100 million stimulus payments have already been deposited directly into recipients' accounts, the I.R.S. said. About 8 million payments will arrive in the mail on prepaid debit cards. By law, the I.R.S. said, it must issue the stimulus payments by Jan. 15. After that, those who are entitled to a payment but haven't received one must instead claim a credit on their 2020 returns.

A Ford Exposition SUV being assembled in Louisville, Kentucky. Credit... Nick Carey/Reuters Ford Motor said on Friday that it will idle a plant in Louisville, Ky., for one week beginning Monday because of a shortage of semiconductors that is causing disruptions in auto factories around the world. Ford's Louisville assembly plant operates two shifts a day, employs about 4,000 workers, and makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair sport-utility vehicles. The automaker said it would cancel a week of downtime scheduled for later in the year at the plant to leave its output unchanged for the year A second Ford plant in Louisville has not been affected by the semiconductor shortage. That plant makes the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Explorer S.U.V.s, and the company's F-series Super Duty pickup trucks. Volkswagen last month warned that the semiconductor shortage would likely cause production delays at its plants in China and elsewhere. Honda and Nissan have also been affected by the shortage, according to Nikkei, the Japanese news organization. General Motors said on Friday that it has not been affected by the shortage but is monitoring the matter closely. Semiconductors play an increasingly important role in cars, controlling engines, brakes, transmissions, driver displays and other systems. Earlier this year, when auto sales fell because of the coronavirus pandemic, semiconductor manufacturers shifted their production to chips used for consumer electronics, Volkswagen said last month. Auto sales have since rebounded, leading to shortages of automotive-grade semiconductors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo compete with Tesla, G.M. will promote its electric cars and adopt a new logo.

The company's reputation for innovation has helped build a following of customers, fans and investors. The stock market values Tesla at more the $800 billion, more than many large automakers combined. G.M. makes far more vehicles and is substantially more profitable but has a market value of around $60 billion. G.M. will use the tagline, Everyone in, and some of the company's ads will feature the author Malcolm Gladwell. G.M. is hoping the campaign will help spark a mass E.V. movement, said Deborah Wahl, the company's global chief marketing officer. G.M. has used its current square logo, which contains the letters GM against a blue background, for nearly 50 years. The new logo uses lowercase blue letters against a white square outlined by a blue border with rounded corners, designed to resemble an electrical outlet or plug. Our traditional logo is more severe, Ms. Wahl said. We felt a need to show the world a different aspect of what we are doing. G.M. plans to spend $27 billion over the next five years on new electric vehicles using a modular battery design that it is counting on to lower costs and make its cars and trucks more affordable and appealing. We really believe this is an inflection point for E.V.s, she said.\n\nMarkets continue to climb, shaking off a grim jobs report. By: Ella Koeze · Data delayed at least 15 minutes · Source: FactSet Financial markets continued to rally on Friday, fueled by bets that a Democrat-led government in Washington would robust fiscal stimulus and despite fresh evidence that the United States economy is backsliding as the pandemic surges. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, climbing further into record territory and bringing its gains for the week to 1.8 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7 percent higher, and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose slightly. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed with a gain of 2.4 percent, climbing to a level it last hit in 1990. Though Washington continues to focus on the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol building on Wednesday, the investing world is instead focused on the wave of spending that could come as Democrats assume leadership of the White House and both houses of Congress That enthusiasm also helped investors look past the Labor Department's report on December payrolls, which showed that U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs last month, the first drop since last spring. The weak report bolsters the argument that more economic stimulus is needed. Stocks dipped Friday afternoon, but they recovered after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he was targeting trillions of dollars in spending. We should be investing significant amounts of money right now, to grow the economy, he said. At the same time, few on Wall Street seem to think Democrats will prioritize tax increases, which had previously been seen as a potential risk of a Democratic sweep. Now you have the potential for more stimulus, even possibly an infrastructure spend, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at the investment management firm Invesco on Thursday. So, I think the stock market is enthused right now. And that enthusiasm is pretty strong. Gains continued in other financial markets too. Oil prices continued to rally, with West Texas Intermediate rising more than 3 percent to $52.52 a barrel. A surge earlier in the week, which came after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production, means oil prices rose more than 8 percent this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also continued to rise, reaching 1.11 percent on Thursday. The rise in yields most likely reflects expectations that the Treasury will be issuing large amounts of debt to finance renewed government spending. Kevin Granville and\n\nU.S. lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline since April. The already sputtering economic rebound went into reverse in December, as employers laid off workers amid rising coronavirus cases and waning government aid. U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said Friday. It was the first net decline in payrolls since last spring's mass layoffs, and though the December loss was nowhere near that scale, it represented a discouraging reversal for the once-promising recovery. The U.S. economy still has about 10 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic began. Job growth reversed for the first time since April Cumulative change in all jobs since before the pandemic By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The December losses were heavily concentrated in leisure and hospitality businesses, which have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. The industry cut nearly half a million jobs in December, while sectors less exposed to the pandemic continued to add workers. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7 percent, down sharply from its high of nearly 15 percent in April but still close to double the 3.5 percent rate in the same month a year earlier. We're losing ground again, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. Most notably, this is still very much a low-wage recession, and the losses were where we first saw them when the pandemic hit. Unemployment rate By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Hiring has slowed every month since June, and the economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020 as a whole, the first calendar-year decline since 2010 and the worst on a percentage basis since the aftermath of World War II. Congress last month passed a $900 billion relief package that will provide temporary support to households and businesses and could give a boost to the broader economy. And in the longer run, the arrival of coronavirus vaccines should allow the return of activity that has been suppressed by the pandemic. But the vaccine and the aid came too late to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth. We did have a pullback in the economy, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. If stimulus was passed earlier, maybe that could have been avoided.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJob losses can be traced to the virus surge, with restaurants and hotels hard hit. Why did job growth go into reverse? It's simple: the resurgent pandemic. As virus cases rose across the country in the fall, governors and mayors reimposed restrictions on businesses and consumers pulled back on activity. Job losses soon followed: Restaurants and bars cut 372,000 jobs in December. Hotels cut 24,000 more. Private schools and colleges cut more than 60,000. The leisure and hospitality industry was hit hard in December, while other sectors made small gains Cumulative change in jobs since before the pandemic, by industry By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics It's more pandemic-induced job loss, said Nick Bunker, head of North American research for the career site Indeed. It's a really vivid demonstration that the labor market can't bounce back in any sustainable form until the pandemic is under control. Industries less exposed to the virus, on the other hand, mostly kept hiring. Manufacturers added 38,000 jobs. Construction companies added 51,000. Even retailers, hit hard in the spring but able to adapt more readily, added 120,000. Mr. Bunker said the hiring in those areas was encouraging, suggesting that the economic damage was contained and potentially allowing for a faster rebound once the pandemic was under control. But the concentration of job losses also means that low-wage workers, many of them Black or Hispanic, are again bearing the brunt of the crisis. It's reinforcing the inequality that already happened a few months ago, Mr. Bunker said. It's just hitting the people who have already been hit pretty hard.
Fighting vaccine resistance with gift cards\n\nOne reason that the start to the U.S. vaccination campaign has been so sluggish is that health care workers — among the first to be eligible — have proved more reluctant to get the inoculation than expected.\n\nSome are concerned with the newness of the vaccines. Others are worried about potential side effects. And the failure to get the virus under control has eroded their trust in the groups now urging them to take the shot: the federal government, politicians and their employers.\n\nBut hospitals and nursing homes have been scarred by many thousands of Covid-19 deaths and are desperate to have their employees inoculated. And they're coming up with carrot-and-stick strategies that other organizations may mimic to handle vaccinations among reluctant employees.\n\nMy colleagues Rebecca Robbins, Sabrina Tavernise and Sharon Otterman found that some employers are offering rewards like cash bonuses, paid time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while in at least a few cases saying they will fire those who refuse.
No sooner was Jair Bolsonaro sworn in as president of Brazil on New Year's Day than he let loose a fountain of far-right decrees, undermining protections for the environment, indigenous land rights and the L.G.B.T. community, putting nongovernmental organizations under government monitoring and purging government contractors who do not share his ideology. This thrilled Donald Trump, who tweeted enthusiastically, Congratulations to President @JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech — the U.S.A. is with you!\n\nMr. Bolsonaro returned the love, tweeting back, Together, under God's protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!\n\nHis actions were a sad but not unexpected performance by Brazil's new leader, a onetime military officer whose 27 years in the Brazilian Congress were notable only for crude insults to women, sexual minorities and blacks. A good criminal is a dead criminal, he declared; he promised to send red outlaws to prison or exile; he dedicated his vote to impeach former president Dilma Rousseff to the military officer responsible for her torture under the former military dictatorship.\n\nNone of that seemed to matter to voters laboring under an economic collapse, a crime wave and a corruption scandal that undermined any faith in the political establishment. Mr. Bolsonaro's promise of change, any change, was enough to sweep him into office with 55 percent of the vote in October. The language of his inaugural address — I come before the nation today, a day in which the people have rid themselves of socialism, the inversion of values, statism and political correctness — was music to the ears of his reactionary base, investors and Mr. Trump, who shares his values and his bluster. The stock market soared to record highs and the Brazilian real strengthened against the dollar.
A HOUSE NEAR THE TAGUS RIVER IN LISBON\n\n$4.2 MILLION\n\nThis four-story house, which dates to the 19th century, is on 0.40 acre on the Rua da Junqueira, close to the riverside neighborhood of Belém in Lisbon, Portugal's capital. The house has 12 bedrooms and bathrooms, 10-foot ceilings, elaborate moldings and stonework, and an elevator. It is about five miles from the center of Lisbon, and eight miles from Lisbon's international airport.\n\nThe main entrance on the ground floor opens into a large foyer adorned with traditional Portuguese glazed tiles. The blue-and-white tile continues up the walls of the main staircase, which is made of stone. Directly off the foyer is a large office/library lined with floor-to-ceiling built-ins. Through an arched stone doorway are the service areas, including the laundry and kitchen. With stone floors and counters, the kitchen was built for use by servants and needs updating, said Paula Penim, the manager of the Oeiras Restelo office of Portugal Sotheby's International Realty.\n\nThe living areas are on the first floor. The main living room has a carved stone fireplace and two sets of glass transom doors that open into adjoining sitting rooms. A third set of doors leads to a spacious formal dining room with dark wood floors and French doors opening onto the yard. A butler's pantry off the dining room has a dumbwaiter to bring food from the kitchen below.\n\nTwo bedrooms, including the master with en-suite bath, are on the first floor. Five more bedrooms, two with their own bathrooms, are on the second floor. The remaining bedrooms are on the third floor, and were once servants' quarters.
And what happens once is likely to happen again. After this, there'll be pressure to get Facebook, Twitter and other companies to suppress other speech, such as fiery rhetoric against the police or oil companies or world trade authorities. People will demand: If you blocked A, why aren't you blocking B? Aren't you being hypocritical or discriminatory?\n\nConsider, too, that the app for Parler, a social network popular with Trump supporters, was removed on Saturday by Apple and Google from their app stores, and blocked by its hosting company, Amazon Web Services, because of concerns that some of Parler's users were inciting violence. Merely refusing to forbid certain speech, much of which is constitutionally protected, is now a basis for blacklisting.\n\nCompanies, moreover, are run by humans, subject to normal human failings. Mr. Trump's suspension may have been motivated by a sincere desire to resist efforts to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power, as Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, put it. But other politicians might be suspended because their policies are bad for corporate profits or contrary to the owners' political ideologies.\n\nIt's only human nature for people to think the worst of their adversaries' views — including by labeling them hate speech or fake news or incitement — while giving their allies the benefit of the doubt. And sometimes just the risk of suspension will pressure politicians to avoid taking positions a company dislikes.\n\nOf course, we shouldn't exaggerate the novelty of this. Newspapers and TV stations have long been able to decide which politicians to cover and which politicians' op-eds to publish.\n\nBut there are hundreds of newspapers throughout the nation and several major TV networks. Facebook and Twitter have no major rivals in their media niches. The public relies on them as matchless mechanisms for unfiltered communication, including politicians' communications with their constituents.\n\nWe also shouldn't overstate the danger of corporate power. Facebook and Twitter, unlike the government, can't send us to jail or tax us.
We sold less, but what we see is as soon as the confinement stops, there is a big increase of sales, Mr. Jottras said. That means people want to buy. They couldn't materially do it during the stay-at-home, but now they can do it, and we have a very, very big increase of sales after the second confinement.\n\nMr. Kraft said the market has performed much better than expected given the circumstances. Paris is still a seller's market, he said, provided prices are realistic. High-end properties in good condition, especially those with outdoor space, are in demand, while homes in need of renovation or in less desirable areas won't sell. In the end, our 2020 results will be equal to those of 2019 (a record year), and this despite 3 months of enforced inactivity during the lockdowns! he wrote in an email.\n\nWho Buys in Paris\n\nPierre-Alain Conil, a partner with Morel d'Arleux, a Paris notary firm, said he worked with many fewer foreign buyers in 2020 than in previous years, and close to none for pieds-à-terre. I know that some are still considering it for when the pandemic will be over because of how strong the market has proved to be, which makes it a very safe and conservative investment, he said.\n\nMr. Kraft saw a similar trend in Paris and throughout France. Normally, foreign buyers represent at least 50 percent of our clientele, he said. In 2020, this number was down to a mere 7 percent. The agency had many inquiries from abroad, but only a few international buyers have pulled the trigger due to the inability to visit properties in person.
The answer, I'd suggest, goes beyond the fact that children can't vote, while seniors can and do. There has also been a poisonous interaction between racial antagonism and bad social analysis.\n\nThese days, political support for programs that aid children is surely hurt by the fact that less than half the population under 15 is non-Hispanic white. But even before immigration transformed America's ethnic landscape, there was a widespread perception that programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children basically helped Those People — you know, the bums on welfare, the welfare queens driving Cadillacs.\n\nThis perception undermined support for spending on children. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families was creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind social collapse in America's inner cities. Partly in response, aid to families, such as it was, increasingly came with work requirements, or took the form of things like the earned-income tax credit, which is linked to earnings.\n\nThe result was a decline in assistance for the poor children who needed it most.\n\nAt this point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were all wrong. The sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social dysfunction in big cities was caused, not by culture, but by the disappearance of good jobs. And he has been vindicated by what happened to much of the American heartland, which suffered a similar disappearance of good jobs and a similar surge in social dysfunction.\n\nWhat this means is that we've established a basically vicious system under which children can't get the help they need unless their parents find jobs that don't exist. And a growing body of evidence says that this system is destructive as well as cruel.\n\nMultiple studies have found that safety-net programs for children have big long-term consequences. Children who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become healthier, more productive adults. And in addition to the humanitarian side of these benefits, there's a monetary payoff: Healthier adults are less likely to need public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes.\n\nIt's probably too much to claim that helping children pays for itself. But it surely comes a lot closer to doing so than tax cuts for the rich.
There are also smaller-bore projects, some of which the governor has already debuted: On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said he wanted the High Line — a pedestrian walkway in Manhattan on a former elevated train track — extended to connect to the newly opened Moynihan Train Hall, a project that he hoped would spur development in the surrounding neighborhoods, already some of the city's richest.\n\nThe governor's address comes two years after Democrats retook full control of state government in 2019, when the Legislature had one of the most productive sessions in recent memory, passing a flurry of progressive priorities that had long been stymied by Republicans who controlled the State Senate. By contrast, many of the objectives Mr. Cuomo unveiled last year were derailed or overshadowed by the response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis year, the governor's arguably two most popular proposals — the legalization of pot and mobile sports betting — will require resolving disagreements with legislative leaders over how best to implement them.\n\nLegalizing recreational marijuana, for example, is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity and about $300 million in tax revenue in its first year, but legalization efforts have previously fallen apart following disputes over who should get licenses and how to spend the tax money. And marijuana tax dollars would not immediately solve the state's budget crisis; much of the money wouldn't materialize until years down the road.\n\nMr. Cuomo long opposed legalization — he described weed as a gateway drug just a few years ago — but his position evolved in 2018 as neighboring states spearheaded similar efforts and Mr. Cuomo faced a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, a progressive who made marijuana legalization a tenet of her campaign.\n\nCoronavirus may change financial and political calculations about many issues: Since last March, no state has had more deaths than New York, with more than 39,000.\n\nThe governor is now trying to remedy a sluggish vaccine rollout in New York, which has seen sharp increases in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths during the worst period yet in the coronavirus crisis. Mr. Cuomo has harshly criticized the federal response and said his own government's vaccine plan is being hamstrung by the limited supply of vaccine to the states.
The trade deficit figures could strengthen the resolve of Mr. Trump's trade advisers, including Mr. Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who want the United States to take a more aggressive stance on trade and are urging tougher action on trading partners that export more to the United States than they import, like China, Mexico and South Korea.\n\nAfter rolling out trade actions on washing machines and solar panels that were nominally aimed at China, the administration is considering sweeping action to protect American intellectual property from Chinese incursions. American negotiators are working to rewrite trade pacts with Mexico and South Korea, in large part because these countries run large bilateral trade surpluses with the United States.\n\nSome left-leaning groups that support the president's promises to end offshoring embraced the view that the administration's trade policies simply haven't gone far enough.\n\nThe same trade policy that Trump attacks ferociously and promised to speedily replace is still in place, said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. It's not surprising that the deficit is up because in year one there has been a wide gulf between Trump's fiery trade rhetoric and action.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's frequent promises to reduce the trade deficit, many economists believe that his trade policies will be largely powerless to reverse the trend. That's because the overall trade deficit is governed by macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. So while changes in trade policy can shift imports and exports from one country to another, for example, reducing the American trade deficit with China while increasing its trade deficit with Thailand, they are unlikely to reduce the American trade deficit overall.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump's signature economic policy so far — the $1.5 trillion tax cut — is likely to widen the trade deficit in coming years by encouraging more investment in the United States, many economists say.
A FOUR-BEDROOM GARDEN HOUSE IN SÃO PAULO\n\n$2.078 MILLION (6.5 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAIS)\n\nThis four-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath house is in Cidade Jardim, an upscale neighborhood that borders the Pinheiros River and is about five miles southwest of the financial district of São Paulo, Brazil's most populous city.\n\nThe two-level, 4,954-square-foot house, situated behind stone walls on 0.13 acre, is being sold fully furnished, said Luiza Cazarin, the international relations coordinator for the listing broker, Axpe Imóveis Especiais, an affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate. The home was built in 1970 and underwent an 18-month overhaul after the current owners bought it in 2012.\n\nThe owners, who are moving to Italy, opted for a contemporary aesthetic in the renovations, led by Vivian Calissi, a local interior designer. They used a mostly muted palette in the finishes and textured wall coverings, with bursts of color in the artwork and accessories, outfitting the spacious rooms with modern Italian furnishings.\n\nEntry is through two sets of doors, with a small garden in between. The main carved wooden doors open to a hallway. There is a lounge area with a piano that flows into the living and dining rooms, both of which have double-height ceilings. The living room has a wall of custom bookcases at one end and glass doors that open to a garden with a seating area. The whole house was designed so all the rooms had a view of some garden, Ms. Cazarin said.
The job of commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department has proved to be one of the most tenuous in the country.\n\nThe mayor this week selected Michael Harrison as the city's fifth police chief in four years, and asked him to try to solve a list of persistent problems that chased most of the others from the job. Among the tasks: Reducing one of the nation's highest murder rates; building trust among residents who widely view the department as racist, corrupt and indifferent; and earning the support of rank-and-file officers.\n\nAnd lately, doing all of this under a federal court order intended to curb the department's long history of abusive and discriminatory practices.\n\nIf that were not enough, perceived success has often boiled down to one yardstick — the tally of murders and other violent crimes — whose roots, many experts say, lie to a large extent in a stew of deeper problems beyond the reach of a police chief.
WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to unveil on Tuesday a $4.1 trillion budget for 2018 that would cut deeply into programs for the poor, from health care and food stamps to student loans and disability payments, laying out an austere vision for reordering the nation's priorities.\n\nThe document, grandly titled A New Foundation for American Greatness, encapsulates much of the America first message that powered Mr. Trump's campaign. It calls for an increase in military spending of 10 percent and spending more than $2.6 billion for border security — including $1.6 billion to begin work on a wall on the border with Mexico — as well as huge tax reductions and an improbable promise of 3 percent economic growth.\n\nThe wildly optimistic projections balance Mr. Trump's budget, at least on paper, even though the proposal makes no changes to Social Security's retirement program or Medicare, the two largest drivers of the nation's debt.\n\nTo compensate, the package contains deep cuts in entitlement programs that would hit hardest many of the economically strained voters who propelled the president into office. Over the next decade, it calls for slashing more than $800 billion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, while slicing $192 billion from nutritional assistance and $272 billion over all from welfare programs. And domestic programs outside of military and homeland security whose budgets are determined annually by Congress would also take a hit, their funding falling by $57 billion, or 10.6 percent.
NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi led his party to a landslide victory in India's largest state on Saturday, consolidating his power and putting him in a strong position to win re-election in 2019.\n\nThe scale of the victory in Uttar Pradesh's legislative elections was all the more stunning because it followed Mr. Modi's politically risky decision to eliminate most of India's cash. The vote was seen as a referendum on the prime minister, who campaigned vigorously in recent days in Uttar Pradesh, which, with a population of more than 200 million, would be the world's sixth largest country if it were independent.\n\nThis is a stupendous achievement, said Ashok Malik, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, based in New Delhi. Here you had a prime minister making himself the face of the election in the absence of a local leader and stitching together a coalition across the state.\n\nThe margin of victory in Uttar Pradesh was the largest seen by any party in more than 30 years. It gives Mr. Modi a significant advantage in the national elections in 2019, which in turn would bring him closer to his long-term goal of becoming a leader of historic significance, steering India away from its more socialist, secular past.
With both Democratic candidates in the lead in Georgia, the Nasdaq composite index opened around 1 percent lower on Wednesday on expectations that technology companies could be hurt by higher corporate taxes and stricter antitrust scrutiny.\n\nWall Street's investors see Democratic control of the Senate as leading to a large amount of deficit spending in the early days of the Biden administration, a potential boon to the still-struggling American economy.\n\nWe have to expect fiscal policy to be looser than if Republicans had kept their majority, wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a research note. That could mean higher inflation, he added, which could be why U.S. Treasury bonds also saw selling pressure on Wednesday. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed above 1 percent for the first time since March.\n\nThe effect on stocks is more mixed, with diversified indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 flat or up as the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank. Companies whose fortunes are linked closely to the overall economy would benefit from a bigger stimulus and infrastructure spending. Efforts to accelerate vaccination programs would also help industries that rely on in-person interactions get back in business.
The president of Mauritius, who was accused of using a credit card issued by a charity to buy clothes and jewelry worth tens of thousands of dollars, will step down, the prime minister announced on Friday.\n\nPrime Minister Pravind Jugnauth told reporters that Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, the first female president of the island nation off the east coast of Africa, would resign after Monday, when the country marks its 50th anniversary.\n\nThe president of the republic told me that she would resign from office and we agreed on the date of her departure, Mr. Jugnauth said in Port Louis, the capital, according to the BBC.\n\nHe did not provide the exact date of her departure, but he said her resignation would take place before Parliament returns at the end of the month.
ALBANY — From Hudson Valley trains to Nassau County bus shelters and Coney Island subways, Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, seemed to have an answer Thursday for every question at a hearing over the authority's part of the proposed state budget.\n\nMore than two dozen senators and Assembly members from districts served by the agency got a chance to ask Mr. Lhota about the needs and problems of their particular districts.\n\nThe volley of questions highlighted an almost endemic frustration with the agency, which oversees an octopus-like transit network that includes not just city buses and subways but also the Long Island and Metro-North railroads, making clear that its problems go far beyond the city's crumbling subway system.\n\nTo most queries, Mr. Lhota indicated that help or a more detailed response was on the way.\n\nThe nearly five hours of questioning, during which Mr. Lhota was joined by other M.T.A. officials, came as the authority is facing questions about its performance, about several high-profile accidents and about claims of deceptive practices. In addition, the agency has been caught in the middle of a public feud between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over how New York City Transit should be funded and improved.
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Four weeks before delegates meet to elect the next president of the United States Soccer Federation, Eric Wynalda was in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday to address the state of soccer in a town hall before about 100 angry fans of the local Major League Soccer team.\n\nIt was unlikely that anybody in attendance had a vote in the election, but that did not matter to Wynalda. In a crowded field of eight candidates, Wynalda, 48, has positioned himself as the voice of the frustrated American soccer fan, a surging demographic since the men's national team failed to qualify for this summer's World Cup. But in that populist role, he has challenged the very pillars upon which soccer in this country has been painstakingly built over the past three decades.\n\nHis candidacy has been called Trump-like. Wynalda rejects the label, but he also has spent months eviscerating the very organization he hopes to soon lead, and he has insisted that he alone has the skills to run an organization with more than $125 million in annual revenues most effectively, even though he spent part of the last decade warding off creditors during a period of personal financial turbulence revealed by public records and not previously reported.\n\nExcept for having a bit of a temper — Wynalda was shown a red card in his first World Cup game — his soccer credentials are unimpeachable. Wynalda played in three World Cups, and for professional teams in Germany's Bundesliga and Major League Soccer, before he became television analyst and lower-division manager.

Sign up here.\n\nAirbnb moves beyond shareholders\n\nBrian Chesky, Airbnb's co-founder and C.E.O., spoke exclusively to Andrew last night about the company's announcement today that it will think about all stakeholders when it comes to corporate governance, not just investors.\n\nThe move is Mr. Chesky's take on the Business Roundtable's recommendations last year that companies consider employees, the environment and more in their business decisions.\n\n• Airbnb is planning to hold a Stakeholder Day. It would be like a traditional annual shareholder meeting — except that everyone from customers to hosts to employees and others will be invited.\n\n• It will also change its compensation program, with factors important to stakeholders like progress on guest safety taken into account when bonuses are calculated.
Punishing tariffs on European steel and aluminum remain in place. The administration continues to dangle the threat of duties on European cars, which would be economically devastating for the Continent. Europeans are deeply alarmed by what they regard as the president's recklessness in the Middle East.\n\nThe current state of E.U.-U.S. relations isn't good, and I don't think it's likely to get better anytime soon, said Peter Chase, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Brussels.\n\nMr. Hogan brings a different set of skills than Cecilia Malmstrom, whom he succeeded as the European Union's top trade official at the beginning of December. Some in Brussels think his rawer style will make him a better match for the current occupant of the White House.\n\nMr. Hogan recently said, for example, that by leaving the European Union, the British people were trading in a Rolls-Royce for a used sedan. The statement was seen as particularly cheeky coming from an Irishman who will also be responsible for negotiating a trade deal with Britain as part of its withdrawal from the European Union, a herculean task.\n\nHe is more direct, said Luisa Santos, the director for international relations at BusinessEurope, an industry group. Gender may also play a role, Ms. Santos said. There is a widespread perception in Washington and Brussels that Trump officials were not comfortable with Ms. Malmstrom, an assertive Swede.

Now, on with the show.\n\nCarlos Ghosn's escape committee\n\nThe former head of Nissan and Renault managed to evade 24-hour surveillance in Tokyo and spirit himself out of Japan to Lebanon. How he did it increasingly sounds like a movie-level caper.\n\nAssociates planned the heist for months, the FT reports, citing unnamed sources. They hired private security operatives who worked in multiple countries.\n\nMr. Ghosn made it onto a private plane bound for Turkey and arrived in Lebanon early Monday, the WSJ adds. (A Lebanese news media outlet claimed that he had hidden in a box meant for musical equipment; the world's tabloids, perhaps with an eye on that movie version, reckon it must have been a double bass case.) He entered Lebanon on a French passport.
Badly.\n\nI am nowhere near as smart as my father. But now, like him, I find I have free time during the day because I realize I've got enough money stashed away to be able to cut back on my workload.\n\nAnd because I like business and finance, I find myself spending more time paying attention to what is going on in the market. I will see or read something intriguing about the transportation industry, for example, and say to myself, I wonder if I should buy X. And then there will be a feature on an up-and-coming online retailer and I'll go: I should keep an eye on it and maybe buy on a dip.\n\nThen I will think of my father's impulsive approach to investing and realize I'm on the verge of following in his footsteps, so I stop and remind myself how I developed my own self-taught approach to investing, and that I have already have in place a plan to prevent myself from trading too often.\n\nI started in my late 20s, when I had a little bit of money (and no children). I didn't know enough to pick individual stocks, so I figured mutual funds were the way to go. In researching what to buy, I was stunned to learn that most actively managed mutual funds never beat the benchmark that they were being judged against, a reality that remains true today.\n\nWhat that meant was if I could just match the benchmark — mainly, the S&P 500 — I would be ahead of the majority of investors who were listening to the underperforming professional advisers. I became a firm believer in what was then, in the early 1980s, a relatively new idea — index funds. I remain a huge fan.
But Mr. Pence said the White House was bargaining in good faith. The administration has now provided Democrats details they were seeking about how any border security money would be spent, and officials have incorporated at least one Democratic idea, to allow migrant children seeking asylum to apply in their home countries rather than make a treacherous journey to the United States border.\n\nThe question I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating? Mr. Pence said.\n\nThe administration's credibility continues to suffer, as Democrats call out Mr. Trump for falsehoods about the crisis, such as his assertion that former presidents had told him privately that they should have built the wall. On Monday, former President Jimmy Carter joined the list of presidents who said they had never discussed a border wall with Mr. Trump.\n\nWith talks to end the shutdown at a standstill, Mr. Pence said the president had directed the Office of Management and Budget to take steps to mitigate its effects, including an order to the Internal Revenue Service to issue tax refunds. Under previous shutdown plans — and interpretations of federal law — the I.R.S. was prohibited from dispensing tax refunds when Congress had not approved money to fund the Treasury Department, as is the case now.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats tried to use leverage of their own to force Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to come to the table and pressure Mr. Trump. On Monday, Democrats said they would vote against advancing a package of bipartisan Middle East policy bills slated for consideration this week unless Republicans allowed a vote on bills to reopen shuttered federal departments already passed by the House — a decision that could scuttle its prospects if Democrats stick together.\n\nSenate Democrats did not indicate whether they are ready to block other bills, but their position raised the prospect that a significant portion of the chamber's work could halt until the Senate gets to vote to reopen the parts of the government now closed.\n\nThe House, under Ms. Pelosi, passed a package of bills on Thursday, the day Democrats took control of the chamber, to reopen the one-quarter of the government without funding Mr. Trump's wall. But Mr. McConnell has refused to consider them, insisting that he will not bring up any legislation that does not have Mr. Trump's explicit support.
A few years ago, when I was self-employed and had recently had my second child, my husband went combing through my credit card statements, looking for tax deductions that I'd missed. I'm financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, I was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. So it's not surprising that I hadn't noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.\n\nIt turned out I'd been signed up for a dubious program that purported to protect users' credit in certain emergency situations. My bank had been accused of fraudulent practices in connection with it and fined $700 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency that was Senator Elizabeth Warren's brainchild. I tried, maddeningly, to seek redress from the bank — cycling through phone trees, screaming at automated operators. No one could tell me how I'd been enrolled in the program, or for how long.\n\nEventually, I turned to the C.F.P.B. itself, filling out a simple form on its website. A few weeks later, I was notified that the bank had been deducting money from my account for years, and I was being refunded more than $11,000. Having financed my own maternity leave, I badly needed the money.\n\n[Listen to The Argument podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]
The minimum wage in New Jersey is currently $8.85, and raising it to $15 would boost the incomes of more than 1 million people in the state, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning research group. The bill proposes increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour on July 1. On Jan. 1, it would increase to $11 an hour, and then would increase by $1 an hour every year until it reaches $15 in 2024.\n\nNo one working a full-time job should ever live in poverty, Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said in a statement. Putting the minimum wage on a clear and responsible path to $15 an hour is good for workers, good for our businesses and good for our economy. A higher minimum wage strengthens all of New Jersey.\n\nThe announcement of an agreement between Mr. Murphy, Stephen M. Sweeney, the senate president, and Craig Coughlin, the speaker of the assembly, amounts to a fait accompli; both Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Coughlin had said they would not introduce a bill unless it could pass and Mr. Murphy would sign it. With Democrats in control of both houses of the legislature, passing the bill will be a formality.\n\nThe agreement also marks a major political victory for Mr. Murphy, who made raising the minimum wage and legalizing marijuana central promises during his run for governor. Though he said during his campaign that he wanted to raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2021, the governor said he was willing to negotiate with legislative leaders to get it passed early this year.\n\nThe bill includes some exceptions: For seasonal workers and employees at small businesses who employ five workers or less, the base minimum wage would reach $15 an hour by 2026. For farmworkers, the base minimum wage would increase to $12.50 an hour by Jan. 1, 2024. Then, a special committee would review whether to raise those workers' minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Q: In the 1980s, when our children were very young, my husband and I left Park Slope, Brooklyn, for Levittown to raise our family, even though neither of us were from Long Island. Our children are now grown and have moved back to the city, where we visit them frequently. We're interested in moving back to Brooklyn, but we're torn. We're in our early 60s, so how would we adjust to being renters again? Or to owning an apartment rather than a house? I'd miss having a backyard and my husband likes coming home to the suburbs. When do we know it's time to move?\n\nA: Sometimes, the decision to move is made for you: New love combines two homes. A job leads you to a new city. A baby demands more space. It's harder when the choice is all yours.\n\nRight now, you need more information about what you want and what's available. Talk to a financial adviser about your long term goals and how selling your house and buying a new one could impact them. Talk to local real estate brokers and ask them to evaluate your home and its listing price. How quickly are homes are selling near you, and for what prices?

A RENOVATED CASTLE NEAR GLASGOW\n\n$1.8 MILLION (1.275 MILLION POUNDS)\n\nThis refurbished country house, known as Duchray Castle, sits on about 80 acres of woodlands in Queen Elizabeth Forest Park, about 36 miles from central Glasgow. The oldest part of the stone castle dates to the 16th century, said Chris Hall, director of rural and professional services for Rettie & Co., which has the listing. The castle has four bedrooms and four full and one half bathrooms, as well as a separate two-bedroom annex.\n\nThe main entrance is through a corner tower, which opens into a large dining room with wood floors, a fireplace and an unusual barrel-vaulted stone ceiling. The Gothic arched windows, set within alcoves, are typical of those throughout the house.\n\nA hallway from the dining room leads to the family room, which has oak-beamed ceilings, an exposed stone wall and a fireplace. The adjoining eat-in kitchen has a flagstone floor, gas range and a farmhouse-style sink. Also on the ground floor are a utility room with laundry hookups and a study with French doors opening onto a patio.\n\nOn the second level, accessible by two winding stone staircases, is a formal great hall with beamed ceilings, oak paneling and a large stone fireplace. There are also two bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom.
GHAZNI CITY, Afghanistan — What does it feel like to live in an Afghan city on the brink of falling to the Taliban?\n\nThe residents of Ghazni, a provincial capital of 280,000 about 110 miles south of the capital, Kabul, on a main highway, can hardly tell anymore who's in charge, and fear has become an everyday companion.\n\nWith the Taliban controlling some of the road network around Ghazni, citizens have long felt vulnerable. But during a recent visit, I kept hearing an even greater sense of defenselessness. Many here fear a full-on effort by the Taliban to seize the city could come at any time.\n\nNot content to merely control access to the city, the insurgents have begun attacking police posts within it. The Taliban methodically extort money — they say it is taxation — from businesses in the city center, including those near the government headquarters, and an increasing number of insurgents live openly in the city. Their fighters regularly kill officials, security personnel and even traffic police officers.
BAGHDAD — In the wholesale market of Jamila, near Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City neighborhood, a merchant, Hassan al-Mozani, was surrounded by towering piles of unsold 110-pound sacks of flour.\n\nNormally at a minimum I would sell 700 to 1,000 tons a month, he said. But since the crisis started we have only sold 170 to 200 tons.\n\nHis troubles are a ground-level indicator of what economists say is the biggest financial threat to Iraq since Saddam Hussein's time. Iraq is running out of money to pay its bills. That has created a financial crisis with the potential to destabilize the government — which was ousted a year ago after mass protests over corruption and unemployment — touch off fighting among armed groups, and empower Iraq's neighbor and longtime rival, Iran.\n\nIran in the past has taken the opportunity posed by a weak Iraqi central government to strengthen its political power and the role of its paramilitaries within Iraq.
DHAKA, Bangladesh — The sale of a used car is developing into an unusual criminal case and a potential diplomatic sore point between the United Nations and Bangladesh, whose government has frequently bristled at criticism from the international community.\n\nAt the heart of the case is an official named Stefan Priesner, an Austrian who headed the United Nations Development Program in Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012. When he left at the end of his tenure, Mr. Priesner sold his imported sport utility vehicle to a colleague.\n\nBut the customs police now say that he evaded $51,732 in taxes owed on the sale. The director general of the customs police, Moinul Khan, said on Thursday that the police were seeking authorization to charge Mr. Priesner with tax evasion and, because he received the proceeds through a foreign bank account, with money laundering.\n\nThe government's real grudge may be not with Mr. Priesner but with the United Nations and other international institutions. The program Mr. Priesner headed worked on electoral reform in Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won the 2014 election essentially by default after major opposition groups boycotted the vote. The next general election is scheduled for next year, and will probably be closely scrutinized.
As California Eases Vaccine Rules, Many Complain of Chaos President-elect Biden proposed a major spending package to combat the virus. Americans are dying in greater numbers, and the virus is not always to blame.\n\nCalifornia just made it easier for people to get vaccinated. For many, it feels harder than ever. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31. Most have received only the first of the two necessary doses so far. The confusion is hardly limited to California. In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach. California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work. California relies on county health departments like the one in Los Angeles to administer vaccines, and Dr. David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up coronavirus testing: too little manpower. Dr. Lubarsky suggested that the state should hand more vaccine doses over to health care providers, who already have the ability to reach out to patients selectively, including harder-to-reach patients like those with lower incomes or who are undocumented. We know who's at risk, he said. Jonah Frohlich, a San Francisco-based health care consultant, said that a combination of factors had left county public health departments scrambling to cope with a deluge of monumental tasks. The same institutions that are trying to manage testing, contact tracing and supports for people, Mr. Frohlich said, are the same people who are managing the distribution of the vaccine. Worse, he said, they must work with often outdated and overwhelmed information systems, and organize it all on the fly. This is the kind of program and process that should take years to implement, he said. The counties are doing the best they can, Mr. Frohlich said, but there is a real human cost to delaying the rollout of the vaccine.\n\n'The very health of our nation is at stake': Biden proposes a $1.9 trillion virus package. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaking in Delaware on Thursday. Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said. We have to act and we have to act now. Mr. Biden detailed his so-called American Rescue Plan in an evening speech in Delaware, effectively kicking off his presidency. The Biden package, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined. The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions community vaccination centers around the country. Mr. Biden also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the Covid-19 response while also rebuilding the nation's fragile public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing. At the same time, Mr. Biden is keen on addressing the racial disparities in health that have been exposed by the pandemic, which has disproportionately claimed the lives of people of color. He pledged to increase funding for community health centers, and also intends to fund efforts to mitigate the pandemic in prisons and jails, where African-Americans and Latinos are overrepresented.

Credit... Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who have battled with the Trump administration for more federal aid, have expressed optimism that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., together with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance. Indeed, just before Mr. de Blasio's expected announcement, the incoming Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said that he and Mr. Biden had reached a deal for the federal government to cover the full costs of state and city expenses related to a disaster declaration from last March, when the virus was first discovered in New York. The move is expected to save the state and city about $2 billion, money that Mr. Schumer's office said can be used to tackle Covid-related budget gaps. And on Thursday, Mr. Schumer was promising more to come. This is just prelude of better days ahead out of Washington for New York, he said. With Biden as president and me as majority leader, it's going to get better. Still, few expect the federal government to be able to fully meet the budgetary needs of state and local governments.

Kristian Thacker for The New York Times Several states in the American South have been the slowest in the country to roll out Covid-19 vaccines. Georgia has faced a raft of logistical and bureaucratic snags. In South Carolina, the governor gave reluctant health care workers until Friday to get their shots or risk losing their priority status. And Alabama has the distinction of administering the fewest vaccines per capita in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was a herculean effort, said Dr. Karen Landers, the assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Health. It has been a challenge. And, of course, it's disappointing that we're not where we need to be. Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier. South Carolina officials, too, have acknowledged disappointment. We are frustrated, Gov. Henry McMaster said last week, giving health care workers 10 days to get their vaccine appointments. And we are determined to eliminate the bottlenecks that are slowing this down. West Virginia, by contrast, has fared much better, administering the most vaccines per capita out of any state in the country. It began giving shots to people 80 and older a week ago and to people 70 and older on Wednesday. Teachers 50 and older are also getting vaccinated. In Alabama and Georgia, state officials say they have administered more vaccines than the numbers indicate. Officials in Georgia said part of the problem is the state's 20-year-old database. It is cumbersome and difficult for providers to quickly enter information about administered doses, said Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey, the commissioner of the state Department of Public Health. Some vaccine providers, particularly hospitals, also held back some of the state's limited supply, to ensure that booster shots would be available, Gov. Brian Kemp and officials from his administration said on Tuesday. They called that misguided. If this issue continues, the state will take possession of those doses and ensure that vaccinations continue, the governor said. If it takes me firing up my pickup truck and doing it myself, so be it. At first, Georgia also found a mismatch of vaccine supply and demand. Vaccines went to rural parts of the state where 60 to 70 percent of nursing home workers did not want them, Mr. Kemp said, leaving those areas flush with doses while demand crushed supply in urban areas. The governor said vaccinating all of Georgia's nursing home residents should be completed by the end of the month. But he also acknowledged that the state still has a long way to go. Many local health departments are being inundated with calls, Mr. Kemp said. Yes, the phone lines will be busy. Yes, the websites will certainly crash. There are simply vastly more Georgians that want the vaccine than can get it today.\n\nChina, after reporting a rare virus death, says its active caseload exceeds 1,000. A quarantine center under construction in Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people in northern China. Credit... Yang Shiyao/Xinhua, via Associated Press China's National Health Commission said on Friday that more than 1,000 people nationwide were being treated for Covid-19, a day after the country reported its first coronavirus death on the mainland since May. The commission said that 144 new cases had been recorded on Thursday, the highest daily figure since a series of new outbreaks began at the end of last year. Of 1,001 total patients in China, the commission said, 26 were reported to be in serious condition. While the toll remains far lower than in other countries, the surge is challenging the government's much-touted success in wresting the coronavirus under control. Hebei, the northern province surrounding Beijing that has been hardest hit in the latest surge, reported 90 more cases on Thursday. New outbreaks have also appeared in the central province of Shaanxi and in Guangxi, a southern province that borders Vietnam. The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns. More than 28 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — more than the number affected last January when the central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported. The National Health Commission reported that nine of the 144 cases recorded on Thursday involved people returning to China, but most of the new ones have spread domestically. In Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people where residents have been ordered to stay home since last week, the authorities have scrambled to build a large quarantine center in a rural district. The facility, which covers 82 acres, will ultimately have 3,000 trailer-like units, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

A nurse administering the Moderna vaccine in New York. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times People who received two shots of the Moderna Covid vaccine in its earliest, Phase 1 clinical trial are being offered a third shot, a so-called booster, as part of a continuing study to determine whether repeated vaccinations are needed, and whether they are safe and effective, the company said on Thursday. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen. But they have not been in use long enough to tell how long the immunity lasts, or whether additional booster shots will be needed. We anticipate that an additional dose could further boost the levels of neutralizing antibodies, should such a boost be required, and that this is expected to be an advantage of mRNA vaccines, Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said in a statement. Neutralizing antibodies are made by the immune system in response to a virus or a vaccine and can block the virus from breaking into cells. The company's statement said the boosters were being offered to participants six to 12 months after their second shot. Volunteers in early trials received different doses of the vaccine, as part of the company's attempts to calibrate the most effective amount of active ingredient to use. The Moderna vaccine was ultimately given an emergency green light from the Food and Drug Administration as a two-dose vaccine of 100 micrograms of mRNA each. Trial volunteers who got lower doses might especially benefit from a third shot, said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. In its statement, Moderna said that boosters might also be studied in people who took part in its later, Phase 3 study of 30,000 participants, if accumulating antibody persistence data indicate that this is warranted. Company officials said at a conference this week that they thought protection should last at least a year, according to a report by CNBC. But Moderna's chief executive, Stephane Bancel, also noted in an interview with CNBC that the vaccine might have to be adjusted in the future to immunize people against new coronavirus variants or strains, much like flu vaccines are regularly revamped.

Mr. Espaillat announced on Thursday he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Credit... Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, announced on Thursday he had tested positive for the coronavirus, as concerns continue to mount on Capitol Hill that efforts to corral lawmakers into secure locations during last week's siege by Trump supporters may have led to a super-spreader event. Mr. Espaillat, 66, who received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week, said he was not experiencing any symptoms and that he was isolating at home. In a statement, he said he understood that it took time for the vaccine to be fully effective and that he had continued to take all necessary precautions. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that people who test positive for the virus should isolate for at least 10 days after their symptoms start. The two vaccines cleared for emergency use in the United States, made by Pfizer and Moderna, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19. But neither vaccine is perfect, and researchers remain unsure of how well the shots curb the ability of the virus to silently infect people. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two injections, separated by three or four weeks, and they aren't believed to fully kick in until about a week or two after a person receives the second shot. Capitol Hill has long struggled to control the spread of the pandemic within its marble walls, a haphazard effort exacerbated last week as hundreds of maskless Trump supporters stormed the building and forced lawmakers to shelter in confined secure locations across the Capitol complex. Lawmakers, aides and reporters who took shelter in two separate rooms on both sides of the Capitol have been warned about possible exposure to the coronavirus. Though cases have continued to emerge since the 117th Congress was sworn in nearly two weeks ago, House Democrats have blamed a group of their Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks during the attack while waiting in a secure location for law enforcement to regain control of the building. Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, and Brad Schneider, Democrat of Illinois, have all tested positive in the aftermath of the attack and cited the Republican refusal to wear masks during the siege. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, is in isolation after her husband, who was with her in the room, tested positive, and in a statement said the diagnoses were a consequence of my callous Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks. In response to those accusations and concerns about the spread of the virus on Capitol Hill, the House earlier this week approved a fine system for members who refuse to adhere to a mask mandate on the floor. It was unclear whether Mr. Espaillat took shelter in the secure room. But on Wednesday, he was among the lawmakers who spoke on the House floor — while wearing a mask — before voting to impeach President Trump for the second time. Mr. Espaillat noted that the colleagues who had tested positive in recent days collectively occupy a range of gender, ages, races and ethnicities. Covid-19 does not discriminate, he said. It is incumbent on each of us to prioritize social distancing from one another — even if that poses a temporary inconvenience — and wear a face mask. There is no singular panacea and we must adjust our daily habits and practices for our own health and safety as well as the health and safety of those around us and throughout our communities.

Tech companies are working to create a digital version of the Covid-19 vaccination cards that are used to track vaccination timelines. Credit... Tim Gruber for The New York Times Airlines, workplaces and sports stadiums may soon require people to show their coronavirus vaccination status on their smartphones before they can enter. A coalition of leading technology companies, health organizations and nonprofits — including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Cerner, Epic Systems and the Mayo Clinic — said on Thursday that they were developing technology standards to enable people to obtain and share their immunization records through health passport apps. For some period of time, most all of us are going to have to demonstrate either negative Covid-19 testing or an up-to-date vaccination status to go about the normal routines of our lives, said Dr. Brad Perkins, the chief medical officer at the Commons Project Foundation, a nonprofit in Geneva that is a member of the vaccine credential initiative. That will happen, Dr. Perkins added, whether it's getting on an airplane and going to a different country, whether it's going to work, to school, to the grocery store, to live concerts or sporting events. Vaccine passport apps could fill a significant need for airlines, employers and other businesses. In the United States, the federal government has developed paper cards that remind people who receive coronavirus vaccinations of their vaccine manufacturer, batch number and date of inoculation. But there is no federal system that people can use to get easy access to their immunization records online and establish their vaccination status for work or travel. A few airlines, including United Airlines and JetBlue, are trying Common Pass, a health passport app from the Commons Project. The app enables passengers to retrieve their virus test results from their health providers and then gives them a confirmation code that allows them to board certain international flights. The vaccination credentialing system would work similarly. The U.S. vaccination program has been stymied by logistical hurdles as states scramble to set up new systems for booking appointments. Demand is high, but the rollout has been progressing far more slowly than hoped, marred by crashing servers, busy signals and confusion. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that about 11.1 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, far short of the goal federal officials set to give at least 20 million people their first shots before the end of 2020. At least 541,000 people in the United States have been fully vaccinated as of Jan. 12, according to a New York Times survey of all 50 states.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAzar acknowledges a top C.D.C. official was right in her February warning about mass disruption.

Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The U.S. secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, excoriated China on Thursday for its bullying of international experts and scientists and acknowledged for the first time that a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was correct when she warned in February that the novel coronavirus might cause a severe disruption to American lives. The official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was muzzled for nine months after issuing the Feb. 25 warning, which threw the stock market into a nosedive and infuriated President Trump, who was on his way back from India at the time. But she was merely repeating what she had learned from a White House Task Force meeting days earlier, Mr. Azar recalled. She got a little ahead of the briefing of the president and the official announcement, Mr. Azar said. But she and we were correct. Mr. Azar made his comments to the Heritage Foundation, during an online seminar that was billed as a talk about lessons learned from the pandemic. He spent much of it describing how China rebuffed offers of help from the United States — and thwarted American efforts to learn more about the virus that has now claimed more than 380,000 American lives. The United States got its first hint of the novel virus — a case of an unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 30, 2019 — from monitoring news reports and through a notification from Taiwan. While American officials tried various tacks to get them to cooperate — including praising China in public as they pressed them very hard and very firmly in private, they were unsuccessful, he said. Our teams were also pressing for the Chinese government to send us viral isolates from patients there. And China has still, one year later, failed to provide the first-generation viral isolates, Mr. Azar said, describing events in late January. It was not until Feb. 16, he said, that an international team including American experts was allowed into China to investigate. By this time, he said, Chinese intransigence meant that the window of opportunity had passed. Outbreaks had been seeded around the world. On Thursday, a team of experts from the World Health Organization finally arrived in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for the source of the coronavirus. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan. The investigation is a critical step in understanding how the virus jumped to humans from animals so that another pandemic can be avoided. Getting answers will most likely be difficult.

Ng Han Guan/Associated Press More than a year after a new coronavirus first emerged in China, a team of experts from the World Health Organization arrived on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for its source. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019. The investigation, which aims to gain an understanding into how the virus jumped to humans from animals, is a critical step so that another pandemic can be avoided. But getting answers is likely to be difficult. Here's what to know about the investigation. China set up hurdles and pushed for control. Apparently worried about drawing renewed attention to the country's early mistakes in handling the pandemic, Chinese officials have used a variety of tactics over the past year to hinder the W.H.O. investigation. After resisting demands from other countries that it allow independent investigators onto its soil to study the origin of the pathogen, China let two W.H.O. experts visit in July to lay the groundwork. They were not allowed to visit Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. For months, China delayed approving a visit by a full team of experts, frustrating the health agency's leaders. When the visit seemed to be finalized this month, it fell apart when Beijing declined to provide visas for the visitors, according to the health agency. Now that the investigators have arrived, critics say Beijing's desire for control means the inquiry will probably be more political than scientific. Tracing the virus will be a painstaking task. The team that has come to Wuhan will face a city radically transformed from when the virus first emerged, in late 2019. The city, which went into lockdown on Jan. 23 last year and became a symbol of the virus's devastation, has since been held up by Chinese officials as a success story in vanquishing the virus. The W.H.O. experts have decades of experience plumbing the depths of viruses, animal health and disease control. But tracing the source of the virus that as of Thursday had killed almost two million people worldwide and infected more than 92 million will be painstaking. While experts believe the virus originated naturally in animals, possibly bats, little else is known. How much access the team gets in China will be critical, public health experts say. The team will have to sidestep attempts to politicize its inquiry. The pandemic has hurt China's reputation, with many foreign governments still angry that Beijing did not do more to contain the crisis in its earliest stages. So Chinese propagandists are trying to use the W.H.O. inquiry to help shore up China's image and portray the country as a mature superpower. Complicating that effort could be new virus flare-ups in recent weeks that have prompted fresh lockdowns in China. In all, more than 22 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — double the number affected a year ago in Wuhan. On Thursday, China's National Health Commission reported a coronavirus death in the mainland for the first time since May. The major concern here is the origin of the outbreak has been so politicized, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. That has really narrowed the space for the W.H.O. to have an independent, objective and scientific investigation.\n\nStrict safeguards should protect schools from the virus variant, experts say. Students boarding a school bus after school let out at Eneida M. Hartner Elementary School in Miami, Fla., on Monday, Nov. 30, 2020. Credit... Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults. The report estimated that the new variant is about 30 percent to 50 percent more contagious than its predecessors — less than the 70 percent researchers had initially estimated, but high enough that the variant is expected to pummel the United States and other countries, as it did Britain. Adolescents and teenagers between ages 10 and 19 were more likely than younger children to spread the variant, but not as likely as adults. Over all, though, the variant was more contagious in each age group than previous versions of the virus. The mutant virus will result in more infections in children unless schools shore up their precautions, experts said. The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to do all he could to keep schools open. But he changed course in the face of soaring infections and buckling hospital systems, and ordered schools and colleges to move to remote learning. Other European countries put a premium on opening schools in September and have worked to keep them open, though the variant already has forced some to close. In the United States, the mutant virus has been spotted only in a handful of states but is expected to spread swiftly, becoming the predominant source of infections by March. If community prevalence rises to unmanageable levels — a likely proposition, given the surge in most states — even elementary schools may be forced to close. But that should be a last resort, after closures of indoor restaurants, bars, bowling alleys and malls, several experts said. I still say exactly what many people have said for the past few months — that schools should be the last thing to close, said Helen Jenkins, an infectious disease expert at Boston University. Keeping schools open carries some risk, but I think it can be reduced substantially with all the mitigations in place, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe U.K. bans travel from Latin America and Portugal, citing concern about a Brazilian variant.

Credit... Niklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Britain said on Thursday that it would ban arrivals from Latin American countries and Portugal over fears of a coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil. In recent weeks, British authorities have already struggled to contain the spread of a different coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is more contagious than its predecessors. At least two coronavirus variants are currently circulating in Brazil, and at least one has slipped its borders, traveling to Japan. Japanese authorities found one of those variants in four people traveling from Brazil earlier this week. The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely. The British ban is set to come into effect on Friday at 4 a.m., the transportation secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter. Travel from Portugal to the U.K. will also be suspended given its strong travel links with Brazil, Mr. Shapps added, although truck drivers transporting essential goods from Portugal will be exempted. Britain has already banned flights from South Africa. Brazil banned flights from Britain on Christmas Day. British authorities have come under criticism from opposition lawmakers for delaying a travel ban from Latin America, but they have argued that implementing such measures takes time, and that travelers coming from these countries had to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. United Kingdom Coronavirus Map and Case Count A detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths. What we need to ensure is that when we make these very, very important decisions that have a huge impact on people's personal lives, but also businesses, we have got to have a little bit of time, the Home Office junior minister Victoria Atkins said on Sky News. In the past week, Britain has faced some of its deadliest days since the beginning of the pandemic, and health authorities have warned that the country's health care system was on the brink of collapse. Authorities have warned that they may tighten nationwide lockdown measures if the public doesn't stay at home. Britain has reported nearly 85,000 deaths, the heaviest death toll in Europe.\n\nNursing-home workers are refusing vaccines. Employers are offering incentives. Health workers preparing vaccinations in Rockaway, N.J. Credit... Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Anxious about taking a new vaccine and scarred by a history of being mistreated, many frontline workers at hospitals and nursing homes are balking at being inoculated against the coronavirus. But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse. Officials at two large long-term care chains in the United States, Juniper Communities and Atria Senior Living, said they were requiring their workers, with limited exceptions, to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs. For us, this was not a tough decision, said Lynne Katzmann, Juniper's chief executive. Our goal is to do everything possible to protect our residents and our team members and their families. Critics say it is unethical to strong-arm low-paid workers into being vaccinated. This is a population of people who have been historically ignored, abused and mistreated, said Dr. Mike Wasserman, a geriatrician and former president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine. It is laziness on the part of anyone to force these folks to take a vaccine. I believe that we need to be putting all of our energy into respecting, honoring and valuing the work they do and educating them on the benefits to them and the folks they take care of in getting vaccinated. A survey of about 5,900 employees at Jackson Health System in Miami found that only half wanted to get a vaccine immediately, a hospital spokeswoman said. Others said they would consider it later. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said last month that roughly 60 percent of nursing home workers had declined vaccination. In New York City, at least 30 percent of health care workers said no to the shot in the first round, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday. Rebecca Robbins, Sabrina Tavernise and\n\nA top W.H.O. official in Europe urges tighter measures to stave off new coronavirus variants.

Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Europe has reached a tipping point as it grapples with the spread of new coronavirus variants, the World Health Organization's top official in the region said on Thursday, calling for tighter public health controls to slow their transmission. The new variants have been identified in 25 of the European region's 53 nations, Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.'s regional director, told a virtual news conference. We were prepared for challenging times in 2021, and it has been just that, he said. The region had 26 million confirmed coronavirus infections last year and more than 580,000 related deaths, he said, and in the past week alone recorded 1.8 million new cases. He said that the health authorities could not yet assess the full extent of a surge in infections resulting from increased social gatherings and relaxed precautions over the year-end holidays, because testing and reporting also dropped. But he said that the availability of vaccines offered hope for the months ahead. 2021 will be another year with the virus, but it will be more manageable and more predictable, Mr. Kluge said. As the year began, over 280 million people in Europe were living under national lockdowns, and several countries are set to add new measures in the hope of reducing new infections and easing the pressure on strained health facilities. In Switzerland, where the number of new Covid-19 infections has fallen in recent days, the authorities announced new restrictions that take effect next week because of the threat posed by the highly transmissible variants. Restrictions on businesses and social life in the country had been limited, and ski resorts have been allowed to remain open in a bid to minimize the impact on the economy. Switzerland is also keeping its schools open. But starting Monday, all shops selling nonessential goods will have to close, the limit on private gatherings has been cut to five people from 10, and the required closing of bars, restaurants, cultural centers and sports facilities has been extended until the end of February.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmericans are dying in greater numbers this year, and not just because of the virus. A casket sat in an empty room at a funeral home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Credit... Alex Welsh for The New York Times Deaths from all causes rose sharply during the second quarter of 2020 as the pandemic took hold in the United States, reaching levels last seen 75 years ago, according to provisional figures released on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics. Over all, the unadjusted death rate for all Americans rose to 1,033.7 per 100,000 in the second quarter of 2020, up from 850.8 per 100,000 Americans during the second quarter of 2019. The last time the death rate exceeded that figure was in 1945, the year World War II ended, when there were 1,058 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. Rates had steadily declined since then, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the center. The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop. The new figures also highlight the unique threat that Covid-19 poses to men. Men died of Covid-19 at far higher rates than women during the second quarter of last year, with 148.1 deaths per 100,000, compared to 124.6 per 100,000 for women. When the figures were adjusted to account for the age differences between the sexes, the disparities were even more stark: the Covid-19 death rate for men was 133.9 per 100,000 during the second quarter of 2020, compared with 86.9 per 100,000 for women. The center has collected data on racial and ethnic disparities in death rates, but has not yet published the research. Another paper published on Thursday, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, calculated that Covid-19 has reduced life expectancy for all Americans by about a year on average, but found that the impact differs dramatically by race. While the life expectancy of white Americans has been shortened by less than a year, to 77.84 years on average, life expectancy among Black and Hispanic Americans has been reduced by two years and three years, respectively, to 72.7 years and to 78.7 years. (Hispanic Americans live longer on average than white or Black people.) The reduction represents the single largest single drop in life expectancy in 40 years. The N.C.H.S. report is not the first to show that the pandemic has increased deaths from a variety of causes. In addition to the nearly 200,000 American deaths caused directly by Covid-19 from Jan. 26 to Oct. 3, another roughly 100,000 so-called excess deaths from other causes were recorded, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported. The greatest rate of excess deaths was found among young adults and people of color. Calculations of the death toll from injuries — a category that includes suicide, homicide, drug overdoses and firearm deaths — were not included in the new data, as reporting on these deaths frequently lags. But a separate N.C.H.S. provisional report on drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending in June 2020 found an 18 percent increase over the previous year to 79,251 deaths, up from 67,821 deaths during the previous 12-month period ending in June 2019. In total, there have been more than 384,000 known virus-related deaths in the United States. As of Wednesday, the seven-day average was 3,346 deaths a day, according to a New York Times database.\n\nOlder New Yorkers are exasperated as they try to get vaccinated. Giving a vaccine shot to a nursing home resident in the Bronx. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times Laura Engle, 78, lives alone in an apartment in Midtown Manhattan. She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. Yet she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City's vaccine finder page on Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and phone number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care's corporate office, which told her to wait. She wanted to register at the new Javits Center megasite, which she had heard about on the news, but couldn't figure out how. I'm willing to wait my turn, she said, frustrated, but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn. Millions of older New Yorkers started the week with optimism that they would finally gain access to a vaccine after months of fearing they would fall victim to the coronavirus. But the reality of actually getting the shots has proved maddening. Buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems that act in parallel but do not link together and a lack of outreach is causing exasperation and exhaustion among older New Yorkers and others trying to set up vaccination appointments. It is also stymying New York's efforts to get the vaccine to many of the city's most vulnerable, creating a situation that risks exacerbating the inequalities that Covid-19 has already laid painfully bare. The race to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers has reached a critical point, as officials on Wednesday announced that two cases of a more contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain had been found in New York City, one in Manhattan and one in Queens. The state has used 35 percent of its available vaccine, in line with the national average in a rollout that has gone far slower than expected nationwide. New York City has distributed 38 percent of its shots, with 491,000 available doses as of Thursday. But in the race to get shots in arms, some say the bigger picture about exactly whose arms should be prioritized has been lost. Here we are, facing a global pandemic, with thousands of New Yorkers who have lost their lives, and who is again the forgotten group of people? The very people who need help the most, said Mark Treyger, a city councilman from Brooklyn who said his office had been inundated with calls from family members trying to get appointments for their parents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story
WASHINGTON — President Trump suggested on Wednesday that he would be willing to consider cuts to social safety-net programs like Medicare to reduce the federal deficit if he wins a second term, an apparent shift from his 2016 campaign promise to protect funding for such entitlements.\n\nThe president made the comments on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Despite promises to reduce the federal budget deficit, it has ballooned under Mr. Trump's watch as a result of sweeping tax cuts and additional government spending.\n\nAsked in an interview with CNBC if cuts to entitlements would ever be on his plate, Mr. Trump answered yes.\n\nAt some point they will be, Mr. Trump said, before pointing to United States economic growth. At the right time, we will take a look at that.
WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration is bringing thousands of furloughed inspectors and other employees back to work as the partial government shutdown drags on, the agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe F.A.A.'s announcement came after unions representing aviation safety inspectors and air traffic controllers raised concerns that the lengthy shutdown was eroding the safety of the United States' air travel system.\n\nIt is one of the largest changes made by a government agency to address the need to maintain an essential service since the shutdown began last month. The Internal Revenue Service is planning to bring back tens of thousands of furloughed workers for tax season, and the Food and Drug Administration has said it is bringing hundreds of workers back to step up food safety inspections.\n\nUnder its revised shutdown plan, the F.A.A. will have 3,113 employees in its aviation safety organization who are considered essential to protect life and safety, and those employees will work without pay. Under its original shutdown plan, only 216 aviation safety positions were considered essential for life and safety.
According to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports goods, the Golden Knights have ranked fourth in N.H.L. merchandise sales this season — and first since the start of 2018.\n\nThe fast start by the Golden Knights has, for now, allayed fears that the N.H.L.'s decision to put another team in a desert city would lead to financial trouble. (See: Coyotes, Arizona.) Commissioner Gary Bettman has for years pushed for new teams in the Sun Belt, with mixed success, and aiming for Las Vegas, in particular, seemed like an overreach.\n\nIt is the country's 40th largest television market, best known as a destination for tourists and gamblers, and has a population heavy on retirees and service industry workers, who are unlikely candidates to spend thousands of dollars on season tickets. The city had little hockey tradition; it has hosted minor league teams but has few ice rinks or youth leagues.\n\nBut an influx of out-of-town fans has complemented the Golden Knights' fast start on the ice and at the box office. This is good news for local hotels, restaurants and casinos, which host 43 million visitors a year, and for the team as it gets its bearings in the market.\n\nOther N.H.L. teams in areas that attract transplanted retirees — like the Arizona Coyotes and the Florida Panthers — also tend to have strong crowds supporting the opposition. The Golden Knights, though, appear to have specifically designed their game nights like most things in their city: as tourist attractions.\n\nWhile hockey is certainly the central focus of game nights, the Knights have added a medieval motif, sometimes comically. The Zambonis that drive on the ice have jousts mounted on their sides to simulate a duel. The arena includes a 24-foot knight's helmet and three castle structures, including one for cheerleaders with pompoms. Catapults are used to launch T-shirts into the crowd.\n\nWe wanted to focus on Vegas as the entertainment capital of the world, Bubolz said.\n\nThe Golden Knights' success, camp and all, is an encouraging sign for the N.F.L., which last year approved the Raiders' plan to relocate to Nevada. (The San Antonio Stars of the W.N.B.A. moved to Las Vegas in the off-season, and will begin play as the Las Vegas Aces in May.)
But the magnitude and the suddenness of the loss surprised and puzzled analysts. An after-tax loss of $100 million in the second quarter for the company as a whole translates into a pretax loss on home computers alone of $200 million to $250 million.\n\nTexas Instruments officials last week declined to be interviewed. ''Not a chance. Absolutely not a chance,'' said company spokesman Norman Neureiter. Indeed, even the home computer division's public relations manager, whose job it is to talk to the press about that specific T.I. activity, has not been allowed to talk to some publications in the last few weeks.\n\nNevertheless, it is evident that the loss was the result of a combination of factors, all of which are evidence of a consistent problem that T.I. has had in the consumer electronics business. In digital watches and calculators, T.I. helped drive prices so low that it ruined the business, even for itself.\n\nOne of the other companies severely hurt in the calculator wars was Commodore International, which was dependent on other companies for the chips it used and was therefore limited in how much it could cut costs. Since then, Commodore has vertically integrated. When Commodore and T.I. faced off again in home computers, Commodore was the winner. Mistake number one for T.I., analysts and competitors say, was getting into a price war with a more agile, lower-cost producer.\n\nT.I.'s home computer was first introduced in 1979 for $1,150 and was an embarrassing failure. T.I. discovered in 1982 that it could sell large volumes by cutting the price and offering rebates. But the T.I. 99/4A, which was little different from the machine that was originally designed to sell for $1,150, was no match cost-wise for Commodore's VIC-20. As Commodore and T.I. started their downhill race, it was inevitable that prices would get so low that T.I. would start losing money while Commodore stayed profitable. T.I. ''got suckered by Jack,'' said Harry Fox, president of Spectravideo, a new home computer company, referring to Commodore president Jack Tramiel.\n\nEven that would not have been too bad had T.I. been able to make up for low-priced computers by making large profits on software and peripheral equipment as it had hoped. But there is a flaw in such a razor-and-blade approach to profits in the home computer market.\n\nThe history of the personal computer business, brief as it is, has shown that the successful machines are the ones that have the most and best software available for them. It has also shown that no single company can write all the software itself. It must take advantage of the cottage industry of programmers.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nWASHINGTON — Not so long ago, left-wing activists were dismissed as fringe or even kooky when they pressed for proposals to tax the superrich at 70 percent, to produce all of America's power through renewable resources or to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThen along came Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — and her social-media megaphone.\n\nIn the two months since her election, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has had the uncanny ability for a first-term member of Congress to push the debate inside the Democratic Party sharply to the left, forcing party leaders and 2020 presidential candidates to grapple with issues that some might otherwise prefer to avoid.\n\nThe potential Democratic field in 2020 is already being quizzed about her (Senator Kamala Harris praised her on The View), emulating her digital tactics (Senator Elizabeth Warren held an Instagram chat in her kitchen that looked much like one of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's sessions) and embracing some of her causes.\n\nMs. Warren and Senator Cory Booker, among others, have recently endorsed the idea of a Green New Deal, a call to reimagine an environment-first economy that would phase out fossil fuels. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez thrust that issue into the national dialogue after she joined a sit-in protest in the office of then-incoming House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, in one of her first, rebellious acts in Washington.
First, the deal calls for China to begin purchasing what the administration says will be $200 billion worth of American crops and other exported goods and services. Those purchases should increase exports from the United States to China, which, all else being equal, would promote growth.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more important, administration officials appear to be counting on the agreement to revive business investment in the United States, which has fallen in recent quarters after surging in the first half of 2018. The uncertainty that Mr. Trump and the Chinese sowed as they imposed escalating tariffs on each other's imports was largely to blame for that sluggishness, many companies and economists have said.\n\nThe bullish case for the China agreement is that it will ease that uncertainty. Some economists say the U.S.M.C.A. could do the same. For months, administration officials have touted a study by the United States International Trade Commission that predicted that the North American trade deal could raise growth by 0.35 percent, largely by reducing uncertainty over trade in digital services.\n\nAndrew Hunter, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, backed that assessment on Tuesday. The gap that opened up last year between investment and corporate profits suggests that tariff uncertainty has caused firms to delay investment plans, he wrote in a research note. He added, With the U.S.M.C.A. deal signed and the threat of further tariffs on Chinese goods seemingly off the table, that drag should now be fading.\n\nMany economists have praised the agreements for reducing uncertainty, but few have raised their growth forecasts because of them. That is in part because they say the deals still leave a large number of tariffs in place — particularly those against China, but also on some steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines imported from other countries.\n\nThey also noted that Mr. Trump had waged his trade wars on fronts well beyond North America and China. New trade battles loom this year, including one between the United States and France over a French push to impose a new tax that hits American tech giants like Google and Amazon.\n\nMary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Phase 1 agreement was good news for the U.S. and the world economy. But, she said, there remains considerable uncertainly for businesses using China as a platform for products destined for the U.S. market, and we will continue to see the impact of this in slower investment and higher business costs.
WASHINGTON — House Democrats unveiled on Friday the details of ambitious legislation devised to lower barriers to the ballot box, tighten ethics and lobbying restrictions and, in a swipe at President Trump, require presidents and candidates for the nation's highest offices to release their tax returns.\n\nSingling out Mr. Trump and his administration, Democrats said that they were making good on promises to voters across the country who vaulted them into the majority with demands to clean up corruption and influence-peddling in Republican-controlled Washington.\n\nOver the last two years, President Trump set the tone from the top of this administration that behaving ethically and complying with the law is optional, said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Ladies and gentlemen, I have stopped by here to simply say we are better than that.\n\nLittle if any of the bill, named H.R. 1 to underscore its primacy, is likely to become law; in its sprawl and ambition, the measure is less a legislative vehicle than a political platform for the Democrats heading into the 2020 presidential cycle.
TIGHTROPE\n\nAmericans Reaching for Hope\n\nBy Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn\n\nAs the United States awakens from one of its foundational myths — that we are a democracy without castes — the official record of our times is being written largely by people born to socioeconomic advantage. This irony, in which those on the fortunate end of historic wealth inequality attempt to chronicle a populist movement produced by that inequality, often results in dubious journalism.\n\nEven well-intentioned urban, coastal, college-educated scribes commit obliviously condescending word choices (flyover country), illogical assumptions (everyone in red states voted for Trump) and variations on poverty porn, in which subjects are conveyed as helpless and joyless (observe this sorry case in Appalachia). To those who know something about, say, rural poverty firsthand, earnest nonfiction narratives understandably may read as voyeuristic studies predicated on the dangerous idea that we are a nation of two essentially different kinds of people.\n\nIn fact, we are a nation of essentially similar people shaped by vastly different circumstances of place, wealth, education and culture. Those best able to document our socioeconomic divide with humility and accuracy typically have occupied more than one class, remain connected to the one they left and attribute any upward mobility to good fortune rather than to personal exceptionalism.\n\nOne such journalist is the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who grew up tending sheep on a small family farm in rural Oregon in the 1960s and '70s. In Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope, he and the journalist Sheryl WuDunn, who is also his wife, offer a litany of stories from across the country, revealing the structural causes of countless so-called personal failures among the working poor. Most of these stories come from Kristof's hometown of Yamhill, population 1,105.
how fitting is it that president trump's first oval office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network , was aimed at stirring up the american public about a crisis largely of his own making?\n\nnot that the border crisis is one of mr. trump's self-serving political fictions — like the deep state or widespread voter fraud. it may have started out that way, but the situation has, with the president's nurturing, become something far more tragic.\n\npursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, mr. trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from california to texas.\n\nmr. trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. the president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. he seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the american people will rally to his side and pressure congressional democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.
the government's repayment policy is an extension of its approach to british tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the united kingdom. people 18 years or older have to reimburse the government.\n\nthat age limit came into effect after the guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old british teenager who sought help at the british embassy in islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. she had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her british passport before being allowed to return to the united kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.\n\nafter that, 16 and 17 year olds became exempt from the reimbursement policy.\n\nthe times of london reported on four british women who were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in somalia where they said they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. the women's families sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.\n\nayaan, 24, who had been at the institution for two years, said she signed a loan agreement on the day she was rescued.\n\ni was left to fend for myself, she told the times of london. the loan has caused so much anxiety.\n\njust as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime, it should not charge women for bringing them back home, said alison gardner, an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the university of nottingham. she said a $1,000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped.\n\nit's an example of this general policy of pushing costs onto the people who have incurred the misfortune, which drives a cycle of increased vulnerability, she said.
tijuana, mexico — is donald trump a conceptual artist?\n\nthat's the intriguing possibility put forth in an online petition tuesday that seeks to have the group of eight prototypes for mr. trump's controversial mexican border wall designated a national monument.\n\nthe prototypes were built at a cost of $3.3 million in federal funds and unveiled last october along the united states border near san diego. the petition, sponsored by the puckishly named nonprofit, maga (the acronym recalls the president's campaign slogan, make america great again), seeks to protect the prototypes from demolition by invoking the antiquities act of 1906 and characterizes the structures as a major land art exhibition of significant cultural value.\n\nthe notion that the prototypes could qualify as conceptual art might seem somewhat far-fetched. they were designed to united states customs and border protection specifications, built to withstand a 30-minute assault from sledgehammers to acetylene torches, and to be difficult to scale or tunnel beneath. aesthetic considerations are largely secondary to brute strength, but, when viewed up close, the walls collectively have the undeniable majesty of minimalist sculpture.
berlin — seven months after his coalition with the far right collapsed in a spectacular scandal, sebastian kurz, austria's former conservative chancellor, stood before television cameras on thursday and announced a new government — this time with the progressive greens.\n\nwe chose a new path, mr. kurz beamed. it was a challenge for both sides, because the differences between the two sides are big.\n\nthe result, he said, was a new kind of compromise. we did not try to negotiate the lowest common denominator but consciously tried to unite the best of both worlds, mr. kurz said. that's how it is possible that both the greens could keep their central campaign promises and so could the people's party.\n\nwerner kogler, the greens leader, who will serve as vice chancellor, put it more bluntly: we were elected for different things.
as a boy, bradley scott silverbush had a knack for breaking up schoolyard fights in his hometown, syracuse. his strategy was simple: collect $1 from the child who was about to be pummeled and split his winnings with the bully to end the dispute.\n\nfrom these grade-school negotiations mr. silverbush acquired some valuable information. i knew from second grade that i wanted to be a lawyer, he said.\n\nnow 60, he is a senior litigation member at rosenberg & estis, a top landlord law firm in new york. and he is still negotiating for the bigger kids on the playground; he lists among his clients douglas elliman and carnegie management.\n\nit would not be difficult for many people to revile a landlord lawyer, yet over dinner at the palm too, a midtown east steakhouse near his apartment, this lawyer with a penchant for racecars came across as unexpectedly likable as he told stories in sometimes off-color language about risks he has taken, like racing at 140 miles per hour on the interstate but talking himself out of a traffic ticket.
president tsai ing-wen of taiwan urged china on tuesday to seek a peaceful solution to its differences with taiwan and stressed that the island's people want to maintain self-rule.\n\nspeaking a day before china's leader, xi jinping, was expected to make a major speech about taiwan, ms. tsai said that china must respect the freedom and democracy of taiwan's 23 million people. her remarks came amid a shift in the island's political landscape, with ms. tsai's democratic progressive party having suffered major losses in local elections in november. candidates who favor closer ties with china won mayoral contests in taiwan's four largest cities.\n\ni must emphasize, the results of the past election absolutely do not represent that the will of the people at the grass-roots level seeks to give up our sovereignty, she said in a new year's day address. beijing considers taiwan to be chinese territory that must be united with the mainland, by force if necessary.\n\nthe chinese government, ms. tsai said, must handle our differences peacefully and as equals.\n\nthat set of differences amounts to one of asia's biggest potential flash points. since ms. tsai came to power in 2016, china has ramped up pressure on her government. it has increased patrols by military aircraft, sent bombers to circle the island and sailed an aircraft carrier through the taiwan strait.
london — prime minister boris johnson was on the caribbean island of mustique, still basking in the glow of his recent election victory, when the news came last friday that president trump had ordered the killing of a powerful iranian general — without tipping off, let alone consulting, his british ally.\n\nthe british government was livid about the lack of notice, according to current and former officials, particularly because there are about 400 british troops deployed in iraq, and britain has historically been more closely aligned with the united states on combat operations there than any other country.\n\nbut mr. johnson held his tongue until sunday evening, after he returned to london. even then, he issued a carefully worded four-paragraph statement that said he would not lament the killing of the general, qassim suleimani, warned iran against reprisals and said nothing about mr. trump's action.\n\nit was a circumspect reaction for a politician not known for his circumspection, and it underscored mr. johnson's predicament as he confronts what is arguably the first foreign policy crisis of the post-brexit era.
patrick chevallereau, a former french military officer now at rusi, a defense research institution in london, said that the trump call shows that the current president is in a mind-set to do anything — absolutely anything — before jan. 20. there is zero standard, zero reference, zero ethics. he added: everything else than himself can be destroyed and collapse, including us.\n\nthomas wright, an irish-born expert on america at the brookings institution, said that people are worried for real that trump will come back. the months since the election have shown people just how bad a second term would have been — the guardrails off, a completely personalized government and giving voice to his authoritarian tendencies, he said.\n\nnow the rest of the world understands that trump could actually make a comeback in 2024, so that is a shadow that he will cast over american politics, mr. wright said.\n\nworld leaders all know that trump is sort of crazy, but it's the extremity of his actions, the lengths to which he has gone, that he got 74 million votes and is not retiring but will be a force for the republicans that is disconcerting, he added. people knew what trump is like, but the importance is the shadow of the future.\n\nalso troubling to many is the letter that the last 10 living secretaries of defense all signed urging the nation — and the military — to accept that the election is over and the time for questioning the results has passed.\n\njean-marie guéhenno, a former diplomat and the former president of the international crisis group, asked on twitter: should we be reassured on u.s. democracy when 10 former defense secretaries warn against use of the military to dispute election results, or terrified that they believe taking a public stance has become necessary?

pamela anderson walks down a city street and uses her cellphone to book a ride. along the way, she passes a newspaper and street signs that say, hollywood sexual harassment scandal reaches new lows and u.s. senator accused of groping. when she gets into the car, she sees another sign that says, ride-hail drivers suspected of rape. the car doors lock, and the driver turns around and suggestively asks, shall we? just then, #metoo pops up on her phone's screen.\n\nwhen you accept a ride from a ride-hail app, you also accept the risks that come with it, ms. anderson says in a voice-over. many ride-hail companies consider their drivers third-party providers, so they don't have to accept any responsibility or accountability for their actions. always ride responsibly.\n\nthe 60-second ad, to be released monday, is the third in a campaign introduced in 2015 by the national limousine association to promote ride responsibly, an initiative that encourages riders to think before you app.\n\nit is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like uber and lyft, which happen to be its competitors. in november, for instance, two women sued uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in florida and california. and last month an uber driver in beirut, lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of rebecca dykes, a british diplomat.
ilsi does not profess to have been perfect in our 40-year history, the statement said. not surprisingly, there have been bumps along the way. this is why ilsi has analyzed best practices and has committed to ensuring scientific integrity in nutrition and food sector research.\n\ncoca-cola said in a statement that it had also been changing the way it funded scientific research through greater transparency and by ending its practice of providing the lion's share of money for studies. in recent years, it added, coca-cola has sought to address mounting obesity in china by offering an array of new sugar-free beverages and through improved nutrition labeling on products. we recognize that too much sugar isn't good for anyone, it said.\n\nprofessor greenhalgh's findings were based on interviews with chinese officials and scientists, and a review of public documents produced by coca-cola and ilsi.\n\nshe said the industry efforts have been wildly successful, in part because china lacks a free media or watchdog organizations that might have been critical of the relationship.\n\nin just a few decades, china has gone from a nation plagued by food shortages to one buffeted by soaring obesity and chronic diseases tied to poor diet. more than 42 percent of adults in china are overweight or obese, according to chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. in chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys.\n\nthe increases closely follow growing prosperity in china that began in the 1980s as beijing embraced market economics after decades of isolation. in 1978, coca-cola was among the first companies allowed into the country, and ilsi arrived soon afterward. seeking to identify influential scientists it could work with, the group found a partner in chen chunming, a leading nutritionist who was the founding president of the chinese academy of preventive medicine, the forerunner of china's c.d.c.\n\nin 1993, ms. chen became the head of ilsa-china and she remained a senior adviser to the organization until her death last year. professors greenhalgh and popkin said that ms. chen was instrumental in stymying attempts to address soaring obesity by stressing the harmful impact of consuming highly processed food and sugary soft drinks.
what election objectors could cost their corporate donors\n\nany remaining notions that the presidential transition would go smoothly were shattered this weekend when 11 republican senators announced that they would not certify joe biden's electoral college victory during a joint congressional session on wednesday. at the same time, president trump pressured georgia's secretary of state to find enough votes to flip the state to him, on a saturday phone call that was recorded. (that said, the prospect of a constitutional crisis hasn't rattled markets: u.s. futures are up this morning.)\n\nthe group of senators, led by ted cruz of texas, will call for an emergency audit of election results in disputed states, without citing specific evidence of fraud. (there's also senator josh hawley of missouri, who had already promised to dispute the result.) scores of republican house members also plan to reject the count, attracting strong condemnation and setting off infighting in the party. and companies whose political arms donated to these lawmakers' campaigns now face accusations of funding their maneuvers.\n\nhow businesses are being linked with this gambit. the senators rejecting the election count include steve daines of montana, bill hagerty of tennessee, cynthia lummis of wyoming and roger marshall of kansas, who ran and won their seats in 2020. their major campaign contributors included corporate political action committees, which collect and distribute employee contributions, based on data from the center for responsive politics. here are some examples:\n\nan exxon mobil pac contributed $10,000 to ms. lummis. in a statement to dealbook, the company said we congratulate president-elect biden on his election. ms. lummis also received money from a u.s. chamber of commerce pac. the trade association congratulated mr. biden on nov. 7. it did not respond to a request for comment.\n\na chevron pac donated $10,000 to mr. daines. the company acknowledged in a written statement that it engages with many people and organizations that take positions that are not always aligned with all their views, and said it looks forward to engaging with president-elect biden and his team.\n\nmr. daines and mr. marshall received $10,000 each from a goldman sachs pac. the bank has warned that sowing doubt about the orderly transfer of power threatens the economy. it did not respond to a request for comment.\n\napollo global management's pac contributed $10,000 to mr. hagerty. the firm did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nthe challenge isn't expected to delay the inauguration on jan. 20, but it turns a routine process into a political showdown. those who spoke up against the move did so in stark terms:\n\nthe voters have spoken, said republican senators lisa murkowski of alaska, susan collins of maine, bill cassidy of louisiana and mitt romney of utah, in a statement also signed by some democratic colleagues. congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results.\n\nrepresentative liz cheney of wyoming, the third-ranking republican, circulated a 21-page memo to house colleagues explaining why the move sets an exceptionally dangerous precedent.\n\nthe former house speaker paul ryan, a republican, said in a statement that the challenges strike at the foundation of our republic, adding that it is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act.\n\nall 10 living former defense secretaries wrote in a joint op-ed that the time for questioning the results has passed.\n\nthe rebellion could affect future corporate donations. in a new ad, the lincoln project, an anti-trump republican group, accused mr. cruz and mr. hawley — as well as senators tom cotton of arkansas and rand paul of kentucky, who have promoted the president's election fraud contentions but haven't committed to the certification challenge — of attempting to suppress millions of votes, and called out the corporate america titans who are funding them, naming at&t, charles schwab and citigroup. if that creates reputational issues, companies may think twice about donations to challengers in 2022 — and beyond.\n\nimage\n\nhere's what's happening\n\nthe covid-19 vaccine from astrazeneca and the university of oxford goes into use. britain began inoculations with the shot, which has also received emergency approval in india. scientists are increasingly immersed in debates about vaccination policy, including whether to delay booster doses to give more first shots faster.
the british government on friday issued new guidance encouraging health care providers to use two arthritis drugs to treat severely sick covid-19 patients, following the release of promising data from a clinical trial that has not yet undergone formal scientific review.\n\nthe findings in a new paper show that treatment regimens involving the drugs tocilizumab or sarilumab reduced the death rate among covid patients in intensive care to about 27 percent, compared with 36 percent among patients who did not receive the drugs. based on these results, about one death would be prevented for every 12 i.c.u. patients treated early with these drugs. all of the patients in the trial received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care.\n\ni think it's a huge result, said dr. anthony gordon, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at imperial college london and the trial's lead researcher. showing that drugs that are available and can be used to save lives, in this pandemic, is a wonderful achievement.\n\nthe results raise the profile of these drugs as among the few so far, apart from steroids like dexamethasone, that have reduced covid deaths in a well-designed clinical trial. (most of the new study's participants also took steroids during their hospital stay.)
they could include a measure finalized this week to restrict the type of scientific studies the environmental protection agency can use to develop new air and water protections, and another granting liability protection to companies that accidentally kill migratory birds.\n\nthe trump administration has also rushed in recent weeks to lock in weak pollution rules.\n\none such action kept in place obama-era standards on smog-causing emissions that, even when originally issued, fell short of the standard recommended by public health experts. another imposed the federal government's first regulation to control planet-warming pollution from airplanes but did not require airlines to go beyond emissions limits that they had set for themselves. and a third updates regulations around lead pipes in a way that environmental critics said falls far short of an overhaul needed to ensure safe drinking water.\n\nthe new balance of power would also make it easier for mr. biden's cabinet appointees to win confirmation, as well as for democrats to increase the budgets of federal agencies and pump money into clean energy research and development. it also would greatly increase the likelihood that congress would incorporate portions of mr. biden's $2 trillion climate plan into new economic stimulus legislation as well as an infrastructure package.\n\npassage of much major legislation, however, requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, so democrats would still be forced to compromise with republicans and would be limited in their ability to pass sweeping new laws, said robert stavins, director of the environmental economics program at the harvard kennedy school.\n\nvictories in both georgia runoff elections would be important across the board, but it doesn't bring them the ultimate freedom they would have if they had a supermajority in the senate, dr. stavins said.\n\nthe biden team, meantime, said this week that it had underestimated the damage that the trump administration had done to climate and environment policy and was keeping all options on the table to bolster federal agencies and the work they do.\n\nthere is hard work ahead to rebuild agencies and our capacities from the ground up and reposition the federal government to be a partner to our workers and communities again — rather than advancing policies that hurt our environment and economy, gina mccarthy, whom mr. biden has tapped to lead a new white house office of climate policy, said in a statement.
do you remember the winter of debt?\n\nin late 2010 and early 2011, the u.s. economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed; long-term unemployment was especially severe, with more than 6 million americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. you might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion.\n\nbut no: washington was obsessed with debt. the simpson-bowles report was the talk of the town. paul ryan's impassioned (and, of course, hypocritical) denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards. and between the capital's debt obsession, the republican takeover of the house, and a hard right turn in state governments, america was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment.\n\nsome of us protested bitterly against this policy turn, arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity. and we were mostly right. why only mostly? because it's becoming increasingly doubtful whether there's any right time for fiscal austerity. the obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.\n\nthat's the message i take from olivier blanchard's presidential address to the american economic association. to be fair, blanchard — one of the world's leading macroeconomists, formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the i.m.f. — was cautious in his pronouncements, and certainly didn't go all mmt and say that debt never matters. but his analysis nonetheless makes the fix the debt fixation (yes, they're still out there) look even worse than before.
the remarks also reflected the disarray that has surrounded the president's decision, which took his staff and foreign allies by surprise and drew objections from the pentagon that it was logistically impossible and strategically unwise. defense secretary jim mattis resigned within hours of the announcement, and the pentagon chief of staff, kevin m. sweeney, said on saturday evening that he was also leaving.\n\nwhile mr. bolton said on sunday that he expected american forces to eventually leave northeastern syria, where most of the 2,000 troops in the country are based for the mission against the islamic state, he began to lay out an argument for keeping some troops at a garrison in the southeast that is used to monitor the flow of iranian arms and soldiers. in september, three months before mr. trump's announcement, mr. bolton had declared that the united states would remain in syria as long as iranians were on the ground there.\n\nasked on cbs news's face the nation if mr. bolton's comments amounted to an admission that mr. trump had made a mistake, senator lindsey graham, a south carolina republican who at times has been one of the president's staunchest supporters, said, this is the reality setting in that you've got to plan this out.\n\nmr. graham, who described the dangers of making the announcement first and then considering the longer-term implications, added, the president is slowing down and is re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives: don't let iran get the oil fields, don't let the turks slaughter the kurds, and don't let isis come back.\n\nthe move to reverse course on mr. trump's promised swift withdrawal picked up in recent days, even as mr. bolton worked to avoid openly confronting the president the way mr. mattis did. on friday, in a briefing for reporters about a forthcoming trip to the middle east by secretary of state mike pompeo, a senior state department official said there was no fixed timetable for the american withdrawal.
a bipartisan, if mildly conservative, group of senators has indicated that it will introduce legislation intended to increase the rule-making requirements on wall street regulators like the securities and exchange commission and the consumer financial protection board.\n\nas senator ron johnson, the chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, has put it, the long-term growth of living standards depends on periodically lightening the regulatory load – the equivalent of scraping barnacles off the bottom.\n\nthe legislation would require more math and permit less flexibility by those regulators. but it would also limit congress's own ability to require the government to embrace good governance values like transparency and honesty, if the s.e.c.'s most recent rule-making is any guide.\n\nthe senators have suggested that they would impose cost-benefit analysis requirements on america's financial regulators. no important rule could be passed without establishing that the dollar impositions on the financial industry would not be outweighed by the dollar benefits created by the rule.
washington — under increasing pressure to defend the killing of a top iranian general in iraq, senior trump administration officials offered new justifications but little detail on tuesday, citing threats to the american embassy in baghdad and intelligence suggesting other imminent attacks that helped prompt the strike.\n\ndemocrats stepped up their criticism of intelligence that the administration provided immediately after the drone strike last week that killed maj. gen. qassim suleimani, the leader of iran's islamic revolutionary guards corps. the administration's formal notification to congress, which remains classified, provided no information on future threats or the imminent attack, officials who have read it said.\n\nseveral said it was improperly classified, and senator richard blumenthal, democrat of connecticut, called it vague and unacceptably unspecific. lawmakers pressed for more answers on tuesday at an intelligence briefing by administration officials.\n\niranian forces or their proxies were days from attacking american personnel when president trump decided to strike general suleimani, defense secretary mark t. esper told reporters at the pentagon. mr. esper added that general suleimani had traveled to baghdad to coordinate attacks following up on a two-day siege of the united states embassy there last week by pro-iranian demonstrators. he declined to elaborate but called the intelligence exquisite.
to do this, the cabinet and congress must deploy the 25th amendment and impeachment in sequence.\n\nfirst, vice president pence and a majority of the cabinet should invoke section 4 of the 25th amendment in order to make a declaration that mr. trump is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. this would immediately suspend, but not remove, mr. trump from the exercise of his presidential duties and appoint mr. pence as acting president. the 25th amendment would not and should not be used as a lasting solution in a case of this kind, but rather as a temporary measure to sideline a demonstrably unfit and dangerous actor who is fueling anti-democratic action.\n\nsecond, the house should quickly draw up and pass articles of impeachment. and then the senate should hold a fair — but immediate and efficient — trial both to remove president trump from office and, as important, to disqualify him from serving in public office in the future. precedent suggests that the senate would likely need to hold two separate votes on removal and disqualification, although the disqualification vote may require only a simple majority to be approved, as opposed to the two-thirds vote necessary for removal from office.\n\ndisqualification is necessary given mr. trump's anti-democratic response to the 2020 election and the continuing danger that he will pose to constitutional norms if allowed to flirt with a return to power in 2024. indeed, the importance of disqualification in this case is such that the congress should proceed with impeachment even if mr. trump's term in office has already concluded.\n\na public vote and rapid trial in the senate would give much-needed legitimacy to actions to remove mr. trump from office. by forcing republicans to stand up for democracy and against the president's actions, it would also reaffirm bipartisan support for the fundamental principles of american democracy. further, while the 25th amendment is intended mainly for illness or other objective incapacities, impeachment offers an appropriate moral response to the president's conduct, including incitement to violence and attacks on basic democratic norms.\n\nwhy do this with only about two weeks left in president trump's term? because we must defend our democracy for all americans, now. and we must preserve our democracy for future americans. we must ensure a field of potential republican presidential hopefuls in 2024 who have integrity. and we must reassure the world, and especially would-be authoritarian regimes, about what united states policy will be on questions of freedom and self-rule now and in the future.

industry — an entity once aligned with the trump administration — urged vice president mike pence on wednesday to utilize powers within the constitution to remove president trump from office after mr. trump's supporters stormed the u.s. capitol. in a lengthy statement, the national association of manufacturers termed the violent incursion at the capitol complex as mob rule that it said was fueled by mr. trump. the 14,000-member group, which last year honored ivanka trump, the president's eldest daughter, said that mr. trump was not fit for office. this is sedition and should be treated as such, the group said. the outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. the association called on mr. pence to use a constitutional mechanism that provides the vice president and a majority of the cabinet — the officials who lead executive agencies — with the ability to declare that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. both the senate and house would be required to approve such a measure by a two-thirds vote. vice president pence, who was evacuated from the capitol, should seriously consider working with the cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment to preserve democracy, the group said. most of those calling for mr. trump's removal as president 14 days before he is slated to leave office were democrats, but there were some exceptions. governor phil scott, republican of vermont, said on twitter that mr. trump should be ousted. the fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the president, he said. enough is enough. president trump should resign or be removed from

results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. mr. romney, the lone republican in the senate who voted to convict mr. trump last year on one of two articles of impeachment, has been the target of verbal attacks by mr. trump's supporters in recent days. videos showed one of the president's followers confronting mr. romney before a flight at salt lake city international airport earlier this week. he was later heckled by mr. trump's supporters aboard a flight. in his statement, mr. romney, who was the republican presidential nominee in 2012, said that the objections to the counting of electoral college votes for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. was because of a selfish man's injured pride. he said that mr. trump had misinformed his supporters and stirred their outburst. they will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in american history, he said of mr. trump's supporters. that will be their legacy. former president george w. bush, the only living republican former president, also denounced the actions of those who stormed the capitol. he did not mention mr.

the boat people\n\nby sharon bala\n\n352 pp. doubleday. $26.95.\n\ntwo pieces of canadian history lie behind sharon bala's debut novel, the boat people. the first involves the arrival — in august 2010 — of the merchant vessel sun sea at equimalt naval base in british columbia, carrying hundreds of sri lankan asylum seekers. the second involves the internment of almost 24,000 canadian citizens of japanese origin in the slocan valley by the british columbia security commission between 1941 and 1949.\n\n\n\nthe arrival of the refugees is fictionalized through the voices of the widower mahindan, a resourceful father rendered unscrupulous by the circumstances of a terrible war, who has arrived with his 6-year-old son, sellian, and priya rajasekaran, a law student assigned to represent the refugees. grace nakamura, an adjudicator for the immigration and refugee board, provides the connection to 1941 through her mother, kumi. the latter, her mind laced with dementia, sallies forth like a greek chorus to insist that subjecting foreign asylum seekers to the processes established by rule of law is the same as the forced removal and incarceration of law-abiding citizens. it's a false equivalence that blights a novel already struggling under the weight of political opinion: bala vilifies the canadian border services agency and the draconian immigration laws and penalties that can be traced to the prime minister at the time, stephen harper, and sings the praises of the canadian tamil congress, which appears here as the tamil alliance.\n\nimage\n\nthe compassionate lens promised on the jacket copy proves elusive. the novel is burdened by a heavy-handed use of emotive prose. bala is particularly fond of the diminutive, the small of things, hands, wounded children — all designed to elicit sympathy. stock characters crowd the narrative. one of them, grace's world-weary colleague mitchell hurst, shows up no fewer than four times to make declarative statements about what a neophyte she is at this business of adjudicating asylum. bala also labors to explain things that do not require explanation, from immigration law (there can be a gap between policy and practice) to border services (the agency responsible for patrolling the perimeter, the country's official boundaries).
los angeles — as california's deadliest wildfire was consuming the town of paradise in november, some of the state's top power company officials and a dozen legislators were at an annual retreat at the fairmont kea lani resort on maui. in the course of four days, they discussed wildfires — and how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the devastation, if any.\n\nit is an issue of increasing urgency as more fires are traced to equipment owned by california's investor-owned utilities. the largest, pacific gas and electric, could ultimately have to pay homeowners and others an estimated $30 billion for causing fires over the last two years. the most devastating of those, the camp fire, destroyed thousands of homes in paradise and killed at least 86 people.\n\nrealizing that their potential fire liability is large enough to bankrupt them, the utility companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. their goal: a california law that would allow them to pass on the cost of wildfires to their customers in the form of higher electricity rates. after an earlier lobbying push, legislators have already voted to protect the companies from having to bear the cost of 2017 fires, and utilities are seeking the same for 2018.\n\nthe utility companies acknowledge that they may bear some responsibility but say not all of it, because climate change and development in remote areas have made wildfires more destructive. in addition, they argue that electricity rates would go up regardless of whether the state protected them because investors and banks could grow wary of lending to california's energy sector.
while mr. warnock's win was a major gain for his party — he is the first democrat to be elected to the senate from georgia since 2000 — both political parties remained on edge over the unresolved ossoff-perdue race and its implications for the next two years in american politics. whichever party wins that race will control the senate, with republicans counting on mr. perdue to prevail and give them the ability to constrain mr. biden's policy ambitions.\n\nms. loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. in recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with mr. trump in northwest georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to mr. biden when congress meets on wednesday.\n\nmr. warnock and mr. ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two republicans, often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. republicans used much of the runoff to focus on mr. warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize african-american voters, especially in more conservative rural georgia where the church is a pillar of many communities.\n\nmr. trump's refusal to acknowledge his defeat also robbed ms. loeffler of what might have been her best argument in what is still a slightly right-leaning state — that she would be a check on the liberal excesses in a government fully controlled by democrats.\n\neven before polls closed on tuesday, senior republican campaign officials were pinning the blame on the president, noting that their polling testified to the power of the check-and-balance argument the party was unable to make because of mr. trump's denial.
in 2016, mr. xi put mr. luo in charge of cleaning up shanxi province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. mr. luo oversaw a purge of the party's senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct.\n\nmr. luo is an unexpected choice to run the central liaison office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland china. he was also only a month into his latest job, in china's national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to hong kong came together fast.\n\nthe beijing leadership previously selected younger men with more expertise in the unique issues posed by hong kong, which has a different legal and economic system from mainland china because it was a british colony until its return in 1997 to chinese sovereignty.\n\nlike other chinese provincial leaders, mr. luo has had some dealings with hong kong, especially over investment and business. he held talks with his predecessor, mr. wang, at least once, leading a delegation from shanxi province to hong kong in late 2018. on that visit, mr. luo also met the city's chief executive, carrie lam, to discuss investment opportunities. but he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in hong kong.\n\nby contrast, mr. wang had spent most of his career as a hong kong specialist before he was named to run the office in hong kong in 2017.\n\nwhen mr. luo stepped down as party chief in shanxi, in november, he said he took pride in helping to clean up the province's political ecology and overhaul its economy, two tasks that mr. xi may also want him to take on in hong kong. mr. luo also said then that he was most grateful to have the backing of mr. xi and other central leaders.\n\nmr. wang and mr. luo are among the roughly 200 members of the chinese communist party's elite central committee, which gathers roughly once a year to discuss policy and review the performance of china's political leadership.

chris hughes was raised by lutheran parents in hickory, n.c., and they taught him, by example, to tithe. every year, they gave 10 percent of their income to the church and other local charities, and mr. hughes carried that tradition into adulthood. but in 2008, when he sold $1 million of his facebook shares on private markets, and the amount of money he needed to give away increased exponentially, he started thinking more seriously about where his contributions might make the most impact.\n\ni grew up looking at the price almost down to the penny on everything from a bottle of juice to a can of soda, he told me in early february, explaining why he wanted to get the most value out of philanthropy. we were sitting in the east village office of the economic security project, an organization mr. hughes co-founded with two other activists, dorian warren and natalie foster, to fund the work of technologists, academics, policymakers and others exploring the idea of a guaranteed basic income for low- and middle-income americans.\n\nmr. hughes is one of the co-founders of facebook, for which he did three years' worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars, as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. he and mark zuckerberg were roommates at harvard, and early on, mr. hughes ran the company's communications and marketing department. the social network's colossal success fast-tracked mr. hughes's career. in 2008, he joined barack obama's first presidential campaign to launch and manage my.barackobama.com, a robust system that organized obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. in 2012, when facebook went public and the new republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. his tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. later that year, he joined with mr. warren and ms. foster to form the economic security project.\n\nin his new book, fair shot: rethinking inequality and how we earn, out this week, mr. hughes, 34, traces his ascent to show how the forces that influenced his and facebook's success — technological advancements, globalization and the rise of private equity firms — have created a winner takes all economy in which only a small group of people succeed.

some progressive groups have protested ms. raimondo's selection, arguing that the biden administration should look to a populist democrat instead. in a jan. 6 announcement, the revolving door project and demand progress criticized ms. raimondo as a corporate insider who locked in liability protection for businesses but stripped funding from low-income areas of rhode island during the pandemic.\n\na progressive democrat could wield the powers of the commerce department to combat climate change, limit pharmaceutical patents and decrease drug costs, reform the census process to decrease gerrymandering, and craft trade policy that would help working families, the statement said.\n\nsome critics have asked whether ms. raimondo has the technical background to devise and carry out a strategy to deal with technology challenges from china. in addition to denouncing deindustrialization and promoting business in rhode island, she does have firsthand experience with china's economic challenges: her father was laid off when the watch factory where he worked in providence, r.i., moved to china.\n\nhistorically, the choice of a commerce secretary has sometimes had more to do with patronage than strategy, with some past administrations appointing a wealthy donor to the post. but given the growing importance of the u.s. competition with china, trade experts say, the position demands someone with expertise who is able to understand the cutting-edge technologies the department regulates and balance the competing demands of business promotion and national security.\n\nmichael smart, a managing director and trade expert at rock creek global advisors, said a large part of the biden administration's affirmative agenda in response to china, which includes efforts to make the american economy more competitive, would fall within the commerce department's jurisdiction.\n\nwilliam reinsch, the scholl chair in international business at the center for strategic and international studies, said mr. biden and his team had placed a lot of emphasis on competing more effectively with china, including efforts to augment american industry that could be run through the commerce department.\n\nwhen you're in a race, there's only two ways to win. one is to trip the other guy, and the other is to run faster, mr. reinsch said. and to biden's credit, he's really focused on running faster.
trump's problem is that, until thursday, that's what he had done. for almost a year, an escalating series of iranian attacks on u.s. and allied assets were met by a conspicuous failure to respond militarily. trump also kept signaling his desire to withdraw u.s. forces from the region.\n\nthe result was to embolden the iranians to hit harder. instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the iranians reached until they overreached. on wednesday, khamenei taunted trump with the message that there is no damn thing you can do. the supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. that is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. rashness often springs from wounded pride.\n\none possible outcome is that a spooked iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. suleimani's death could bring a sense of realism to the islamic republic's thinking, says the iranian-american journalist masih alinejad. for 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it's been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. it may now take its time to reassess that view.\n\nthe alternative? iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like hezbollah for political deniability. it could try to take hostages at the american embassy in baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in tehran in 1979. it could use its influence in iraq to demand the expulsion of u.s. troops — accomplishing in the wake of his death what suleimani long tried to accomplish in life, as mark dubowitz of the foundation for defense of democracies observes. and it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.\n\nthe next days will be decisive. the best course for the united states is to spell out clearly to iran what the paths of escalation — and de-escalation — hold. on the de-escalatory side, a return to the status quo ante and a willingness to explore negotiations over the full range of iran's malign activities, including its regional aggression and expanding nuclear program, in exchange for the easing of oil and other economic sanctions. on the escalatory side, a policy of deliberately disproportionate retaliation to any iranian aggression, no matter whether it's carried out by iran or its proxies, and no matter whether it aims at us or our allies.\n\nthe clearer we are in limning the courses of hope and fear, the likelier we are to achieve a stable balance between them.
one of the biggest firms in the rent-to-own home business is now on the federal government's do-not-sell list.\n\nfannie mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance giant, said on tuesday that it had stopped selling properties to the firm, vision property management, after conducting a review of the firm's rent-to-own program, which operates in more than a dozen states.\n\nthe mortgage finance company will also impose restrictions on future sales of foreclosed homes to firms that engage in abusive forms of seller financing — which includes selling homes on either rent-to-own leases or in long-term installment agreements known as contract for deed.\n\nthe policy change by fannie could put a big crimp in the business model of certain investment firms that have sprouted up since the financial crisis. these firms buy foreclosed homes on the cheap and sell them to people unable to qualify for a conventional mortgage.
the targeted killing of maj. gen. qassim suleimani and four others in a precision strike by an mq-9 reaper drone at baghdad international airport was an impressive display of american military prowess. and it liquidated a destabilizing figure: the general was the commander of the quds force, which is responsible for iran's covert and extraterritorial military operations. in the scheme of things, he had it coming. yet killing him made little strategic sense for the united states. in some ways, the most significant thing about his death is what it shows about the breakdown of american foreign policymaking.\n\npresident trump ordered the strike directly, prompted by the death of an american contractor on dec. 27 in a rocket attack by kataib hezbollah, an iranian-sponsored iraqi shia militia. mr. trump did not bother to consult congressional leaders. as with his other displays of martial fiat, his immediate impulse was probably to shock the liberal domestic audience, vicariously make himself feel tough, and assert raw executive power by going around the normal channels of decision making.\n\npresidents george w. bush and barack obama had considered taking out general suleimani but rejected it — not for lack of nerve, but for fear of undue escalation and an unnecessary war with iran. the fundamental facts on the ground have not changed, and in the kind of robust interagency, national security decision-making process that the national security council staff is supposed to supervise, such concerns would have been systematically raised, dissected and discussed, and a consensus reached to inform presidential action. no such process seems to have occurred here.\n\nthe pentagon has claimed, facilely, that general suleimani was hit because the revolutionary guard was planning attacks on american targets in the region. but in a proper interagency review, the intelligence community could have pointed out that decapitation is a patently unreliable means of pre-emption — particularly when the organization in question is the revolutionary guard, an integral part of a well-honed security state with considerable depth of command talent.
in december, president trump made an extraordinary declaration about u.s. involvement in syria: we have won against isis. now, it's time for our troops to come back home. ignoring advice from his generals and advisers, trump said that the u.s. would leave syria. defense department officials said that they were ordered to do it within 30 days. [explosion] then came a flurry of criticism, even from inside his own party. i believe it is a catastrophic mistake. this is very disappointing. it needs to be reconsidered. then, the resignations. first, defense secretary jim mattis quit. and america's chief diplomat in the fight against isis, brett mcgurk, soon followed. now, the timeline for a full withdrawal is unclear. i never said we're doing it that quickly. he went on to say that the u.s. will leave at a proper pace while continuing to fight isis, a shift from — they're all coming back, and they're coming back now. the nearly eight-year-long war in syria has left hundreds of thousands of people dead. [explosion] so, how did we get here and what are u.s. forces doing in syria? in 2011, uprisings rippled through the middle east. leaders fell in tunisia, libya and egypt. and after months of anti-government protests in syria, the u.s. had a message for president bashar al-assad: this morning, president obama called on assad to step aside. he didn't and the conflict escalated. in 2012, obama warned assad against using syria's stockpile of chemical weapons against his own people. that's a red line for us, and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing the use of chemical weapons. a year later, assad's army launched a chemical attack on a damascus suburb, killing 1,400 people. [screaming] in response, the u.s. debated airstrikes, but they were avoided when syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. but a new threat was also emerging — isis. in 2014, the u.s. began supporting rebel groups to fight extremists, while also conducting airstrikes as part of an international coalition. these efforts expanded and the u.s. troop numbers grew from hundreds to the low thousands. in 2016, u.s.-supported fighters took control of the isis stronghold of manbij — and in 2017 their de facto capital, raqqa. there are now around 2,000 american forces in syria who are largely fighting alongside the kurdish groups. this has been a problem for america's ally turkey, which has a long-standing conflict with the kurds. u.s. troops have had run-ins with assad's forces as well as groups backed by russia and iran. since taking office, trump has ordered two strikes on areas controlled by assad in response to chemical weapons attacks. we are prepared to sustain this response, until the syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. u.s. officials and allies dispute the claim that isis has been defeated. they warn that an american departure will weaken u.s. influence in the region and may embolden russia, iran and turkey, who are also on the ground. the other worry? the move may inspire some isis fighters to return to syria.
this article is part of the on tech newsletter. you can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n\nfacebook and twitter temporarily locked president trump's accounts this week after he inspired the rampage on the capitol, and they are considering permanent bans.\n\nit's worth asking whether the major internet properties should revise their rules for him and other people with large online followings who regularly spread bogus or harmful information.\n\nthere are a small number of influential people, including the president, who have repeatedly been instrumental in stoking misinformation about the election or spreading unproven treatments for the coronavirus.\n\nif the internet companies want to give everyone a voice and create healthier online spaces, perhaps facebook, twitter and youtube should subject the prominent band of habitual online misleaders to stricter rules. this could dial back some of the internet's dangers by penalizing those who do the most harm without stifling a vast majority's free expression.
washington — this article is a collaboration between propublica and the new york times.\n\na year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the education department plans to investigate their accusations that the wolf point school district in montana discriminates against native american students.\n\nin a dec. 28 letter, sent hours after the new york times and propublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department's office for civil rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the fort peck indian reservation in eastern montana that it would look into the complaint. the board includes members of the assiniboine and sioux tribes. native american and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of wolf point's enrollment.\n\naccording to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether wolf point schools discipline native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services.\n\nthe department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent's accusations that a native student was racially harassed. the student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter.
boeing agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in a legal settlement with the justice department stemming from the 737 max debacle, the government said on thursday. the agreement resolves a criminal charge that boeing conspired to defraud the federal aviation administration, which regulates the company and evaluates its planes. with less than two weeks left in the trump administration, the agreement takes the question of how a biden justice department would view a settlement off the table. president trump had repeatedly discussed the importance of boeing to the economy, even going so far last year to say he favored a bailout for the company.\n\nelon musk, the chief executive of tesla and spacex, is now the richest person in the world. an increase in tesla's share price on thursday pushed mr. musk past jeff bezos, the founder of amazon, on the bloomberg billionaires index, a ranking of the world's 500 wealthiest people. mr. musk's net worth was $195 billion by the end of trading on thursday, $10 billion more than that of mr. bezos's. mr. musk's wealth has increased by more than $150 billion over the past 12 months, thanks to a rally in tesla's share price, which surged 743 percent in 2020. the carmaker's shares rose nearly 8 percent on thursday.\n\nwayfair, the furniture and home goods e-commerce business, said on thursday that all of its u.s. employees would be paid at least $15 an hour. the increase, which took effect on sunday, applies to full-time, part-time and seasonal employees. more than 40 percent of wayfair's hourly workers across its u.s. supply chain and customer service operations received a pay bump.
washington — the pentagon has abruptly sent the aircraft carrier nimitz home from the middle east and africa over the objections of top military advisers, marking a reversal of a weekslong muscle-flexing strategy aimed at deterring iran from attacking american troops and diplomats in the persian gulf.\n\nofficials said on friday that the acting defense secretary, christopher c. miller, had ordered the redeployment of the ship in part as a de-escalatory signal to tehran to avoid stumbling into a crisis in president trump's waning days in office. american intelligence reports indicate that iran and its proxies may be preparing a strike as early as this weekend to avenge the death of maj. gen. qassim suleimani, the commander of iran's elite quds force of the islamic revolutionary guards corps.\n\nsenior pentagon officials said that mr. miller assessed that dispatching the nimitz now, before the first anniversary this sunday of general suleimani's death in an american drone strike in iraq, could remove what iranian hard-liners see as a provocation that justifies their threats against american military targets. some analysts said the return of the nimitz to its home port of bremerton, wash., was a welcome reduction in tensions between the two countries.\n\nif the nimitz is departing, that could be because the pentagon believes that the threat could subside somewhat, said michael p. mulroy, the pentagon's former top middle east policy official.
however, reconciliation bills must follow a set of complicated requirements known as the byrd rule. the simplest way of thinking about them is that legislative provisions have to be budgetary to be allowed. that means that the process isn't ideal for writing large-scale health reform, experts say, but it may be the best tool democrats have to pass laws with their slim majority.\n\nthe democrats have to deal with robert byrd and his nattering little rule that hasn't gone away, said rodney whitlock, a vice president at mcdermott+consulting and a former health aide to senator chuck grassley who worked on reconciliation bills during his senate tenure.\n\nlegislators have often turned to reconciliation to pass health policy when their majority is slim. democrats used it in 2010 to pass final tweaks to the affordable care act after losing their supermajority. republicans used it in a failed effort to repeal the health law in 2017 and in a successful attempt later the same year to make changes to the tax code.\n\nthere are six areas of health policy where congressional aides and health policy experts could see democrats focusing their efforts this year. smaller policy reforms are expected to be easier, both legally and politically, while more ambitious policies may not easily slot into reconciliation's strict rules — or the political preferences of enough democratic lawmakers.\n\naffordable care act expansions\n\ncongress is most likely to act on a set of changes meant to expand the affordable care act and to make health coverage less expensive for those who buy their own plans. one priority is raising the income ceiling for those who receives subsidies, expanding the number of people who qualify for help. another is rewriting formulas to peg the size of the subsidy to a more generous health insurance plan, a way to increase the amount of assistance.
on monday, mathilde krim died. she was a biologist who spoke five languages; who contributed, in her 20s and 30s, to more than a dozen papers on cancer and virology; ran the interferon lab at memorial sloan kettering; served on a team that developed a method for determining sex in utero; smuggled guns to opponents of british rule in palestine; threw john f. kennedy's 45th-birthday party at her east side townhouse; married twice, had a daughter and later received the presidential medal of freedom for her historic work in aids research and advocacy. at the news of her death, the internet paid relatively little attention.\n\ninstead, by the next morning, the leading conversation among women whose voices are prominent on social media revolved around the story of a young photographer who had a demoralizing sexual encounter with aziz ansari, after going out for lobster rolls with him a few months ago. the woman, who used the alias grace, recalled the events of the evening, which began with drinks at mr. ansari's downtown apartment and ended with recycled jokes and uber and sorrow, to a writer for an online publication, babe. we are meant to infer that the comedian's self-regarding erotic misbehavior began the moment he gave his guest a glass of white wine when she wanted red — there's no place for speculating that maybe he just ran out of syrah.\n\ngrace came to view what happened as assault, even if the facts she presents do not warrant the charge. mr. ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual. he continued, he said, to support the essential movement toward sexual equilibrium that was upending the old order, and the world appeared willing to let him do it — few people seeming to demand that his distasteful persistence leave him expelled from public life.
members of congress have serious, urgent concerns about the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward, ms. pelosi said in a statement. our concerns were not addressed by the president's insufficient war powers act notification and by the administration's briefing today.\n\nthe day after iranian missile struck bases in iraq where american troops are stationed, republicans and democrats in congress split sharply over the president's approach on iran and the way forward. amid back-to-back classified briefings by top administration officials for members of the house and senate, most republicans praised mr. trump effusively on wednesday for targeting general suleimani and for his restraint in responding to iran's action.\n\nsenator mitch mcconnell, republican of kentucky and the majority leader, said the president had shown patience and prudence.\n\nas a superpower, we have the capacity to exercise restraint and to respond at a time and place of our choosing, if need be, he said. i believe the president wants to avoid conflict or needless loss of life. but he's rightly prepared to protect american lives and interests.\n\nbut a couple of republicans joined democrats in raising grave questions about mr. trump's strategy, concerns that only sharpened after the briefings on capitol hill by secretary of state mike pompeo, defense secretary mark t. esper, and the c.i.a. director, gina haspel.
i don't really remember when i pulled the black everlane pants out of the drawer and onto my body. was it spring, after the lockdown started and we were still doing videoconference happy hours for fun? or the summer, when the rhythms of remote work seemed to settle in? or the fall, when i began to see my co-workers do things like put on earrings for a meeting while i was still trying to keep the camera off for as long as possible?\n\nrecalling the pants' entrance into pandemic life is difficult because this particular pair of pants — priced at $98, made of an italian wool trademarked as goweave — is supposed to transcend any one season. what this means is that it is not right for any season. they are too hot in summer, too flimsy in the winter, easily soaked by spring showers and … well, they are ok in the fall.\n\nthe fabric feels cheap, though. i hate the fabric. i hate the fit. they squeeze my thighs when i pull them up to my natural waist and flatten my butt when they fall to my hips. they are bulky without keeping me warm, and there is no shirt that can make the awkward length — too long to be short pants, too short to cover my ankles — work at all. and yet, beginning in september, i have been wearing them at least three times a week.\n\nthis is, as i have been telling anyone who will listen, a hate-wear. i am now hate-wearing clothing.
how mr. trump sees the killing of general suleimani as advancing his broader agenda on iran is unclear, and on friday he seemed to portray the operation as something of a one-off: a necessary step to ensure that tensions between the united states and iran do not spiral out of control. general suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks before we caught him in the act and terminated him, the president said from his resort in palm beach, fla., although administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what they said the general had been orchestrating for years.\n\nwe took action last night to stop a war. we did not take action to start a war, mr. trump said. the president's decision to kill the general at this time appeared to many military experts as a potentially reckless escalation. but his policy toward iran, what administration officials call a maximum pressure campaign, has long underestimated how the country would respond to economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.\n\nwhen iranian operatives blew holes in oil tankers in the gulf of oman in june and launched drone strikes on saudi oil facilities in september, mr. trump opted in both cases against a direct, immediate military response. still, one day after the drone strike targeting general suleimani, the pentagon announced it was sending around 3,000 more troops to kuwait as a precaution against growing threats to american forces in the region.\n\nlindsay p. cohn, a professor of political science at the naval war college, said that mr. trump appears to be convinced that general suleimani's death will not lead to a significant surge of violence in the middle east. it satisfies two imperatives for him: appearing to look tough without taking on, at least for now, any new commitments.\n\nhe doesn't want to get entangled. but he doesn't want to look weak, said professor cohn, adding that her opinions did not necessarily represent those of the defense department.\n\nthe president's mercurial approach to iran has left a trail of alienated allies — including european nato allies angry about his decision to withdraw from the 2015 iran nuclear deal and arab nations in the persian gulf region uncertain about mr. trump's resolve to support them in the face of direct attack from iran.
the phrase jacksonian belongs to the foreign policy scholar walter russell mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides american foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: hamiltonian, wilsonian, jacksonian and jeffersonian. the worldviews are simplifications (intended to be suggestive and evocative, in mead's words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, american foreign policy tends to work.\n\nthe hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. the wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the united states military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.\n\nbut far more american voters are either jacksonians or jeffersonians. the jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, america retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and america's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (no blood for oil is the defining jeffersonian attitude toward all our middle eastern misadventures.) the jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (more rubble, less trouble is the essential jacksonian credo.) since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in washington, d.c., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize jacksonian or jeffersonian sentiment to achieve hamiltonian or wilsonian ends.\n\nbut when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get jeffersonians and jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of george mcgovern and george wallace when the vietnam war went bad. and when one party's elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual jacksonian in the white house.\n\nyes, not everything trump has done fits mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly jacksonian. a hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against north korea; a wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. a hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with china; a wilsonian would speak out more clearly against beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of syria and afghanistan are patently jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. his eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are jacksonianism at its worst.
according to them, a standard american home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. in many places, that's what the prices roughly are. but for a few metropolitan areas like san francisco and boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.\n\nwe would still see homes of different sizes and styles — condos in some places, single-family homes in others — depending on the market in each city. a new york home would be smaller than one in, say, houston.\n\nand prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. it's easier to build in phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in san francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). but while building in the san francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it's not that expensive. by the paper's calculations, a home in the san francisco area should cost around $281,000.\n\nthe actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). the paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. the result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.\n\npeople are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. many studies, from the mckinsey global institute, california's legislative analyst's office and others, have shown that california's high home prices are largely a supply problem: the state doesn't build enough homes.\n\nthere are counterexamples around the world. tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand are met with increases in new building.\n\nso let's carry on with this hypothetical. say we opened the floodgate of development. what kind of effects could we expect? the economy would grow, and by a lot. according to a recent paper by the economists chang-tai hsieh, from the university of chicago's booth school of business, and enrico moretti, from the university of california, berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the united states' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.
you follow advice and then find out years later that it was the wrong advice, ms. doggart posted on the facebook page of kidswithfoodallergies.org.'oh no. wait. we were mistaken. it's actually the opposite thing you should be doing!'\n\nbut others reacted with sadness, wondering whether better information earlier on might have prevented their children's allergies. it is a bit disheartening and frustrating, heather eslinger, a physical therapist in colorado springs whose children have nut allergies, said in an interview. it is hard to accept that things may have been different had we known then what we know now.\n\nwhile national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time — menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples — few topics are as fraught as food allergies. for starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly. as a result, parents are particularly fearful about following the advice.\n\ni gave my 5-month-old a bit of my toast and peanut butter and we ended up in the emergency room, said lori dombek, 58, a web developer in gorham, me., whose son is now 22. peanut allergies are nothing to fool with.\n\nbut scientists say the new guidelines are based on the latest science. a large clinical trial studied hundreds of british children at risk for peanut allergies, giving them either peanut-containing food regularly from infancy or withholding all foods with peanuts.\n\nby the age of 5, the trial found, those who had been given peanut-containing food early in life had an 80 percent reduced risk of developing a peanut allergy.\n\nthe trial's results were very very unambiguous, said dr. matthew greenhawt, chairman of the american college of allergy, asthma and immunology's food allergy committee and one of the authors of the new guidelines. the fact that the guidelines changed over time makes them more credible, not less, he said.
battered by a wave of coronavirus infections and deaths, local jails and state prison systems around the united states have resorted to a drastic strategy to keep the virus at bay: shutting down completely and transferring their inmates elsewhere.\n\nfrom california to missouri to pennsylvania, state and local officials say that so many guards have fallen ill with the virus and are unable to work that abruptly closing some correctional facilities is the only way to maintain community security and prisoner safety.\n\nexperts say the fallout is easy to predict: the jails and prisons that stay open will probably become even more crowded, unsanitary and disease-ridden, and the transfers are likely to help the virus proliferate both inside and outside the walls.\n\nmovement of people is dangerous, said lauren brinkley-rubinstein, a professor at the university of north carolina school of medicine, who has been tracking coronavirus cases in correctional settings. we've got really good examples of overcrowding equals more infection and greater risk of outbreak. we've got lots of evidence that even transferring people from one facility to the next is very dangerous.
there's really no difference, which is actually quite remarkable when you think about the additional layer of stigma these children are growing up with, she said.\n\ncritics of same-sex parenting have frequently pointed to a 2012 study by a university of texas sociologist that suggests children of gay and lesbian parents are significantly different from children raised by heterosexual couples. that study has been roundly criticized by others in academia.\n\njudge nance's decision to recuse himself comes less than two years after kim davis, a county clerk in kentucky, defied federal court orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses because it went against her christian beliefs. she was jailed for her refusal and became a symbol of the resistance to same-sex marriage.\n\nthe family foundation, a lexington-based group that says it seeks to strengthen kentucky families, offered praise for judge nance's decision, saying, judges have a right of conscience like everyone else.\n\nif we are going to let liberal judges write their personal biases and prejudices into law, as we have done on issues of marriage and sexuality, then, in the interest of fairness, we are going to have to allow judges with different views to at least recuse themselves from such cases, martin cothran, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement.\n\nother judges have faced consequences for similar stances on l.g.b.t. issues. a judge in wyoming was censured in march for refusing to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, and an alabama judge was suspended in september for ordering probate judges to defy federal orders to issue marriage licenses.\n\nsome critics called for judge nance to resign or face ethics charges after thursday's order. chris hartman, director of the fairness campaign, an l.g.b.t. advocacy group, said the order displayed clear discrimination.
kristoff st. john, who won two daytime emmy awards during his long tenure on the cbs soap opera the young and the restless, was found dead early sunday morning at his home in los angeles. he was 52.\n\nsarah ardalani, a public information officer at the los angeles county medical examiner's office, confirmed the death. she said that an autopsy had been conducted but that the cause of death had not been determined.\n\nmr. st. john spoke openly about his depression after his 24-year-old son, julian, committed suicide in 2014. mark geragos, mr. st. john's lawyer and friend, said in a telephone interview on monday that mr. st. john had told him recently that his grief and depression had worsened.\n\nmr. st. john began playing neil winters, a cosmetics executive who struggled with infidelity, alcoholism and many other plot twists, on the young and the restless in 1991. he most recently appeared as the character in january, completing nearly 1,700 episodes of the show.
who will win? we'd love to know, too. our awards-season expert, kyle buchanan, has made his oscar predictions, and the short answer is that the world war i drama 1917 is well-positioned. then again the south korean thriller parasite could pose strong competition. buchanan also expects the quartet of joaquin phoenix (joker), renée zellweger (judy), brad pitt (once upon a time … in hollywood) and laura dern (marriage story) to take home acting trophies, as they have all season long.\n\nwho will be presenting? the academy has announced a long list of household names, including will ferrell, gal gadot, salma hayek, mindy kaling, spike lee, lin-manuel miranda, keanu reeves, maya rudolph and timothée chalamet.\n\nwhat else should i expect? there will probably be remembrances of kirk douglas, who died on wednesday, and kobe bryant, the basketball star who won an oscar for a short film made after he retired. and there will reportedly be a special performance by janelle monáe with elton john and randy newman.
i called the police and was connected to the dispatch office in the county where the avalanche had occurred. the dispatcher asked for my husband's name. i told her. hold on a minute, she said. she returned to the line. well, we don't have his name right here, she said. i will have the coroner call you back one way or the other. that should have been my clue. either she didn't want to tell me or she wasn't authorized to deliver the news.\n\nthe doorbell rang. i opened the door to the three sheriff's deputies. i managed to speak first. it was him, wasn't it? i said. my voice was barely a squeak. my tears started as they asked if they could come in. one of them was a chaplain, who sat on the couch and confirmed my fears. much after that is a blur. many other phone calls were made: to a friend who would come over so i wouldn't be alone; to my parents, who would fly out the next day to be with me. the conversation with the deputies came around to informing chris's mother. she was in kentucky. one of them called to lexington. the police there were busy with new year's eve festivities. the deputy called a fire chief, who said he didn't feel comfortable with the task. it was left to me.\n\nit was approaching midnight where chris's mom lived. i wondered: should i wait until morning? i dreaded causing her the pain i knew was to come. the wretched cry i had heard from my own mother minutes before would surely be multiplied a hundredfold. for a moment i thought that if i could wait until morning maybe i would think of the right words. there are many gaps in my memories of that night. one comment i do remember was this: i'm a father, one of the deputies said. i would want to know now. i made the call. i told her that, yes, his body had been recovered and passed on the coroner's contact information. she responded with tears and devastation and shared in my disbelief of whether this moment was real.\n\nchris's urge to be in the mountains was related to his postwar adjustments, and it became central to his regeneration and health. but i didn't blame the war for his death. his drive to pursue his passions outside of his first career gave me the resolve to do the same. six months after he died, i left the army, moved across the country and started medical school. becoming a physician requires years of intensive practice and study, and in this early stage of my career, i know i should be more concerned with learning drug names or the proper quantity of fluid boluses. yet it's the act of communicating bad news to patients and their families that i often ponder. i came to medical school having served around violence and trauma, and having already received and given a death notification. i've learned that the worst moments in someone's life can be a haze with few distinct memories. in these moments it matters less what you say than how you say it. people in pain remember compassion, like the compassion i received from the deputies who sat on the couch with me and didn't leave until i was no longer alone.\n\ni am trying to apply this lesson as i follow chris's example, knowing that as an emergency-medicine physician, it's inevitable that i will be informing families about a loved one's death. i don't view this as a dreaded duty. it is part of being human and connecting with others. i want to pass this knowledge on.
in saudi arabia, all women are required to have a male guardian, whose permission they need to get married, travel and undergo some medical procedures. the guardian is often a father or husband, but can be a brother or even a son.\n\nthe kingdom's day-to-day ruler, crown prince mohammed bin salman, has vowed to make life better for saudi women. he defanged the once-feared religious police, who harassed women deemed inappropriately dressed, and last year he lifted the ban on women driving. saudi women can now attend mixed concerts and pursue careers off limits to their mothers.\n\n[read about the challenges that remained for saudi women after the driving ban was lifted.]\n\nwhen asked about guardianship laws last year, the prince said that saudi arabia had to figure out a way to treat this that doesn't harm families and doesn't harm the culture.\n\nthose moves have increased his popularity among saudi women, many of whom say guardianship is not a burden because their male relatives take good care of them. others escape the rules by seeking jobs in neighboring countries like the united arab emirates, where social rules are more lax.\n\nbut the system's critics say it gives no recourse to women with controlling or abusive guardians.\n\nthat's what sent nourah, 20, fleeing for australia. her father had divorced her mother before nourah was born, and she was raised mostly by her uncles, she said. her father sometimes abused her, but her efforts to get help fell on deaf ears.\n\nlast year, her boyfriend wanted to marry her, but her family refused because they perceived him as coming from a lower social class, said nourah, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used for her safety. her father began to arrange her marriage to a man she did not know and who wanted to bar her from working. in october, a day before her prospective groom arrived, she ran away.
the outsider art fair, up at the metropolitan pavilion in chelsea until sunday, is still one of the best deals in new york: compact, but filled from edge to edge with things to see. you can brush up on the heroes of the genre — work by self-taught artists — with a stunning henry darger panorama at andrew edlin at booth d14, and a gorgeous, never-before-shown martín ramírez drawing of a cowboy on a rearing purple horse at ricco/maresca (a11). you can make new discoveries, like the off-center flower paintings of john maull at tierra del sol (b1), or the eye-grabbing shopping-bag paintings of a retired peruvian parachute trooper who goes by judá ben hur at gabby yamamoto/espacio (b5).\n\nthis year, its 28th in new york, the fair has also introduced a diffident handful of curated booths, including the writer and curator paul laster's relishing the raw: contemporary artists collecting outsider art (a8), in which mr. laster teases out suggestive connections between contemporary artists and their own personal collections: it's like listening to a british invasion rocker talk about his favorite blues records. below are seven of my own favorite booths to get you started, but you're almost guaranteed, just by setting foot in the door, to find something i overlooked.
cooper jameson kupp jr. — nicknamed june, as in junior, by his parents — did not know the significance behind the note his mother asked him to deliver last may. but the 2-year-old eagerly complied, bouncing over to his father.\n\ncooper kupp, a sure-handed receiver for the los angeles rams, scanned the piece of paper, then leapt past his surprised son to embrace his wife, anna kupp. the message: june would soon be a big brother.\n\ndisbelief washed over cooper.\n\njune had been a blessing, arriving shortly after the couple decided to start a family. this time, the second time around, it took a little longer, cooper said during a recent zoom call. this was something we were trying for and just hadn't happened for us yet.\n\nsuddenly, the couple needed a game plan. navigating a pregnancy is strenuous for any expectant parent. for professional athletes, unyielding schedules can intrude on family obligations under the best of conditions. in the n.f.l., rigid coronavirus protocols have forced players to make tough work-life decisions as they trudge through the pandemic season.
at its most fundamental, a dinner party is an act of generosity: come to my place; share my bounty. of course, it's rarely that simple. historically, the powerful have used these gatherings to flaunt their resources; social and political intimidation in the guise of hospitality. in the potlatch — a ritual practiced during precolonial times by indigenous tribes of the northwest coast, including the tlingit and the kwakiutl — the high-ranking host plied guests with enormous amounts of food (like fish oil served via quart-size spoons), often until they threw up. then he extravagantly gave away his most prized possessions — or destroyed them in a bonfire, just to show that he could. to save face, a guest from a rival village might counter with an even bigger feast.\n\nin the hermetic kingdom of the dining room, the host is at once benefactor and dictator. alfred hitchcock planted whoopee cushions on seats, dyed food blue and reversed the order in which courses were served, beginning with dessert, all to toy with guests. less whimsically, during the renaissance, the aristocratic borgias were rumored to poison them. even without the threat of assassination, a dinner party can feel like a series of psychological tests: the table set with tiny implements of inscrutable purpose, the small talk like needles through the eyes. the oxford dictionary of psychology by andrew m. colman includes a listing for deipnophobia, fear of dinner parties — defined as irrational, although i'd argue it's a defensive response to our divided modern times.\n\nfor if, as some have argued, dinner parties heralded the dawn of civilization, in this brawling era they might soon hasten its end. anxiety over forced commingling may explain why the trope of the nightmare feast has taken hold in the imaginations of contemporary artists. in the filmmaker sally potter's recent farce the party, guests are at each other's throats before they down a single hors d'oeuvre. shattering revelations bring a whiff of hell: i smell burning, a guest says. the vol-au-vents, the hostess sighs, momentarily distracted from her disemboweled marriage. thomas adès's opera the exterminating angel, which had its american premiere this fall, revisits the surrealist luis buñuel's 1962 film of the same title, in which socialites at a posh soiree can't muster the will to leave. they stay, trapped by their own ennui, until food and drink run out, until the mask — of who they strive to be in the presence of others — slips, and they wind up slaughtering a sheep and roasting it over a burning cello. (in uncanny synergy, buñuel's vision has likewise infiltrated both a musical-in-progress by stephen sondheim and david ives, and darren aronofsky's vexed 2017 horror movie, mother!, which ends in cannibalism and an ugly subversion of the last supper.)\n\nwhy, then, does it seem as if everybody is throwing dinner parties again? we could glibly dismiss it as an offshoot of the current obsession with food; amateur chefs looking to unleash their inner yotam ottolenghi on a captive audience. but these days, when our greatest intimacy is with our iphones and the spectral kinship of social media has supplanted the immediacy of analog conversation, the true hunger is for earnest connection. and so a new strain of dinner party dispenses with formality in favor of sincerity. gone are the napkins tortured into swans and the postprandial triage that shunted women to the drawing room while men dealt business. instead, tables might be strewn with tea lights bought by the hundred at ikea and dessert might be klondikes from the corner bodega. in a communal, nigh utopian spirit, guests share in the labor and often bring dishes of their own, rehabilitating the idea of the potluck — which has nothing to do, etymologically, with potlatch: it derives from the 16th-century english pot-lucke, in which unexpected guests made do with whatever was already in the pot. for every dinner party that leaves family bonds and lifelong friendships in smoldering ruins, there is another that unites and reaffirms: yes, we really like each other.
arnold l. lehman is echt brooklyn.\n\nthe former director of the brooklyn museum, who served for almost 18 years, mr. lehman, 72, was born in the borough. and he lives there, too, in a spacious brooklyn heights apartment with his wife, pamela.\n\ntrue to form, he has a wisecrack at the ready. asked about his current job, as a senior adviser to the chairman of phillips auction house: to me, senior adviser means someone very old with a big mouth.\n\nbut the lehmans are serious when it comes to collecting contemporary art. they have a tracy-and-hepburn-style disagreement about exactly how many works they own: he says 300, she says 120. so they settle on 200. that kind of compromise may be why the marriage has lasted since 1969.\n\nthe lehmans have filled up not only their high-ceiling floor-through in brooklyn, but also a house in maine and an apartment in miami. so they've finally slowed down. collecting is a lot easier now that we're not collecting anymore, said mr. lehman, who also formerly led the baltimore museum of art.
i\n\nthe horoscope was confounding. if the famous guerrilla revolutionary ernesto che guevara was born on june 14, 1928, as stated on his birth certificate, then he was a gemini--and a lackluster one at that. the astrologer, a friend of che's mother, did her calculations again to find a mistake, but the results she came up with were the same. the che that emerged was a grey, dependent personality who had lived an uneventful life. there were only two possibilities: either she was right about che, or she was worthless as an astrologer.\n\nwhen shown the dismal horoscope, che's mother laughed. she then confided a secret she had guarded closely for over three decades. her famous son had actually been born one month earlier, on may 14. he was no gemini, but a headstrong and decisive taurus.\n\nthe deception had been necessary, she explained, because she was three months pregnant on the day she married che's father. immediately after their wedding, the couple had left buenos aires for the remote jungle backwater of misiones. there, as her husband set himself up as an enterprising yerba mate planter, she went through her pregnancy away from the prying eyes of buenos aires society. when she was near term, they traveled down the parana river to the city of rosario. she gave birth there, and a doctor friend falsified the date on her baby's birth certificate, moving it forward by one month to help shield them from scandal.\n\nwhen their baby son was a month old, the couple notified their families. their story was that they had tried to reach buenos aires, but at rosario celia guevara had gone into labor prematurely. a baby born at seven months, after all, is not an out-of-the-question occurrence. if there were any doubts, the couple's story and their child's official birth date were quietly accepted by their families and friends, and remained unchallenged for years.\n\nif that child had not grown up to become the renowned revolutionary che, his parents' secret might well have gone with them to their graves. he must be one of the rare public figures of modern times whose birth and death certificates are both falsified. yet it seems uniquely fitting that guevara, who spent most of his adult life engaged in clandestine activities and who died as the result of a secret conspiracy, should have also begun life with a subterfuge.\n\nii\n\nwhen, in 1927, ernesto guevara lynch first met celia de la serna, she had just graduated from the exclusive buenos aires catholic girls' school, sacre coeur. she was a dramatic-looking girl of twenty with an aquiline nose, wavy dark hair, and brown eyes. celia was well read but unworldly, devout but questioning. ripe, in other words, for a romantic adventure.\n\ncelia de la serna was a true argentine blue blood of undiluted spanish noble lineage. one ancestor had been the spanish royal viceroy of colonial peru; another a famous argentine military general. her paternal grandfather had been a wealthy landowner, and celia's own father had been a renowned law professor, congressman, and ambassador. both he and his wife died while celia was still a child, leaving her and her six brothers and sisters to be raised by a religious guardian aunt. but despite her parents' untimely deaths, the family had conserved its revenue-producing estates, and celia was due a comfortable inheritance when she reached the legal age of twenty-one.\n\nat twenty-seven, ernesto guevara lynch was both moderately tall and handsome, with a strong chin and jaw. the glasses he wore for astigmatism gave him a deceptively clerkish appearance, for he had an ebullient, gregarious personality, a hot temper, and an outsized imagination. he also possessed argentine surnames of good vintage: he was the great-grandson of one of south america's richest men, and his ancestors included both spanish and irish nobility. but over the years, his family had lost most of its fortune.\n\nduring the nineteenth century rosas tyranny, the male heirs of the wealthy guevara and lynch clans had fled argentina to join the california gold rush. after returning from exile, their american-born offspring, roberto guevara castro and ana isabel lynch, had married. ernesto was the sixth of their eleven children. they lived well, but they were no longer landed gentry. while her husband worked as a geographical surveyor, ana isabel raised the children in buenos aires. they summered at a rustic country house on her inherited slice of the old family seat. to prepare his son for a working life, roberto guevara had sent him to a state-run school, telling him: the only aristocracy i believe in is the aristocracy of talent.\n\nbut ernesto still belonged by birthright to argentine society. he had grown up on his mother's stories of california frontier life, and listening to his father's own terrifying tales of indian attacks and sudden death in the high andes. his family's illustrious and adventurous past was a legacy too powerful to overcome. he was nineteen when his father died, and although he went to college, studying architecture and engineering, he dropped out before graduation. he wanted to have his own adventures and make his own fortune, and he used his father's modest inheritance to pursue the goal.\n\nby the time he met celia, ernesto had invested most of his money with a wealthy relative in a yacht-building company, the astillero san isidro. he worked there for a time as an overseer, but it was not enough to hold his interest. soon he was enthused about a new project: a friend had convinced him he could make his fortune by growing yerba mate, the stimulating native tea ritually drunk by millions of argentines.\n\nland was cheap in the yerba-growing province of misiones, twelve hundred miles up the parana river from buenos aires on argentina's northern border with paraguay and brazil. originally settled by jesuit missionaries and their guarani indian converts in the sixteenth century, annexed only fifty years earlier by argentina, misiones was just then opening up to settlement. land speculators, well-heeled adventurers, and poor european migrants were flocking in. guevara lynch went to see it for himself, and caught yerba mate fever. his own money was tied up in the astillero, but, with celia's inheritance, they would be able to buy enough land for a yerba mate plantation, and, he hoped, become rich from the lucrative green gold.\n\nunsurprisingly, celia's family closed ranks in opposition to her dilettante suitor. celia was not yet twenty-one, and under argentine law she needed her family's approval to marry or receive her inheritance. she asked for it, but they refused. desperate, for by now she was pregnant, she and ernesto staged an elopement to force her family's consent. she ran away to an older sister's house. the show of force worked. the marriage was approved, but celia still had to go to court to win her inheritance. by order of the judge, she was granted a portion of her inheritance, including title to a cattle and grain-producing estancia in central cordoba province, and some cash bonds from her trust fund--enough to buy a mate plantation in misiones.\n\non november 10, 1927, she and ernesto were wed in a private ceremony at the home of a married older sister, edelmira moore de la serna. la prensa of buenos aires gave the news in its dia social column. immediately afterward, they fled buenos aires for the wilderness of misiones bearing their mutual secret. together we decided what to do with our lives, wrote guevara lynch in a memoir published years later. behind lay the penitences, the prudery and the tight circle of relatives and friends who wanted to impede our marriage.\n\niii\n\nin 1832, british naturalist charles darwin had witnessed the atrocities waged against argentina's native indians by gaucho warlord juan manuel de rosas, and predicted: the country will be in the hands of white gaucho savages instead of copper-coloured indians. the former being a little superior in education, as they are inferior in every moral virtue.\n\nbut even as the blood flowed, argentina had spawned its own pantheon of civic-minded historical heroes, from general jose de san martin, the country's liberator in the independence struggle with spain, to domingo sarmiento, the crusading journalist, educator, and president who had finally wrested argentina into the modern age as a unified republic. sarmiento's 1845 book, facundo (civilization and barbarity), had been a clarion call to his compatriots to choose the path of civilized man over the brutality of the archetypal argentine frontiersman, the gaucho.\n\nyet even sarmiento had wielded a dictator's authority to lead the country, and with his death the argentine cult of the strongman, or caudillo, had not disappeared. caudillismo would remain a feature of politics well into the next century as government swung back and forth between caudillos and democrats in a bewildering, cyclical dance. indeed, as if reflecting the sharp contrasts of the great land they had conquered, there was an unreconciled duality in the argentine temperament, seemingly balanced in a state of perpetual tension between savagery and enlightenment. at once passionate, volatile, and racist, argentines were also expansive, humorous, and hospitable. the paradox had produced a flourishing culture and found expression in classic works of literature such as ricardo guiraldes's don segundo sombra and the gaucho epic poem martin fierro by jose hernandez.\n\nsince the 1870s, the country had become more stable. and, when the conquest of the southern pampas was finally secured after an officially sponsored campaign to exterminate the native indian population, vast new lands had opened up for colonization. the pampas were fenced in as grazing and farming lands; new towns and industries sprang up; railroads, ports, and roads were built. by the turn of the century, its population had tripled, swollen by the influx of over a million immigrants from italy, spain, germany, britain, russia, and the middle east who had poured into the rich southern land of opportunity--and still they came.\n\na dismal colonial garrison on the vast rio de la plata estuary only a century before, the city of buenos aires now had a melting pot's combustive quality, epitomized by the sensuous new culture of tango, its dark-eyed crooner carlos gardel giving redolent voice to a burgeoning national pride. its population spoke their own creole street dialect called lunfardo, an argentine cockney rich in double entendres, cribbed from quechua, italian, and local gaucho spanish.\n\nthe city's docks were bustling: ships carried argentina's meat, grains, and hides off to europe while others docked bringing american studebakers, gramophones, and the latest paris fashions. the city boasted an opera house, a stock exchange, and a fine university; rows of imposing neoclassical public buildings and private mansions; landscaped green parks with shade trees and polo fields, as well as ample boulevards graced with heroic statues and sparkling fountains. electric streetcars rattled and zinged along cobbled streets past elegant, bronzed-doored confiterias and wiskerias with gold lettering on etched glass windows. in their mirrored and marble interiors, haughty white-jacketed waiters with slicked-down hair posed and swooped like vigilant, gleaming eagles.\n\nbut while buenos aires's portenos, as they called themselves, looked to europe for their cultural comparisons, much of the interior still languished in nineteenth-century neglect. in the north, despotic provincial caudillos held sway over vast expanses of cotton- and sugar-growing lands. among their workers, diseases such as leprosy, malaria, and even bubonic plague were still common. in the andean provinces, the indigenous quechua- and aymara-speaking indians known as coyas lived in conditions of extreme poverty. women would not be given the vote for another two decades, and legal divorce would take even longer. vigilante justice and indentured servitude were features of life in much of the hinterland.\n\nargentina's political system had not kept pace with its changing society and had stagnated. for decades, two parties, the radical and the conservative, had ruled the country's destiny. the current radical president, hipolito yrigoyen, was aging and eccentric, a sphinxlike figure who rarely spoke or appeared in public. workers had few rights, and strikes were often suppressed by gunfire and police batons. criminals were transported by ship to serve terms of imprisonment in the cold southern wastes of patagonia. but, with immigration and the twentieth century, new political ideas had also arrived. feminists, socialists, anarchists, and now fascists began making their voices heard. in the argentina of 1927, political and social change was inevitable, but had not yet come.\n\niv\n\nwith celia's money, guevara lynch bought two hundred hectares (about five hundred acres) of jungle along the banks of the rio parana. on a bluff overlooking the coffee-colored water and the dense green forest of the paraguayan shore, they erected a roomy wooden house on stilts, with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse. they were a long way from the comforts of buenos aires, but guevara lynch was enraptured. with an entrepreneur's eager eye, he looked into the jungle around him, and he saw the future.\n\nperhaps he believed he could, as his grandfathers had done before him, restore the family fortunes by intrepidly striking out into new and unexplored lands. whether or not he was consciously emulating his forefathers' experiences, it is clear that for guevara lynch, misiones was his own wild west adventure. to him, it was not just another backward argentine province, but a thrilling place full of ferocious beasts, dangerous work, robbery and murders, jungle cyclones, interminable rains and tropical diseases.\n\nhe wrote: there, in mysterious misiones ... everything attracts and entraps. it attracts like all that is dangerous, and entraps like all that is passionate. there, nothing was familiar, not its soil, its climate, its vegetation, nor its jungle full of wild animals, and even less its inhabitants.... from the moment one stepped on its shores, one felt that the safety of one's life lay in the machete or revolver....\n\ntheir homestead was in a place named puerto caraguatai, named in guarani after a beautiful native red flower, but its puerto was just a small wooden jetty. caraguatai was reached by a two-day river journey up from the old trading port of posadas on the ibera, a venerable victorian paddle-wheel steamer that had done prior service carrying british colonials up the nile. the nearest outpost was the small german settlers' community of montecarlo, five miles away, but the guevaras found they had a friendly neighbor who lived a few minutes' walk through the forest. charles benson was a retired english railway engineer and an avid angler, and just above the river he had built himself a white, rambling bungalow with its own internal water closet imported from england.\n\nfor a few months, the guevaras spent an enjoyable time settling in and exploring the area. they sportfished, boated, and rode horses with benson, or else drove into montecarlo on their mule-drawn buggy. to eight-year-old gertrudis kraft, whose parents ran a little hostel on the montecarlo road, the guevaras were admirable, rich and elegant people, whose rustic home by the river was a mansion.\n\nthe guevaras' honeymoon idyll, such as it was, did not last long. within a few short months, celia's pregnancy was well advanced, and it was time to return to civilization, where she could give birth in greater comfort and security. the couple set out downriver and ended their journey in rosario, an important parana port city of three hundred thousand inhabitants. there, celia went into labor, and their son ernesto guevara de la serna was born.\n\nhis doctored birth certificate, drawn up at the civil registrar's office on june 15, was witnessed by a cousin of guevara lynch's who lived in rosario and a brazilian taxi driver evidently drafted at the last minute. the document says the baby was delivered at 3:05 a.m. on the morning of june 14, in his parent's domicile on calle entre rios 480.\n\nthe guevaras remained in rosario while celia recovered from the delivery of ernestito. they rented a spacious, three-bedroom apartment with servant's quarters in an exclusive new residential building near the city center, at the address given on the birth certificate. their stay was prolonged when, shortly after his birth, the baby contracted bronchial pneumonia. ernesto's mother, ana isabel lynch, and his spinster sister ercilia came to help out.\n\nif the couple's families suspected anything, they kept quiet about it. che's younger brother roberto says that his mother told him that ernesto was born in a clinic in rosario on the 14 of june 1928. the address that appears on the birth register is where he lived the first days, but not where he was born. possibly it was the house of a friend, or that of the taxi driver who was a witness....\n\nof course, the truth, as celia later told julia constenla de giussani (who had arranged for che's astral chart to be drawn up by their mutual astrologist friend), was that she had actually given birth in may, on the same day, and at the same hour as a striking dockworker nicknamed diente de oro (gold tooth) died of gunshot wounds.\n\nthe yellowing archives of rosario's daily newspaper la capital confirm the story. in may 1928, a strike by rosario's dockworkers had escalated into violence. almost every day, stabbings and shootings had taken place, most of them carried out by strikebreaking armed scabs working for the stevedores' hiring agency, the sociedad patronal. at 5:30 p.m. on tuesday, may 13, 1928, a twenty-eight-year-old stevedore named ramon romero, alias diente de oro, was shot in the head during a fracas at the puerto san martin. at dawn the next day, may 14, he died in the granaderos a caballo hospital in san lorenzo, about twenty kilometers north of rosario.\n\nv\n\nafter a whirlwind round of visits with their families in buenos aires to show off their infant son, the guevaras returned to their homestead in misiones.\n\nguevara lynch now made a serious attempt to get his plantation off the ground. he hired a paraguayan foreman, or capataz, named curtido, to oversee the clearing of his land and the planting of his first crop of yerba mate. but when it came to hiring laborers, he had to confront the system of labor bondage, still practiced widely in the untamed region.\n\nin misiones, loggers and owners of yerbatales usually hired itinerant guarani indian laborers called mensu, who were given binding contracts and cash advances against future work. paid low wages according to how much they produced, mensu received not cash but private bonds, valid only to purchase basic essentials at the overpriced plantation stores. the system virtually ensured that they could never redeem their original debts. armed plantation guards called capangas kept vigilant watch over the work crews to prevent escapes, and violent deaths by gunshot and machete were frequent occurrences. fugitive mensu who escaped the capangas but fell into the hands of police were inevitably returned to their patrones. guevara lynch hired mensu himself, but he was no yerba baron, and, horrified at the stories he heard, he paid his workers in cash. it made him a popular patron, and many years later, he was still remembered by local workers as a good man.\n\nas guevara lynch worked his plantation, his young son was learning how to walk. to help train him, his father used to send him to the kitchen with a little pot of yerba mate to give the cook for boiling. invariably stumbling along the way, ernestito would angrily pick himself up and carry on. another routine developed as a consequence of the pernicious insects that infested caraguatai. every night, while his son lay sleeping in his crib, guevara lynch and curtido crept quietly into his room. while his patron trained a flashlight on his son, curtido carefully used the burning tip of his cigarette to dislodge the day's harvest of chiggers burrowed into the baby's flesh.\n\nin march 1929, celia became pregnant again. she hired a young galician-born nanny to look after ernestito, who was not yet a year old. carmen arias proved to be a welcome new addition to the family; she would live with the guevaras until her own marriage eight years later, and remain a lifelong family friend. freed from child-minding, celia began taking daily swims in the parana. she was a good swimmer, but one day when she was six month's pregnant, the river's current caught her. she would probably have drowned if two of her husband's axmen clearing the forest nearby hadn't seen her and thrown out liana vines to pull her to safety.\n\nguevara lynch reprovingly recalled many such near-drowning episodes involving celia in the early years of their marriage. already, celia and ernesto's very different personalities had begun to collide. she was aloof, a loner, and seemingly immune to fear, while he was an emotionally needy man who liked having people around him, a chronic worrier whose vivid imagination magnified the risks he saw lurking everywhere.\n\nbut while the early signs of their future marital discord were already in evidence, they had not yet pulled apart. the guevaras took family excursions together, either horse rides on the forest trails, with ernestito riding on the saddle mount in front of his father, or river excursions aboard the kid, a wooden launch with a four-berth cabin that guevara lynch had built at the astillero san isidro. once, they traveled upriver to the famous iguazu falls, where the argentine and brazilian borders meet, and watched the clouds of vapor rise from the brown cascades that roar down from the virgin jungle cliffs.\n\nin late 1929, the family packed up once more for the long trip downriver to buenos aires. their land was cleared and their yerbatal had just been planted, but celia was about to give birth to their second child, and guevara lynch's presence was urgently needed at the astillero san isidro. during his absence, business had gone badly, and now one of its investors had withdrawn. they planned to be away only a few months, but they would never return as a family to puerto caraguatai. it was the end of what ernesto guevara lynch recalled as difficult but very happy years.
the solution that we received is a welcome relief to the conflict we have been experiencing, said the rev. tom berlin, who represented groups that opposed discrimination against l.g.b.t. people in the mediation. i am very encouraged that the united methodist church found a way to offer a resolution to a long conflict.\n\nconservatives, who seemed to have the upper hand after the vote tightening a ban on same-sex marriage, would get $25 million once their new denomination is formed and incorporated. all current clergy and lay employees of the denomination, even if they affiliate with the traditionalists, will get to keep their pension plans.\n\nit is not everything that we would have hoped for, but we think it is a good agreement that gets us out of the decades-long conflict that we have experienced and enables us to focus on ministry in a positive way, said tom lambrecht, vice president of good news, one of the conservative groups.\n\nthe factions agreed to allocate $39 million to support communities historically marginalized by the sin of racism, according to the agreement. that sum includes $13 million the traditionalists contributed instead of receiving as part of their portion.\n\ndespite the deep doctrinal disputes that led to the split, the negotiations were largely secular: process, governance, finances, said kenneth r. feinberg, the lawyer who helped craft the thorny settlements that arose from the 2010 bp oil spill and the sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\ni'm the last person in the world who's going to help the parties resolve their doctrinal differences, said mr. feinberg, who assisted in the church's mediation on a pro bono basis.\n\nlocal churches will choose whether to join any new traditionalist denomination or remain in the united methodist church. several people interviewed on friday believed that most american churches would stay, though there has not been any formal survey.
there was never any question of bob stepping down, and so he worked and edited almost to the last. retirement was for sissies; better to step up to the plate. no eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. he had his quirks. he hated the word stance. he was a stickler for accuracy. the pencil in his hand went to the heart of the matter. to edit, for bob, was to make a writer better and get out of the way. that may sound simple. it's not and it's rare.\n\ni learned of bob's passing while i was in france, where he'd worked for the paris review in the 1950s. i was a friend, not a close one, but i'd written one piece a year or so for him since 2008, and he would take me to lunch at en, a japanese brasserie near his downtown office. he was gallant, droll and courtly (another description of his accent, reported by thomas meaney in the times literary supplement, captured it as mineola via the grand tour). he was also challenging, indignant about all injustice, and a quiet saboteur of every jejune idea.\n\nwhen we talked about iran, where i'd witnessed the postelection tumult in 2009, he broached human rights, the iran nuclear threat and the movies of abbas kiarostami with effortless authority. what did iran want? how could its people be brought closer to the world? how might their yearning for liberty be satisfied? bob probed. he was always ready to learn, even if he always seemed to know more than you. he was the generalist rebuking the specialist. he prodded me, most recently, to write — and then rewrite — a review of elena ferrante's work. he liked writers in new territory.\n\nat a memorial service for him this week at the new york public library, the immensity of bob's loss was palpable. justice stephen breyer sent a note, read by the review's publisher, rea hederman. it extolled the importance of bob's forum for distinguishing sense from nonsense. ian buruma captured bob's particularly jewish identification with the oppressed and his decency – that word dear to camus, who observed in his novel the plague that, it may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency. mark danner evoked the love of bob's life, grace dudley, and his sense of not knowing who i am after her death late last year. still, bob kept working. there were always things to do.\n\nyes, it is time to fight with decency the indecency seeping from high office; to reject nonsense; to resist contempt for the persecuted and the refugee; to uphold love lived to its limit; to honor industry over ostentation. bob was the greatest editor of our time. editors cut; showmen splurge. and one day the showman is unmasked.
rinaldi was tossing balls and occasional advice to williams on friday as williams exchanged groundstrokes with vandeweghe during their practice session. williams crushed certain shots with customary power and precision but mistimed many others, muttering to herself and shadow-stroking between rallies.\n\nshe was in a playful mood, dancing as she walked to the baseline and cracking jokes in her chair during breaks and between deep breaths, but she was all business between the lines.\n\ni'm sure she does want it to go faster, rinaldi said of the process. she's got high expectations obviously, and it's tough to manage those in the beginning and be patient with herself. but as you can see, i think that's what makes her so great, too, is that she is tough on herself and has that drive. she wants to be back, wants to be playing and wants to be winning titles, it seems, and absolutely nobody knows how to do that better than she does.\n\nso what is reasonable in terms of expectations? a few months for williams to get her bearings, drop some more weight and potentially pose a threat at wimbledon in july? or something more ambitious?\n\ni wouldn't be surprised if she steps back into it and does well, to be honest with you, rinaldi said. i've seen her this week, and every day she's better and stronger, and the desire is there.\n\nolympia, now five months old, is here in asheville with williams, who experienced complications after giving birth by emergency cesarean section in september. she has said she spent the first six weeks of motherhood in bed. after her wedding in november, williams resumed training in earnest in december, a few weeks before she played and lost a lucrative exhibition match to jelena ostapenko in abu dhabi on dec. 30.\n\nostapenko, the reigning french open champion, kindly stopped hitting many balls to the corners as the match progressed, and williams looked underwhelmed with her own play.
casey station, antarctica — near a nice, big hole in the ice and beneath the stone gray, midday antarctic summer skies, six adélie penguins stared at six men toiling with tools. the chasm in the ice might have been an inviting entry to the krill-rich waters below. none of the members of the tuxedoed recon party dove into the hole, a square about six feet across. the risk of leopard seals was just too great.\n\nbut had they leapt in, the penguins would have discovered not a seal, but a robot.\n\nin november, scientists and engineers from nasa's jet propulsion laboratory successfully field tested bruie — the buoyant rover for under-ice exploration — beneath the ice of eastern antarctica. the remotely operated rover was built to crawl along the underside of sea ice and ice shelves. these tests on earth have a long-term goal of one day seeking evidence of life beneath the thick frozen shell covering jupiter's ocean moon of europa. beneath that ice is three times more liquid water than can be found in all the oceans on earth.\n\n[sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\n\nit will be years before a spacecraft from earth lands on europa, which was most closely studied by nasa's galileo mission in the 1990s. the next robotic probe to visit that world will be europa clipper, scheduled to launch no sooner than 2025. when it arrives some years later, that spacecraft will orbit jupiter and encounter europa dozens of times at different angles to thoroughly scan and map the moon, considered one of the best candidates in our solar system to be inhabited by some form of extraterrestrial life.
during a recent interview, the german soprano diana damrau and the italian tenor vittorio grigolo tried to describe the chemistry they have together onstage. reading their comments, i worried that they might be overthinking things. after all, they first worked together only last year, appearing as the lovers in massenet's manon at the metropolitan opera. the couple thrilled audiences and critics with the smoldering intensity they emitted. so this is a new relationship. in talking about their instinctive connection might they risk making it self-conscious?\n\nnot to fear. on saturday night for its new year's eve gala, the met introduced a new production of gounod's roméo et juliette starring mr. grigolo and ms. damrau as shakespeare's star-crossed adolescent lovers. in scene after scene, these exciting and charismatic artists disappeared into their characters, emboldening each other to sing with white-hot sensuality and impassioned lyricism.\n\nthe production, by the director bartlett sher, his seventh for the met, updates the setting from renaissance to 18th-century verona, presenting an essentially traditional staging with some surreal touches that seem a little forced. still, to whatever degree mr. sher shaped the courageous performances of his stars, and this very strong cast, he deserves much credit.
the film is just getting started. melinda marries robert anyway, and he continues to drain the money she inherited from her mother. mr. perry tracks the major expenses in onscreen text, and puts synonyms for the movie's principal themes (acrimony, of course, as well as deranged and inexorable) in title cards.\n\na partisan narrator but probably not an unreliable one, melinda is somehow able to present flashbacks to moments that she didn't see. that's just one of several ways in which mr. perry's screenplay feels structurally shaky. already ungainly in its mix of social realism and parable — melinda undergoes a series of overwrought, essentially biblical trials in a city vaguely identified as present-day pittsburgh — acrimony truly gets muddled once it starts making excuses for its excuse-making antagonist.\n\nafter all, what if robert really means well? what if this time will be different? in addition to endorsing the logic that keeps spouses stockholm syndrome'd in bad marriages, acrimony also offers poor economic advice (melinda's enduring devotion to robert is an illustration of the sunk-cost fallacy — except that the movie suggests she hasn't sunk enough). and the less said about the yacht-based climax, featuring some of the least convincing ship-jumping ever filmed, the better.\n\nms. henson does what she can with a role that keeps her anger at a low simmer until requiring her to go full banshee within basically one scene. you can't accuse her or acrimony of being boring, but the film falls short of a design for living.
thursday would have been the 100th birthday of the composer, pianist and conductor leon kirchner, who died at 90 in 2009. one of the most comprehensive musicians of his day, he was a valued teacher during a long career at harvard. as a composer, mr. kirchner demonstrated that one could write works of rigorous complexity employing modernist techniques but in an instinctive, richly expressive, viscerally dramatic way.\n\nthough steeped in the dodecaphonic music of his beloved teacher schoenberg, kirchner never used the 12-tone system strictly. just hints of the aesthetic run through this mysterious slow movement from kirchner's second string quartet (1958), beautifully performed here by the orion quartet. bartok and stravinsky where also major influences, as the punchy opening movement of kirchner's first piano concerto (1953) make clear in this 1956 performance featuring the composer at the piano, with mitropoulos conducting the new york philharmonic.\n\nsome musical highlights of my years living in boston were the concerts mr. kirchner conducted with the harvard chamber orchestra. he was not the tidiest technician. but he led scores by mozart, beethoven, brahms and contemporary giants like a fellow composer who completely understood how the piece at hand worked. anthony tommasini\n\nany ensemble making its american debut is likely to feel some jitters, especially when the program includes a masterpiece as dense and thorny as beethoven's op. 130. but on sunday, members of the maxwell string quartet had an additional reason for feeling a little, well, vulnerable.
egil krogh, who as part of president richard m. nixon's staff was one of the leaders of the secret plumbers unit that broke into the office of daniel ellsberg's psychiatrist, a prelude to the watergate burglary that brought down the nixon presidency, died on saturday in washington. he was 80.\n\nhis son peter said the cause was heart failure.\n\nin november 1973, mr. krogh, known as bud, pleaded guilty to conspiracy against rights of citizens for his role in the september 1971 break-in at the office of dr. lewis fielding in beverly hills, calif.\n\nthe plumbers, a group of white house operatives, were tasked with plugging leaks of confidential material, which had bedeviled the nixon administration. mr. ellsberg, a military analyst, had been responsible for the biggest leak of all: passing the pentagon papers, the top-secret government history of the vietnam war, to the new york times earlier that year.\n\nthe plumbers were hoping to get information about mr. ellsberg's mental state that would discredit him, but they found nothing of importance related to him.
joanne rogers, who as the gregarious wife of fred rogers, the influential creator and host of mister rogers' neighborhood, spread his message of kindness after his death in 2003, died on thursday at her home in pittsburgh. she was 92.\n\nher death was announced by fred rogers productions, which produces children's programming for public television.\n\nso much a part of me was fred, mrs. rogers said in a tedx talk in 2018. one of the things he talked about was making goodness attractive, and i think that's something that we can try to do, and it's quite an assignment.\n\nmrs. rogers was as comfortable being fred rogers's wife as she was performing for nearly 40 years in a piano-playing duo with her college friend jeannine morrison. mr. rogers was also a trained pianist, but he was not considered as adept as his wife.
materials/textbooks\n\ncortlandt anthology of 20th and 21st century fiction \n\ngriggs-massey's guide to grammar and style\n\nnote: the instructor will not be assigning the self-published novel through the wild dreaming night by prof. arnold r. young. this novel was for many years on the required list for introductory fiction, but this instructor cannot in good conscience continue to inflict it on undergraduates. through professor young's temporary and capricious patronage i have survived on white bread and tuna in an apartment the size of a closet for the past two years; given my nonrenewal of contract, i am no longer obliged to pretend to respect his work.\n\ncourse objectives/goals\n\nvia writing exercises and discussion, students will gain an appreciation for plot, character, setting, mood, tone, dialogue, chronology, structure, tension, etc. they will experience the short story as a brief immersion in the lives and experiences of others — a vehicle for insight. students may come to understand, for example, why a 39-year-old woman, graduate degree in hand and reasonably attractive, would allow herself to be seduced by a potbellied has-been 20 years her senior, a scholar-cum-novelist who, after buying her a number of drinks at a conference, persuaded her to relocate from a reasonable metropolitan area to a splotch on the prairie, only to reunite, two and a half weeks after her arrival, with an almost-ex-wife he had somehow neglected to mention.\n\nevaluation/grading\n\ncriteria for evaluating fiction will be discussed in class. to those who would raise the buga boo of subjectivity or instructor favoritism, please see the classroom motto: life is not fair. though the instructor promises to do her best to evaluate student work according to clearly defined standards and procedures, students should note that this represents a break from the way in which business is conducted on campus. see, for example, my recent performance review, a vengeful hack job written by a member of the faculty not to be identified here (but recognizable by her badly dyed bouffant and her marriage to the scholar-cum-novelist referred to above).\n\nschedule of readings and assignments\n\nthese will be issued in class, week by week. the instructor has found that spontaneity is often best, keeping the student reader in suspense and creating the impression that anything might happen: imagine, for instance, a gloved hand reaching for a knife, and the next thing we know a body is dappled in blood as if in red sunshine, his hoary bulk splayed across a desk in a modest office cluttered with manuscripts … but suddenly the alarm clock erupts with a —\n\nnote: syllabus and classroom policies are subject to change.\n\njulie schumacher, a creative writing instructor at the university of minnesota, is the author of the novel dear committee members.\n\nfollow the new york times opinion section on facebook, twitter (@nytopinion) and instagram.
what's been lost?\n\ni miss the serendipity of bumping into people, crossing paths in a spontaneous way. some of our best conversations used to take place in an elevator or on our way out the door. those random things that are the fabric of our lives are so greatly diminished.\n\ndo you compensate virtually?\n\nthe computer screen has no texture. our lives have no texture. that is why we're so drawn to cooking and eating right now. those things bring smells, texture and physicality into our lives. that feeling of baking bread, of turning over the dough, that doesn't happen on a screen.\n\ndoes visiting a museum restore some of that sensation?\n\nit can. our attendance is pretty strong. i find people come because they feel they can be safe, but also be with other people again, even if they are standing 15 or 20 feet away.\n\nyou once remarked that a museum cannot right all the ills of an unjust world. do you stand by that?\n\ni believe much of what happens, happens through the art itself, through the voices of the artists. day's end, our big public art project with david hammons, will appear in may. it is an open structure, a ghost version of a pier shed that used to exist on the hudson. in many ways, it is an aspirational project, about reparations. it's symbolic of the resilience of new york. for me it is about the healing of a city and a country that have been battered.
art can be expected to hold a mirror up to society, but it cannot be expected to hold a mirror up to every individual who is engaging with it. even with its long running time, there is a lot the inheritance does not and cannot cover.\n\nno one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and i believe that is a good thing: it creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for the inheritance and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy.\n\nthe inheritance was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. what i was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues i have rarely seen depicted in theater. i have painted on a broad canvas. it is simply not the canvas others might have chosen.\n\ni wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease i have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as h.i.v./aids did 30 years ago. i also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain.\n\nsuch examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. but avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. healing is impossible if you don't understand the cause of the injury.\n\nand while i examine race in the inheritance, it is not one of its central themes. this is a decision for which i have been criticized, but it is a decision that i made consciously as a person of color. it is a consideration that is not asked of white writers, but it is one that writers of color must face with every project we begin.\n\nresponsibility to community is the first question we must answer for ourselves. i believe that in writing honestly about my experience as a gay man, i have also contributed one more example of what it means to be a puerto rican man.
dear match book,\n\ni need an author i can read front to back, or one who has written five books that i'll want to read without stopping.\n\ni was an english major in college, so i guess what i like is literary fiction. my four favorite books are blood meridian, by cormac mccarthy, moby-dick, by herman melville, invisible man, by ralph ellison, and continental drift, by russell banks — in that order.\n\ni've read everything by colson whitehead, so the algorithms led me to percival everett's erasure, but it just didn't click. i've read most of t. c. boyle, but he's just writing the same book over and over now; and i stopped liking russell banks's work a while ago. (i understand his wanting to try different things, but how could the man who wrote the sweet hereafter also produce rule of the bone?)\n\ni don't just stick to americans (i love ian mcewan's writing from the last few years) or men (i've read all of donna tartt's fiction and most of annie proulx's). now that i'm older, i'm thinking about going back to saul bellow (i grew up in hyde park), because back when i started to read his books, i'd always just put them down in favor of something by philip roth. i'm just starting my second magnus mills novel, so we'll see about him.
connie sawyer, who began performing in vaudeville and nightclubs more than eight decades ago and continued to appear on stages and screens until she became known as the oldest working actress in hollywood, died on jan. 21 in los angeles. she was 105.\n\nher death, at the motion picture & television fund's retirement home in woodland hills, where she had lived for a decade, was confirmed by her daughter lisa dudley.\n\nmiss sawyer, as she liked to be known, was billed as the oldest member of the screen actors guild and the american federation of television and radio artists (sag-aftra) who was still working.\n\nher memoir, self-published last year, was titled, i never wanted to be a star — and i wasn't.\n\nstill, since her broadway debut in 1948, she had accumulated about 140 acting credits in theatrical, movie and television productions.
mr. trump's comments about mr. cohen on saturday, made during a friendly interview with jeanine pirro of fox news, were his first extended remarks on the matter since mr. cohen's congressional testimony was announced. asked by ms. pirro if he was worried about the testimony, mr. trump called mr. cohen weak and asserted — in contradiction to filings by federal prosecutors in manhattan — that mr. cohen had no information on him.\n\nhe's in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxicabs and stuff that i know nothing about, mr. trump said. and in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, i have an idea, i'll tell — i'll give you some information on the president.\n\nmr. trump then implied that mr. cohen ought to be sharing information instead on his father-in-law, whose name he said he did not know.\n\nbut he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at, he said, adding, that's the money in the family. pressed by ms. pirro for more details, mr. trump said, i don't know, but you'll find out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there.\n\nmr. cohen's father-in-law, fima shusterman, emigrated from ukraine in 1975. the year before his daughter's marriage to mr. cohen, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. he was sentenced to probation after cooperating with prosecutors in a related case.\n\nsaturday was not the first time mr. trump has targeted mr. cohen's family. after mr. cohen pleaded guilty to his crimes, the president said mr. cohen had done so only to save his wife and his father-in-law.\n\nas they prepared to indict him, prosecutors had signaled to mr. cohen that his wife could be implicated, since she had also signed his tax returns. that threat helped push mr. cohen to plead guilty to the charges, according to a person familiar with the events.
there are echoes of beggar boy in the ironically titled story america the great equalizer. biks, a nepali graduate student living in illinois at the time of michael brown's shooting in ferguson, mo., simultaneously develops a heightened awareness of the racism all around him and learns that his beloved seema, back in nepal, has married. the death and the marriage, hardly comparable tragedies, intertwine in his mind, sparking a suspicion that seema rejected him because of his comparatively dark skin. feeling himself the victim of a terrible injustice due to prejudice, he begins to identify with african-americans, taking on what he believes to be black mannerisms, including addressing customers at his new job in a gas station as brothah. it's an uncomfortable charade, barreling right through the boundary between empathy and appropriation, and into offensive stereotypes, a fact biks is initially incapable of seeing, though others try to point it out. 'am i your brother because we have the same mother, or am i your brother because you're african-american?' one customer asks him. then he laughed and said he was just giving biks a hard time.\n\nimage\n\nbiks sees through his own masquerade only after reaching some acceptance about his former lover's marriage, a piece of timing that suggests the great degree to which his supposed empathy has been about managing his own emotional wounds. this was not the life he'd envisioned … trying to be blacker than blacks — 'blacker than thou,' he muttered to himself — when his history didn't compare to theirs, the brutality, the dehumanization, the violence. he was a fraud, trying to pretend to be someone he was not. … 'i am a pretender,' biks said to himself. 'a poseur. an impostor.'\n\nthat is clearly true, but as with ramesh in beggar boy, the pretense has to do with enacting something genuinely felt. and while impostors are commonly thought of as assuming a higher status, to which they have no claim, these characters take on the identities of those they perceive to be of lower status, to whose sufferings they have no claim, in order to engage in a kind of theater of pain. their behaviors are particularly outlandish and so seem particularly egregious, but the wrong of using other people's troubles to soothe oneself is commonplace, a sin most of us commit at some point, which is perhaps why upadhyay maintains so empathic a stance toward his characters, even as they transgress.\n\nthough he does allow them to be mocked. the specter of foolishness hovers close to many of the people found in mad country. the distinction between the questions who might i actually be? and just who do you think you are? is repeatedly revealed to be a slippery one. in freak street, set in 1970s nepal, a young american woman decides she is nepali, changing her name from sofi to sukumari, taking to wearing nepali clothes and calling her landlady ma. she is ridiculed for doing so, though again, her masquerade is the product of a profound unhappiness. the boy pointed at sukumari. 'she! she's funny! look at her. she a kuiriney hippie, but she thinks she's nepali.' with this drumbeat of mockery, upadhyay illuminates the unquestioned pressures on us all to remain as we are, a key element in a book about societal constructs, emotional exigencies and identity.\n\nstory collections need not be entirely consistent to triumph. mad country is brilliant, daring, memorable — and also uneven. the opening piece, fast forward, about a newsmagazine in kathmandu, is a nuanced study of truth-telling under a repressive regime, while the novella dreaming of ghana, in which a young man first dreams about the country ghana and then meets a young black woman whom he rather presumptuously names ghana, involves disparate plot lines and symbolic representations that never quite add up. the title story, in which a successful businesswoman finds new forms of contentment while baselessly incarcerated, left me unconvinced. but i would not want any pieces excised. even the less powerful stories here are original and thought-provoking enough to add something of value to the whole.
alexandra levy olsman and zachary isaac frankel lived across rittenhouse square from each other at a young age and went to the same montessori preschool in philadelphia. but, when a mutual friend introduced them in october 2016, they had no memory of ever meeting.\n\nmr. frankel said the mutual friend, lauren jacobs, had reached out to him to say, i have this girl for you.\n\nthat woman was ms. olsman, an associate specialist then in the antiquities department at christie's new york. ms. olsman was part of an art gallery panel discussion about collecting art, which ms. jacobs was attending. the event, in philadelphia, was where ms. jacobs had the inspiration to match the two. after the talk, and over wine and cheese, she mentioned her idea to ms. olsman about meeting mr. frankel. minutes later he called ms. jacobs, who handed the phone over to ms. olsman, and they chatted.\n\nthe next week, while ms. olsman was in england at christie's london, he texted her about meeting in new york when she got back.
seoul, south korea — kim tschang-yeul, who devoted a half century to creating luminous paintings of water drops that are informed by the trauma of war and eastern philosophy, died here on jan. 5. he was 91.\n\ngallery hyundai, which has shown his work since the 1970s, confirmed the death.\n\nrendered with meticulous care, mr. kim's drops can seem to sit miraculously atop his raw canvases or be in the midst of gliding down them, leaving a trail of moisture. they glimmer with light and cast shadows, and while vividly present, they are always on the verge of evanescing. they made mr. kim one of the most celebrated korean artists of his time.\n\nversed in zen buddhism and taoism, he wrote in a statement for a 1988 exhibition that his aim in his tranquil paintings was to dissolve everything into drops of water and return it transparently into nothingness.\n\nwhen we have turned anger, unease, and fear into emptiness, he wrote, we can experience peace and harmony.

season 2, episode 2: 'dead cat bounce'\n\namong other things, billions is a show about american aristocracy, of two men burnishing a legacy that will etch their families' names in the firmament for generations to come. one of the key distinctions between chuck rhoades and bobby axelrod is that they approach the same goal from different angles: chuck is an old-money political climber, on a conventional (if currently twisty) path from united states attorney to the governor's office, boosted by his father's reputation and connections. axe is a nouveau riche brawler from yonkers, using hedge fund billions to bully his way to the status his name itself cannot afford. hence the sizable donation necessary to change an august manhattan performance space into axelrod hall last season — the dubious permanence of which i likened to enron field in houston.\n\nin a key scene in tonight's episode, chuck rhoades sr. pays a visit to wendy's home while her husband is away. for chuck sr., there's no more important goal than making certain his son builds upon the rhoades family legacy in the state of new york. and being the connected person that he is, it was only a matter of time before news of chuck and wendy's separation made its way through the grapevine. chuck sr. doesn't want to hear wendy's rationale about the lies and deception that led to the separation, which to him are mere bumps in the road. she needs to think about the children. she needs to think about how much harder it will be for little kevin rhoades to meet his station in life. they are the future of my name, he tells her, adding, you'd really rather have your three nights a week than be first lady of the state of new york?\n\nhearing chuck sr. badger wendy over her marriage recalled, for me, last year's excellent documentary weiner, about the former congressman anthony weiner's failed campaign to become the mayor of new york city. among the many casualties of that run — including, in a tangential way, the presidential ambitions of hillary clinton — was the marriage between weiner and huma abedin, who also happened to a top clinton aide. there was a time when weiner and abedin were securing their place in the aristocracy: they married the year after weiner won the first of his seven terms in the house of representatives — bill clinton officiated their wedding — and their union survived the first sexting scandal, nicknamed weinergate, which led to his resignation from congress. weiner chronicles his attempt at a political comeback, which unravels after another round of sexts, sent under the pseudonym carlos danger, torpedoes his campaign for good.\n\nnobody can know for certain what goes on in a marriage, but political unions like the one between chuck and wendy — and anthony and huma, and bill and hillary — plainly involve considerations other than the boring-old conventions of trust, fidelity and happiness. we saw it last season, when chuck and wendy dined with a couple that does everything together and recoiled at their lovey-dovey intimacy. chuck sr. may seem like a sinister interloper in a relationship he knows nothing about, but he's there to remind wendy that she entered into a political marriage and that the arrangement calls for a certain amount of flexibility. a couple of scenes later, when chuck advises wendy to tell oliver dake the truth (i don't want you to lie for me), it may be the most romantic moment they've ever had on the show. they even hold hands!
los angeles — the composer matthew aucoin began working on crossing, his first opera, when he was in college. it was a work of enormous talent, exciting promise and considerable hubris: mr. aucoin wrote his own libretto, inventing a story about walt whitman's work with wounded soldiers during the civil war.\n\nif crossing (2015) lacked a certain kind of unity — as mr. aucoin, now 29, said in a recent interview — it was still taut, intense and audacious. what would he do next?\n\nthe answer came on saturday, with the premiere of eurydice at los angeles opera, where it runs through feb. 23 before traveling to the metropolitan opera next year. this project demanded a very different approach. mr. aucoin didn't write the libretto; instead, the text was a collaboration with the playwright sarah ruhl, closely hewing to her 2003 play, a modern-day take on the orpheus and eurydice myth which tells the story from the woman's perspective.
bernie telsey was still a student at n.y.u. when he met an actor named robert lupone and decided to form a theater club. their duo became a trio when they met will cantler, and soon they were putting on shows whenever and wherever they could.\n\nthat was more than three decades ago, and over the years the company they founded — now called mcc theater, with a focus on new work by living writers — has become one of the more respected off broadway nonprofits, attracting such stars as lucas hedges, judith light and zachary quinto to its stages.\n\nbut they have never had their own building, until now. on jan. 23, the box office opens at their first permanent home, on west 52nd street at 10th avenue, with two theaters, two rehearsal studios, and all the amenities (including a bar) one has come to expect from a modern theater. to have a home, it's mind-boggling, mr. telsey said.\n\nthe $45 million project has been a long time coming, and brings mcc into a corner of hell's kitchen with a growing number of performing arts organizations.
andrew is so young — and so new to the rigors of broadway — that he's going to begin his run doing just five performances a week, while taking vocal lessons to shore up his stamina. this will be his first professional production, and the creative team, determined to protect him as well as their smash-hit show, has decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success; the show's alternate, michael lee brown, will do the other three performances as andrew builds comfort and strength.\n\nit's a little scary for all of us — for him, for me, for his mom — because we're asking a lot of him, said stacey mindich, the show's lead producer. but in every single moment he has grown with us already — at every passage he has shown us he is uber-capable.\n\na fan of musicals and more\n\nthis is not one of those stories about someone who happened into theater unwittingly. this is a story about an unabashed theater geek — a child who has adored broadway since he saw beauty and the beast at age 3, who has been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of mr. bundles in a community theater production of annie at age 8; who writes songs and plays the piano, guitar, drums, ukulele and bass; who has been to all four editions of broadwaycon, including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing as angelica schuyler from hamilton.\n\nhis passion for the imaginary goes way beyond musicals. he's a huge fan of star wars — we watched 'a new hope' in english class to learn about archetypes, and i was like, 'oh my god, this is the coolest thing' — and has dressed as general grievous and kylo ren for halloween. (it's not that he's drawn to the dark side; it's just, he says, that those characters look cooler.)\n\nhe's an even huger fan of disney (which now owns star wars, so maybe that's redundant). he estimates that he's been to disney theme parks, including disneyworld, disneyland and disneyland paris, at least 20 times, starting when he was 6 months old. something draws me to the idea of being able to live in another world, he said.\n\nand now he really, really loves dear evan hansen. the first time he saw the musical, a couple of weeks after it opened on broadway in 2016, he was so overcome he couldn't find the words to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up.
when the writer and director mike nichols was young, he had an allergic reaction to a whooping cough vaccine. the result was a complete and lifelong inability to grow hair. one way to read mark harris's crisp new biography, mike nichols: a life, is as a tender comedy about a man and his wigs.\n\nhe got his first set (hair, eyebrows) before he went to college. it was dismal. nichols attended the university of chicago, where susan sontag was also a student. one reason they didn't date, harris writes, is that she was thrown off by his wig.\n\nnichols moved to manhattan to make it as a comedian. a friend said that she would enter his tiny apartment and the smell of acetone — wig-glue remover — would just hit you in the face.\n\nnichols found fame in his mid-20s. his improvisational comedy routines with elaine may, whom he'd met in chicago, were fresh and irresistible. they took their act to broadway in 1960, where nichols met richard burton. through burton, he would get to know elizabeth taylor.
the custom of the country, wharton's novel of divorce, was among her favorites. begun in 1908 and published in 1913, the book took her an uncommonly long time to write. she was distracted by other projects — in those years, she produced ethan frome (1911) and the reef (1912) as well as short stories — but most significantly, wharton and her husband, teddy, themselves divorced, after twenty-eight years of marriage, in part because teddy had stolen significant sums of money from his wife. although born into an eminent yankee family with a great deal of wealth, and consequently in a considerably better position than most divorcées (then or now), she nevertheless found herself, as martin-wagner puts it, something of a social outcast, and left the united states for france, where she would live until her death in 1937. at the same time, her biographer r. w. b. lewis writes, she felt propelled out of her metaphorical prison, able to exercise what henry james had called a fantastic freedom.\n\nundine's repeated unions and their dissolutions — by the novel's end her full name is undine spragg marvell de chelles moffatt, though strictly speaking moffatt should be listed twice — are on the one hand socially unsettling to (though ultimately accommodated by) new york and paris societies, and on the other constitute for undine that fantastic freedom. it's perhaps not totally surprising, then, that, as lewis notes, undine shares a number of key traits with her creator, including their childhood nickname, puss. wharton understood well the personal costs of marriage for women, and the limits society placed upon them. she surely put something of herself into undine. at the same time, she knew intimately the suffering of poor ralph marvell, scion of old new york, who, upon reading about his divorce in the newspapers, felt that the coarse fingering of public curiosity had touched the secret places of his soul, and nothing that had gone before seemed as humiliating as this trivial comment on his tragedy.\n\nwharton's genius lies in her novelistic ability to allow her characters their perspectives while seeing the situation from all sides. both in her lifetime and since, she has been maligned for being born rich (franzen complains that privilege like hers isn't easy to like; it puts her at a moral disadvantage); and janet flanner accused her, in a waspish 1929 new yorker profile, of lacking sensuality and sympathy, of formally proving that the wages of social sin were social death. but in fact wharton — who could well have sat around in her fancy houses eating bonbons with her feet up rather than writing wonderfully entertaining, humanly true novels that have stood the test of time — turned her critical eye equally upon transgressors and upholders of convention alike. that's not to excuse her snobbery or to overlook the limitations of accounts of high society; but now, as then, we're fascinated by the lives of the wealthy, and shouldn't project our own secret shame about it onto wharton. her sharp wit is hard on all her characters, and crucially, she captures also their redeeming qualities, their humanity. she sees and understands undine's laser-focused ambition, her parents' trembling and self-sacrificing indulgence, ralph's highly cultured but weak romanticism, elmer's robust desire for material success. and she appreciates also undine's splendor, her vitality and allure, ralph's delicacy and tenderness, elmer's frankness and generosity. like the novel's discreet and cheerful mrs. heeny, masseuse and manicurist to the rich, who travels from house to house with her bag full of press clippings, wharton observes and records it all. in this new gilded age, when the disparities between rich and poor are again, and disastrously, as great as they were in wharton's time, we could do with such a novelist, a cultural anthropologist who might hold up a mirror to our failings and our future, with eagle-eyed clarity and a small measure of compassion.\n\nclaire messud is the award-winning author of eight books, including the burning girl and, most recently, kant's little prussian head and other reasons why i write: an autobiography through essays.
chapter one\n\nto keep the waters troubled\n\nthe life of ida b. wells\n\n\n\nby linda o. mcmurry\n\n\n\noxford university press\n\nread the review\n\nchildhood and early adulthood\n\na happy, light-hearted schoolgirl\n\nthe remarkable journey of ida wells began during the civil war in the northern mississippi town of holly springs. it was not the most auspicious place for an african american to be born, for mississippi has been the site of horrific incidents of white racism and violence. in the antebellum period, slaves from other states feared being sold down to mississippi; later, some of the bloodiest chapters of the civil rights movement would be written there. nevertheless, ida b. wells was born at a time and place in mississippi that offered african americans cause for hope as well as discouragement. her parents also emerged from slavery with more opportunity than many.\n\nalthough slavery was hardly a benevolent institution, as white southerners sought to paint it, some slaves were more privileged than others. sources of privilege included kinship with the master, acquisition of valuable skills, and the opportunity to be hired out in cities. ida's father, james wells, apparently benefited from all three. his master/father owned a plantation in tippah county and had no children by his white wife, miss polly. like many slave owners, he had a black family with a slave--peggy. born in 1840, james wells was their first child and was cherished by his father, who was relatively old when james was born. such liaisons were deeply resented by most slave owners' white wives, who felt the bitterness of betrayal and the humiliation of seeing tangible, public proof of their husbands' infidelity in the skin color of the children. these wives' wrath was sometimes unleashed on the slave women who shared their husband's attention, whether or not the bondswomen were willing participants in the relationships. james wells recalled how miss polly had gotten someone to strip and whip peggy the day after her husband died.\n\nbefore his death, james's father had taken him to holly springs, in northern mississippi, to be apprenticed to a carpenter. thus at age eighteen, james wells gained a valuable skill and a measure of independence as a hired-out slave living in town. masters hired out their slaves to other people for a variety of reasons--usually for compensation or for their slaves to acquire certain skills. hired-out slaves enjoyed a wide range of freedom, and some received very little. life in cities and towns, however, gave many hired-out slaves some freedom from supervision, and most found more autonomy than the slaves on their masters' plantations.\n\nin holly springs, wells learned carpentry and acquired a mate at the residence of a contractor and builder named bolling. he fell in love with elizabeth warrenton, the cook in the bolling household. as slaves they could not legally marry, but they lived as man and wife and legalized their vows after emancipation--as many slaves did. unlike james, elizabeth (born in 1844) had not been sheltered from bondage's worst abuses. one of ten children born to slaves in virginia, she vividly recalled receiving beatings from her masters. she also suffered one of the worst abuses of slavery: she and two of her sisters were sold and separated from their family. such separations were painful reminders of slaves' vulnerability and cut them off from the very people who provided comfort and support to cope with the harsh realities of slavery. like so many others, elizabeth sent inquiries back to virginia after emancipation in a vain attempt to find her lost family.\n\nida bell wells was the first child born to the couple. her birth on 16 july 1862 was in the midst of the civil war. at first the union and the confederacy carefully tried to separate the issue of slavery from their war aims, but the process of the war ultimately destroyed the system of human bondage. when union troops arrived nearby, many slaves sought to liberate themselves by fleeing behind union lines. after a period of confusion over the status of these fugitives (at first, slaves were often returned to their confederate masters), the u.s. congress directed that escaped slaves of rebel masters could be considered contraband of war and proclaimed free. nevertheless, when union troops moved out of a region, some of the newly freed slaves found themselves recaptured in the web of slavery. for many southerners of all shades, the transition from slavery to freedom was chaotic and confusing. ida wells's birthplace was the scene of more-than-average confusion.\n\nholly springs was captured and recaptured by the two armies, changing hands at least fifty-nine times during the war. its geography and its history made the city's experiences of the war and reconstruction both typical and atypical of most of the state. when ida was born, holly springs had existed for only a few decades. in 1832 the chickasaw ceded the region, known as the chickasaw cession, to the federal government. four years later the territory was divided into counties--the largest of which was marshall county with holly springs as its seat. while still carving the city from the wilderness, its settlers sought to make it a cultural center. even before the town was incorporated, residents voted in a town meeting to establish the holly springs female institute, the first of a number of educational institutions. by 1850 the county was spending more on higher education than all the rest of the state, excluding the budget of the university of mississippi. a history of the state noted that in 1891 holly springs, called the city of flowers, was widely known for the hospitality and culture of its people.\n\none reason for the culture and prosperity in holly springs was the arrival of successful cotton planters, who had moved west for more fertile soil, as well as many others who grew cotton on a smaller scale. king cotton demanded slaves; the 1840 county population of 17,536 included 8,260 slaves and 8 free blacks. as a new town with many land claim cases, the city also was the home to numerous lawyers. both lawyers and planters tended to join the whig party, which dominated the town's early politics--until the rise of the slavery issue in national debate. the controversy destroyed the party there as elsewhere and no compromise democrats rose in power.\n\nby 1860 the county's population had grown to almost 29,000, including 1,295 slave owners and 17,439 slaves; the free black population remained at 8. now a minority, whites became even more determined to retain slavery as a source of control and power, and marshall county played an integral role in mississippi's march toward secession. one of its residents was coauthor of the state's ordinance of secession, and when it was signed on 9 january 1861, the county provided five signatories--more than any other county. thus a year and a half before ida wells's birthday, her parents and the rest of holly springs probably waited anxiously for the outcome of the bold move toward disunion.\n\nbecause whites were outnumbered, a constant fear of racial revolt lingered in many minds. such fear was intensified by the uncertainties of war. early in the hostilities planters summoned home some of their hired-out slaves. the state legislature also moved to control slaves by penalizing masters who granted their bondsmen and bondswomen too much freedom. even so, rumors spread like epidemics, fanning the fever of fear with lurid descriptions of insurrection plots. hysteria required no tangible evidence. the month ida was born, the provost marshal of natchez reported the hanging of forty african americans during the preceding year, foreshadowing the postwar terror and murder of black men to retain white control. by the end of the century only the dominant excuse had changed--from insurrection to rape.\n\nat first holly springs seemed to have been spared the worst of the hysteria and war. not until about two weeks before ida's birth in july 1862 did the first significant civil war skirmish occur near holly springs. a considerable number of confederate troops remained in the area until later that fall when union general ulysses s. grant began moving troops into northern mississippi in preparation for the vicksburg campaign. before his army reached holly springs, confederate forces partially dismantled the local foundry and retreated to a more defensible position. grant proceeded to establish a large supply depot in the city. weapons, ammunition, food, and other materials filled every public building as well as churches, the masonic temple, and even a few private homes. while he briefly made his headquarters there, the city's black population celebrated a rare degree of freedom.\n\nas grant's army moved deeper into slave territory, slaves began coming in larger numbers to the union camps. to handle the hordes, grant asked chaplain john eaton to establish a camp for the contrabands. eaton chose grand junction, tennessee, as the camp's location--just across the state line from holly springs. eaton later described the scene of slaves coming garbed in rags or silks, with feet shod or bleeding, individually or in families and larger groups,--an army of slaves and fugitives, pushing its way irresistibly toward an army of fighting men. although the wells family and many other slaves chose to remain in holly springs, the camp's nearby location had an ameliorating impact on slavery in that city.\n\nlate in the fall of 1862, grant's army moved south, leaving only twenty-five hundred troops in holly springs. until that time holly springs had suffered little damage, although the town and the surrounding countryside had changed hands frequently. on a plantation near holly springs, eighteen-year-old cordelia scales wrote letters describing the changing parade of union and confederate troops that camped in her yard. both seem to have foraged--but not unduly. some outlying plantations suffered more than others, but major destruction of the town began with the raid by confederate general earl van dorn on 20 december 1862. van dorn's men quickly routed the outnumbered and unsuspecting federal troops in holly springs. knowing they had little time, confederate soldiers rapidly looted the easily transportable federal supplies. then, from early morning until 4:00 p.m., they set fire to the many buildings housing the remaining stores. exploding ammunition caused further destruction and some deaths. j. g. deupree, a participant, described the scene as\n\nwild and exciting: federals running; confederates yelling and pursuing; tents and houses burning; torches flaming; guns popping; sabres clanking; negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy; women, in dreaming robes and with disheveled hair floating in the morning breeze, shouting encouragement to the raiders; a mass of frantic, frightened human beings.\n\nof all the frantic, frightened human beings few were more scared than the negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy. james and elizabeth wells may well have feared for their six-month-old infant.\n\nthe destruction was not yet complete. two days later federal troops returned. one iowa soldier watched sadly as every portion of the fated city seemed given over to pillage and destruction and no hand was raised to save anything from the general sack and ruin. he was especially disturbed by the sacrileges committed in a church and the women and children standing in their homes wailing with the most piteous cries. before confederate forces in mississippi surrendered on 4 may 1865, holly springs had witnessed more than a dozen major skirmishes. after so much chaos and confusion, the county's slaves must have wondered if freedom had actually come to stay, while whites worried about what would replace slavery. former masters and former slaves warily sought to redefine their new relationships.\n\nafter the war was over, james wells accepted bolling's invitation to continue working for him. like most freed people, wells sought to test and taste the varied fruits of freedom. he first exercised those rights that white southerners had grudgingly conceded--legalizing his marriage and seeking education for his family. the wells family continued to grow in the years following the war, and eventually ida had four brothers and three sisters. both parents were eager for their children to go to school. former slaves realized that education had been forbidden because it was a key to freedom and a source of white power. most slave children had worked at an early age; their freed fathers wanted them to have childhoods more like those of their former masters' children. ida wells later recalled, our job was to go to school and learn all we could.\n\nshe began school at such an early age that she could not remember when or where she started. her earliest recollections were of reading the newspaper to her father and his friends and of her mother going to school with the children until she was able to read the bible. students of all ages clustering around a limited number of books in small schools was a common sight to the newly freed slaves during reconstruction. whether ida's father learned to read is unclear. her reading the newspaper to him and his friends could have represented a father's desire to show off the accomplishments of his offspring or his inability to read for himself. like many freed heads of households, james wells was undoubtedly busy and apparently did not attend school with his family. however, he may have learned to read and write from his father or as an apprentice. regardless, wells was deeply involved in education because he was one of the trustees of shaw university, the school ida attended in holly springs.\n\nin addition to exercising their rights to marriage and education, freedmen eagerly embraced the right to vote. for the entire republican reconstruction period in mississippi (1867-1875), african americans comprised a majority of the county's population and overwhelmingly supported republicans despite white democrats' efforts to win their votes. the democrats used both carrots and sticks to woo black voters. many used economic intimidation to persuade african americans to vote for democrats. james wells was one victim of such tactics. when bolling found out that wells had not voted democratic, he locked wells out of his shop. wells, however, was not easily intimidated. without saying a word to anyone, he bought his own tools, rented a house, and moved his family out of the dwelling owned by bolling.\n\nsome african americans followed the path of james wells, but black voters responded in a variety of ways. like wells, a number openly demonstrated their independence--a few attended democratic barbecues and picnics adorned in caps with the republican insignia. others dissembled. one man, threatened with eviction by his white landlord if he voted republican, won a reprieve with the explanation that he had been forced to vote for republicans by black threats to run him out of town. many accepted democratic gifts and then voted republican anyway. a few did become democrats either out of loyalty to former masters or employers or because of economic threats and incentives. the leader of a black democratic club was rewarded with the gift of a small house by his white fellow democrats.\n\nalthough a numerical minority in marshall county, democrats were able to get most of their candidates elected as late as the election of 1871. to do so, they utilized both intimidation and fraud. tactics included counterfeiting republican ballots, attempting to confuse voters by using african americans to distribute democratic tickets, hiding in the building to stuff ballot boxes while the election clerks were eating supper, and requiring black voters to present written proof of their age. as a result of reported electoral fraud, the state legislature refused to seat two marshall county democrats elected in 1871. in the next election, the republicans swept all the county's offices. one african american served as state senator and three as representatives. however, two years later in 1875, the democrats returned to power--permanently. black mississippi politician john roy lynch later noted, the new order of things was then set aside and the abandoned methods of a few years back were reviewed, reinaugurated, and readopted.\n\nida recalled that her father was interested in politics and remembered the anxious way my mother walked the floor at night when my father was out to a political meeting. her mother had good reason to be concerned. whites resented all black political participation but especially loathed the loyal league, a black political organization founded and often controlled by white republicans across the south. the holly springs branch of the league was established by a. c. mcdonald of shaw university and nelson gill of the freedmen's bureau. it usually met in gill's home or in the black baptist church. during one meeting, members of the local ku klux klan hid under gill's house listening to the proceedings and waiting for j. l. holland, who had been chosen among them by lot, to shoot gill. when holland finally decided it was time and aimed his pistol, another klansman had second thoughts and knocked the gun out of holland's hand just as he fired it. no one was hurt, but all were scared. afterward, pickets were posted outside during loyal league meetings.\n\nheated campaigns led to physical assaults and fights--apparently instigated by democrats. republican speakers were pelted with sticks and brickbats, had their coattails ripped, were buggy-whipped, and had their legs broken. the most serious incident of violence was the fatal shooting of tyler williamson, an african american who was called a very turbulent leader and exceedingly impudent to the white people. despite that incident, holly springs remained more peaceful than many towns and cities during reconstruction. ida wells noted in her autobiography that she could not remember any riots in the city, although there were plenty in other parts of the state.\n\npolitical violence and klan activities frightened elizabeth wells and others, but reconstruction also brought new hope and opportunity to mississippi's black population. although brief, the period of republican ascendancy in holly springs had to be a source of great pride to the wells's and other black families. most whites, although they resented black political power, agreed that the city had been blessed with extraordinarily capable and honest black officeholders. two were singled out for praise: james hill, who rose from the state legislature to become mississippi's secretary of state from 1874 to 1878, and hiram rhodes revels, who moved to holly springs in the mid-1870s, and became the first african american u.s. senator. both won white respect by their conciliatory attitudes. but whites also noted that although state senator george allbright was a willing and eager tool in the hands of gill, he was a negro who was above average in intelligence. at the height of black political power in holly springs, ida wells was a child of about ten. the events she witnessed may have whetted her interest in politics, which remained strong her entire life.\n\nalthough james wells was known as a race man who was intensely interested in politics, he apparently never held office but stayed busy running a business and taking care of his growing family. as in many households, however, ida's mother played the biggest role in the day-to-day affairs of the children. a very religious woman, elizabeth wells made sure that her children attended church regularly. the wells family likely belonged to asbury methodist church, where shaw university classes were first held. ida was baptized in that faith at the age of twelve. ida recalled that her mother won the prize for regular attendance at sunday school, taking the whole brood of six to nine o'clock sunday school the year before she died. elizabeth wells was a strict disciplinarian who kept close watch over her children. she regularly went to their school to check on their progress, taught them how to do household chores, and assigned each tasks around the home. ida proudly asserted that her mother brought us up with a strict discipline that many mothers who have had educational advantages have not exceeded.\n\nlike many african american families, the wells family was part of a network of kinship. although elizabeth wells had been unable to locate her parents and other siblings, her sister belle, who had also been sold to mississippi owners, lived out in the country near holly springs. james wells's mother, peggy, married a black man (probably named buffer) after emancipation and also lived nearby. they apparently lived as man and wife during slavery and had a daughter named margaret and at least one other son. the butlers tilled a number of acres and brought their corn and cotton to sell in holly springs each fall. utilizing that trip for a family visit, they usually brought gifts, some of which ida called souvenirs from hog-killing time. on one such visit, ida recalled her father angrily refusing his mother's request to go see his father's widow, miss polly, reminding his mother of how miss polly had her whipped and saying, i am never going to see her. i guess it is all right for you to take care of her and forgive her for what she did to you, but she could have starved to death if i'd had my say-so. she certainly would have, if it hadn't been for you. in addition to those visits, ida sometimes went to stay with her grandmother and aunt and uncle, who helped peggy and her husband on the farm. apparently, another uncle and his wife, fannie butler, had three children and lived in memphis, tennessee.\n\nwhen ida reached her teens, she enrolled at shaw university (informally called rust college until 1890, when the name change became official), where she was greatly influenced by the missionary spirit of the school. under the jurisdiction of the methodist episcopal church, north, rust was strongly tinged with evangelical christianity. students were required to attend daily chapel, weekly prayer meetings, and church on sunday. w. w. hooper, who became president of rust while ida was a student, was remembered as a religious man who prayed in chapel with his eyes open and would call your name when he got through if you didn't behave. such an environment reinforced the religious training ida received at home.\n\nrust's curriculum spanned from elementary education to normal school training for teachers--a four-year high school level program. a. c. mcdonald founded the school to make former slaves and their children useful, independent citizens. in 1875 he wrote the following:\n\nit is our aim to do no hot-house work, seeking to hurry students through a college curriculum ... sending them into the battle of life only to disgrace themselves and bring reproach upon the cause of education at large, but to take the far more difficult and tedious plan of trying to lay well a foundation for a broad, thorough and practical education.\n\nas in many schools for african americans of that era, rust's faculty was predominately white. most of the teachers were northerners who saw themselves as missionaries. the white women teachers influenced ida's concept of ideal womanhood and her acceptance of victorian codes of propriety. at the same time, she may have been inspired by the example of black faculty member ophelia smith who wrote, i love my race.\n\nwhile a student at rust, ida encountered the joys and sorrows of puberty. she experienced her first love and its painful demise. james b. combs was a rust student from georgia, who boarded with a local family. described in the 1880 u.s. census as mulatto, combs was about five years older than wells and apparently was the one to end the relationship. he married someone else and remained in holly springs for at least ten years--his presence reminding wells of the impermanence of love. throughout her twenties ida remained skittish of committing herself to just one man.\n\nother relationships caused difficulties for wells at rust. in late 1885, she referred to her tenure at rust as my darkest days. ida's fiery temper often got her in trouble, and a confrontation with president hooper apparently led to her dismissal sometime in 1880 or 1881. for years she resented him tremendously for her expulsion, but in june 1886 she admitted to herself that her own tempestuous, rebellious, hard headed wilfulness was to blame. she rued her disposition to question his authority and asserted, i no longer cherish feelings of resentment, nor blame him that my scholastic career was cut short.\n\nin 1878 ida b. wells encountered the next painful chapter of her life while on a visit to her grandmother. that year witnessed a devastating yellow fever epidemic in the mississippi valley. the region had undergone previous epidemics of yellow fever, but none was as extensive or deadly as the 1878 outbreak. an unusually mild winter, an early spring, and a blistering hot summer had allowed the mosquitoes, which served as the fever's agent of transmission, to breed prolifically and over a wide range of territory. thus the fever spread to areas that had never experienced an epidemic; therefore, most residents of those regions had no acquired immunities to yellow fever. compounding these factors, the strain of virus that year was particularly deadly, which caused higher mortality rates even in areas previously infected. in some regions the mortality rates exceeded 50 percent.\n\nlacking a good understanding of how the fever was spread, most holly springs residents believed their town to be immune, so the city opened its doors to people from other infested cities. the first refugees were housed in a small brick building that had served as the original land office. within a week one of the refugees had died, which was only the beginning of the terrible toll the fever would exact in holly springs. on 4 september 1878, the new orleans picayune reported fifty cases of yellow fever in holly springs and two deaths; an epidemic was declared and panic began, causing a frenzied effort at flight from the unseen terror so that streets were jammed with every conceivable type of vehicle loaded with baggage and human beings. by the next day a different scene was described: the hurry and confusion of panic is gone. no hurried footsteps sound along the forsaken streets unless they seek help or a doctor. hollow echoes mock their passing. the mass exodus reduced the town's population from about thirty-five hundred to fifteen hundred, comprised of three hundred whites and twelve hundred african americans. one who remained telegraphed on 5 september, the stores are all closed.... physicians are broken down.... many cases will die today.... gloom, despair, and death rule the hour, and the situation is simply appalling. only a few dozen of those who stayed escaped the fever; by the end of the epidemic, 215 whites and 89 african americans had died.\n\nwhile holly springs was reeling from yellow fever, ida was safe at her grandmother's house and presumed that the rest of the family had evacuated the city and gone to stay with her mother's sister belle. when no word came from them, she assumed delivery of the mail had been disrupted. then three men from holly springs brought her a letter, which she scanned until, as she later recalled, four sentences caught her eye: jim and lizzie wells have both died of the fever. they died within twenty-four hours of each other. the children are all at home and the howard association has put a woman there to take care of them. send word to ida. she immediately fainted and came to in a house of mourning surrounded by her grandmother, aunt, and uncle. her father had died on 26 september and her mother the next day.\n\nwells was concerned about her younger siblings in holly springs. two years earlier the next oldest child, eugenia, had developed severe scoliosis that had bent her spinal column until she became paralyzed below the waist. next in order of birth were her brothers james, age eleven, and george, age nine. her two youngest sisters were five-year-old annie, and lily, about two. the youngest sibling was a nine-month-old baby named stanley. another brother, eddie, had died a number of years earlier of spinal meningitis. wells wanted to go to the children immediately, but her relatives would not allow her to leave until they received a letter from a doctor saying that she should come.\n\nwhen ida arrived at the house, she found out that all the children except eugenia had been stricken with the fever. although most had slight cases, the baby had died on 3 october, and two still remained in bed. eugenia told her what had happened since the fever struck, recounting their father's contribution to the emergency. to protect his family while he built coffins and comforted the sick, james wells left home but came daily as far as the gate to bring food and to check on them. elizabeth, however, was the first of the family to be stricken. an irish woman was sent to nurse her, and james came home to help--only to come down with the fever himself.\n\njames wells had been a master mason, which in the black community often operated as a safety net for its members and their families. thus once the epidemic had passed, a group of masons gathered at the wells home to discuss what was to become of the children. after many hours of discussion, they had come to an agreement on the arrangements. they decided that ida was old enough to take care of herself, but the others would have to be parceled out. two of the masons' wives each agreed to take one of the younger girls, annie and lily. the two boys were to be apprenticed to two different men--one of whom was a local white who was familiar with their father's work and hoped his son shared wells's carpentry skills. the big problem was eugenia. because of her paralysis, no one wanted the responsibility of caring for her, so she was to be sent to a poorhouse.\n\nwhile the men were divvying up the children, ida had sat quietly. when they finished, however, she calmly announced that her parents would turn over in their graves to know their children had been scattered like that and she did not intend to let it happen. she would care for them if the masons would help her find work. although they initially scoffed at the idea, ida was adamant and they relented--probably relieved to be rid of the responsibility. wells later subtly altered the past and her experiences at rust university by recollecting, after being a happy, light-hearted schoolgirl i suddenly found myself at the head of a family. actually, her days there were less than idyllic, and she continued to attend rust between school terms until her expulsion some two years later.\n\nat age sixteen, ida b. wells was able to keep her family together because her father had been industrious and frugal. he had left them a house free of debt and accumulated savings of at least three hundred dollars. that met their needs for awhile, but ida needed to find work. on the suggestion of the masons, she sought a teaching job in a country school. she successfully passed the examination and was assigned to a school six miles outside of holly springs with a salary of twenty-five dollars a month. while she waited for school to open, wells lengthened all her skirts for the transition from schoolgirl to schoolmarm.\n\nuntil that time, wells had been sheltered by her parents, who were very protective. she had not been allowed to be in the presence of men unchaperoned, and her contacts with boys had been limited to what she called children's parties. she was naive and society was suspicious of women living without the protection of a father, husband, or male relative. the result was a pattern of rumors that would plague her until she married. after she insisted on staying in the family home with her siblings, the word spread that wells wanted the house for illicit assignations with a white man. she was dimly aware that such arrangements existed, but she was deeply shocked and hurt that people believed her capable of such action.\n\nalthough wells was listed as the head of the household in the 1880 u.s. census, she received help in meeting her responsibilities from her extended family and friends. mr. and mrs. james hall, family friends who were in their early thirties, served as guardians. after fallacious rumors that wells was having an affair with a white doctor, her grandmother, peggy, came from the country to stay with them. although she was in her seventies, she tried to help out by working during the day. however, one night peggy collapsed with a paralytic stroke, and her daughter took her back to the country to care for her until she died?\n\nonce wells started to work at the country school, she needed someone to watch the children during the week. an old friend of her mother's (probably rachel rather) agreed to do so. rather was from virginia, twenty-four years older than elizabeth, and may have served as a surrogate mother to her. she took care of the children until ida would come home every friday, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. before she returned on sunday afternoon, wells did all the laundry and housecleaning for the week. she also cooked for the children, often using eggs and butter that people near her school had given her. fortunately, she did not have to keep up this frantic pace for too long. gradually, she was relieved of the responsibility for some of the children. by 1880, her brother james, who the family called jim, had left home and had become apprenticed to a carpenter. although he was no longer under her direct supervision, wells still worried about jim. she later called him her problem child because he was constantly getting into minor difficulties, especially with women. he would then go to ida, who would help him out of the trouble. george was quieter and also became a carpenter's apprentice, eventually moving to kansas.\n\nwells taught for three years in marshall county and tate county schools and for six months in a school in cleveland county, arkansas. in 1881 wells accepted the invitation of her aunt, fannie wells, to come to memphis. fannie lived there with her three small children, having been widowed by the yellow fever epidemic. wells brought her two youngest sisters with her to memphis, while eugenia went to live with their aunt belle on her farm. after she arrived in the city at the age of nineteen, wells continued to teach--first in the nearby town of woodstock, and after 1884 in the city schools of memphis.\n\nforced into an early adulthood by her parents' deaths, in memphis wells began to feel the pull of conflicting duties and desires that marked her entire life. as she struggled to balance her responsibilities to her family and her race, wells also sought to fulfill her personal needs for independence and security. her quest for self-identity was complicated by a temperament that made it difficult for her accept the gender and racial roles expected of her. after much seeking and struggling, wells became both a woman and an activist in memphis.
but i happened to be in a relationship at that time, said ms. mcculley, who graduated from pomona college and received two master's degrees, one in business administration and the other in sport management from the university of massachusetts amherst. she was also a fulbright scholar in switzerland from 2009-2010, where she conducted research on european sports law.\n\nthey parted ways but tinder soon put them on another course, this one in may 2017.\n\ni was very excited, mr. spencer said. though i must admit, i needed a bit of a nudge to remember having met kayla previously through the car pool.\n\nms. mcculley provided the nudge, and two weeks later, mr. spencer took her on a whirlwind first date that included a stop for coffee and churros, followed by some bookstore browsing and ending with blues dancing lessons.\n\non their sixth date, the book club was created.\n\nthat's about the time when we first started getting serious, said mr. spencer, who graduated from m.i.t. and received a ph.d. in electrical engineering from the university of california, berkeley.\n\nwe often discussed our favorite books with one another, he said. that became a great way to learn new things about each other, and to feel more comfortable when in each other's presence.
in a crucial early scene of janacek's katya kabanova, the title character, a young woman trapped in a stultifying marriage to a timid merchant in a town on the volga, recalls memories of her carefree childhood. as a girl, katya tells varvara, her adopted sister-in-law, she would rise early on summer days, wash in the stream and tend to every flower in her house. going to church was like falling into a trance, katya says; she imagined rising to heaven to watch angels fly.\n\njanacek's restless music suggests that this nostalgic confession is fraught with katya's instability. the emotional complexities came through strongly on friday night when the juilliard school opened a production of katya kabanova by the director stephen wadsworth at the peter jay sharp theater — and not just because the soprano felicia moore, as katya, sang so expressively.\n\nthe dramatic impact was enhanced because the opera was performed in an english translation of janacek's original czech libretto. it used to be common, if never the prevailing practice, for operas to be translated into the language of the audience, especially in the united states. this was especially true for less familiar works, though i have wonderful early memories of hearing staples like the marriage of figaro and la bohème performed in english.\n\nthis practice involves a trade-off. great composers wrote vocal lines that hewed to the sounds and flow of the words in the libretto, and that bond is hard to mimic even in the best translations. the advantage is the direct communication between singers and audiences that can result.
i am 17. since i was a baby, my mother has taken me to church with her on sunday mornings. recently, i've felt less religious and less interested in going than i used to. but when i bring this up with her, it always ends in a screaming match (especially on sunday mornings). she believes i must go. we get along fairly well otherwise. is there a better way to broach this subject, or should i simply endure the weekly ritual until i go to college?\n\nsara\n\nin one of the great understatements in (boxing) history, floyd mayweather jr. once said, self-preservation is an important thing to me. so it should be to all of us. you are probably financially dependent on your mother — and will be, to some extent, when you go to college. nothing in your letter suggests a dire backdrop, but many young people are cut off by their parents for warring over hot topics such as religion or sexuality. keep that (and your best interests) in mind.\n\ni applaud your mom for wanting a regular spiritual component in your life. but that needn't be church (in my irrelevant opinion) for one disinclined and on the cusp of adulthood. suggest a weekly commitment to serving those in need — at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter, maybe — in lieu of church. she may go for a switcheroo with a moral and compassionate flavor. (or she may want you sitting in the pew next to her.) bring it up quietly at dinner some tuesday night and see how it goes.\n\nvegansplaining\n\ni am a passionate vegan for many reasons. but contrary to popular opinion, i do not speak about them. still, when asked if i am vegan, i suffer an instant barrage of unsolicited opinions — from you're going to die of malnutrition to stop being a snowflake; animals don't have feelings. this offends me. these conversations aren't about me explaining my choices, but others imposing their (often incorrect) views on me. i am a peace-loving person, but i would like a saucy comeback. can you oblige?
fire sermon\n\nby jamie quatro\n\n208 pp. grove press. $24\n\nthere are books with front doors, through which the reader walks right in, and there are books with side doors. side door books take more interpretive work, but yield special pleasures. jamie quatro's fantastic new novel, fire sermon, is a side door book. the novel delivers its story through a variety of methods: first-person confessions, fictional third-person descriptions, letters sent and unsent, emails, questionnaires, socratic dialogues with the self. roiling, raw and sensual on the surface, this mazy novel rewards a second reading.\n\nthe plot is simple: a married woman is trying to forget her lover. the woman, maggie ellmann, a contented mother of two grown children, meets james, a married poet, at a conference. they spend two years falling into a long-distance emotional affair. the affair culminates in a single, searing night together in chicago, after which they part for good. in the unsent letters she writes to james during this embargo, maggie struggles to find a theological framework for her longing and her pain. in one such letter, she admires the buddhist notion of death as the ultimate lack of attachment, noting, what relief there would be in no longer longing to feel, again, your whiskers on my inner thighs. her antagonist is time — so slow when she is trying to forget, so quick when she reflects on the simpler years with her husband and children, before the erotic disruption.\n\nthe novel dips back through time to track life before the affair. the mores of the ellmanns' lives are exceedingly conventional, as are many of the novel's touchstones — weddings, baptisms, the death of pets. but the way this slim book condenses these happenings in the context of the affair gives them poetry. lyrical lists of domestic detritus contain the sweetness of child rearing, as well as a mysterious sense of loss: parent meetings, medical forms, class photos, permission slips. organelles. passive versus active transport. quatro cuts gorgeous topiaries into the domestic landscape. maggie's little daughter mispronounces nail polish as pale nolish; her son fashions a makeshift loincloth from his father's old t-shirt, with a wrapping-paper tube for a spear. but over the years, invasive plants encroach, privet and wisteria, thistle and honeysuckle. the backyard steadily shrinks. even before she meets james, maggie is aware of a lack of feeling, an inattentiveness to self — this nothing. this nothing can partly be traced back to two difficult childbirths, and the habitual surrendering of her own body to others, most especially during sex, into which her usually benign husband manipulates and bullies her. middle age looms. the children grow into complicated teenagers, then leave for college. in other words, maggie has been in a personal stasis for a long time. enter james. she first becomes aware of him through reading his poetry, which she admires. i think i'm going to write to him, she announces to her husband, thomas.\n\nimage\n\npoor thomas. he surely has his side of the story, but we don't get it here. instead we are told: thomas is, in fact, a good husband. syntactically, the sentence says so much. the fact of the husband's goodness becomes a sidebar. maggie is aware of, but helpless against, the greed for more love, when she already has more than most. the marriage has its problems, but the biggest one is its earthly limitations, the waning of interest and desire — its mortality. only if a person were married to god would she or he have a partner who would never suffer from overfamiliarity.
i also wanted to be honest about my feelings without hurting his. he seemed unfazed when i suggested it may be awkward to appear as eddie and sally obermueller and morph into a singular identity that looked like neither of us.\n\neddie responded just as casually: what about our kids?\n\ngood question.\n\nwe both remembered being children and grappling with our cultural identities.\n\nstarting in my youth, i went exclusively by sally as my american name . it's a change many asian immigrants make in order to assimilate to their new worlds. having a western name was a kind of status symbol in the ethnic enclave of southern california where i grew up, where the prosperous and so-called model minorities aimed to set themselves apart.\n\na cascade of embarrassment would overcome me any time my real first name, phuong, was discovered. the start and end of the school year served as the bookends to my self-consciousness.\n\nmy heart pounded as i spoke up at roll call on the first day of school to ask my teachers to call me sally. and i would quickly and quietly cross out my legal name in yearbooks when the last day of school came near, replacing it with sally and hoping those who flipped past the page wouldn't notice.\n\nand my last name was no cakewalk either. i was a girl taunted for being a ho.\n\ni couldn't wait to shed for good the stupid jokes involving santa claus and prostitutes, comforting myself with the idea that i had a married name to look forward to. it was a western tradition i was excited for, even though it's not the norm in asian cultures like mine.
maj. charles s. kettles, an army helicopter commander in the vietnam war, led an extraordinary rescue operation that saved the lives of dozens of airborne troops who had been ambushed by north vietnamese soldiers in may 1967. president barack obama would later describe the incident as like a bad rambo movie.\n\nmajor kettles was awarded the distinguished service cross, the army's highest citation for valor after the medal of honor, in 1968.\n\nbut the story of his heroism and those of his fellow helicopter crewmen remained largely unknown beyond military circles for nearly half a century.\n\nthat changed on july 18, 2016, when president obama presented mr. kettles, a retired lieutenant colonel, with the medal of honor at the white house.
this week, noah baumbach's marriage story received six oscar nominations, including for best actor (adam driver) and best actress (scarlett johansson). in the movie, an amicable split becomes a shattering rupture, a.o. scott writes in his review. what is happening is catastrophic, ridiculous and also — as the lawyers know — perfectly ordinary.\n\nfor readers who have watched the movie, we're curious what the experience was like if you've gone through a divorce or if you grew up with divorced parents. if you're married and watched it with your spouse — and are still recovering — we'd love to hear from you too.\n\nshare details of your experience via the form below, and include contact information so the times can follow up with you. we may publish a selection of the responses.
jake silverstein, editor in chief: what i love about this design, aside from the innate fascination of studying these couples closely, is how the subtle narrative of the four-part sequence (beginning with the husband and wife and then ending with them in a more intimate pose) perfectly captures the provocative idea posed by the question in the center.\n\nread the cover story by susan dominus, is an open marriage a happier marriage? see all past covers here.
john druschitz spent five days in a texas hospital last april with fever and shortness of breath. it was still the early days of the pandemic, and doctors puzzled over a diagnosis.\n\nthey initially suspected coronavirus and hung signs outside his door warning those entering to wear protective equipment. mr. druschitz had already spent two weeks at home with worsening symptoms. he recalls one doctor telling him, this is what it does to a person.\n\nensuing lab work, however, was ambiguous: multiple molecular tests for coronavirus came back negative, but an antibody test was positive.\n\ndoctors found that mr. druschitz had an irregular heartbeat and blood clots in both his lungs. they sent him home on oxygen, and ultimately did not give a coronavirus diagnosis because of the negative tests. he didn't think much about the decision until this fall, when he received a $22,367.81 bill that the hospital has since threatened to send to collections.
the administration has instituted regulations to undermine the law, for example expanding the sale of short term health insurance policies that do not have to cover pre-existing medical conditions or other health benefits deemed essential by the law, such as emergency services and prescription drugs. and the white house has cut funding to promote obamacare sign-ups and for navigators who are supposed to help consumers enroll.\n\nin seeking to get rid of the tax, the democrats appear in one sense to be joining the slow dismantlement — or at least undermining their own argument that the embattled health law will save taxpayers more than it costs them over the long run while holding down health spending broadly.\n\nbut that proved to be of less concern than complaints from some of the democrats' key supporters, who say the cadillac tax will hurt middle-class workers. the bill's sponsor, representative joe courtney of connecticut, titled it the middle class health benefits tax repeal act and recruited 367 sponsors, including 200 democrats.\n\neven some liberal economists, backed by the unions, are urging repeal. the economic policy institute, a liberal research group, argued that health care costs were already decelerating, so the tax was unnecessary both to pay for the health law and to further slow down health cost increases.\n\nto put it simply, the tax aims to reduce patients' utilization of health care, wrote thea m. lee, the president of the institute and a former leader of the a.f.l.-c.i.o., and the economist josh bivens. but the glaring problem of u.s. health costs is not excess utilization; instead it is high and rising prices for health care. smart cost-containment policy should address these prices, not seek to ratchet down how much care patients seek.\n\nwith so many supporters, mr. courtney secured a vote on the house's fast-track calendar, which requires two-thirds of the house to vote for passage, but also allows the bill to bypass rules that would require the cost to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere.\n\nrepealing the 40 percent excise tax on generous employer-sponsored health plans would increase projected federal deficits by $197 billion through 2029, according to the budget office, and so far there is no plan for replacing the lost revenue. many health economists, who have generally been the biggest supporters of the tax, still see it as an important way to contain rising health care costs, contending that generous health benefits encourage people to get more medical care than they need.
[music playing]\n\nezra klein\n\ni'm ezra klein, and this is the ezra klein show. i don't want to ruin too much of this show by summarizing it at the top. heather mcghee, who is my guest and the author of the wonderful and really important new book, the sum of us, explains all of it better than i can. so i'm going to let her do it. but i do want to share a connection this conversation made for me that i wish i'd made before i walked into it. and so maybe you'll get more out of it having this earlier than i did. a few years ago, i interviewed a psychologist named lisa feldman barrett, and she had written this really great book about how the mind generates emotions. and her argument is that emotions are metaphors that apply to sensory data. depending on which metaphors our society has given us, we will interpret the same sensory data in different ways. so if you believe yourself to be an anxious person or your society talks about anxiety a lot, you'll likely interpret a speedy heart rate, a bit of stomach churning as anxiety, a bad thing. i know i've done this quite a bit. but another person in another context might feel the same feelings as anticipation or excitement. she tells this funny story about being on a date and thinking it wasn't going well — that the conversation was lame, that the guy was lame. but at the same time, she was flushed and her heart rate was sped up and she felt these butterflies in her stomach, and so she thought, i must be wrong. there must be some real primal connection here. but it just turned out she had food poisoning. her brain had a story, a metaphor. it knew how to apply to those sensory feelings. and so then it got what those feelings met wrong. our brains are prediction machines, and sometimes they predict incorrectly. something that i took from this conversation with heather is that the same thing happens on a societal level. if we grow up in a society cut up by racism, told again and again that our relationships, our policies are zero-sum, that if those people over there are going to progress, it's going to come at our expense, that metaphor will lodge in us. we'll become used to interpreting the data of this world in a zero-sum way. and so a society that needs to tell that zero-sum story again and again and again to justify racial hierarchy and oppression, to justify ill-gotten gains, will also become used to seeing the world through that lens. and so we will deprive ourselves — all of us — of so many opportunities to advance together, because we are so used to fearing that any other group's gain will mean our loss. but even outside that specific outcome, it's just worth thinking about this whole conversation in terms of the deep stories we tell ourselves and the way that trains our mind to think, the way that trains our mind to interpret. when we are useful looking at things one way, we will look at almost everything that way. we'll be quick to impose that story on the world around us. and if that's a bad story, a story of scarcity rather than abundance, of zero-sum rather than positive-sum interactions, then that is a world we'll get. in many cases, that is a world america has now. as always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. i'm always interested to know who you'd like to see on the show next or what you think of the show. just send me your suggestions, your feedback. here's heather mcghee. so the metaphor at the center of the book is this idea of the drained public pool. but i want to start in the reality of the drained public pool. tell me about that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, america went on this building boom across the country of this novel thing which was the grand, resort-style, public pool. it was a tangible symbol of government largesse and commitment to the kind of high, leisure-filled quality of life that would become the american dream. it was a melting pot, almost literally. it was a part of the americanization project of bringing white ethnic communities together to have shared recreation. there was a sense that the new america of the 20th century, the early 20th century, needed this kind of public investment to cohere a national identity and improve everyone's quality of life. and there were over 2,000 in the united states, and many of them were for whites only and segregated, as were most of the public benefits at the time. then in the 1950s and '60s, civil rights advocates in black communities started arguing that their tax dollars had funded these grand public pools, and therefore, they should be allowed to swim too. and that's when white towns got really creative. in order to avoid integrating the public pools, they sold them to private entities for $1. they wouldn't provide them in a public way anymore. and then ultimately, in order to avoid integrating them, many of these towns drained their public swimming pools rather than let black families swim too. so of course, the white families lost a public resource as well. the black families never knew the glory days of the well-funded public pool. we started seeing backyard pools crop up around the country and these private members-only swimming clubs — over 100 of them in the d.c. area alone after pool integration — these private clubs that you had to pay. and it was a tangible example, like of course, massive resistance to brown in virginia, where they closed dozens of public schools, where once the idea of the public included people of color, not only was the public no longer good, but white people didn't want public goods at all.\n\nezra klein\n\nit's such a powerful visual. so you went to one of these pools, and they literally poured concrete in it.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nmm-hmm. yeah.\n\nezra klein\n\ni mean, they destroyed something they loved.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah. i traveled to montgomery, alabama, where oak park is still there, but the pool that was the center of the park in the middle of montgomery was filled in, seeded over with grass by the time the next summer came along, and you see this wide expanse rimmed with oak trees now. i actually collected a handful of the acorns from these oak trees just as a reminder of how recent this phenomenon was, and how it can regenerate if we're not careful — these seeds of this exclusion and dispossession. they closed in montgomery the parks and recreation department for a decade, from 1959 to 1969. so they sold off the animals to the zoo. they had no parks and recreation department at all for a decade of the 1960s. and when they reopened the system, they never recreated the pool. they never rebuilt the pool.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i want to hold here for a couple of minutes and talk about the psychology. i think it is easy to listen to something like this and say, well, that's in the before days.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyep.\n\nezra klein\n\nbut 1969 is not 6,000 years ago. my parents were alive. my brother would be born in a couple of years. that is in living memory. so i want to talk about the psychology that would lead white people to brick over their own public goods rather than share them. at that moment in 1959, when you have leaders in montgomery, alabama — white leaders closing their park department, telling their own children, there will be no pool for you to go to — how do they see themselves as doing the right thing for their children, for themselves? the book, both in this metaphor and in everything else we're going to talk about, is about this idea that this mindset leads to not just black people getting less, but white people getting less. and it literalizes right here. so how are they the heroes of their own story?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthe story that allows them to be heroes by cutting off their noses despite their face, for example, is a story in which black people have a poverty that is contagious — that black people are both physically unclean and dangerous, more prone to violence, and so would therefore be threatening to the little kids and the — heaven forbid — women in bathing suits. there's a sexualized stereotype around hypersexual black masculinity, that we can't have our white women being anywhere near black men. but there is also the idea, i think, on a deeper level that when generations of white people have been the beneficiaries of these invisible government benefits from the homestead act, the g.i. bill, that have created an actual economic superiority over black people, that idea reifies the idea that there's something innately superior about white people. and so the way i made sense of it was, if you've been taught for generations to disdain and distrust a group of people and exclude them from the circle of human belonging, from citizenship, from economic inclusion, from schools, from unions — the list goes on — neighborhoods, mortgage markets, and then suddenly the same government that was the purveyor of all of that, the government that wrote into its housing codes, do not sell to black people or we will not give you money — that same government almost on a dime said, ok, now you have to swim with those people. you have to go to school with those people. it was a level of betrayal to the white consciousness that made white people want to disengage from a collective that was no longer trustworthy.\n\nezra klein\n\nyou and i grew up in a similar milieu in politics, in this policy analysts world in d.c. and you were at demos, and i was at the american prospect, which at a certain point merged together for a time. and something you talk about is a realization — as that work continued looking at table after table showing how a tax plan or a student debt plan or a health plan would benefit different groups, that there was this myth at the core of policy analysis that what people are trying to do in politics is pursue their economic self-interest. and when you look at examples like this one — but so much that we'll talk about here, so much in the trump era, so much in modern politics too, you just endlessly watch that disproven. you just endlessly watch that narrow distributional table way of measuring what is in somebody's self-interest fail. so when you look at these stories, how do you understand political self-interest?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyou're right that in many ways, i left the think tank world in order to set out on the three-year journey it took for me to write the sum of us, because i felt like the way the progressive economic orthodoxy was understanding economic self-interest and what was driving people and how to make change — the idea that we could study the problem, put the numbers in front of decision makers, and of course, everybody would benefit — that all seemed very flawed to me, particularly after the election of donald trump. what i understand now is that much more than a material self-interest is a status self-interest — is a self-interest particularly in a society as hierarchical as ours, as brutally hierarchical as ours. being in the middle or on the top of that hierarchy is more important than $7 more an hour for you, is more important than $10,000 off of your student loan bill, is more important than things like taking action to address climate change. all of these obvious self-interest issues have been filtered through a racialized zero-sum story — the idea that progress for people of color has to come at the expense of white people. that is, more than anything i discovered, the major stumbling block to progress in america.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i want to look at some of the policy areas this plays out today, because i think it's important to say this really clearly — drained pools is by no means the most consequential example of drained pool politics. and so i actually want to begin with medicaid expansion after the affordable care act. you cite a study in the book which found that as the percent of the black population increases, the likelihood of medicaid adoption in a state decreases. tell me about that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso i look at the racialized history of our unique-among-advanced-economies unwillingness to provide universal health care, and it's just overwhelming, the evidence. from the very beginning, truman tried to have a national health insurance plan. the segregationist dixiecrats in his party opposed it. and then, of course, to obamacare and medicaid expansion. i actually didn't realize until i began researching the book that white americans are pretty vehemently opposed to obamacare and have been. support for it has never reached over 50 percent. it's still an unpopular plan among white americans, even though if you break down the individual policies, white americans are supportive of it. but if you think about medicaid expansion, which is still a fraught battle — we still have a dozen states that have refused to expand medicaid. and as soon as, not incidentally, a states' rights theory was used to knock down the medicaid expansion that should have been universal across 50 states, you had a new mason-dixon line of states mostly in the old confederacy that refused to expand medicaid. and i looked at a bunch of the research that really showed the racialization of health care opinion, and i go to texas, which is the state with the highest uninsured in the population. it is the state with the highest number of rural hospital closings. and these are hospitals that are the lifeblood of these mostly rural, conservative, largely white towns, and they are closing. and a significant degree of the closure is because of unpaid bills by people who should be eligible for medicaid. but the texas political class — the overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male political class in texas is absolutely opposed to expanding medicaid. and the idea that i heard from the advocates on the ground was that the idea of medicaid has become a dog whistle for black people. even the latino community in texas — there were many people who said, it's not something we want, because after 40 years of being told that public benefits are only for degraded poor people, you don't want any part of that. admitting that you need medicaid is admitting that you were on the bottom of this social hierarchy that you're going to work like hell to rise above.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i remember covering this. i covered the affordable care act closely. and there are two things about this that always stick in my mind. one is that the medicaid expansion, even with the supreme court decision allowing states to opt out — it was built to be such an extraordinarily good deal for the states. the federal government paid 100 percent of the cost for the first three years, and then it was 90-10 after that. medicaid is usually a much closer match between the federal government and state governments. the federal government was backing up dump trucks of health care money into these red states, and these red states are saying no. but then the consequences are deadly. so a 2019 study by the center for budget and policy priorities found that medicaid expansion saved 19,000 lives from 2014 to 2017, and state decisions not to expand cost 15,600 premature deaths over the same period. and to state the unbelievably obvious, a lot of those are white people. this isn't just not being able to swim in a pool. this is your mother may die, your friend may die — it's shocking.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's shocking. it's very upsetting. i did talk to health care advocates who could easily recall people they knew who had died because of a lack of health care coverage. and these are the stakes. this is why i felt the need to write a book making this somewhat controversial argument that racism has a cost for everyone. because when we continue to allow the zero-sum story, the idea that progress for one group comes at the expense of another, it's a lie that we are buying into, and it's a costly lie. i talk about health care in the book. i talk about the lives lost for our unwillingness to — in a way, it is swimming in the same pool, ezra. it's the same risk pool. it's the same health insurance pool. actually, insurers use the word pool.\n\nezra klein\n\nthe wonk is coming out with that pun. [laughter] swimming in the same risk pool.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthat's right. but i mean, deep must that zero-sum story be to have white americans, the majority of whom have voted against the party of the new deal that largely built the white middle class since that party also expanded to become the party of civil rights too — they're cheering the gutting of public investments that they, in fact, would benefit from. and yet ever since integration, we have had white political majority that has cheered on the cutting of the social safety net, the ratcheting down of welfare to virtual meaninglessness, and the attacks on unions.\n\nezra klein\n\nso one of the things i'm going to want to push on during this conversation is some questions of causality. and so one here is about whether or not this reflects a often counterproductive human belief in certain forms of zero-sum fairness or racism directly. so there are all kinds of studies and experiments in which if people feel somebody else is getting something that is unfair, they will make it so they and everyone else get less in order to keep it from that person getting more. my colleague, sarah kliff — we're both at the new york times now, but back then, we were at vox — she did this extraordinary reporting trip to kentucky early in the trump era. and she was going and looking at and talking to white people in kentucky, poor white people who were benefiting from the affordable care act but were supporting donald trump and supporting a republican party that wanted to repeal it. she got a bunch of explanations, but one thing she kept finding was anger and resentment that the slightly better-off working class white people had towards the slightly poorer white people, because they were paying premiums in the exchanges, and the slightly poorer white people were not paying premiums for medicaid. they felt the poorer white people were getting too much for nothing. so is this just a racialized phenomenon, or is this a deeper thing in which this idea that somebody else is getting more than we are when we're the ones who deserve more than they get just fouls up politics everywhere and always?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthe zero-sum story — i go back in the book to the beginning — where did we get the zero-sum story? it's not an obvious thing. it's not an obvious belief system. it's not a natural sense of group competition, and it's more widely held among white people than other people. and so i went back to the founding and the pre-founding of this country and showed how it was used to justify the first economic policies of this country, which were stolen people, stolen land, and stolen labor. that zero-sum racial hierarchy created the scaffolding. i do believe that since it's so aggressively marketed to white people through the lens of racial hierarchy, it's very clear to me that a white person can feel that way about other white people as well, that resentment and that desire to distinguish among the various small gradations on this ladder of human value. but it's that ladder of human value that was first mapped onto the american psyche as a racialized project. though disdain and distrust that particularly white americans have for people who are poor is a very racialized view — it's the idea that there's something inherently wrong with people who don't have enough money. it's also — of course, the whole thing is very rich. when you say that people are so resentful of people getting things in an unfair way, i mean, that's what the entirety of the white spoils system has been in this country. and those same people are not resentful of white privilege. those same people are not resentful of the history, which frankly, many of them were taught not to know and worked very hard not to know of all of the litany of free stuff that was given by the government to create the white middle class. and so i do think it's related — the idea of resentment at some idea that somebody is getting something else and the way that we cling as americans to whatever our rung is on this brutal hierarchical ladder.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i want to try to draw out more this psychological model you're suggesting here. so human beings are born, and we're pretty malleable in the way we can understand society working. there have been lots of different ways society has been composed going way, way, way back through the ages, and lots of different ways they're composed around the world now. so it's obvious to me looking at some of these studies that we all have a tendency to be willing to either be altruistic and believe we should be helping each other, or to be pulled towards a selfish, zero-sum, angry, resentful — i have a toddler, and i will see this — just flipping every couple of hours depending on mood. and so what you're saying is that in a society riven by racism, more of a story that gets people thinking in a zero-sum resentful way is told and told and retold and retold. and if i understand you, it falls within particular power. that's why people say, look at black people. but it's a way you have structured your thinking so that it also becomes natural for you to think of other white people this way, people of other social classes this way, maybe people of other countries this way. that once this model of this is the right way to understand your competition with others takes hold in your brain, it's an easy metaphor to start applying everywhere. and so these things that maybe have a beginning in the need to construct and sustain this racial caste system begin to be applied more broadly over time. is that true to how you think about it, or am i getting that story wrong?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nno, i think that is right. when you create this hierarchy of human value, and you feel that there are only so many rungs on that ladder, and if someone gets on your rung, that means you have nowhere to go but down — that can apply to immigrants, different kinds of immigrants over different time, that can apply to women coming into the workforce, et cetera. but i will say that for me, it was important to note that the zero-sum racial hierarchy is a story that has been relentlessly packaged and marketed and sold by people who benefit the most from the economic status quo. it is not something that is a predominant white working class idea on its own. everything we believe comes from a story we've been told. and whether it's rupert murdoch and the desire for a billionaire to have a propaganda mechanism where the zero-sum story is really the core narrative that finds a new example every hour to the person with the biggest bull horn in the world for four years, to donald trump, and everything in between, the conservative orthodoxy around makers and takers and freeloaders and taxpayers and reagan's shifting of the narrative of what was wrong with black people from white oppression to cultures of black poverty — all of that is a story that political and economic elites have sold for their own profit to a white majority that then continues to vote for their perceived racial interest instead of their class interest with brown and black americans who are often struggling from the same economic challenges.\n\nezra klein\n\ni always think of donald trump in this model, because trump is somebody who i think you really see had a temperament oriented towards this kind of zero-sum thinking, and then applied it to everything despite being at the very top of the ladder. i mean, he's somebody who was racist, but also his understanding, as far as i could tell, of all relationships between america and other countries was that we were either winning or losing the transaction. his understanding of all business deals was he was either winning the deal or he was losing the deal. his understanding of all human relations was he was either winning and dominating or losing and being made weak. and it always struck me in him and in its appeal to people that it is actually, sadly, much harder to make people think about the ways in which a world can be positive-sum, the ways in which a deal can benefit both sides simultaneously, than the ways in which it can be zero-sum. and so there's this real danger of people who have either felt this or seen this or oriented towards it, and then that becomes the only way they can think about life.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah. i mean, i do my best in the book to try to find examples time and time again that give lie to the idea of the zero-sum not only enumerating the costs of racism to white people, to widen the aperture that has completely unwittingly and not at all with anything but positive intent communicated a story in recent years of white privilege that suggests that racism is good for white people, so maybe they should actually keep it. if i'm told all the time that racism is to my benefit, the only thing i have to make me want to join with racial justice advocates to fight against racism is a sense of self-sacrifice. and at a time of widening insecurity, that's not enough. it's also not true. i mean, we hit on the formula in this country for making broadly-shared prosperity for the masses. and we walked away from it because of racism. that is more clear to me now than ever. and you get reports coming out every six months it seems from citigroup this summer saying that we've lost nearly $20 trillion in economic output because of the racial-economic divides over the past 20 years. or the federal reserve bank just this past week — a report saying we lost $2 trillion in economic output in 2019 because of the economic gaps between white men and everybody else. it's no way to run a country. we're leaving some of our best players on the sidelines. [music playing]\n\nezra klein\n\nso you mentioned earlier that if you look at public opinion about the affordable care act just among white people, it has never been popular. though the affordable care act is now above 50 percent in polling, it is not above 50 percent among white people. i mean, if you at, say, votes for donald trump, donald trump would have won if only white people voted. and one way of reading this that i see sometimes, it's just like, white people are conservative. but something that you draw out, and that you see, i think, if you look at europe, is that that is a reaction to america's particular history with race and its racial divide. so there's obviously nothing genetic about white people that causes them to favor these politics, or else canada would not have a universal health care system, the uk wouldn't have it, denmark wouldn't have it, switzerland wouldn't have it. in other places, white people do not have the politics that white people in america have.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nmm-hmm. that's exactly right. everything we believe comes from a story we've been told, and the story that has been aggressively marketed to white americans has been that there is something so wrong with black and brown people that you don't want to be in collaboration with or in solidarity with them or else that reflects on you. there is a hierarchy of human value. you'd better fight like heck to maintain your position in that hierarchy. i think it's really important not to even inadvertently communicate that there's some sort of biological basis for these group-identity-related psychologies. i talk about it in terms of the slogan that's become very popular in some places on the left. trust black women. i'm a black woman. i want you to trust me. i want to trust stacey abrams. i want you to trust ayanna pressley. i agree to a certain degree, but i was always a little bit wary of it, because it suggests there's something biologically amazing and magical about us. and in fact, it's not that. it's that there is a social hierarchy, that group identity does shape your experience of the world and how the systems shape your life, and so people who are at the intersectional bottom of that social hierarchy are the ones who have the clearest view of all of it — all who is harmed by it, and what you need to do to fix it for everyone.\n\nezra klein\n\ni want to move to another example in the book, which is higher education. you connect the transition from publicly financed higher education, which we really did have through much of the 20th century — you really could go to college on the government's dime and not come out with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans — and you connect the racialization of this and the way that the politics of race deformed white attitudes towards public spending to the student debt crisis today. can you talk through that story a bit?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthis was really important to me, because there actually has been a lot of reporting about poor and working class white people who reject welfare and means-tested medicaid, because they're so silly. they cut off their noses despite their faces and tsk-tsk about them. but i want to talk about something that was a much more middle class issue, which is college. the somewhat novel idea of well-funded public colleges, at least one in every state, was one of the hallmarks of the american whites-only social contract for the first half of the 20th century. all of that changed with a new post-civil rights movement anti-government ethos among the white voting majority which wanted tax cuts and not public spending, which wanted a sense of pulling up the ladder and divesting from these places that had become really fraught and contested spaces like public education of the k through 12 level. public college became a place where integration was being threatened. and so it's not normally conceived of. first of all, most people don't know that we have so much student loan debt because of government cutbacks of states spending less per capita on public college despite a growing tax base and a federal shift from grants to loans. people don't know that it's government cutbacks that created the student debt problem. and they certainly typically don't map the issue of race and racism onto it. but the shift in the expectation of free college for a majority white college-going population to a debt for diploma system for a predominantly students of color population is one of the most dramatic examples of racism draining the pool. and if i can just add, it's so frustrating, because it's seen as a colorblind issue. student debt — the rules that we changed in order to make student debt the new normal were not explicitly racist like redlining or all of that. but when you say suddenly to a generation, not only do you have to go to college to get a middle class job because of changes we've made in the labor market, but you will now have to fund that college out of your own family's wealth, knowing full well that family wealth is where history shows up in your wallet, where the amount of money you have in savings or cds or home equity absolutely tracks to what side of the color line you were on when the government was handing out free wealth building opportunities, you get what you have now, which is a widening of the racial wealth gap, which is the fact that a black family with a college degree has less wealth than a white family headed by a high school dropout. it's colorblind, but it's systemically racist, and it impacts not just the targeted community, but also the majority of white students who have to borrow now too.\n\nezra klein\n\nthis, i think, is such an important point. i want to hold on it for a minute, because something i was thinking about reading the book is a little bit subtle here. so if you think about the way a lot of american public policy has changed over the decades you're tracking, basically, it moves from the government does things that you just get, like public college, to you have to pay out of pocket for it. and so that's really a move from something that builds wealth in the future to takes income in the present. and so then, what looks like a fair race to people — i mean, everybody's getting this chance to go to college and get a pell grant — but in fact, as you say here, is reflecting that if you got in when the getting was good, you have the assets to then pay for the thing you need now and just have it then continue to build wealth. and that's where it seems we get into some of this widening wealth gap stuff. and i'd like to talk about the mechanisms of that a little bit, because i think it's really important, wherein if you have family who can pay for your higher education, and so then you go to college and you get a really good job, then you just start rebuilding wealth. but if you have family who couldn't pay for your higher education costs, and so you go to college and you get a good job, but you're paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt, and you're also helping other members of your family who maybe don't have as much as you do, then you don't build wealth. it helps your income some, but it doesn't translate into your wealth, and so the gap just keeps widening. i really feel like the dynamics of wealth creation are understudied and under-emphasized in politics, where we tend to talk about income. but in many ways, they seem to me to be more important.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nin my time at demos, we really focused on these issues of wealth and debt, because it is so much more compounding in terms of opportunity and disadvantage than an income. you could get a great job today or tomorrow. you could get a great contract. you could have enough money in a given paycheck to pay your bills. but the question of what happens when that paycheck stops or is paused or you feel sick and can't go in is life determining. and that is where, basically, we're all paying compound interest on decisions made long before we were born — racially explicit decisions. there's a section in the book where i lay out the list of free stuff that was given to white americans to help build wealth. and it's so important to recognize that the divides that everyday people observe today — what's going on with that black neighborhood? why does it feel like it doesn't have as many small businesses? why does it seem like the schools in black neighborhoods are underfunded? well, they're linked to property values, which are a result of generations of explicit laws forbidding black people from owning homes and selling them. and so we have this now somewhat colorblind story of economic disparity today that we try with the american mythology of individual effort and bootstraps and just overall individualism to justify by saying, well, black people just don't try that hard. but in fact, it's not that black people don't try that hard. it's in fact that decisions were made long before many black people and white people were born, and when we ended the era of explicit racial wealth stripping policies — i'm going to put a caveat in that around the subprime mortgage crisis, which we may come back to — we didn't take that into account. and that's why there's such a vocal call now for reparations, because no amount of education or income that black families do is going to make up for generations of racism in our wealth building markets.\n\nezra klein\n\nso senator cory booker and congresswoman ayanna pressley have this idea for baby bonds, which is a wealth generating proposal. and they calculate that it would close about a half to two-thirds of the racial wealth gap, at least if you're measuring that from the median, not the mean. and for a long time in the democratic party, there was this idea that because the politics of race are so difficult, because framing things for race creates these drain the pool mentalities. so what you want to do is you want to have racially progressive policies that you sell in a colorblind way. and in recent years, there's been an almost reversal, i think, having to do with the dynamics inside the democratic party, where policies that are literally colorblind, like this baby bonds policy, are being sold in a very race-conscious way, as a way of, say, closing the racial wealth gap. given the research you've done here, and so the grappling you've done with the politics that happen when you frame things around race, where do you come down on that?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso what that's reflecting is the hard fact that the majority of white americans have not voted for democrats since the civil rights movement. and so when we were growing up and there was this fear of the white center all the time in politics, it was a cold calculation. the new calculation is that what the democrats are riding to victory is a new, multiracial, anti-racist coalition, the backbone of which is black people, and then the white people who join are progressives who don't mind sitting in a meeting with and swimming in a pool with black people. they came for obama, they stayed to fight against trump. now they like it. so that is, i think, what explains that shift. i think the idea is we've got to deal with these racial disparities. i think it is a genuine desire to see this country prosper by making sure that all families have what they need and that we don't keep holding back millions of american families because of bad public policy decisions. but i think the politics of it are, yes, we can actually talk about the race impacts of this, because there's a clamoring for racial justice. and the white democrats who are with us are basically there because of their racial attitudes.\n\nezra klein\n\nbut in a world where you have to sell that beyond the democratic party, is that a bad strategy?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni wrote this book because i think it's important to talk about the benefits of moving beyond drained pool politics for all people, including white people. we have reached the economic and moral limits of the zero-sum world view that was handed to us at the founding of this nation. and i do believe that today's inequality insecurity dysfunction has as its unifying core this majority-white belief in a zero-sum racial hierarchy. and so i'm trying to make this an invitation to white americans to join in, to release this really false and illusory idea that they're so different from people of color and so much better than people of color that they don't want to be in fellowship with people of color, get a sense of patriotism about who we are as americans, all of us, and move forward together. joe biden, in his first speech on race as president, was issuing a bunch of racial equity executive orders. and he actually said, for too long, we've allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester. we've bought the world view that america is a zero-sum game in many cases. if you succeed, i fail. if you get ahead, i fall behind. if you get the job, i lose mine. maybe worst of all, if i hold you down, i lift myself up. but racism is corrosive, it's destructive, and it's costly. it costs every american, not just those who have felt the sting of racial injustice. so that, for me, was a big win. the idea that this man who — in many ways, joe biden is an avatar of the white moderate who's had a huge journey himself on these issues, who's always wanted to have his heart in the right place. god, he even was a lifeguard in a black pool. it doesn't get any more apt than this. he followed the white moralizing logic into the crime bill of the 1990s. he was opposed to busing for school integration. and yet, then he became barack obama's best friend, and also, i think, did what good politicians do, which is read the moment and recognize that his constant moral compass now demanded something much bolder in terms of confronting the persistence of racial inequality and systemic racism. and yet, because he's still got his finger on the pulse of the scranton white american politics, he needed to call out the scapegoating. he needed to say, hey, i'm nostalgic for that time too, when a white guy could go into a factory and come out with being set for life. but it wasn't the black folks and the immigrants who took that factory job away. and in fact, this divided politics is propping up a party and an economic worldview that is stripping opportunity from your family and your neighborhoods and your communities. i was really proud, obviously, as you can imagine, to see that moment happen, and to see him try to speak to white americans to say that it doesn't have to be a zero-sum game.\n\nezra klein\n\none thing that touches on is that i think in politics for a long time, it's been believed there are two ways of approaching this. one is to deal directly with racism and the fact that you're trying to close racial economic divides, and the other is to ignore it, to pretend you don't know anything about racial economic divides, and you've just got this economic policy. but you've been involved with ian haney lópez in some research that has this other idea, which is to say that in fact, the human mind does have a us-versus-them tendency. it is a powerful thing to harness in politics. this is how i read it. i don't think this is how ian or you would frame it. and that the most powerful messaging is to say that there are powerful economic interests that are using racial division to enrich themselves and keep everyone else down. and so there's actually a different synthesis here that is more effective, but it's not one that ignores division. it is one that recasts division. i'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthat's exactly right. this idea that racism has a cost for everyone animated a massive public opinion and political messaging project that ian haney lópez, who was my law professor at berkeley, and anat shenker-osorio, who's a linguist and political message strategist, led to try to square the circle of the divide in progressive messaging. so you have the race left, which is talking about racial disparities and racial injustice, and which definitely galvanizes many people of color, though not all, and many white people who've made it part of their identity to be anti-racist, and then you have the class left that often says, you know what, that's divisive. let's talk about economic populism, and let's talk about the plutocrats and the 99 percent. there's no difference among the 99 percent. it's the 1 percent versus everybody else. and what we found was that given how overwhelmingly powerful the megaphone is for the zero-sum scapegoating story, it wasn't effective even with persuadable, slightly progressive voters, to ignore that zero-sum story and just say, hey, no, it's about the 1 percent and the 99 percent. ignore those divides. ignore the stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in your brain about immigrants and poor black people. ignore what donald trump is saying and what fox news is saying and what your neighbor is saying. you have to actually give people a new way to think about that dominant narrative, because it's not like they can ignore the dominant narrative. they need to recast the dominant narrative as a tool of the plutocrats, as a tool that stops us from joining together across lines of race to do what we can only do together and what we can't do alone — things like adequately fund our infrastructure and our schools, things like tackle climate change, things like rewrite our trade laws to make sure that every american who wants one has a decent job. and it's really important to not ignore just how profoundly racialized the story of the american economy and government is and has been for all of our history. so if you try to bring colorblind tools to convince people about their economic self-interest while ignoring just how profoundly racialized the economic story is, you just won't succeed. [music playing]\n\nezra klein\n\ni spent a lot of time grappling while thinking about the book with the way in which policies that begin with racist roots get out of control. they slip their reins, and they become broadly applied, hurting a lot of people of all different races, and also in a funny way, non-racist in their modern intent, but still terrible. so you have a discussion in the book of single-family zoning. and single-family zoning is a policy with extraordinarily racist roots, and particularly so in california, where i live. and in san francisco, where i live, single-family zoning has made it unbelievably unaffordable for basically anybody to live here — black people, brown people, but also white people. i know tons of white people who have had to leave or have not been able to raise a family here because of single-family zoning. and one of the stories about this that began to take shape in my head is that there's obviously the case of policies that are directly racialized even now, like medicaid, that the racialization of them ends up draining the pool. a lot of white people benefit from medicaid, but they're voting against it on race grounds. but then there's something like single-family vote zoning where i was talking to somebody doing survey research on this, and they were saying that in fact, single-family zoning is popular among everybody when you ask about it, voters of all races, but it's making things unaffordable for everybody. you built zoning policy on the zero-sum racial idea, and now you have zero-sum zoning policy which only works to the advantage, if it works to anybody's advantage, of either the rich or the people who already live there, the incumbents. and that as a way of thinking about policy generally, that strikes me as very powerful that if you are engaged in zero-sum policy construction or zero-sum policy framing, that no matter whether or not you think now that you've cut the division well, you have no idea, eventually, which side of that you are going to be caught on — that zero-sum logic — it grows.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah, that's actually a really good way of thinking about it. i totally agree that the crisis of affordable housing is a great example of racism costing everyone. and i also, in my mind, when i think about the zero-sum logic growing out of control and leaping off the rails, as you said — i think about the financial crisis. i think about a totally racialized mortgage market where, for generations, the idea that black and brown people were risky — so risky that the government drew lines around black and brown neighborhoods and said, we will not guarantee a backstop — the mortgages, as we were doing for the entire mortgage market, of any mortgages sold in these neighborhoods, because it's just too risky. never substantiated. never substantiated, this idea, but it was just a common sense that black people are going to be risky. that then was replaced very quickly by a lightly regulated mortgage market in the 1990s that, at the end of redlining, which happened in the late 1970s, you had about 10 years of fits and starts of black people emerging into the mainstream mortgage market. and then you have the advent of the subprime mortgage, which was totally justified. it was pretty zero-sum. it was like, these lenders can make double what they were making by increasing the interest rates on these loans. and it will cost handsomely the borrower. but it's ok, because what's happening is these lenders are pricing for risk. and so you had the advent of these high-cost loans. the idea was, they were supposed to be marketed and sold to people with lower credit scores. but in fact, the majority of subprime loans before the crash went to people with credit scores that would have allowed them to get prime loans. it was just, the limit was what you could get away with selling people. and this mechanism was first test it out in black neighborhoods of existing homeowners. i mean, it's the thing that i actually get the most emotional about in terms of this book and all of these ideas. it's these communities that had just been excluded out of the american dream for so long that finally got their piece of it, and then there was a knock on the door, and brokers came in and said, you could really consolidate your debt. we could get you a better interest rate. and they just lied and they cheated and they swindled — and cascading losses in black and brown neighborhoods that then once the mortgage market saw how much money was being made and how much the government was not going to stop them — and in fact, the federal government took actions only to make it easier for lenders to avoid consumer protections in the early 2000s — then the wheels were off. and then it was a open season on the wider and whiter mortgage market. and if i do anything with my book, i want people to jettison this narrative that we actually heard from mayor bloomberg — that it was the financial crisis, which cost us so much as a country and as a globe, was the fault of the victims of redlining, was the fault of black and brown people who got in over their heads, who shouldn't have been in those houses in the first place, who were financially illiterate, when in fact, what happened was just a quintessentially american mix of racism and greed that was enabled by structural racism and institutional racism and that then, of course, most direly impacted the finances of black families who have still not recovered. the home ownership rate is back to what it was before the fair housing act. it's just devastating. and yet it also costs millions of american jobs of white people and foreclosures in white neighborhoods as well.\n\nezra klein\n\none thing this book is doing is providing a different deep story of american politics and policy making — a different understanding of what's been going on under the hood in the way we think and then the outcomes that kind of thinking has. and one of your suggestions in the final chapter of the book relates very directly to how we might change that story, which is this idea of a truth, racial healing, and transformation commission. and i think about this a lot. i've talked to people who are more expert in this area than i am. and i go back and forth on it, because i always wonder, how do you make sure, given what we see, let's just say, with the insurrection on the capitol — given how hard it is to get americans to agree on any kind of truth now, how could you do something like this that would result in more healing rather than more division? but you've thought about this. so when you imagine something like that, how would it look? what makes you confident that would help?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nwell, first, it wouldn't be a blue ribbon commission in washington like the kerner commission or the clinton commission on race. it would be a ground-up effort at the community level, which i think is really important. this is not about experts picking up history books and learning what they should already know. this is about communities coming together, people who really already have a stake in the well-being of their community. i talked to folks in dallas who have created this truth, racial healing, and transformation hub which invites stakeholders from the cops to racial justice advocates, from librarians and schoolteachers to business leaders, to come together and do a few key things to rewrite the racial history of their community to create what's known as a community history. and the people who did this in dallas said 90 plus percent the people we talked to just didn't know — white, black, or brown. there's just so much we don't know. there's so, so much in so many ways, like the lost cause profoundly won in terms of our historical imagination. i was talking to someone earlier today who's from st. louis, which is the city where there was the huge fairground pool riot that i talk about in the book, where the largest public pool that we can find record of was closed after a bunch of racial riots and integration. and she had no memory of it. she wasn't able to find lots of people in her community who had memory of it. and this is a black woman. we've just erased so much of the knowledge. and so we're left to puzzle out — why is it we can't — i open the book saying, why is it we can't seem to have nice things? why are we not addressing climate change? why are we not having universal health care? why is it so hard for working families to make ends meet? why does it feel like we keep falling behind and falling apart? and so when you give people the truth — sometimes people talk about putting a racial equity lens on an issue. i think it's taking blinders off — just allow people to know the full story of our community's history, the beauty and the struggle. then you get people on the same page, and then you can turn it. i do think it needs to be the federal government to adopt this as a national effort, but it needs to be implemented at the local level. i tried for almost 20 years to give rational, economic, self-interest arguments to decision makers and to white people who are listening to me talk on meet the press and whatever, to say, what let's do something about the struggling middle class, which is a diverse middle class now. and it wasn't working. we still have this racialized politics. we still have the majority of white people voting for donald trump. and i think i became hopeful at the end of writing this book, because there is a yearning, i think, in all of us for human connection. the bullhorn that is the loudest is the zero-sum, but it's also true that the largest social movement in american history is black lives matter in 2020, that you now have millions more white people who want a way out of the moral and economic quandary that is american racism. there are these moments where the brutal ugliness of the american lie causes a groundswell and an opening and a pivot. all of this is our history. it's the struggle and the beauty at all times. and i think the more we can see these kinds of conversations where people really connect on a human level and at the local level — i hate to sound like a federalist here, but i do think it's really important for people to experience this with people they have relationships with in communities where they really have real bonds, to see what it's like to have a shared story of american struggle and american progress.\n\nezra klein\n\nis donald trump himself an apotheosis of drain the pool politics? and i mean this in two ways. one is that he follows barack obama, so there's, for the first time, an african-american president. and then white people, largely — i mean not exclusively, but overwhelmingly are the ones who make donald trump his successor. and trump is a pretty manifestly unqualified, incompetent, erratic guy. we get a lot of death and destruction as a result with coronavirus. but then at the end, when trump loses reelection, and you have the storming of the capitol, it's such a perfectly literal if we can't have this country, no one can — this political system that did pretty damn well for white people, actually. i mean, you can actually make a somewhat different argument for non-white people until much more recently, but did pretty damn well for white people. america has gotten pretty rich. and it's like, enough of it. enough. we'll pave it over. we'll fill the pool. there's a lot of policy in the book, but i actually thought there was this amazing literalization of it into politics — it must have been right while you were finishing, or probably after you had finished, actually — that you really see the power of this. because for a political party that has so wrapped itself in the flag and patriotism for so long to so literally give up — like to attack cops and storm the capitol, it becomes very hard to deny that this is the tendency, this is the reaction.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's a book about the economy, but i do include a chapter on democracy, because on the list of nice things that we can't seem to have because of racism, a functioning representative democracy is pretty high up on the list. and so i traced the history of all of the ways that, from our founding, elites attacked the bedrock of what is a pretty bold and beautiful idea, which is self governance and representative democracy, in order to keep room for racism and slavery and racial subjugation. i have an extremely long section of notes in this book that is kind of a joke with my publisher. but one of the longest notes — i think actually the longest note is what i put in the notes instead of going into long detail about colfax, louisiana, which is a story of one of the many but one of the most deadly anti-democracy racial mob violence stories in american history. i did finish the book long before january 6th, but colfax, louisiana, is in the book. and colfax, louisiana, is the story of a white mob storming the courthouse where an election result was going to be certified for a reconstruction era governor who won office with a multiracial voting population. and they attacked the courthouse. black people tried to defend the courthouse. they slaughtered 100 black neighbors, and then burned the courthouse. this white, racist mob was willing to burn down the edifice of their own government rather than submit to a multiracial democracy.\n\nezra klein\n\ni think that is a good place to come to a close. so the final section of the podcast is around book recommendations. and i want to start here. what's, in your view, the best novel or movie for understanding race in america?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni don't think it's been written yet. i don't think it's been shot yet, to be honest. we're just now starting to tell stories that include black people as more than supporting characters or immigrants as villains. but i grew up as a sci-fi and fantasy nerd, and so parable of the sower continues to be just profoundly prescient and a beautiful must-read for everyone.\n\nezra klein\n\nwhat's the one book you would give joe biden to read if he asked for a recommendation?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni would love for joe biden to read a book called the color of law richard rothstein, which really helps explain the way that government segregated america. he's got a big commitment to racial equity at the center of his administration, and he's got to see all the different ways that it's government policy — many of those policies that are still on the books — that are segregating us and keeping us apart.\n\nezra klein\n\none of my favorite heather mcghee facts is that you really wanted to be a television writer. so what's your favorite tv series?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni wanted to be a tv writer when i was growing up, because i wanted to be the black norman lear. i felt that television had this amazing power to tell americans who other americans were, and therefore cohere a national story of our relative goodness or merit. and so norman lear — i mean, he did sanford and son, he did good times, the jeffersons, all in the family, maude — all of these real, working, middle-class, totemic reflections of who we were and who we were becoming that really grappled with the issues of the day. i don't know. i don't that we've done much better than that in terms of tv shows that people are actually really watching.\n\nezra klein\n\nbut so what is one of those you'd recommend if people don't know their history?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni think good times is amazing.\n\nezra klein\n\nthat's a good recommendation. and finally, you and i both have two-year-olds. what's your favorite children's book or your favorite book to read to your child?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso we are really into the word collector these days. do you know this book?\n\nezra klein\n\ni have not. no. i've heard of it, but i have not read.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's about a boy named jerome — it's a little black boy — who collects words. some people collect stamps and coins and rocks. jerome collects words. and my son collects words. he pauses on words he's never heard. he ruminates on them, and then he loves to throw them back out at us. and it's a really beautiful story of a little black boy who collects words that he hears and comes across. and then at the end — hate to give away the ending — it's only like 10 pages long — he spills all of his bag of words off a mountaintop to give them to other children. and he has no words to describe how happy that makes them.\n\nezra klein\n\noh, i love that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's so nice.\n\nezra klein\n\nthat's wonderful. the reason i now ask that one in every episode, because i've just decided children's books are both nicer and more affecting somehow. they tuck a lot of emotion into a contained space.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah, they're all we need, really. let's write a children's book, ezra. what's your favorite these days?\n\nezra klein\n\nooh, i have a couple that i love. but i've become — the two that i love most are — there's an illustrated book around the song what a wonderful world — the one sung by louis armstrong. and it is — it'll bring tears to your eyes. it is beautiful. i don't remember the illustrator offhand, but i just love it. i sing it to my son every night. and then i really love a book called the quiet book. it's a book about how there are many kinds of quiet, but it's very true in a strange way about all these different moments and different kinds of quiet. and it's a little bit unusual for a kids book in — maybe it's not that unusual, but it has a lot of somewhat sad and intense forms of quiet, like others telling secrets quiet or last one picked up from school quiet. and also happy ones, like tucking in teddy quiet. and i just find it very affecting. i really like the quiet book. and your book, of course, is the sum of us, and everybody, including joe biden should read it. it's really fantastic. congratulations on writing it and publishing it. thank you very much.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthank you very much, ezra.

every state is required to provide medicaid coverage to certain groups: poor children and pregnant women, people with disabilities, and poor older people requiring long-term care. but the obamacare expansion provides coverage for many poor parents and childless adults who were less often covered in the program. the health law provides federal funding for states to include all residents who earn below or just above the federal poverty line — the limit is about $16,000 for a single person.\n\nin the first three years of the expansion, the federal government paid 100 percent of the tab. but now states need to chip in a small share to cover the expansion population's medical bills. that share, 5 percent this year, is set to rise to 10 percent in 2020.\n\nsome state governments and local think tanks have prepared estimates of the costs and benefits of medicaid expansion in their region. but the avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand. some of the numbers are big. florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to avalere; north carolina $13 billion.\n\nthe medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention. strong evidence suggests states' expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals. studies also show that medicaid coverage has helped low-income americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health.
washington — neera tanden, president biden's nominee to head the office of management and budget, suffered a significant setback on monday as two moderate republicans said they would not support her nomination, potentially dooming her chances for confirmation.\n\nthe statements of opposition from senators susan collins of maine and mitt romney of utah, two republicans with a professed willingness to work with the biden administration, further winnowed ms. tanden's chances in an evenly divided senate. three senators in four days have announced plans to vote against her, after senator joe manchin iii, democrat of west virginia, became the first to publicly oppose her confirmation.\n\na white house official said on monday that the administration continued to stand behind ms. tanden's nomination, but her path to confirmation was increasingly narrow. her failure to win confirmation would be the first casualty for mr. biden, who has so far been able to win senate support for several other cabinet picks, though many nominees have yet to face full senate votes.\n\nms. tanden's fate consumed the white house on monday, as continued questions about her history of attacking both republicans and progressive democrats threatened to undercut mr. biden's promise to bring a unifying tone to washington. when pressed repeatedly about whether mr. biden had any problems with ms. tanden's social media practices, jen psaki, the white house press secretary, avoided answering directly and focused on the nominee's qualifications.
1. high-stakes maneuvering on health care:\n\nsenate republicans unveiled their answer to obamacare: a 142-page bill drafted in secret that includes deep cuts to medicaid, impedes access to abortion and shifts resources from the poor to the rich.\n\nfive republican senators say they will not support the bill as it stands — meaning that mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, above, may be ready to accept a loss if he manages to push the measure to a vote this week.
of course i am concerned, said gov. brian sandoval, the republican governor of nevada, where about 300,000 people have gained medicaid coverage. i am someone who elected to expand medicaid. that's been very beneficial to my state, and i want to be sure those individuals can keep their coverage.\n\ngovernors are all in agreement, said gov. terry mcauliffe of virginia, a democrat who is the chairman of the national governors association. we do not want one single one of our citizens to lose access to quality health care. we are all unified on that. actually, we want to expand, so everybody has access to quality health care.\n\nmr. trump brushed aside opinion polls suggesting that the 2010 health law was becoming somewhat more popular. people hate it, the president said, but now they see that the end is coming and they're saying, 'oh, maybe we love it.' there's nothing to love. it's a disaster, folks.\n\nbecause of the intricate procedures that govern budget legislation and the inherent complexity of health care, republicans appear unlikely to undo the health law as quickly as they had hoped. mr. trump said congress must tackle the affordable care act before it can overhaul the tax code, also a high priority for republicans. and those delays could slow work on other priorities like a trillion-dollar infrastructure push.
washington — president obama vetoed legislation friday that would have repealed the affordable care act and stripped all federal funds from planned parenthood, writing in his veto message that the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in america.\n\nmr. obama's veto — only the eighth of his presidency — was expected, and his decision to issue a simple message without holding a public ceremony indicated that he did not wish to draw attention to the showdown. republicans do not have the votes in the house or the senate to override the veto.\n\nbut it shows that nearly six years after its enactment, the health law remains one of the most divisive political issues of the obama presidency. for many americans, the health law is seen as costly, cumbersome and a government infringement on freedoms, even as it has spread health coverage to millions and ensured popular benefits like ending lifetime coverage limits and the denial of insurance for pre-existing medical conditions. this week's house vote was the 62nd to fully or partly repeal the health law but only the first that sent legislation to the president's desk.\n\nthe white house has long expected that the fierce politicking around the law would wane as millions of people got coverage and other issues took center stage. but while some republican governors have decided to take advantage of the law's provisions to expand medicaid coverage in their states, republican legislators in congress remain persuaded that the law is collapsing and are determined to help it fail. republicans also showed they could use arcane budgetary rules to circumvent a democratic filibuster and pass repeal legislation for the signature of a republican president.
washington — several republican senators on monday proposed a partial replacement for the affordable care act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose, a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former president barack obama's signature health law.\n\nbut the plan was attacked by democrats as a step back from the affordable care act's protections, and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible. if anything, the proposal — by senators bill cassidy of louisiana, a medical doctor, and susan collins of maine, a moderate republican — may show how difficult it will be for republicans to enact a replacement for the affordable care act.\n\nlegislation that can pass muster in the more conservative house may not win enough support in the senate. a bill with broad appeal in the senate may fail in the house.\n\nunder the proposal, states could stay with the affordable care act, or they could receive a similar amount of federal money, which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance. we are moving the locus of repeal to state government, mr. cassidy said. states should have the right to choose.
indeed, members of the freedom caucus — which is supported by outside conservative groups — have often claimed the mantle of pure conservatism, but their tactics have been seen by many in their party as uniformly counterproductive.\n\ntime after time, they undermined republican leaders' efforts to secure wins for the conservative cause by overreaching and demanding the impossible.\n\nthey have anointed representative mark meadows of north carolina as their leader and principal spokesman. but they occasionally get help from three senators sympathetic to their cause: ted cruz of texas, rand paul of kentucky and mike lee of utah.\n\nat critical times, house conservatives have forced their party to make deals with representative nancy pelosi of california, the democratic leader — an idea anathema to most republicans, who would seethe.\n\nthis time, by negotiating with mr. trump on the complex issue of health care, a measure whose complexity he did not seem to fully grasp, they moved an already contentious bill further and further to the right, eliminating too many benefits to keep moderate and other conservative members on board. even mr. trump was said to be taken aback by their attempts to remove things republicans have long promised to keep, like health insurance benefits for children up to 26 years old.\n\ngiven that the house and senate majorities were built on a promise to repeal and replace mr. obama's signature health care law, many lawmakers fear electoral repercussions. it is painfully ironic that members from safe, conservative congressional districts who can't ever quite seem to get to 'yes' make it harder to enact good, conservative public policy like repealing obamacare, said michael steel, a republican strategist and former aide to mr. boehner.\n\nthis seemed lost on many freedom caucus members on friday. part of the legislative process is working with people who have different ideas, said representative justin amash, republican of michigan. this process from the beginning wasn't designed to do that.
yet public opposition to the law has ticked up again in recent months, in part because the cost of coverage from the law's insurance exchanges is rising in many states for 2016. the most recent kaiser family foundation tracking poll found 46 percent of americans had an unfavorable opinion of the law, compared with 40 percent who viewed it favorably. this has left the law a weapon of choice for republicans in congress, particularly in an election year in which speaker paul a. ryan is seeking to set the policy agenda.\n\na lot of what members on my side of the aisle predicted has come to pass, said senator susan collins, republican of maine, citing increased premiums, higher deductibles and confusion among employers as to what constitutes full-time work. a lot of the issues that directly affect people's pocket books have turned out to be negative. i continue to believe, however, that our party must have a plan for replacing and fixing obamacare and not just repealing it.\n\nrepublicans concede that if they win the white house, simply repealing the law will no longer be sufficient. republicans in congress have yet to offer a comprehensive replacement for the law. instead, much of their focus, beyond the health care law, has been on attacking planned parenthood.\n\nwe were elected on a pledge to try and repeal obamacare, said representative david jolly, republican of florida. if we are unsuccessful in a veto override, i think we should turn our attention to other matters like national security. but if we get a republican in the white house, then we need to turn to solutions. the focus can't be just on repealing obamacare. it has to be, 'what is our health care plan?'\n\nrepublicans say that the health law remains potent for them in part because some of its flaws, like rising premium costs, have only begun to be revealed, even as many of its more popular provisions were quickly clear.\n\neven though the law was passed many years ago, the rollout is much more recent, and some components haven't even been implemented, said representative lee zeldin, republican of new york. for a few years the debate over obamacare was one about how it was going to impact individuals, families and businesses in the future. and when it actually started, the debate shifted and people had their own personal stories to tell.\n\ni would say constituents have been very upset with the failure of the new york co-op, he said, referring to the health republic insurance of new york.
any one of these changes individually is moderate, but stack one on top of another and you get a big boost to the affordable care act, said jonathan cohn, author of the ten year war, a new history of the health law. it doesn't change the law's structure, but it does make it much more generous.\n\nthose close to the effort say its ambitions — and its limits — reflect the preferences of those leading the way. mr. biden, who was involved in the passage and rollout of obamacare as vice president, ran on the idea of expansion, not upheaval. and leaders in congress who wrote obamacare have been watching it in the wild for a decade, slowly developing legislation to address what they see as its gaps and shortcomings. many see their work as a continuing, gradual process, in which lawmakers should make adjustments, assess their effects, and adjust again.\n\nwhen you think about where we thought the a.c.a. was headed four years ago, and contrast that to where we are right now, on the cusp of a massive expansion of affordability, it's pretty exciting, said christen linke young, deputy director of the white house domestic policy council for health and veterans affairs.\n\nbut bob kocher, an economic adviser in the obama administration who is now a partner at the venture capital firm venrock, said that beyond the current changes, mr. biden's mission on obamacare seemed more modest, more like don't break it.\n\ni don't think he has any ambition in mind beyond managing it, he said.\n\nto aid in the effort, president biden has recruited a host of former obama administration aides. his picks for top jobs at the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the office of management and budget, as well as key deputies at h.h.s., all worked on the first rounds of obamacare policymaking. many key congressional aides working on health care now also helped write the affordable care act.\n\nfrequently asked questions about the new stimulus package how big are the stimulus payments in the bill, and who is eligible? the stimulus payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. to qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. for heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. to be eligible for a payment, a person must have a social security number. read more. what would the relief bill do about health insurance? buying insurance through the government program known as cobra would temporarily become a lot cheaper. cobra, for the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. but it's expensive: under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire cobra premium from april 1 through sept. 30. a person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. and someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either. read more what would the bill change about the child and dependent care tax credit? this credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. more people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. the bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. that will be helpful to people at the lower end of the income scale, said mark luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at wolters kluwer tax & accounting. read more. what student loan changes are included in the bill? there would be a big one for people who already have debt. you wouldn't have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you've been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. this would be the case for debt forgiven between jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025. read more. what would the bill do to help people with housing? the bill would provide billions of dollars in rental and utility assistance to people who are struggling and in danger of being evicted from their homes. about $27 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance. the vast majority of it would replenish the so-called coronavirus relief fund, created by the cares act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments, according to the national low income housing coalition. that's on top of the $25 billion in assistance provided by the relief package passed in december. to receive financial assistance — which could be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses — households would have to meet several conditions. household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic. assistance could be provided for up to 18 months, according to the national low income housing coalition. lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance. read more.\n\nborn in the great recession, the affordable care act was drafted with a focus on costs. political compromises and concerns about runaway deficits kept the law's overall 10-year price tag under $1 trillion, and included enough spending cuts and tax increases to pay for it. those constraints led its architects to scale back the financial help for americans buying their own coverage. staffers who wrote the formulas said they ran hundreds of simulations to figure out how to cover the most people within their budget.\n\nthose who wrote the regulations that interpreted the law also recall drafting rules that erred on the side of spending less to avoid blowback or litigation.
at 3:30 p.m. on friday, mr. ryan called republicans into a closed-door meeting to deliver the news that the bill would be withdrawn, with no plans to try again. the meeting lasted five minutes. one of the architects of the house bill, representative greg walden, republican of oregon and the chairman of the energy and commerce committee, put it bluntly: this bill's done.\n\nwe are going to focus on other issues at this point, he said.\n\nthe republican bill would have repealed tax penalties for people without health insurance, rolled back federal insurance standards, reduced subsidies for the purchase of private insurance and set new limits on spending for medicaid, the federal-state program that covers more than 70 million low-income people. the bill would have repealed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes imposed by the affordable care act and would also have cut off federal funds to planned parenthood for one year.\n\nmr. ryan had said the bill included huge conservative wins. but it never won over conservatives who wanted a more thorough eradication of the affordable care act. nor did it have the backing of more moderate republicans who were anxiously aware of the congressional budget office's assessment that the bill would leave 24 million more americans without insurance in 2024, compared with the number who would be uninsured under the current law.\n\nthe budget office also warned that in the short run, the republicans' legislation would drive insurance premiums higher. for older americans approaching retirement, the cost of insurance could have risen sharply.\n\nwith the house's most hard-line conservatives holding fast against the bill, support for the legislation collapsed friday after more and more republicans came out in opposition. they included representatives rodney frelinghuysen of new jersey, the soft-spoken chairman of the house appropriations committee, and barbara comstock of virginia, whose suburban washington district went for the democratic presidential nominee, hillary clinton, in november.\n\nseven years after enactment of obamacare, i wanted to support legislation that made positive changes to rescue health care in america, mr. frelinghuysen said. unfortunately, the legislation before the house today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in new jersey.
when sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a political revolution, which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the senate and possibly the house.\n\nimage\n\ninteresting, but also unlikely. go talk to all the blue dog democrats who lost their seats in the wake of obamacare passage. go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure republican leadership, and therefore prevent medicaid from being expanded in their states.\n\nthere are political realities that exist in america that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.\n\nfurthermore, sanders likes to tout that he doesn't have a super pac and doesn't want one. that is a principled position. but the republican candidate will have the support of many super pacs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. they are going to beat sanders like he is a nail with the socialist label and his proposal on new taxation. middle of the spectrum middle america is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.\n\nbut instead of clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than sanders's, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about sanders's honor.\n\nthe swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-obama because he wanted obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap obamacare, simply do not connect.\n\nsanders may be a dreamer, but he's not dishonorable. trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.
it's an odd moment for liberals to mourn justice kennedy, who'll turn 82 next month, and for conservatives to relish his departure. he did nothing important for liberals this term, failing to provide even one crucial fifth vote to swing the outcome of a case in their direction.\n\nafter he had appeared to invite a challenge to partisan gerrymandering way back in 2004, a case finally arrived in the just-concluded term, with the social science measures of partisanship he had asked for. but justice kennedy ducked without even writing to explain why as the court decided the case on narrow technical grounds. and though his principal left-leaning legacy is his expansion of gay rights, especially marriage equality, he settled for another narrow resolution this month, writing the majority opinion that favored the religious objections of a colorado baker over a gay couple's right to be treated like anyone else when they walk into a store and order a wedding cake.\n\njustice kennedy also voted with his conservative allies this week to dilute the power of minority voters in texas. he helped to expand the reach of private, case-by-case arbitration, making it more difficult for employees to band together to confront their employers about wage theft and other problems. on wednesday, hours before announcing his retirement, he helped diminish the influence of unions. and let's not forget justice kennedy's vote in bush v. gore and his opinion in citizens united, with its blindness to the reality of how money corrupts our political process.\n\nand yet, the difference between a court with justice kennedy and one with a trump-chosen replacement for him is likely to be the difference between incremental and drastic change in crucial areas of law, between baby steps and giant ones.\n\nthe path of reasoning the court takes from case to case often matters as much as the outcomes. some justices with a vision (and a majority behind them) are more patient than others. justice kennedy was of the slow-cook variety. before his majority opinion in obergefell v. hodges, justice kennedy's gift of same-sex marriage to the country, there were his majority opinions in united states v. windsor, which granted some rights to gay couples, and lawrence v. texas, which struck down the sodomy laws that targeted them.
el problema es que para trump las normas no significan nada. desde un principio dejó muy claro que quería erradicar cualquier rastro de la presencia de obama en el ala oeste. tenía el peor gusto, le dijo trump a un visitante a principios de 2017 mientras presumía sus nuevas cortinas (que no eran muy distintas de las de obama, en opinión de otras personas que entraron al despacho durante ese periodo caótico).\n\nesos esfuerzos por hacerlo desaparecer fueron más enfáticos en lo referente a las políticas. un exfuncionario de la casa blanca comentó que trump interrumpió una presentación para verificar que una propuesta del personal no fuera una cosa de obama.\n\ndurante la transición, en lo que en retrospectiva parece un anticipo de la presidencia, a un colaborador de trump se le ocurrió imprimir una lista detallada de las promesas de campaña de obama del sitio web oficial de la casa blanca y utilizarla como una especie de lista de objetivos a abatir, según dos personas con conocimiento de la medida.\n\nes algo personal para trump; todo se trata del presidente obama y de acabar con su legado. es su obsesión, explicó omarosa manigault newman, veterana del programa apprentice y, hasta su abrupta salida, una de las contadas funcionarias negras en el ala oeste de trump. el presidente obama no podrá descansar mientras trump respire.\n\ncuando los dos hombres se encontraron en noviembre de 2016 para una forzada reunión posterior a la elección, el presidente electo fue cortés, por lo que obama aprovechó la oportunidad para aconsejarle no desmantelar obamacare. mira, puedes quitarle mi nombre; no me importa, le dijo, según los asesores.\n\ntrump asintió sin comprometerse.\n\ncuando la transición comenzó a hacerse eterna, obama experimentó una creciente inquietud ante una actitud que le parecía la alegre indiferencia del nuevo presidente y su equipo de novatos. muchos de ellos ignoraron por completo los documentos de información que el personal de obama había preparado con tanto empeño, recuerdan sus antiguos colaboradores, y en lugar de centrarse en la política o en el funcionamiento del ala oeste, preguntaron por la calidad de los tacos en el comedor del sótano o dónde encontrar un buen apartamento.\n\nen cuanto a trump, no tiene ni la menor idea de qué está haciendo, obama le dijo a un asistente después de su encuentro en el despacho oval.
affluent young people might end up saving some money as a result of these changes. but the effect on those who are older and less affluent would be devastating. aarp has done the math: a 55-year-old making $25,000 a year would end up paying $3,600 a year more for coverage; that rises to $8,400 for a 64-year-old making $15,000 a year. and that's before the death spiral.\n\nfor the combination of price hikes and weakened penalties would lead many healthy americans to forgo insurance. this would worsen the risk pool, causing premiums to rise sharply — and remember, subsidies would no longer adjust to offset this rise. the result would be even more people dropping out. republicans have been claiming that obamacare is collapsing, which isn't true. but trumpcare, if implemented, would collapse in a mar-a-lago minute.\n\nhow could house republicans under the leadership of paul ryan, who the media keeps assuring us is a smart, serious policy wonk, have produced such a monstrosity? two reasons.\n\nfirst, the g.o.p.'s policy-making and policy analysis capacity has been downgraded to the point of worthlessness. there are real conservative policy experts, but the party doesn't want them, perhaps because their very competence makes them ideologically unreliable — a proposition illustrated by the rush to enact this bill before the nonpartisan congressional budget office can estimate either its costs or its effects. basically, facts and serious analysis are the modern right's enemies; policy is left to hacks who can't get even the simplest things right.\n\nsecond, republicans seem to have been undone by their reverse-robin-hood urges. you can't make something like obamacare work without giving lower-income families enough support that insurance becomes affordable. but the modern g.o.p. always wants to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted; so the bill ends up throwing away the taxes on the rich that help pay for subsidies, and redirects the subsidies themselves away from those who need them to those who don't.\n\ngiven the sick joke of a health plan, you might ask what happened to all those proclamations that obamacare was a terrible, no good system that republicans would immediately replace with something far better — not to mention donald trump's promises of insurance for everybody and great health care.\n\nbut the answer, of course, is that they were all lying, all along — and they still are. on this, at least, republican unity remains impressively intact.
here's a brief history of president trump's record on pre-existing health conditions.\n\ndid he pass the affordable care act?\n\nno. the president was not in washington and not in politics when the affordable care act was written, debated and passed in 2009 and 2010. the health law established consumer protections for americans who buy their insurance, including a rule that health insurers must offer coverage to anyone who wishes to buy it, with prices varying only by region and the age of the customer.\n\nbefore obamacare, some states protected people with pre-existing conditions in this way, but most did not. americans with prior illnesses like cancer, asthma, even acne, often had trouble buying insurance for themselves and their families. one state that did protect people with pre-existing conditions was new york, where the media executive and presidential candidate michael bloomberg currently resides and where mr. trump did at the time. (mr. bloomberg's recent television advertisements, which attack mr. trump's health care record, appear to have prompted the tweets.)\n\nthe affordable care act was a large and complex law, with many provisions that have proved controversial. but the protections for people with pre-existing conditions enjoy widespread public support.\n\nhas he tried to weaken pre-existing conditions protections as president?\n\nyes. president trump's first legislative priority after his election was to repeal and replace the affordable care act. republicans in congress voted on several different bills, but each of them had provisions that would have substantially eroded the current protections for americans with prior health conditions, by weakening the regulations that make such insurance available, affordable and useful.\n\nthe bills would have weakened rules that require insurance to cover a standard set of health benefits, for example, and would have established policies that would have raised prices for people with a history of health problems.
this year, the media has been focused largely on the election process — campaign managers, speaking styles, every slip and misstep. that's been entertaining, but the policy differences between the two sides are much more important, and the most crucial difference may be over economic policy.\n\ndonald j. trump has campaigned very clearly for change — a policy upheaval to promote faster growth, repair the economic stagnation and end the corrupt pay-to-play system that favors the well heeled. hillary clinton has pledged to extend and build on the policies of the obama administration.\n\nthere is no doubt who has the better plan. our economy is growing at only 1.1 percent per year, a fraction of our average rate, and the congressional budget office forecasts just 2 percent annual growth (in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product) for the next 10 years.\n\nyes, we went through a deep recession, but it ended in 2009. the recovery has been the weakest in decades, and the first that has actually pushed median incomes down. business investment and profits are lower now than a year ago. counterproductive federal policies squash small businesses with inane regulatory sprawl that affects hiring, taxes, credit and medical care.
much of that was how america had always been. we changed it, many of us, through some of the proudest struggles of our history. it wasn't easy, and sometimes it wasn't pretty, but we did it, together. we won voting rights for all. we ended jim crow, and we pushed open the golden door again to welcome immigrants. we achieved full rights for women, and fought to let people of all genders and sexual orientations stand in the light. and if we have not yet created the america that langston hughes swore will be — the land that never has been yet — if there is still much to be done, at least we have advanced our standards of humanity, hope and decency to places where many people never thought we could reach.\n\nwhat old men know, too, is that all that is gained can be lost. lost just as the liberation that the civil war and emancipation brought was squandered after reconstruction, by a white america grown morally weary, or bent on revenge. lost as the gains of our labor unions have been for decades now, pushed back until so many of us stand alone in the workplace, before unfettered corporate power. lost as the vote is being lost by legislative chicanery. lost as so many powerful interests would have us lose the benefits of the social welfare state, privatize social security, and annihilate obamacare altogether.\n\nif he wins this tuesday, donald j. trump would be, at 70, the oldest president ever elected. but there is much about mr. trump that is always young, and not in a good way. there is something permanently feckless and immature in the man. it can be seen in how he mangles virtually the same words that langston hughes used.\n\nwhen hughes writes, in the first two lines of his poem, let america be america again/ let it be the dream it used to be, he acknowledges that america is primarily a dream, a hope, an aspiration, that may never be fully attainable, but that spurs us to be better, to be larger. he follows this with the repeated counterpoint, america never was america to me, and through the rest of this remarkable poem he alternates between the oppressed and the wronged of america, and the great dreams that they have for their country, that can never be extinguished.\n\nmr. trump, who is not a poet, either in his late-night tweets or on the speaker's stump, sees american greatness as some heavy, dead thing that we must reacquire. like a bar of gold, perhaps, or a bank vault, or one of the lifeless, anonymous buildings he loves to put up. it is a simplistic notion, reducing all the complexity of the american experience to a vague greatness, and his prescription for the future is just as undefined, a promise that we will return to winning without ever spelling out what we will win — save for the exclusion of others, the reduction of women to sexual tally points, the re-closeting of so many of us.
die-hard opponents of the 2010 health reform law, the affordable care act, have often used its real and imagined problems to argue that it is fatally flawed. now they are seizing on an announcement by aetna that it will reduce its participation in the health insurance marketplaces set up by the law. donald trump's campaign called aetna's move the latest blow to this broken law that is slowly imploding under its regulatory red tape.\n\nthis is hyperbole. the law has survived many setbacks, and it will overcome aetna's decision, too.\n\nthe law set up federal and state-run marketplaces where people who don't have health insurance through their employers or government programs like medicare can buy coverage. despite initial problems with healthcare.gov, the federal program's website, and some state sites, the marketplaces have helped many americans become insured. about 11 million people have bought policies, and the government provides tax credits to 85 percent of them to make the coverage affordable.\n\nbut some big national insurers like unitedhealth, humana and now aetna say they are losing too much money on marketplace policies. the reason is that the customers they signed up used more medical services than the insurers had anticipated. on monday, aetna said it would reduce the number of counties where it sells such policies to 242, from 778, citing a $200 million pretax loss on those policies in the second quarter. the company had sold marketplace policies to about 911,000 customers as of april.\n\naetna's decision will cause problems in some places. for example, pinal county in arizona might have no insurer selling marketplace policies for 2017 unless another company steps in to replace aetna. but competition is more robust elsewhere. a kaiser family foundation report published in july said that in 16 states and the district of columbia, there would be an average of 5.8 insurers selling policies for 2017. that number was down from 6.5 in 2016 but about the same as in 2014.
campaigning recently at a recreation center in murray county — a rural, mainly white bastion of republicanism on the tennessee border — she stood before tv news cameras, reminding people of her work helping to pass a bipartisan billion-dollar transportation bill, and her support of legislation that supports grandparents and other family members raising children.\n\ni know how to work across the aisle when we need to, she said.\n\nms. abrams, 44, who favors the expansion of medicaid under obamacare and the extension of state scholarships to the immigrants known as dreamers, has given republicans many opportunities to argue that she is too far left for a state like georgia. senator david perdue recently called her the most radical liberal.\n\nsupporters like gerald griggs, a vice president of the state n.a.a.c.p. chapter, reject such descriptions as inaccurate — and also hear in them a coded effort to scare off white voters.\n\ndefinitely, it's a dog whistle embedded, he said.\n\n[democrats see opportunity for gains at the state level.]\n\nms. abrams was elected to the general assembly in 2006, two years after republicans had taken control of the georgia house for the first time in more than a century. she was young, but not green. she had served as student president at spelman college, atlanta's storied african-american women's college, and kept her life ambitions, eventually including the goal of becoming president, listed in a spreadsheet. the sheer boldness of my ambitions gnawed at me, she recalled in her 2018 autobiography, minority leader: how to lead from the outside and make real change.\n\nstyle-wise, she was more of a listener than a glad-hander, more policy wonk than enforcer. she was a careful, prepared speaker with a bookish quality, a wry sense of humor and a tendency toward efficiency.\n\nshe engendered a sense of loyalty in a lot of people that way, said brian thomas, who was a member of the house democratic leadership at the time. a lot of people just respected the fact that she was just a lot smarter than some of us, and able to use that intellect in ways that were really effective.
i want to point out one theme that keeps popping up in altman's piece — and existed long before obamcare: a lot of americans are deeply frustrated by the logistical headaches built into our health care system.\n\nas altman writes: they were especially upset by surprise bills for services they believed were covered. they said their coverage was hopelessly complex. if they had their way, altman says, their insurance would become much more understandable.\n\ni share their frustration, and i imagine most of you do, too. just this week, a member of my family endured the kafkaesque experience of being told that she needed to show up for an appointment even if she were no longer sick or face a penalty, thanks to insurance rules.\n\nstrikingly, some of the trump voters told kaiser that they resented lower-income people who were enrolled in medicaid, which they viewed as a better deal. medicaid has its own complexities (and its own problems), but government-run programs do tend to be simpler than private ones. it's true of medicare, and it's true of single-payer systems in other countries.\n\nobamacare looks the way it does because its designers wanted to cause the least possible disruption to the status quo while providing insurance to many more people. by that measure — and others, as a new times editorial notes — the law has been a big success.
the answer is, laugh in their faces. the g.o.p. recently rammed through a tax cut, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy, that will probably cost $2 trillion over the next decade — with no offsetting savings. enhanced health care could easily be paid for by rescinding just part of this big giveaway. if republicans won't do that, it's not democrats' problem.\n\nand if this proposal's advocates are willing to be relaxed about funding, as they should be, the plan is basically ready to go. if democrats take the senate and the white house next year, they could enact the plan, easing the burdens of millions of americans, almost immediately.\n\nwhat about progressive hopes for a more fundamental health care overhaul? representative alexandria ocasio-cortez got it exactly right: while still calling for hearings on medicare for all, she declared herself happy to support any provision that strengthens the a.c.a. and plugs some of the gaps that we're seeing. (so far, bernie sanders has refused to support the plan. let's hope he walks that back.)\n\nso democrats have a realistic plan to expand health care, while republicans are still pursuing their jihad against obamacare. the question is why.\n\nwe have, after all, gone well beyond the point where trying to kill the a.c.a. was a smart if cynical political strategy. the act has become increasingly popular since trump took office. health care was central to the 2018 midterms, and 75 percent of voters who considered it the most important issue voted democratic.\n\nso why can't the g.o.p. just cut its losses and accept that obamacare has become part of our social fabric? after all, there was a time when people like ronald reagan insisted that medicare would destroy american freedom; these days republicans pose as defenders of the program (even if they're still trying to undermine and privatize it on the sly).\n\nwell, political scientists have some interesting thoughts about the reasons the g.o.p. won't just throw in the towel on the a.c.a. but details aside, modern republicans just hate the idea of using public policy to help americans get the health care they need, even when people's inability to get insurance is a result of pre-existing medical conditions over which they have no control.
but make no mistake: the public is with biden now. the covid-19 relief package — with its direct payments to families and aid for businesses, the unemployed and local governments — is backed by nearly 70 percent of americans, according to a recent quinnipiac poll. in a nation that can't agree on a simple set of facts, this is staggering.\n\ntwo-thirds of americans supported raising the federal minimum wage before the pandemic, by august, that figure had risen to 72 percent. that level of support has only gone up since covid set in, as people realize that many of their beloved essential workers have been living on poverty-level wages.\n\nin florida, a state run by republicans, the $15 minimum hourly wage won more than 60 percent of the vote last november. let republicans in congress continue to defend a federal wage floor of $7.25. they can't. nor can they go after the popular central elements of the american rescue plan.\n\nbiden's plan to provide tax credits in the form of payments of up to $300 per month to poor families could lift 10 million children above or closer to the poverty line. people who have long argued that the best way to help the poor is simply to give them money are going to have their moment.\n\nbig majorities also support rejoining the paris climate agreement, offering a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and expanding obamacare with a public option. one month in, biden's presidency gets the approval of well over 50 percent of americans, something trump never had in the aggregate of polls in his four years.\n\nwhat could doom democrats is fellow democrats. seattle was a laudable pioneer in raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. but now its city council is never far from a bad idea. a recent proposal would make it the first city in the nation to appear to incentivize misdemeanor crime. assaults, trespass, stalking — all could be excused if their offense is linked to poverty or a behavioral health disorder.\n\nand then there's the san francisco school board, which can't find a way to put children back at their desks but plans to wipe out a third of the city's school names, including one named for abraham lincoln, because of character flaws of the honorees.
it is not clear whether the administration will establish a special enrollment period for the 32 states with markets it manages. (there are also six state-run exchanges that use the federal platform, and those states can't proceed without federal sign-off.) the administration continues to argue in court for the law's invalidation. in a press briefing on sunday, president trump reiterated that he would like to eliminate obamacare altogether and replace it with an unspecified program he prefers.\n\nwhat we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care, he said, in response to a question about the lawsuit.\n\nthere are also an estimated 17 million people already uninsured but eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent study from the kaiser family foundation. that study found that more than a quarter of those people were eligible for a bronze plan that would cost them nothing in premiums after federal subsidies were applied (they would still have a high deductible). a broad special enrollment period could protect that group from big bills, too, if they contract the disease known as covid-19.\n\nif open enrollment were more broad, and there were fewer barriers, that could make it easier for people to sign up, said cynthia cox, a vice president at kaiser and a co-author of the study.\n\npeople in so-called short-term, limited-duration health plans — those offering skimpier coverage that doesn't meet all the requirements of an a.c.a. plan — could also sign up. although the administration has encouraged the availability of alternatives, many may now want more comprehensive coverage.\n\nwashington state, which has been enrolling people since march 10, has had 2,973 residents indicate they plan to sign up as of last thursday. about 500 have actually done so. in new york, during the first four days of the enrollment period, 150 people signed up, according to state officials.\n\nin rhode island, which has had open enrollment since march 14, we've had a really strong response, ms. lang said. as of friday, 233 people had enrolled, with a further 150 or so in the process of doing so.
health care is consistently near the top of the list of issues voters care about. while republicans and president trump tend to have an edge on the economy, democrats won the house in 2018 in large part by emphasizing health care — a playbook they intend to revive in 2020. the pandemic has also put republicans at risk of losing the senate, said jessica taylor, who analyzes senate races for the nonpartisan cook political report.\n\nthere are a lot of factors that have put the senate into play, but the pandemic and how it has affected health care and the economy is a major one that have made these races competitive, ms. taylor said.\n\ndemocrats need to win three senate seats to take the majority if they also win the white house, four if they do not. although cook political deems one democratic incumbent, senator doug jones of alabama, an underdog in his race, it also rates senate races in five states — north carolina, maine, colorado, arizona and montana — as tossups. all have republican incumbents.\n\nin montana, gov. steve bullock, a democrat, jumped into the race to defeat the republican incumbent, senator steve daines, in march, just as the pandemic was exploding. three days later, a liberal group, protect our care, announced a $250,000 ad campaign attacking mr. daines as dead set on taking away montanans' health care after voting five times to repeal the health law. cook political moved the race to its tossup column last week.\n\nthe public has been deeply divided over the affordable care act since it became law in march 2010, according to surveys by the kaiser family foundation. but with people now worried that infection with covid-19 will become a pre-existing condition, democrats say the health law — which requires insurers to cover such conditions — is becoming more attractive to voters.
these reflections on the court's instinct for self-preservation lead me to a final question: what to do about the census case? as the world knows, the deeply contested question of the validity of the trump administration's plan to ask about citizenship has become even more fraught with revelations from the computer files of a recently deceased republican redistricting specialist, thomas hofeller. the documents appear to validate the conclusion reached by federal district judge jesse furman, whose ruling against the trump administration is before the justices, that the administration's purported good-government reason for adding the citizenship question was a pretext. the real reason, the documents indicate, was to provide a statistical basis for entrenching republican power by disregarding noncitizens in the population counts for future redistricting.\n\nthe court heard argument in the case in april, a month before the new information surfaced in an unrelated redistricting case. judge furman, responding to a request by one set of plaintiffs to reopen the census case for further discovery, said that with the case now before the supreme court, he lacked authority to do so. those plaintiffs, represented by the american civil liberties union, have now asked the justices for a limited remand that would send the case back to the district court to allow exploration of where the truth lies.\n\neven if the justices were so inclined, the request presents obvious logistical difficulties, with the clock ticking toward the date when the census forms have to be in final shape for distribution. it was that deadline that led the court to grant the administration's request to hear the appeal directly from the district court without waiting for a decision from the court of appeals.\n\nbut there is another option, suggested by the plaintiffs in a final footnote to their latest brief: just dismiss the appeal. the procedure is known as a dig: dismissed as improvidently granted. the justices use it once or twice a term, usually when a case turns out, on further reflection, not to be what they thought it was when they granted it. in fact, the court used a dig on april 23 to dismiss a securities case, emulex corp. v. varjabedian, that had been argued a week earlier.\n\nthe court deployed a dig on the last day of the term in june 2012 to dismiss a case, first american financial corp. v. edwards, that had been argued a full five months earlier. that case presented a question with important implications for the separation of powers: whether congress can enact a law that confers standing — the right to sue — on people who, while they can point to a legal violation, did not suffer a concrete injury traceable to the violation. circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that after the case was argued on nov. 28, 2011, the assignment to write the majority opinion went to justice clarence thomas.\n\nfor reasons never revealed, justice thomas apparently failed to keep the four colleagues he needed on board with his analysis of the case, and a decision was never published. did he overreach and scare the others away by trying to make too big a statement about the relationship between congress and the judiciary? did the court, tormented that term by the first obamacare case, just throw up its hands? the fate of first american financial is one of the little mysteries i'd like to see solved one of these years.\n\nfor the time being, it's a reminder that the court knows how to get itself out of a tight spot when it needs to. a dig requires no explanation. its effect is to wipe the supreme court slate clean, as if the appeal had never even reached the court. a dig here would leave judge furman's opinion in place and would enable the professionals in the census bureau, who strongly objected to adding the citizenship question, free to go about their business counting us — all of us. if i'm right about these recent signals that the court knows how to save itself, now is the time.\n\nthe times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. we'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. here are some tips. and here's our email: letters@nytimes.com.\n\nfollow the new york times opinion section on facebook, twitter (@nytopinion) and instagram.
the number of americans without health insurance did rise during the trump presidency, because of his attempts to diminish the law. his administration did little to advertise obamacare policies and weakened some of its provisions, like protections for people with certain medical conditions. but this increase in the number of uninsured reversed only a small portion of the decline caused by obamacare.\n\neven after trump, an additional 20 million or so americans have health insurance today largely because of obamacare. others have better benefits — like maternity care and addiction treatment — or face lower costs.\n\nwhat biden did yesterday\n\nbiden's orders still matter, because trump's actions mattered.\n\nbiden will try to strengthen protections for people with medical conditions. he will also create a new three-month sign-up period for obamacare, starting next month, aimed partly at people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. the most recent sign-up period was in the fall.\n\nperhaps most significant, the biden administration plans to promote the sign-up period heavily, through advertisements, email and other outreach, according to my colleague margot sanger-katz, who's been covering obamacare for most of its existence. biden's people think the trump people bungled the regular enrollment period, margot told me.\n\nby the end of trump's presidency, the uninsured rate probably rose close to 10 percent, from 8.6 percent in the obama administration's final year. through executive action, biden may be able to reduce it to about 8 percent over the next four years, according to my reporting.
democrats, eyeing potential turmoil in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, have little political reason to cooperate. one thing is clear, said the house democratic whip, representative steny hoyer of maryland. house republicans are going to have to find the votes on their own to dismantle the protections incorporated in the affordable care act that the american people now have.\n\na growing chorus of republican policy experts and senators are pleading to slow the process down or risk a political blood bath.\n\nbut republican leaders and mr. trump appear to be laying the groundwork for blaming the law they are annulling for the fallout likely to come in the repeal's wake.\n\nmr. trump asserted on friday that 2017 would be a disaster for the health law. that's the year it was meant to explode, because obama won't be here, he said, adding that as bad as it is now, it'll get even worse. on saturday, he took to twitter: obamacare is imploding and will only get worse. republicans coming together to get job done! and vice president mike pence traveled to louisville, ky., on saturday to assure residents that the obamacare nightmare is about to end.\n\nwhat is clear is that 2018 — a year that republicans say will be messy — will loom large for them as they move toward a vote on the measure. but republicans say that gives them nearly a year of time, since people will experience few changes with their health care in 2017.\n\nunder the proposed house legislation, individuals would no longer be subject to a penalty if they go without health insurance, a politically popular change that would be retroactive to 2016. but they would still enjoy the protections of the affordable care act: insurers would have to offer a suite of essential health benefits, could not deny them coverage because of pre-existing conditions and could not impose annual or lifetime caps on coverage.\n\ninsurers would be free to raise their premiums to meet these requirements, but because current policies are locked in for the year, voters would not see the effects until 2018. if young, healthy americans flee the market, freed from the mandate, premiums could soar next year.
medicare for all isn't a new idea. it may be defined, basically, as universal health insurance under a single government-run, taxpayer-financed plan. it would certainly alter, and probably limit, the role of private health insurance companies like unitedhealth. senator bernie sanders of vermont has supported the idea for years. but it wasn't much of an issue for investors because it never went anywhere in congress.\n\nnow, however, mr. sanders is the front-runner among the announced aspirants for the democratic presidential nomination. what's more, he appears to have moved the entire political conversation into territory that is exceedingly uncomfortable for health care companies.\n\nwhen he introduced a new version of his medicare for all legislation in the senate on april 10, the stock market noticed that his co-sponsors included at least four senate democrats who are also running for president: kirstin gillibrand of new york, cory booker of new jersey, elizabeth warren of massachusetts and kamala harris of california.\n\nit's far too early to divine whether medicare for all — particularly a version that bans or severely limits private insurance — has even a modest chance of coming into existence after the 2020 election. even now, amid all the hoopla, the odds may not be propitious.\n\nthe current democratic leaders in congress — senator chuck schumer of new york, the minority leader, and nancy pelosi of california, the house speaker — have not supported it. president trump and republican leaders in congress have been demanding a smaller government role in health care, not a larger one. and the giant health care companies, which have enormous wealth and influence, are, for the most part, committed to blocking the idea.
you have to be seriously geeky to get excited when the internal revenue service releases a new batch of statistics. well, i'm a big geek; like quite a few other people who work on policy issues, i was eagerly awaiting the i.r.s.'s tax tables for 2013, which were released last week.\n\nand what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences.\n\nyou might think that this is obvious. but on the left, in particular, there are some people who, disappointed by the limits of what president obama has accomplished, minimize the differences between the parties. whoever the next president is, they assert — or at least, whoever it is if it's not bernie sanders — things will remain pretty much the same, with the wealthy continuing to dominate the scene. and it's true that if you were expecting mr. obama to preside over a complete transformation of america's political and economic scene, what he's actually achieved can seem like a big letdown.\n\nbut the truth is that mr. obama's election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences. which brings me to those i.r.s. tables.\n\nfor one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that mr. obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. partly this was achieved by allowing the upper end of the bush tax cuts to expire; there were also new taxes on high incomes passed along with the affordable care act, a.k.a. obamacare.
but if the trump administration allows arkansas to scale back its medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the obamacare expansion went too far. other states may be tempted to expand medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. the federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.\n\nthe arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.\n\nmr. hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the affordable care act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. but that could end up costing the federal government more money — another reason the trump administration may be slow to approve it. president trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as failing and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.\n\nregardless, mr. hutchinson said monday he was optimistic about winning approval to shrink the expansion population after meeting recently with alex azar, the new health and human services secretary.\n\nmr. hutchinson has long been under pressure from conservative republicans in the arkansas legislature who say the medicaid expansion has proved too expensive, with far more people enrolling than originally estimated.\n\narkansas is anticipating spending about $136 million in general revenue on its medicaid expansion in the coming fiscal year, with the federal government spending an additional $2 billion. the state uses federal medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor — an alternative that conservative republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. about 285,000 people are now enrolled in the medicaid expansion.\n\ncindy gillespie, the director of the arkansas department of human services, said the state was planning to activate an online portal on march 30 where those subject to the requirement will be expected to record how they're meeting it each month. in june, the state will start phasing it in, relying largely on its department of workforce services to connect job seekers with employment, education or training.
that first debate seems to have helped hillary clinton move ahead of donald trump in the polls. however, i know that many of you are asking yourselves: why is this even a question?\n\nwhy isn't she leading 3 to 1? this is not a normal race between a democrat and a republican. one of the candidates has made it clear that he has no attention span or self-control. world security experts in both parties are terrified by the idea of a trump presidency. he's screwed small contractors in his business dealings and bought dumb presents for himself with money from his charitable foundation — a charitable foundation, by the way, that appears to have been managed by a team of gerbils. also, he keeps changing his positions on critical issues and has paid settlements to people alleging he discriminated against them on the basis of race or not being attractive enough.\n\nand you know that's just the beginning.\n\nit's possible trump is just riding a swell of white-male alienation, but there's a less depressing answer for his staying power. americans have always been pretty pragmatic about the presidents they pick. mostly, they go for change or not-change.\n\ngiven all the complications out there, it's a pretty pragmatic approach. if the same president has been in office for eight years, they pick his successor from the other party. give or take a few vice presidents, it's a rule that goes back to rutherford b. hayes.
bruni: joe trippi, you mentioned something that has greatly concerned me, too: the dangers of stridency. what qualifies as too strident when it comes to democrats and the right messaging and positioning and candidates for the midterms? what are a few things you've observed recently — tactics, statements — that made you wince and think: that's too strident. that's not wise.\n\ntrippi: a partisan from either party who is in a marginal district and lashes out at the other side is likely to hurt themselves with these voters. how is this candidate not going to add to the chaos and hostility in washington? how is this candidate going to get anything done for me?\n\ndemocratic activists want someone who is going to attack and fight the republicans at every turn. that will work great in a democratic district — it may work to attract support and money and win praise from the base. but in marginal districts, particularly places that have voted republican for years (like alabama, for instance), that will squander an otherwise winnable district or state.\n\nwe can't be a one-size-fits-all party. i should point out that doug jones did not have a competitive primary, whereas the g.o.p. had exactly the ideological fight we need to avoid in marginal districts. it's the candidates we nominate in the primaries of 2018 that will determine how successful we are.\n\nbruni: governor patrick, but aren't the means really everything? single payer and medicare for all are a world apart from obamacare, and when it comes to how things play out in the political arena, republican strategists tell me they're champing at the bit to have their candidates campaign against any plan that they can brand socialized medicine.\n\npatrick: i get that, but it doesn't trouble me. for example, obamacare started out as a republican idea, conceived by a right-leaning think tank and tried out (successfully) in massachusetts. when president obama proposed and passed it in congress, it soon became clear that the only thing republicans didn't like about it was the obama part. now they want to fuss about alternatives, including medicare for all or even a medicare option in the marketplace. but they have yet to propose any idea to ensure health care for everybody. that's the revealing truth. and that's what's wrong.\n\nbruni: as a member of the (very populous) camp of americans who believe that president trump is a great danger to us and that we desperately need him to be checked by at least one chamber of congress in democratic control, i have to admit that i'm spooked by some of what i've seen recently. a washington post/abc news poll over the weekend showed that 58 percent of americans rate the economy good or excellent — that's a 17-year high. another recent poll showed that the generic-democratic versus generic-republican difference had collapsed from over 10 points to just six. tell me why i shouldn't — or should — be hugely worried.
while sanders's fellow candidates didn't parrot his vocabulary and denounce oligarchs and oligarchy, they spoke expansively about gross income inequality and the need to tackle it. that largely reflected how wealth had been concentrated over recent decades. but it owed something, too, to sanders's right and righteous demand that america have this conversation.\n\nbiden's proposed tax increases of about $3.4 trillion over a decade are more than double what clinton was advocating in 2016, while buttigieg's were more than quadruple. how is that moderate?\n\nthe scare that sanders put into clinton four years ago and the organization that he built have transformed the party, moving it even further left than the questionable electoral successes of his movement justify. although there is scant evidence in recent elections that a democrat running on sanders's platform can win anywhere but in decidedly blue districts and states, that platform colored the democratic primary in a bold and indelible way. candidates disrespected it at their peril.\n\nas the democratic race narrowed to about half a dozen plausible contenders, klobuchar asserted herself — and was frequently characterized as — a sort of common-sense centrist. but her actual positions and proposals told a different story. as my fellow times op-ed columnist david leonhardt recently wrote: she wants to raise taxes on the rich, break up monopolies, vastly expand medicare, fight climate change, admit more refugees, allow undocumented immigrants to become citizens, ban assault weapons and require universal background checks. a klobuchar administration would probably be well to the left of the obama administration. it would be closer to sanders territory.\n\nall the lead contenders are running on the most progressive agendas to ever dominate a democratic primary, wrote vox's ezra klein and roge karma late last year. they noted that this primary's moderates would have been considered leftists in the recent past. as a result, they added, if biden or buttigieg actually win the nomination, they will be running on the most progressive platform of any democratic nominee in history.\n\nbuttigieg was designated a moderate despite his support for abolishing the electoral college and expanding the supreme court, both of which would be profound changes in american politics and governance.\n\nbiden was designated a moderate despite declaring that the equality act, which would offer sweeping federal protection against discrimination for l.g.b.t.q. people, didn't merely have his support; it would be his top legislative priority. he was designated a moderate despite being among the 10 candidates at a democratic debate early on who all raised their hands when asked if they supported extending health care benefits to undocumented immigrants.
the trump administration plans to use money from the recent stimulus bills to pay hospitals for treatment of uninsured coronavirus patients. it says the plan is more efficient than reopening enrollment in the obamacare markets to achieve the same goal.\n\nthe money would be drawn from a $100 billion fund to help hospitals respond to the crisis that hospital groups expected would be spent on their more immediate financial needs.\n\npresident trump announced the policy on friday at his daily briefing. that should alleviate any concern uninsured americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment, he said.\n\nusing the hospital funds to pay for uninsured coronavirus patients could be a targeted way to pay for coronavirus care for the growing number of americans who lack health insurance. but critics say it may not go to hospitals in the states hit the hardest so far and does little to address concerns over the millions of people now without coverage for medical care unrelated to the virus.
and third, the bill lowers the value of cost-sharing subsidies for plans, so most people purchasing it would have higher out-of-pocket spending on health care than under current law, the budget office estimated.\n\nhe falsely said that people with pre-existing medical conditions will have better coverage than under obamacare.\n\nas under the current law, the senate bill states that insurers cannot refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, nor can they charge higher prices. but it allows states to apply for waivers to change essential health benefits, a set of services insurers now must provide.\n\nso someone who needs certain drugs or treatments could not be denied or charged more for insurance, but their health plan may not cover those services if the state waived the rule. as a result, people may experience substantial increases in supplemental premiums or out-of-pocket spending on health care, or would choose to forgo the services, according to the budget office.\n\nof course, it is up to states what insurers would cover, but mr. trump's claim that the plan is better than the current law for people with pre-existing conditions is unfounded.\n\nhe falsely said the bill will provide better coverage for low-income americans.\n\nthe affordable care act intended to expand medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of poverty level from the previous threshold of 44 percent, and provide tax credits for those making between 100 percent and 400 percent of poverty. but the supreme court ruled in 2012 that the federal government could not compel states to expand their programs, and 19 states declined to do so. this created a gap in which people making between 44 and 100 percent of poverty neither qualified for medicaid or subsidies in those states.\n\nthe senate bill seeks to close that gap by expanding making tax credits available to people making between 0 and 350 percent of poverty. but because the benchmark plan under the senate bill would pay only 58 percent of benefits, deductibles would increase. therefore, despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan, the budget office said.\n\nthe senate bill also reduces funding to medicaid — the health program for poor and disabled americans — by more than $800 billion over the next decade, leading to 15 million fewer enrollees by 2026 than under the current law.
if you are receiving unemployment insurance, the legislation entitles you to a special discount: regardless of your income, your premiums will look similar to that of the person earning $19,000 on our maps. and if you lost your coverage at work and want to keep it, the bill will also pay the full cost of your premiums for six months under the federal cobra program.\n\nnotes: premiums and subsidies displayed here are for individuals buying a silver plan at the second-lowest price in their market. but subsidies are calculated differently depending on family sizes. a family of four earning around $40,000 would pay the same premium as an individual earning $19,000, for example.\n\nin a handful of states, people earning $19,000 won't qualify for new subsidies because they already qualify for other low-cost state insurance programs — medicaid in alaska, hawaii and the district of columbia; and the basic health plan in minnesota and new york (the basic health plan is medicaid-like coverage with low premiums for a sliver of low-income americans in certain states).\n\nif you want to calculate the premium you would pay for your income, household size and location, this online tool may be helpful.\n\nhere are answers to other frequently asked questions about the stimulus package.
[read more on the history raphael warnock is chasing.]\n\natlanta — ebenezer baptist church bills itself as america's freedom church, a reflection of its lofty stature as the house of worship where the rev. dr. martin luther king jr. once preached. over the decades, the 6,000-member congregation just east of downtown atlanta has become a favored stop for national politicians seeking to make their case to the african-american community and pay homage to the slain civil rights icon.\n\nbut this week, ebenezer transformed from political venue to political launching pad when its senior pastor, the rev. dr. raphael g. warnock, a democrat, entered the race for the united states senate seat recently vacated by johnny isakson, a republican who cited ailing health as his reason for resigning with three years left in his term. the move is likely to alter the way the powerful king legacy resonates in the state, particularly because dr. king declined to run for public office, preferring to effect change through direct social action.\n\nin a phone interview on thursday afternoon, dr. warnock, 50, said he respected that position, but noted that he had also spent a number of years before coming to ebenezer as a pastor at new york city's abyssinian baptist church. it was there that another of dr. warnock's civil rights heroes, the rev. adam clayton powell jr., once preached, and mr. powell had no reservations about entering the political fray, serving in congress from 1945 to 1971.\n\nyes, it is, for some people, an extraordinary step for a clergyperson to operate beyond the pulpit and enter the rough-and-tumble of politics, dr. warnock said. i am aware of the risk. but i am embracing it because i think the times demand it.
the american health care act, which narrowly won passage in the house on thursday, could transform the nation's health insurance system and create a new slate of winners and losers.\n\nwhile the senate will probably demand changes, this bill, if it becomes law in its current form, will repeal and replace large portions of the affordable care act (obamacare). it will change the rules and subsidies for people who buy their own insurance coverage, and make major cuts to the medicaid program, which funds care for the poor and disabled.\n\nany sizable change in our complex health care system leaves some people and businesses better or worse off. for some, insurance will become more affordable — or their taxes will be lower. others will lose out on financial support or health care coverage. you can see how you might be affected in our summary of winners and losers.\n\nwinners\n\nhigh-income earners: the bill eliminates two taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000: a 0.9 percent increase on the medicare payroll tax, and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income. it also allows people to save more money in tax-excluded health savings accounts, a change most useful to people with enough money to have savings.
president trump gave a bravura performance on tuesday night. among presidential speeches, the state of the union address comes closest to the long, disjointed, episodic form of the campaign rally — the form of oratory at which he excels. so even though virtually every word of the speech is scripted, it has the shout-outs, the self-applause, the knowing smiles and mugs that this president enjoys and that allow him to engage the congressional and the television audience over a long evening.\n\nhe became almost as much a conductor as a speaker, expertly cuing the soloists, as it were, a dozen or so times during the speech — surely the largest number of hero-witnesses crammed into one of these events since ronald reagan had the dubious idea of turning the state of the union into a report card on the state of the people.\n\nthe rhetorical flourishes in last night's address owed much to reagan: not merely the heroes and volunteers, but above all the business and personal tax cuts, the largest in a generation, and with them the whirring and turning of economic gears, lifting citizens (in a nice phrase) from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\n\na few hard edges were smoothed away. the phrase radical islamic terrorism did not appear in the speech, as it had in mr. trump's inaugural address and his message to the joint session of congress last year. he did not mention the news media, libel laws or russia (except to criticize it alongside china as rivals that challenge our interests, our economy and our values). the phrase america first is gradually softening (another reagan touch?) into putting americans first. as mr. trump put it winningly: i want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. i want our poor to have their chance to rise.
■ two weeks later, mr. trump declared he would not run, citing his passion for business and a new contract with nbc for celebrity apprentice.\n\nhe was gone, but the anger of many g.o.p. voters remained. rick santorum, not mr. trump, wound up being the insurgent who gave the party establishment fits. he came a lot closer to beating mr. romney than a lot of people remember (and it's not hard to imagine that mr. trump could have done even better).\n\nin 2011, mr. trump had a chance to give his media strategy a test run. the new york times article on his farewell from the race suggested that the most noteworthy element of his flirtation as a candidate was a media culture that increasingly seems to give the spotlight to the loudest, most outrageous voices. stuart spencer, a former political strategist for ronald reagan, was quoted as saying, the media made him, the media kept him, the media kept promoting him.\n\nmr. trump also demonstrated his willingness and ability to mine racial and ethnic resentment. in 2011, mr. trump said, china is raping us. four years later, he said mexico was sending rapists to the united states.\n\nin the run-up to the trump candidacy of 2016, gabriel sherman reported in new york magazine that an employee of mr. trump, sam nunberg — who was later fired for racially charged facebook posts under his name — measured the base's pulse.\n\ni listened to thousands of hours of talk radio, and he was getting reports from me, nunberg recalled. what those reports said was that the g.o.p. base was frothing over a handful of issues including immigration, obamacare and common core. while jeb bush talked about crossing the border as an act of love, trump was thinking about how high to build his wall.\n\nbut maybe more than anything, mr. trump showed in 2011 how he would deploy conspiracy theories. being a birther was merely a start. he associated with conspiracy purveyors like alex jones, a syndicated radio host. among many examples in the last year, the times wrote in march, mr. trump reposted information on twitter from the website infowars, hosted by mr. jones, to support his unsubstantiated claim that thousands of muslims in new jersey cheered the sept. 11 attacks.
the decision to work together was fueled by the pandemic, the coalition said, and by the need to address longstanding inequities in health care access and disparities in health outcomes. millions of americans lost their insurance during the downturn, and the virus has disproportionately affected communities of color, which have experienced high numbers of cases and deaths.\n\nthe recommendations signal a strong show of support for the beleaguered health care law, which had been under fierce attack not only from republicans under the trump administration but from progressive democrats who have urged replacing it altogether with a government-run medicare for all system.\n\nwhile the hospitals, the doctors and the insurers, which benefit when more people have coverage, had previously united to fight the attempts to repeal obamacare by the republicans in 2017, the new coalition also includes the chamber, which had not been a proponent of the law.\n\nwe have always believed that there are better approaches to expanding health care coverage and lowering costs than the a.c.a., but it is the law of the land and as such we want it to function as smoothly and efficiently as possible, neil bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an emailed statement.\n\ngiven the election of mr. biden and the change in the composition of congress, we now have an opportunity to see something actually happen, said chip kahn, the president of the federation of american hospitals, which represents for-profit hospitals and, along with the american hospital association, is a member of the coalition. in addition to the american medical association, the american academy of family physicians is also a member of the coalition.
unitedhealth group, one of the nation's major insurers, reported on wednesday that its earnings actually increased this past quarter, adding that the costs of the coronavirus pandemic were offset by the cancellations of routine medical appointments and elective surgeries for hip replacements and other conditions.\n\nthe company's report provided an early glimpse of how the crisis is affecting the u.s. health care industry, which in many regions has been overwhelmed by emergency and intensive care of patients infected by the virus. tens of billions of dollars in federal funds are now flowing to hospitals dealing with the crisis as part of the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by congress last month.\n\nthe company, which operates one of the nation's largest health insurers as well as physician groups and surgery centers, announced on wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic had minimal impact on its earnings.\n\nunitedhealth reported earnings from operations increased by 3 percent, to $5 billion, for the first quarter of 2020, compared with the same three months of 2019, on revenue of $64 billion.
the biographical video from senator david perdue's first campaign, in 2014, celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural america whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career, navigating free markets and faraway lands, all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.\n\nthe embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern georgia, showcased in the 1996 atlanta olympics, dissected by the novelist tom wolfe and promoted by, among others, mr. perdue's nafta-loving cousin, sonny perdue, governor from 2003 to 2011. three years later, in his maiden run for office, david perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of republicans in bibb county, close to his middle georgia hometown.\n\nthere's only one candidate in this race that's ever lived outside the united states, mr. perdue said. how can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?\n\nnow, facing one of a pair of jan. 5 runoff elections in georgia that will determine control of the senate, mr. perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. but that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge — in his career and in his character, but also in his party and his region — as he embraces the populist, america-first strains of trumpism.
in the first weeks of the democratic primaries, bernie sanders was the only candidate to win big. and to win repeatedly.\n\nwe won the popular vote in iowa, we won the new hampshire primary, and according to three networks and the a.p., we have now won the nevada caucus! [cheering]\n\nin nevada, he did it through sheer popularity by proving he'd built a coalition, one made up of union workers, people with college degrees and hispanic voters. in iowa and new hampshire, he did it by narrowly beating out his moderate rivals who split the majority of the vote, with the leading moderate candidate, joe biden, losing support and stumbling badly.\n\nthe only gas that powers a candidate to the nomination is these delegates, and sanders now has 43 of them. that's more than his closest rival pete buttigieg at 26. and now you can see sanders also has more than triple the number of delegates of most other people in this race.\n\ndown-ballot democrats are very worried about bernie ending up at the top of the ballot, but there's speculation that the rest of the folks — the moderates and others — can't get it together, and they can't stop bernie.\n\n— and the only one who could walk away from super tuesday, today, as the likely democratic nominee.\n\njust days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead. now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the democratic party, we just won and we've won big because of you.\n\n— joe biden offered a vision of a different coalition, this one made up of black voters, older voters and suburbanites.\n\njoe biden lapped the field with 48 percent of the vote, winning every single county in the state, crushing bernie sanders by more than a 2-1 margin, with everyone else trailing badly. biden's big win helped him close the delegate gap considerably with sanders. it's very close.\n\ndespite biden's big night, the confetti could stop for him on super tuesday, as sanders is much better organized and positioned to take a potentially commanding delegate lead.\n\nand so the question now is, will sanders sweep? or, will the moderate wing of the party coalesce around biden, and will the voters who had left him come back in time for super tuesday? it's tuesday, march 3.\n\nno one's ever going to invite me to their home after hearing this. [laughs] they've still got a christmas tree.\n\nso this house right behind us — four beds, three baths, 2,600 square feet. estimated price: $1.3 million.\n\nyou would not be the first new yorker to do that.\n\nto look up how much these homes sell for?\n\nwe are on a residential street in arlington, virginia. it's a quite lovely neighborhood of colonial houses. i think it's safe to say well-off. an affluent suburban community.\n\nof course, of course. nice to meet you.\n\nso on sunday night i went with my colleagues jessica cheung and clare toeniskoetter to meet brian keane at his house in arlington, a suburb about 15 minutes outside washington, d.c.\n\nso cute in here. they've even got a fire going on.\n\nthere are so many of you!\n\nso you met tommy. and this is julia, and this is maddie, and this is jack.\n\nand his dog, a yellow lab named annie. and then we sit down in his living room.\n\nso my name is brian keane, and i'm 52 years old. we're here in arlington, virginia.\n\ntell me who you are and what you do.\n\nso brian, like a lot of people in arlington, used to work on capitol hill. his wife is a partner at a law firm that represents, among many clients, the democratic national committee. he now runs a nonprofit organization and a software company, both of them focused on renewable energy.\n\nwe have a sense that if we're going to be voting, we understand that you want to vote for somebody who can be elected, and so you don't want to kind of just say like, oh, let's just go crazy and vote for mr. potato head because i think he's great, and see what happens.\n\nand you said left of center. my sense of this community is that that center word is important. that it's left of center, but it's not liberal liberal. i went back and looked at the 2016 primary for arlington county and saw that hillary clinton won this county by a 2-to-1 ratio over bernie sanders. it wasn't really even close. he got 32 percent. she got twice as much, 66 percent.\n\nwhat's the kind of character of people's political identification, if you could summarize it?\n\nsure. it's a wealthy community. and it's a very well-read community, if you will. and the reason a lot of people kind of live here is because of the politics. and so they move to washington — certainly that's why i came here, because i love politics.\n\nso tell me about the politics of this community — arlington, virginia.\n\nbut in the most recent polling, which was conducted before south carolina, sanders is actually leading the state of virginia with 28 percent of the vote. joe biden has 19 percent, and michael bloomberg has 17 percent, which, as you can probably gather, is not welcome news to brian.\n\nwell, look. let's be clear. the establishment is freaking out. the establishment is worried. wall street is worried. the drug companies are worried. insurance companies are worried.\n\nwhen he and his friends hear sanders going after the establishment —\n\nwhen you say washington's the problem, he's probably talking about us, and that's not really well received.\n\n— they hear that as him going after them.\n\nyou mean it will trickle down over the whole party.\n\ni don't think, for every — and i really, really think trump is bad for america — a socialist revolution is not what we're asking we need. and if we have a nominee to stand up against trump that says we need a socialist revolution, we're going to lose. and we will lose our senate. we'll lose any strong candidates we have in the senate, and we have a lot of strong candidates.\n\ni think it would be really, really bad for the party.\n\nwhat about as your democratic nominee? i mean, what do you —\n\nhe's just a little mean. i don't think i'd like him as my neighbor.\n\nyeah, like any industry town would be, right? so if you're going to say, the car manufacturers stink, i think detroit would take umbrage to that.\n\nthis is how you hear a lot of establishment democrats talking right now, that a sanders nomination would trigger a meltdown inside the party.\n\nplease tell a long story. we didn't come here for a short story.\n\nwell, i came to washington, d.c. to go to college here at american university. and this is a long story. can i tell my long story?\n\nyou say i'm a joe guy with so much conviction that i kind of want to go back to understand what you mean by that.\n\ni love the guy, but can you win? and then in that case, it's like, so i need to go with a guy that's a person who's going to win. and so now i'm, like, ping-ponging back and forth of who can win, who can win, and i have to give up the guy i love, you know?\n\nso it's, i've been all over the board, though. like it just moves so fast. and my personal thing is so interesting, though, because i've always — my heart has always been like, i'm a joe biden guy at heart.\n\ngiven what you just laid out, who do most of your neighbors tend to support in this primary?\n\nbut, to summarize: brian went to college at american university, where he was the head of an undergraduate group that brought speakers to campus, and joe biden was one of them. this was in 1988, and biden had just dropped out of his first presidential run after being caught plagiarizing a speech. and then he had a brain aneurysm that he barely survived.\n\nand the guy was just great. like it's just me and joe. and then he just says to the bartender, hey, how late are you guys open till? last call, maybe 2 o'clock. oh, great, great. can i borrow your phone? yeah. so he gives him his phone, and joe dials and he goes, hey beau, it's dad. i'm here at american university with brian keane. come on over. get hunter. come on over, and let's have a beer with brian keane at american university.\n\nand so, they shut the room down. so it's, like, 11 o'clock at night now. and he says, hey, is there like a bar around here? and so i said, well, actually, there's a tavern on campus. he's like, oh, you got time? let's go get a beer.\n\nthey actually had to shut it down. they were like, we got to close the room.\n\ni'm serious. i'm serious. i'm serious. don't make me laugh. the answer is yes, i do see the possibility of uniting us so that we can win.\n\nhe took every single question that was there.\n\ni don't see no leader right now of the democratic party who's able to unite everyone. the southern conservatives, the northern liberals —\n\nmost of we public officials, when we're about to speak somewhere, we start off and we say, i'm really happy to be here. well folks, i'm happy to be here. i'm happy to be anywhere in light of [laughs] the last 8 or 10 months. [applause]\n\nsenator joseph r. biden, jr. first entered public service in 1970 when he was elected to the council of newcastle county — excuse me — in new jer— in delaware. [laughter] sorry.\n\n[applause] thank you. good evening, and welcome to tonight's program. my name is brian f. keane, and i am the director of the kennedy political union.\n\nyes, right. so i'm there. i'm just a senior in college, i'm a kid. and he shows up. he gets out of this car, and he's like my best friend. he's like, brian, it's so great to see you! you have no idea how glad i am to see you. and i'm like, senator biden, so nice to meet you. no, you have no idea how glad i am to meet you — uh, to see you. not meet you. you know, he's very good. it's like, in case he has met me before, he's like, so glad to see you! and it was like [gasps], we're best friends. this is amazing.\n\nand so the speech he gave for the kennedy political union at a.u. was his first speech after having been driven out of the race and his aneurysm. so he shows up —\n\nso the boys came over. and really, he was calling for a ride. [laughs] and i was like, that was unbelievable. it was, like, the best night of my life.\n\nthis is actually not the end of the story.\n\nyeah, yeah. and that he is a democrat's democrat to me.\n\npartly because of the relationship you had, partly because of his politics, all of it?\n\nyes. so joe enters 2020, and i said, well i got to be with joe.\n\nbut i think it's amazing that there's a person that can make you feel like that.\n\nwell, i said to my wife, well, i got to go with joe. we're like best friends, you know? and she's like, you don't talk to the guy.\n\nso this time around, 2020, did you know right away? did it feel like he was going to be your candidate?\n\nthat he is the best politician. he loves people. and, actually, that is what the job is. and if you love people, you're going to do well by people.\n\nand i go, oh my god! how do you remember that? that was 1989. he goes, that was a great night, wasn't it? how are you man? how's it going? how are you? and i said, well, are you running for president? and he's like, well, why not? like, why not? and so we got coffee, and then we waited in line for the amtrak. and it was unbelievable.\n\nto make this long story longer, that was 1989. so fast forward to 2007. there's rumors that he's going to run for president. so i'm taking the amtrak, and i get to 30th street station and i go up the escalator. and i'm like, i think, just to myself, i'm like, i think that's joe biden over there. and there's a guy just holding the newspaper. he's holding it up. and i said, excuse me, mr. president. and he folds the newspaper down, and he looks at me. he looks me in the eye, and he goes, american university.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\ntell me about what's happened since then.\n\nbrian keane\n\nso i love joe. joe's my guy. but he has not been a strong candidate. i think he doesn't look good. i think he's not sounding good. and joe biden, who is a great guy, is playing by a rulebook that was written in 1980 maybe, 1972. and that's really concerning to me because donald trump's going to fillet him very quickly. i mean, we're seeing these debates. joe biden's version of kind of hand-to-hand combat is to just say it louder, is to yell.\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren)\n\n— things that touch people's lives.\n\narchived recording (anchor)\n\nmayor, mayor —\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\ni agree. let me she referenced me. i agreed with the great job she did, and i went on the floor and got you votes. i got votes for that bill. i convinced people to vote for it, so lets get those things straight too.\n\nbrian keane\n\ni kind of feel like i'm walking through a nursing home and seeing an old friend, and he's just yelling at me. and it's like, you're an old friend, why are you yelling? he just says it louder, you know, and it's like, stop yelling.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders)\n\n— separate health care plan.\n\narchived recording\n\nsenator klobuchar, i'm going to come to you.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nmy name was mentioned.\n\narchived recording\n\ni'm going to come to you for 45 seconds. 45 seconds for vice president biden.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\ni'm the only guy who's not interrupted here, all right? and i'm going to interrupt now. it costs $30 trillion. let's get that straight.\n\nbrian keane\n\nit's like he doesn't know how to take on his opponents without just yelling it. and he was stumbling on these words.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\ni agree that everybody, once they, in fact — anyway, my time is up. i'm sorry.\n\narchived recording\n\nthank you, vice president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nyou just felt he was faltering.\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nso as you're confronting what you see as his weaknesses, you're watching these debate performances, it sounds like you're starting to flirt with other candidates around this time. and where is your eye starting to drift?\n\nbrian keane\n\nto everybody, actually. and then along comes bloomberg. and there's a guy who really does understand social media, and he has the money to understand social media. and that's really kind of cool. and on an electoral level, he really can go toe-to-toe with trump on that and put his money behind the whole thing to win this thing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nso when it comes to bloomberg, for you he has this combination of values and resources. that's the appeal.\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah. and as such, he could win.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nand what about his candidacy so far, if anything, has given you any reservations, given you pause?\n\nbrian keane\n\nthat he so quickly got off message and kind of got sidetracked.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nin the debates.\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah, in the debates. and to me, the problem there is, oh, so now you're going to go one-on-one with trump? maybe you're not the guy. this is a problem. this all a game-day decision for me, right? so it's — election's tuesday. so, you know, can trump destroy bloomberg? can he destroy biden? yes and yes, perhaps. who has kind of the better heart, and i think i have that answer, because joe is the guy. i love joe. who has the money to be able to do this? bloomberg does. but biden's victory in south carolina, game changer for me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nreally?\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nwhy?\n\nbrian keane\n\ni didn't believe he was going to be able to do that. i didn't believe him when he said, it's a firewall. and the numbers are unbelievable. it's like, wow. joe did it. so then you come back to bloomberg, and it's like, well, i don't know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nsounds like the thing that matters most you was just victory. is seeing joe biden, this person who was faltering onstage, you didn't like the way he was presenting, suddenly seeming electable because he had won an election?\n\nbrian keane\n\nno.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nno?\n\nbrian keane\n\nthe winning was really important, but that speech —\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nthank you, thank you, thank you, south carolina!\n\nbrian keane\n\n— really grabbed me.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nlet me talk directly to democrats across america, especially those who will be voting on super tuesday.\n\nbrian keane\n\nand it was hopeful, and it laid out an agenda.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nif democrats want to nominate someone who will build on obamacare, not scrap it; take on the n.r.a. and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us. and if the democrats want a nominee who's a democrat [cheering], a lifelong democrat, a proud democrat, an obama-biden democrat, join us.\n\nbrian keane\n\nand so now, he's back.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nso here's the deal. let's get back up. we're decent. we're brave. we're resilient people. we can believe again. we're better than this moment. we're better than this president. so get up, take back our country. this the united states of america. there's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. god bless you all, and may god protect our troops. thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nso at the moment — this is sunday night, almost 9 o'clock — you are leaning toward joe biden. ok. what are the odds that you change your mind between now and super tuesday?\n\nbrian keane\n\nit's really amazing because i'm just so back and forth and back and forth every day. and every hour of every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\ni want to talk about what i'm hearing you say, because i think this is a larger question happening in virginia on super tuesday and part of the reason why we're here, which is that it seems like aside from defeating trump, which is your number one priority, a big priority for you is not having bernie sanders be the nominee. is that fair to say?\n\nbrian keane\n\na equals b, and b equals c. because if my number one issue is to beat trump, then we need the candidate who can do that. so that's really the calculus that's happening here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nbut i'm hearing you waffling over these two moderate candidates, biden and bloomberg. and the latest polling has sanders with close to what he had in 2016 in arlington. biden and bloomberg are around 20 percent too, because they're sharing a lot of voters. so if on super tuesday, sanders sweeps a bunch of these states, and he wins in places like virginia, it will likely have been because biden and bloomberg split the vote. and i wonder if you're thinking about that at all.\n\nbrian keane\n\ni am thinking about that. i think every other election has been like, oh, i don't watch the polls. i just vote. i vote my heart. i vote the issues, you know? but now we're all watching the polls. we're all kind of —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\ngaming.\n\nbrian keane
we can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. we have 800,000 bureaucrats working for dod, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...\n\nblitzer: ... thank you...\n\nkasich: ... these resources into strengthening the military. so, we can do it all...blitzer: dr. carson, how would you deal with north korea?\n\ncarson: ok. well first of all, people say that i whine a lot because i don't get time. i'm going to whine because i didn't get asked about taxes, i didn't get asked about israel. hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes. i had something to say about that.\n\nnow...\n\nblitzer: go ahead. this is your moment.\n\n(applause)\n\ncarson: ok. we have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. you know, i never had an audit until i spoke at the national prayer breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. and then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year. and they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year. they didn't find anything and they won't find anything because i'm a very honest person.\n\nbut he fact of the matter is the irs is not honest and we need to get rid of them.\n\n(applause)\n\nand as far as israel is concerned, you know, when i was there several months ago, i talked to a lot of people. i couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on israel. you know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a judeo christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject israel. it doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people. we can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.\n\nand now, as far as north korea is concerned, you know, kim jung un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. and i think we have to present strength to him. we should be encouraging the alliance with japan and south korea. we should be encouraging the placement of the thaad, the terminal high-altitude area defense, that seems to disturb not only the north koreans but the chinese as well.\n\nand we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and i think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. we need to be able to defend ourselves. and lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.
