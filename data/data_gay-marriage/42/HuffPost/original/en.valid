lima, peru (ap) — javier pérez de cuéllar, the two-term united nations secretary-general who brokered a historic ceasefire between iran and iraq in 1988 and who in later life came out of retirement to help re-establish democracy in his peruvian homeland, has died. he was 100.\n\nhis son, francisco pérez de cuéllar, said his father died wednesday at home of natural causes. current u.n. secretary-general antonio guterres called the peruvian diplomat a personal inspiration.\n\nmr. pérez de cuéllar's life spanned not only a century but also the entire history of the united nations, dating back to his participation in the first meeting of the general assembly in 1946, said guterres in a statement late wednesday.\n\nmarlon gomez via getty images disturbed by the united nations' dwindling effectiveness, javier perez de cuellar sought to revitalize the world body's faulty peacekeeping machinery.\n\npérez de cuéllar's death ends a long diplomatic career that brought him full-circle from his first posting as secretary at the peruvian embassy in paris in 1944 to his later job as peru's ambassador to france.\n\nwhen he began his tenure as u.n. secretary-general on jan. 1, 1982, he was a little-known peruvian who was a compromise candidate at a time when the united nations was held in low esteem.\n\nserving as u.n. undersecretary-general for special political affairs, he emerged as the dark horse candidate in december 1981 after a six-week election deadlock between u.n. chief kurt waldheim and tanzanian foreign minister salim ahmed salim.\n\nonce elected, he quickly made his mark.\n\ndisturbed by the united nations' dwindling effectiveness, he sought to revitalize the world body's faulty peacekeeping machinery.\n\nhis first step was to shake the house with a highly critical report in which he warned: we are perilously near to a new international anarchy.\n\nwith the 1982 israeli invasion of lebanon, and with conflicts raging in afghanistan and cambodia and between iran and iraq, he complained to the general assembly that u.n. resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored by those that feel themselves strong enough to do so.\n\nthe problem with the united nations is that either it's not used or misused by member countries, he said in an interview at the end of his first year as u.n. secretary general.\n\nduring his decade as u.n. chief, pérez de cuéllar would earn a reputation more for diligent, quiet diplomacy than charisma.\n\nle ton fait la chanson, he was fond of saying, meaning that melody is what makes the song and not the loudness of the singer.\n\nhe has an amiable look about him that people mistake for through and through softness, said an aide, who described him as tough and courageous.\n\nfaced early in his first term with a threatened u.s. cutoff of funds in the event of israel's ouster, he worked behind the scenes to stop arab efforts to deprive the jewish state of its general assembly seat. there was muted criticism from the arab camp that he had given the americans the right of way in the middle east.\n\nroberto schmidt via getty images un secretary general javier perez de cuellar announces on august 25, 1990 his invitation to iraq's foreign minister tarek aziz to a meeting in new york or geneva for discussions on peaceful solution to the middle east crisis. (photo by roberto schmidt / various sources / afp) (photo by roberto schmidt/iraqi tv/afp via getty images)\n\nin dealing with human rights issues, he chose the path of discreet diplomacy. he refrained from publicly rebuking poland for refusing to allow his special representative into the country to investigate allegations of human rights violations during the warsaw regime's 1982 crackdown on the solidarity trade union movement.\n\nin july 1986, pérez de cuéllar underwent a quadruple coronary bypass operation, putting in question his availability for a second term. from the outset, pérez de cuéllar had insisted that he would be a one-term secretary-general.\n\nupset with what he viewed as member states' reluctance to pitch in to help the world body out of a financial crisis, he told the new york times in september 1986, i don't see any reason why i should preside over the collapse of the organization.\n\nbut he did come back for a second term after a groundswell of support for his candidacy, including a conversation with president ronald reagan, who — in the words of the u.n. chief's spokesman — expressed his personal support for the secretary-general.\n\njust about all the western countries have told him they'd like to see him stay on, a western diplomatic source said at the time. there is no visible alternative.\n\nunlike his predecessor, kurt waldheim who was regarded as a workaholic and who spent long hours in his office, pérez de cuéllar liked to get away from it all. he is very jealous of his own privacy, a close aide said.\n\nwhen i can, i read everything but united nations documents, pérez de cuéllar confided to a reporter. once on a flight to moscow, an aide observed that in the midst of it all, the secretary-general had time for splendid literature.\n\ntrilingual, pérez de cuéllar read french, english and spanish literature.\n\npérez de cuéllar spent much of his second term working behind the scenes on the hostage issue, resulting in the release of westerners held in lebanon, including the last and longest-held american hostage, journalist terry anderson, who was freed dec. 4, 1991.\n\nall told, pérez de cuéllar's diplomacy helped bring an end to fighting in cambodia and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war, and the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan.\n\nshortly after midnight on jan. 1, 1992, he walked out of u.n. headquarters to his waiting limousine, no longer the secretary-general, but having attained his final goal after hours of tough negotiations: a peace pact between the salvadoran government and leftist rebels.\n\nmr. pérez de cuéllar played a crucial role in a number of diplomatic successes — including the independence of namibia, an end to the iran-iraq war, the release of american hostages held in lebanon, the peace accord in cambodia and, in his very last days in office, a historic peace agreement in el salvador, said guterres.\n\neddy lemaistre via getty images pérez de cuéllar and his wife, the former marcela temple.\n\njavier pérez de cuéllar was born in lima on jan. 19, 1920. his father a modest businessman, was an accomplished amateur pianist, according to the former secretary-general. the family traced its roots to the spanish town of cuéllar, north of segovia.\n\nin peru, the family belonged to the educated rather than the landowning class. he went to the right schools, a countryman at the united nations once said of pérez de cuéllar.\n\nhe received a law degree from lima's catholic university in 1943 and joined the peruvian diplomatic service a year later. he would go on to postings in france, britain, bolivia and brazil before returning to lima in 1961, where he served in a number of high-level ministry posts.\n\nhe was ambassador to switzerland and then became peru's first ambassador to the soviet union while concurrently accredited to poland. other assignments included the post of secretary-general of the peruvian foreign ministry and chief delegate to the united nations.\n\nafter leaving the u.n. pérez de cuéllar made an unsuccessful bid for peru's presidency in 1995 against the authoritarian leader alberto fujimori, whose 10-year autocratic regime crumbled in november 2000 amid corruption scandals.\n\nat the age of 80, pérez de cuéllar emerged from retirement in paris and returned to peru to take on the mantle of foreign minister and cabinet chief for provisional president valentin paniagua.\n\nhis impeccable democratic credentials lent credibility to an interim government whose mandate was to deliver free and fair elections. eight months later, newly elected president alejandro toledo asked him to serve as ambassador to france.\n\nbetween foreign assignments, he was professor of diplomatic law at the academia diplomatica del peru and of international relations at the peruvian academy for air warfare.\n\ntransferring to the united nations in 1975, he was appointed by waldheim as the secretary-general's special representative in cyprus. during his two years on the divided island he helped to promote intercommunal peace talks between greek and turkish cypriots.\n\nafter a brief stint as peru's ambassador to venezuela, he returned to the united nations in 1979 as undersecretary-general for special political affairs. in that capacity, he undertook delicate diplomatic missions to indochina and afghanistan.\n\npérez de cuéllar resigned his u.n. post in may 1981 — just before the election campaign for u.n. secretary-general heated up — and returned to the peruvian diplomatic service.\n\nhowever, he encountered political problems at home when he was nominated by president fernando belaunde terry to be ambassador to brazil.\n\nthe nomination failed to win senate approval. there was no public debate, but congressional sources in lima said opposition came from javier alva orlandini, peruvian vice president and leader of the ruling popular action party. the sources said orlandini resented pérez de cuéllar's participation in the swearing in of the military junta that overthrew belaunde terry in 1968.\n\npérez de cuéllar maintained that, as secretary-general of the peruvian foreign ministry at the time, he was required by protocol to take part in the ceremony even though he had no pro-junta leanings.\n\nbelaunde terry, restored to power in 1980, reaffirmed his confidence in pérez de cuéllar by recommending him for nomination as u.n. secretary-general.\n\npérez de cuéllar married the former marcela temple. he had a son, francisco, and a daughter, cristina, by a previous marriage.\n\nhis funeral will be held friday.\n\n—-\n\nedith m. lederer in the united nations contributed to this report.
banda aceh, indonesia (reuters) - indonesia's national police chief has ordered an investigation into the detention of 12 transgender women in the province of aceh, officials said on friday, after reports that they were stripped, beaten and forced to cut their hair before being released without charge.\n\nindonesia has the world's largest muslim population but aceh, on the northern tip of sumatra, is the only province that enforces islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.\n\nreligious police and vigilantes in the ultra-conservative province often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.\n\npolice in north aceh raided hair salons - where transgender people often work - last weekend and briefly detained 12 individuals. rights activists and media reports said they were forced to cut their hair and were stripped and beaten.\n\nthere were photos circulated that led us to suspect that there had been physical action taken against the suspects, misbahul munauwar, a spokesman for aceh police, said. the national police chief has instructed us to investigate those photos and to determine if there was any...procedural or ethical violation.\n\na national police spokesman confirmed that police chief tito karnavian had ordered the investigation.\n\nhuman rights watch and other rights groups welcomed the move, which comes amid a rising tide of hostility against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.\n\npolice in aceh and elsewhere have stepped up raids on what they call gay spas and gay sex parties in recent months, detaining people on charges of violating strict anti-pornography laws.\n\ndozens of protesters on friday staged an anti-lgbt rally outside a mosque in the provincial capital banda aceh.\n\nwe don't hate gay, bisexual or transgender people. what we hate is their actions, and if we can prove their actions, they will be punished, aceh governor irwandi yusuf told the small crowd.\n\nlast year, the provincial and central governments drew international condemnation after authorities in aceh tried two young men on charges of engaging in gay sex and then publicly caned them - the first such case in the country.\n\nindonesia's parliament is also drafting revisions to the national criminal code that could ban all consensual sex outside marriage.\n\nthe parliamentary commission drawing up recommendations has still to finalize its proposals, but a draft seen by reuters includes measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated.\n\nreporting by reuters stringer in banda aceh; writing by kanupriya kapoor; editing by ed davies and nick macfie
digitalvision vectors no one likes to talk to a chronic one-upper.\n\nwe all have that friend: the one who one-ups you in conversation every chance they get. sometimes it's a co-worker or family member, but what they all have in common is that anything you can do they can do categorically better.\n\nwent to a public ivy for your undergrad? oh, yeah, they applied to a handful of them but ultimately went with harvard.\n\nfinally got around to buying a new hybrid sedan? sure, the new priuses are nice, but they're waiting for tesla to put out the new model s.\n\ngoing to the amalfi coast for your vacation next spring? sweet! they went there with their spouse years ago, before it got super touristy. they can send you a list of recs if you want! (everyone loves the list. they've forwarded it like 50 times.)\n\nif this article were a medical malpractice ad, this is the point where we'd say: if you or a loved one has had prolonged interaction with a one-upper, you may be entitled to financial compensation...\n\njokes aside, one-uppers ― people who listen to you tell a story and immediately try to do you one better (or try to do you one worse, if you shared something sad) ― are some of the least pleasant people to talk to.\n\nit's almost as if one-uppers have the belief that if your light shines, theirs is dimmed, said margaret rutherford, a psychologist in fayetteville, arkansas, and the author of perfectly hidden depression. do they do it to take you down a notch? or is it because they somehow feel less than because you're getting attention or praise for something?\n\na 2015 study found that braggarts overestimated the extent to which their audiences would feel proud and happy, and underestimated their annoyance.\n\nrutherford hears complaints about one-uppers all the time in her therapy practice, and she's dealt with plenty in her own life, too.\n\ni'm an avid walker, and i had a family member who would tell others that they walked just as much or farther than me when all of us knew they'd never walked for exercise. ever, she said. it's quite sad.\n\noneupmanship can be born from all kinds of inner struggles. sometimes it's rivalry, low self-esteem masked by bravado, an actual problem with lying or just having an awkward social presence, rutherford explained.\n\nthat awkwardness is worth exploring a little: most of us can read the room if we're coming across as braggy: if we jump on someone's sentence before they can finish getting it out or use their story as a jumping-off point for our own humblebrag, we'll notice that there's an awkward pause from the rest of the group once the interaction is through. we'll spot the occasional eye roll and realize, oh, my gosh, i'm a thunder-stealing monster! and change our ways.\n\nit's different for a one-upper. what sets them apart is their failure to relate to others and read social cues, said amanda deverich, a marriage and family therapist in williamsburg, virginia.\n\nmany people who like to 'story top' are not aware of what they are doing. they're simply enjoying sharing their story and feeling like they are one of the gang with a similar experience, she said. these who are unaware are getting a good feeling, as if they are popular and well-liked.\n\nscience backs this up. a 2015 study found that braggarts overestimated the extent to which their audiences would feel proud and happy, and underestimated their annoyance.\n\nwhen a one-upper brags, they misjudge how the story will play for others. if i tell my co-workers about how i quit my first job at 22 to backpack through europe for a whole year, they'll think it's romantic and cultured sounding! the one-upper thinks.maybe they'll want to join me on my next smaller trip.\n\nmeanwhile, the one-uppers' co-workers are thinking: could this guy be any more of a bragger? must be nice to up and quit your job. his parents probably paid for that.\n\nsometimes one-upping is motivated by a competitive streak, too, but a sophisticated, competitive person knows story-topping generally is impolite, off-putting and disenfranchising, deverich said. it doesn't actually secure your position at the top of the social hierarchy. the intelligent, competitive person will save the topping story for the most advantageous moment.\n\nhow to deal with a chronic one-upper:\n\n1. go into the conversation expecting it.\n\ncertain things ― a root canal, a conversation with a relentless one-upper ― are easier to deal with if you just accept it's going to be rough going. if you're in regular conversation with a one-upper, just think of their habit as part of the package. maybe even learn to laugh at it. (i wonder how many times they'll respond with a brag this time; last time, i think the count was four.)\n\nas with so many character traits that are annoying, what's helpful is to expect the response ahead of time, rutherford said. if you're talking about your own accomplishments, assume the one-upper will do the same. they have to stick their two cents in, whether what they're saying is truth or fabrication. if you expect it, it has less impact on you. it can even make you smile.\n\n2. sympathize with the one-upper. they probably don't even know they're doing it.\n\nnow that you know most one-upping is fueled by the inability to read the room and relate to others, hopefully you'll respond differently the next time your pal does it. it's not them, it's their social awkwardness!\n\ntry not to get too annoyed or frustrated with this person, even though it can be taxing to deal with, said jessica baum, a psychotherapist in palm beach, florida. remind yourself that the other person might have low self-esteem or that maybe they feel out of place and could be unaware of their behavior. patience is really important here.\n\nif the one-upping is hindering your relationship, it's ok to speak up and share that you need them to listen to you more, because you want to connect with them and feel that they care about your experiences, too. - jessica baum, psychotherapist in palm beach, florida\n\n3. maintain a healthy sense of pride in your accomplishments ― even if the one-upper tries to steal your thunder.\n\na healthy sense of self-esteem can make you near bulletproof to one-uppers, deverich said. resist competing with the bragger in your life; it's a waste of time, plus, there will always be someone who's done, seen and accomplished more than you have. our goals are so highly personal and individualistic, what's the point of comparing?\n\none-upping is just a never-ending cycle of madness, deverich said. encourage yourself when it comes to your goals, and appreciate the experiences of others. definitely distance yourself from braggarts and aggressively dominant jerks, though.\n\n4. if you're close to them and it's really starting to bother you, address it gently.\n\nwhile practicing patience and empathy is usually the best approach, that can be difficult when you're close to the one-upper and their bad habit is starting to chip away at your goodwill toward them. in this case, healthy and kind communication is a big step in the right direction, baum said.\n\nyou can share your take on their behavior and do so in a loving way, she said. if the one-upping is hindering your relationship, it's ok to speak up and share that you need them to listen to you more, because you want to connect with them and feel that they care about your experiences, too.
prince harry and meghan markle's big day is fast approaching, which got us thinking about all of the british royal wedding traditions we may (or may not) see on may 19.\n\nsure, you may be aware that female wedding guests don fancy hats and fascinators for the ceremony (a british custom not just reserved for royals). who could forget the bold headwear princess beatrice of york wore at the wedding of the duke and duchess of cambridge? but there's probably quite a few traditions you've never heard of before. below, we delve into some of the lesser-known ones.\n\n1. the bride carries a sprig of myrtle in her bouquet.\n\ndan kitwood via getty images kate, the duchess of cambridge, holding her wedding bouquet, which included a sprig of myrtle.\n\nthis tradition dates back to the 19th century when prince albert's grandmother gave queen victoria some myrtle ― a symbol of good fortune in love and marriage ― which victoria then planted in her garden at osborne house on the isle of wight. she cut a sprig from that plant when her oldest daughter, princess victoria, got married in 1858. since then, queen elizabeth ii, princess diana and kate have all carried a bouquet with myrtle from victoria's garden. the same bush is still thriving.\n\nwe take very good care of it, a spokesperson for osborne house told people.\n\n2. the wedding band is made of welsh gold.\n\nandrew milligan/pa images via getty images prince william places the wedding ring on kate's finger on april 29, 2011.\n\n3. the newlyweds serve fruitcake at the reception.\n\nprincess diana archive via getty images david avery, head baker at the royal naval cooking school, displays charles and diana's multi-tier fruitcake in 1981.\n\na fruitcake was originally a symbol of wealth and prosperity because of its precious ingredients such as dried fruits, alcohol and spices, london pastry chef chris dodd told vogue. furthermore, the cake, in a way, represented the vastness of the british empire, using ingredients from far-flung corners of the globe. a wedding was, and is to this day, a time of celebration, and as such it calls for a cake to match the occasion.\n\nprince harry and meghan markle, however, will be going in a different direction. in march, kensington palace announced that the couple decided on a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream frosting by chef claire ptak of london's violet bakery. it's possible they will also have a smaller groom's cake, as william did at his wedding.\n\n4. and after the wedding, guests receive a slice of the wedding cake in the mail.\n\n5. the bride leaves her bouquet at the tomb of the unknown warrior inside westminster abbey.\n\npeter macdiarmid via getty images the bridal bouquet kate held on her wedding day was placed on the grave of the unknown warrior at westminster abbey.\n\nthis tradition began in 1923 with the queen mother as a way to honor her late brother capt. fergus bowes-lyon, who was killed during world war i.\n\nsince then, other royal brides ― even those who did not marry at westminster abbey ― send the bridal bouquet to be laid on the grave on their behalf.\n\n6. the royal family member must receive the queen's formal permission to tie the knot.\n\nchris jackson via getty images the queen must approve the marriages of the first six people in line for the throne.\n\non march 14, two months ahead of prince harry and meghan markle's wedding, the queen gave her formal blessing for the nuptials in an official letter that read: i declare my consent to a contract of matrimony between my most dearly beloved grandson prince henry charles albert david of wales and rachel meghan markle.\n\n7. the groom wears military clothing for the ceremony.\n\nprincess diana archive via getty images charles donned a military uniform on his wedding day in july 1981.\n\nthe way this is different is that [harry] is not in the direct line of succession, royal expert and officer of arms alastair bruce told town & country. he is a member of the royal family. this is a family wedding which is taking place not in public, not out of the public eye, but within the castle, which is much less visual.\n\nif he does wear military garb for the ceremony, harry will likely change out of it afterward, as his brother, william, did at his 2011 wedding.\n\n8. the royal family poses for formal wedding portraits.\n\nhugo burnand/clarence house via reuters will and kate pose for an official portrait with their families and the wedding party on april 29, 2011.\n\nphotographer alexi lubomirski, who shot harry and meghan's engagement photos, has been named the official photographer for their wedding.

marriage therapy only works if both partners are committed to the process. but by the time some couples schedule an appointment, one or both partners has already checked out.\n\nbelow, marriage therapists around the country share seven reasons to head to therapy sooner than later.\n\n1. struggling alone does you no favors.\n\nthe average couple that comes in for therapy has been struggling for about six years. this means they've been unhappy for much longer than they needed to be. one reason to get into therapy early is to get ahead of the curve and address issues before they become problems. ― zach brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forbetter\n\n2. solvable problems may escalate to entrenched, bitter hurts.\n\ncouples who reach out earlier for support when things are amiss often head off a caustic, ugly pattern of hurting each other in ways that are hard to forget or forgive. marriage therapists should be able to help partners identify the ways they express themselves when they are hurt or angry and to recognize how they may unintentionally put their partners on the defensive.― linda lipshutz, a psychotherapist in palm beach gardens, florida\n\n3. asking tough questions now will save you a world of hurt later.\n\nin my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. when you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. so many of the issues i see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: people who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. a few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― ryan howes, a psychologist in pasadena, california\n\n4. you lose empathy for your spouse the longer you stay bitter.\n\nwhen issues remain unresolved, resentment can create a large and ugly divide between two people. this often manifests as lack of empathy, disinterest and at times, even disrespect. go to therapy before arguments seem insurmountable because one or both of you have become apathetic. ― talia wagner, a marriage and family therapist in los angeles, california\n\n5. the earlier you nip problems in the bud, the better.\n\ni'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. that means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― zach brittle\n\n6. crisis is a horrible time to work on things.\n\ni often share a folksy old saying with my clients: 'it's best to fix the roof when the sun's shining.' we all know that when we're in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. maybe you've noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. the wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. it's ok to go to counseling when things seem 'fine' so that you are more resilient when they aren't. even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it's good to be equipped when they come. ― ryan howes\n\n7. and ultimately, life is too short to be miserable in your marriage.
hi, readers!\n\nthis is dominique, back on the newsletter this week — this time from sticky, sweltering singapore, where the streets have been disquietingly empty as people have battened down the hatches and taken shelter out of fear of getting ill with the novel coronavirus. below, a native of wuhan, china, the epicenter of the sickness, shares her perspective on the virus terrifying the globe — but let's not dwell on that for the time being.\n\ni first want to thank all the generous readers who wrote in to share their own stories in response to last week's newsletter on gender dynamics in marriage. some readers said gender imbalances in relationships appear to be shifting in a positive direction in many cultures, including in the u.s., but that there's still a long way to go. self-love and self-work, including seeking counseling for both partners, is key to enacting change in a relationship, a pennsylvania-based clinical social worker and family therapist suggested in her email to me.\n\nthis week, we'll be pivoting our focus to something quite different but similarly compelling: exploring this interactive feature on black hair, created by huffpost u.s. and published in honor of black history month.\n\nthe feature, which seeks to amplify black conversations about black hair, tells the stories of 18 people and their relationship with their kinky, curly, straight, dreadlocked and even hairless heads.\n\nhuffpost us\n\nblack hair defined is all about letting people tell their stories about their hair journeys, erin evans, a senior enterprise editor at huffpost who commissioned the articles for this project, told me from new york.\n\nwhether that was a story about hair loss, or about embracing natural hair as a black trans woman or even a few fun pieces that looked iconic hairstyles in film, music, politics and sports — it was important for there to be a variety of perspectives and voices since black hair is beautiful and versatile in all its many forms, erin said.\n\nfor me, this project really resonated as a true exploration of how people think deeply about their relationship to their hair, erin added. i rock a curly 'fro because i love how it looks, whether the curls are defined, frizzy or tangled. and as a black woman, i think there's so much beauty and power in being able to embrace my curls and coils no matter what anyone else may think.\n\nsoak in the project for yourself and then perhaps ponder how your own hair has influenced your identity. share your thoughts with me at herstories@huffpost.com.\n\nwishing you a fantastic weekend,\n\ndominique\n\ndominique mosbergen, senior reporter, huffpost u.s.\n\nif you're in new york, you can also join huffpost editors for a conversation on black hair, politics and identity on feb. 26. register here.\n\nchina daily cdic/reuters\n\ncanadian resident and wuhan native debbie lu shares her perspective on the coronavirus outbreak. so many westerners only know wuhan in the context of the [virus], she laments. they don't know that we have famous authors and scholars and actors, or great street food, or hot summers. they don't know that we're known for our schools. so when people share negative opinions over social media about my home, because of coronavirus, i wish i could show them its better side — the side of wuhan that i know and love.\n\nlauren mulligan/getty images\n\nit can be hard to tell your parents, in-laws and other relatives that you've made the choice to not have children. psychologists and counselors share their advice with huffpost india on how to have these challenging conversations with honesty, compassion and empathy.\n\nin case you missed it ...
mixed race woman taking broken paper heart\n\nif you don't start offending your wife, i don't think you're going to have a marriage. i heard these words come out of my mouth at a recent session with a couple in my office. i imagined that they were thinking, this family therapist is crazy. but i was pretty sure i was right.\n\nlet me explain: marriage, or any duet or intimate partnership needs plenty of caring, lots of tolerance and acceptance and enough humor to take the edge off. but a pattern of too much politeness or caution in one or both partners kills the spark, and pretty soon the marriage is limping along, barely alive, or, sometimes, so turbulent that it can break apart.\n\na recent couples' session illustrates this dynamic:\n\nbeth and larry, a mid-30's couple with two young daughters, came to see me on the verge of divorce. at least, beth is on the verge of divorcing her mild-mannered husband. from the first visit, beth was large and in-charge. this attractive woman, who runs a child-developement center, indicated that she felt let down by larry in every way. he was no longer affectionate with her, he argued with her over what she considered petty things, and beth had begun making plans to, as she put it, work on becoming effective co-parents-i.e., she was giving up on the marriage. this was her second marriage, by the way.\n\nbeth fell for larry shortly after she left a really turbulent relationship with her bi-polar-ish first husband. beth felt responsible for him, and said she hung on much longer than she should have. devastated and emotionally drained following her break-up, this handsome, capable and calm larry felt like just the ticket. they dated for several years, during which time they each pursued professional degrees. beth remembered that they fought rather intensely during periods of separation from each other, but had long months where they enjoyed a close and loving connection.\n\nin the sessions, the most striking quality of this couple is larry's reticence with beth. he's a really smart guy, thoughtful, a well-regarded environmental specialist, but he seems dumb with his wife. while she threatens to give him the boot, he looks unruffled. but he's clearly hurt, and at our initial meeting he acknowledged not being able to sleep because of worry that beth would leave.\n\nat our last session, i wondered about larry's quiet demeanor. this followed my umpteenth observation that larry appears to be a caring, engaged guy who loves his family and wants to make things better. that's worth a lot. when i asked larry what keeps him so polite with beth, he responded, i'm afraid of offending her. she easily gets offended. on a roll now, he described how he had been sleeping on the couch for a couple of years-!-because his wife was committed to co-sleeping with the kids. he didn't like the idea, he wanted his bed-and his wife-back, but, according to him, she became offended when he tried to bring this up. wow!\n\nthis was the problem with these well-meaning people in a nutshell. when beth gets upset, or fights larry on an idea, he withdraws. i'm not sure if he's protecting himself or her, but my guess is that it's a bit of both. and even though beth says she wants a relationship of equals with two strong voices, she has a subtle way of appearing to be the expert. she says she wants an equal, but a real equal partnership will challenge her status as exclusive expert, especially on the kids. i'm not sure she's ready for that.

less than a year after legalizing marriage equality, bermuda passed a law last month to ban same-sex marriage once again.\n\nsame-sex couples have until the end of may to wed there before the new measure goes into effect. the self-governing british territory became the first to reverse its stance on the issue, according to glaad, as countries increasingly move to legalize marriage between people of any gender.\n\nnow, a pack of celebrities, including ellen degeneres, tegan and sara and patricia arquette, are calling to boycott the vacation hot spot ― at least until its residents make equality the law of the tiny land.\n\ni guess i'm canceling my trip, degeneres tweeted thursday evening. anyone else?\n\nbermuda just banned marriage equality. i guess i'm canceling my trip. anybody else? https://t.co/c5bwubyjzt pic.twitter.com/vpt5qqafsq — ellen degeneres (@theellenshow) march 7, 2018\n\nactor bradley whitford called for a boycott last month, shortly after the news broke.\n\nlater in february, arquette also called on followers to boycott bermuda.\n\non wednesday, pop duo tegan and sara sent a tweet saying they were thinking of our friends in the lgbtq community in bermuda, and encouraged followers to support efforts to overturn the policy.\n\nthinking of our friends in the lgbtq community in bermuda. bermuda is the first country in the world to remove the right to marry for gay and lesbian couples. learn more here and consider supporting the fight for justice and equality. https://t.co/lr2znjsvzb https://t.co/gugk7losad — tegan and sara (@teganandsara) march 8, 2018\n\nbermuda's supreme court ruled in may 2017 that a registrar's decision to deny a marriage license to a same-sex couple was discriminatory, legalizing marriage equality in the socially conservative atlantic territory.\n\nlegislators responded by creating the domestic partnership act, which allows same-sex couples to form domestic partnerships, not marriages, and claims to offer such partnerships equal rights. same-sex couples who are already married in bermuda can remain married.\n\ncritics say the law contradicts bermuda's constitution, which protects against discrimination.\n\nsome worry the law will create problems for bermuda's $431 million tourism industry. cruise lines registered in bermuda ― including carnival's cunard, p&o cruises and some princess cruises ― will not be able to host same-sex marriages regardless of where the ships travel, cnbc reported.\n\nthe lgbtq segment of the global tourism industry is significant and growing, according to a 2017 report by the world tourism organization, which states that locations supportive of lgbtq rights are (unsurprisingly) appealing to lgbtq travelers.\n\nglaad has called on tourism businesses to speak out against bermuda's reversal on marriage equality.\n\nthese brands and their business leaders should demonstrate true leadership and stand for those customers they've courted by helping to combat this harmful decision, glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis said in a statement.\n\na crowdjustice campaign has raised 25,000 pounds (about $35,000) of a 50,000-pound goal (about $70,000) to finance efforts to reclaim marriage equality in bermuda.
young-ju kim, author of a daughter-in-law's letter of resignation, was a good daughter. she got married in 1989 to the eldest son of the eldest son in a large extended family, which meant she had to become a manmyeoneuri, or the eldest daughter-in-law. it was a role that would long consume her life.\n\nshe quit her job and worked as a daughter-in-law, mother and wife for decades. but after 24 years, she felt she'd done enough ― and decided to live the life she actually wanted before it was too late.\n\nshe filed for divorce in 2012 and submitted a letter of resignation to her parents-in-law just before the 2013 chuseok holidays, a major harvest festival in south korea. her loved ones complained and asked how she could do such a thing.\n\nbut she had no regrets. she felt like nothing would change before she died unless she acted on her decision. there was nothing to lose.\n\nsanga kim author young-ju kim wrote a letter of resignation to her husband's family in 2013.\n\nher declaration of resignation as eldest daughter-in-law changed almost everything. her husband, whom she moved in with again after knee surgery in september 2017, finally began to listen to her, and the annual ancestral rites and holiday ceremonies, which had been a source of immense strain and stress, were simplified. she and her husband grew in respect for one another, and ended up not divorcing. the change that occurred in her daily life was significant enough that she has called it amiracle, even a small revolution.\n\ni'm the only unmarried person in my family. i asked kim how women should take on their roles as daughter, sister and sister-in-law so that there will be no regrets later.\n\ni, myself, must be happy first and foremost, kim told me firmly. put off the pressure of having to play roles in the family; make sure that you are happy first. that's what's most important.\n\nit's not a selfish choice but a way to make people around you happy, she added. everyone has their own burdens of life. rather than trying to solve your family's problems for them, let them solve the problem for themselves. no matter how long it takes. seriously.\n\nwe tend to think that we are close to our family, but we don't actually know their thoughts, who they really are, or even their likes and dislikes. i spoke to kim about how we can feel happiness in our relationships with our family, how her own family has changed and self-care.\n\nsanga kim young-ju kim when she was still the eldest daughter-in-law.\n\nthe korean new year holidays are just around the corner. how will you spend the festive season?\n\njust as i typically do ― or, at least, typical as things have been since i submitted my letter of resignation in 2013. after my letter, i didn't go to my husband's parents' home for two to three years. then, when i did go, there again, i didn't cook ― as i normally would've done ― and we ordered in. but the food wasn't as good as home-cooked meals, so we started cooking one dish at home, and since last year, we've been cooking just enough jeon [korean pancake] for our family to eat.\n\nbefore my resignation, i had cooked for the entire family all by myself ― but now we all cook together. my parents-in-law buy groceries in advance, and we all share the rest of our duties. it takes less than two hours to finish now.\n\nyou may say, that's the same as before, isn't it? but it isn't. the difference is my actions are now voluntary. no matter how good a duty of obedience is, no one enjoys doing it. it feels demeaning. but it's not unpleasant to do it voluntarily in a balanced relationship. now the holidays have become a fun time to meet and talk about current events for hours, as well as cook and eat delicious food together.\n\nhow were your holidays when you were the eldest daughter-in-law, before you submitted your resignation?\n\nit all centered on preparation and cooking. it took two to three days to buy all the groceries. i had to go to traditional markets, big supermarkets and even small shops when i needed a specialty item.\n\ndid you shop alone?\n\nyes, alone, without even my husband's help. i bought piles of groceries and cooked all alone. i also had to make a lot of side dishes on top of the main holiday foods. it was so hard and stressful.\n\ni'm feeling a rising frustration in my heart as the new year holidays approach...\n\nthere was a family gathering at the end of last year .… that day was winter solstice, and my father-in-law bought red bean porridge, my mother-in-law boiled the cabbage soup, my sister-in-law went grocery shopping, and my husband's brother and his wife washed all the vegetables while others grilled the meat. i brought side dishes from home. my husband washed all the dishes.\n\neveryone from all three generations prepared the dinner and washed the dishes together. my son bought coffee after he finished eating, and everyone was very happy to have coffee and tea together. i felt so content because i felt a great sense of cooperation and equality. i realized again that my ordinary life had changed like a miracle.\n\na roomful of adults of different generations. it sounds like a recipe for squabbling!\n\n[laughs.] is that so? we have three generations. my parents' generation, my husband and my generation, and our son's generation. when we meet, we talk about social issues. we all have different ideas and perspectives. nevertheless, we don't ignore others, and we don't say, you don't know any better. by listening carefully, we can at least understand where others' ideas stem from ― even if we don't necessarily share those opinions.\n\nsince i know what it was like before, i feel like the present situation with my husband's family is a sort of miracle. actually, i feel more intimate with them after submitting my resignation letter. i've grown to think of them as actually really good people.\n\nas all these changes happened in your family after you submitted your resignation, you clearly played a big role in this transformation.\n\nno, i actually think the letter was just a spark, a small starting point for change rather than a major personal achievement. it could've gone in a completely different direction. i am grateful to my family for having worked toward building the balanced and peaceful relationship we have now.\n\nhave you ever regretted the letter?\n\ni have my regrets. i also regret not quitting sooner. had i acted at an earlier date, i could have created a more equal and respectful environment for my children. at the time, my husband's family felt like this insurmountable, enormous rock, and it was scary. but then i realized that i too am a person with power.\n\nthe rock wasn't as enormous and insurmountable as you expected it to be?\n\ni had initially regarded myself as too small and meager in comparison to such a huge rock ― and i felt i didn't have a voice. but after submitting my resignation letter and filing for divorce, i realized how much power i possess.\n\nafter i saw how my small actions prompted big change within my family, i realized that it wasn't just them that had needed to change ― but i had needed to change first.\n\nsanga kim\n\nquestions are increasingly being raised now about the honorific titles and other language used in familial relationships and in the marital setting in korea. like, why is it that a woman needs to use formal terms like miss or young master when referring to her husband's family members? what do you think about these terms?\n\ni'm very empathetic. when i got married, i addressed members of my husband's family as miss or young master ― but i felt like i was a maid.\n\ni remember calling my husband's 6-year-old brother young master, but in informal settings, i would use his real name. when an elder relative got wind of this, however, he told me to call him young master instead. i thought it was irrational.\n\ndaughters-in-law are often required to speak deferentially to their husband's family members. the language contains respect. but there's not much respect for the names of women. it is a problem that my generation does not dare to touch, but i think that it will change in the next generation.\n\nyou lived alone for 10 months starting in november 2016. how was that?\n\ni lived in my parents' house before marriage, and i lived as a wife, a mother and a daughter-in-law after marriage. it was the first time in my life that i'd spent 24 hours totally alone.\n\ni woke up when i wanted to wake up and slept when i wanted to sleep. i felt a bit lonely, but i went out and met people, and that helped.\n\nthings i really wanted to do had been removed from my priority list when i was living as a daughter-in-law ― but during those months alone, i lived fully and enjoyed it. that's when i wrote the book.\n\nhow is your relationship with your husband now?\n\ni thought that each of us should be free and independent for a healthy marital relationship, and a lot has changed. after i left, my children also became independent, and my husband was alone. when i came back after my surgery, i saw him cleaning the house and watering the flower pots. [laughs.] now we do everything together, from start to finish, when we cook.\n\nhave you ever heard of other people who tried to make a change via a letter of resignation?\n\ni've heard of many. there was a middle-aged man whom i met at a reading. he said he was shocked after reading my story. he had never thought about it that way and began worrying about his own wife resigning. he said he had a mental breakdown and decided he needed to change before his own wife quit. he said that he had got rid of all the unnecessary things for holiday preparations and went to the movies with his wife after almost 20 years of marriage, which made them both very happy.\n\nhe also said that he was committed to making changes to things that need to be changed from now on, which made me very happy.\n\ni hadn't expected my book or my actions to have made this sort of effect. i resigned because i felt like i was dying at the time, and after, i felt i'd been reborn. i am so encouraged when i hear about those who are trying to recover after thinking they've lost everything.\n\nthis interview has been translated from korean. it was edited for length and clarity.

(ap) — california's governor announced wednesday that he is posthumously pardoning a gay civil rights leader while creating a new pardon process for others convicted under outdated laws punishing homosexual activity.\n\nbayard rustin was a confidant of dr. martin luther king jr. and a key organizer of the march on washington in 1963. he also helped plan other nonviolent protests and boycotts to end racial discrimination.\n\ngov. gavin newsom pardoned rustin for his arrest in 1953 when he was found having sex with two men in a parked car in pasadena. he was in town as part of a lecture tour on anti-colonial struggles in west africa.\n\nhe served 50 days in los angeles county jail and had to register as a sex offender before returning to his home state of new york. he died in 1987.\n\nnewsom noted that police and prosecutors nationwide at the time used charges like vagrancy, loitering and sodomy to punish lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (lgbtq) people.\n\nhe issued an executive order creating what he called a new clemency initiative to identify those who might be eligible for pardons and swiftly consider those applications. he encouraged californians to apply for clemency for people they believe meet that criteria.\n\nnewsom's office could not say if other states have taken similar steps.\n\nin california and across the country, many laws have been used as legal tools of oppression, and to stigmatize and punish lgbtq people and communities and warn others what harm could await them for living authentically, newsom said in a statement. he thanked those who pushed for rustin's pardon and encouraged others in similar circumstances to seek a pardon to right this egregious wrong.\n\nnewsom first gained national prominence in 2004 when, as san francisco's mayor, he ordered officials to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. the practice was overturned then but eventually became the law nationwide.\n\nthe california legislature's lgbtq and black caucuses last month asked the democratic governor to pardon rustin.\n\nrustin's close friends knew he was gay, but his religious and political associates distanced themselves after his arrest, sen. scott wiener of san francisco and assemblywoman shirley weber told newsom on behalf of the caucuses.\n\ngenerations of lgbt people — including countless gay men — were branded criminals and sex offenders simply because they had consensual sex, wiener said in a statement praising newsom's actions. this was often life-ruining, and many languished on the sex offender registry for decades.\n\nweber said the pardon helps leave rustin's legacy in the civil rights movement uncompromised.\n\nrustin was a great american who was both gay and black at a time when the sheer fact of being either or both could land you in jail, she said in a statement praising newsom. this pardon assures his place in history.\n\nrustin was stripped of his leadership post at the fellowship of reconciliation, a pacifist organization involved in the civil rights movement, after u.s. sen. strom thurmond of south carolina read rustin's arrest file into the congressional record.\n\ncalifornia repealed the law against consensual sex between same-sex adults in 1975, and in 1997 created a way for those individuals to be removed from the california sex offender registry. but neither step changed the original convictions.\n\npresident barack obama honored rustin posthumously with a presidential medal of freedom in 2013 for the 50th anniversary of the march on washington and king's famous i have a dream speech.
when i was born in a dingy hospital in ahmedabad, india, 29 years ago, my parents were handed two documents: a birth certificate and a natal chart. the doctor informed my mom that the latter, also known as a birth chart, was an astrological map that revealed how the position of the sun, moon, planets and other celestial bodies at the time i was born would influence my behavioral tendencies, character traits and life purpose.\n\nshe has to be named with the 'p' rashi [moon sign], he told her before handing over the paperwork. don't lose this.\n\nironically, my birth certificate got misplaced, but the natal chart remained accounted for and intact in its laminated form. when we moved to the united states, it traveled with us and eventually found a permanent and secure home in my dad's safe.\n\ni learned very early on that vedic astrology ― the kind of astrology practiced in india, which differs from western astrology ― served as a guidepost in my parents' household. their trusted astrologer was on speed dial, despite living in india, and they frequently referred to my star alignment before i was allowed to make monumental decisions. going out of state for college? consult the planetary placement first. picking a career in law? make sure the zodiacs are on board. looking to get married? ensure the celestial bodies don't have any concerns.\n\nalthough i'm not religious or an avid believer in astrology, i didn't argue with my parents' reliance on the astrologer's recommendations because it was just easier than trying to dispute the accuracy of his claims. they found solace in knowing that the universe was somehow supportive of key milestones for me, and for most of my life, my personal pursuits seemed to be reinforced by the cosmic world they believed in, so i chose not to rebel.\n\nuntil now.\n\nlast summer, i got engaged to a british indian man. he, like me, is a product of a liberal upbringing but understands the need to respect certain facets of our culture.\n\nthis meant that he needed the universe's permission before formally asking for my hand in marriage.\n\nshortly after he proposed to me, our families decided to recognize our engagement in the traditional hindu way, or as we colloquially call it, the coconut ceremony. during this ceremony, my fiancé and i would be given coconuts, money and other gifts from both sides of the families as a token of good luck as we formalized our commitment before god.\n\nthey say the course of true love never runs smooth and, for us, the biggest impediment was astrology.\n\na week before the indian engagement ceremony, my parents, brother, fiancé and i sat in our living room in queens, new york, huddled around a phone to learn the astrologer's assessment of our compatibility. kundali matching is a popular method in which the prospective bride and groom's horoscopes are compared under an obscure system that counts 36 points among the two horoscopes. if 18 or more points match, that's a match literally made in heaven. fewer than 18 matches means your marriage is not approved by the stars.\n\nin order to calculate our score using this mysterious scientific and mathematical process, the astrologer needed some information.\n\nwhat's your birthday, exact time of birth and birth location? the familiar voice inquired over the speakerphone.\n\nmy fiancé reluctantly replied. i could read the apathy on his face, noting that to him this meant very little. on the other end of the line, i could hear the soft tapping of keys as the astrologer input our data to determine if our marriage would be suitable. the room was filled with palpable tension as we waited impatiently. we all understood that this analysis was a make-it-or-break-it moment for my parents.\n\nsixteen, he answered moments later. not compatible. the marriage will not work.\n\ni could see the color drain from my parents' faces. my mom immediately went into problem-solving mode, inquiring what remedies were available to undo the cosmic block. she was determined to find a comfortable solution without defying the stars. after all, she and my dad had been married for over 30 years and she was convinced that it was due to their astrologer's prediction.\n\ni could hear the soft tapping of keys as the astrologer input our data to determine if our marriage would be suitable. the room was filled with palpable tension. ... we all understood that this analysis was a make-it-or-break-it moment for my parents. 'sixteen,' he answered moments later. 'not compatible. the marriage will not work.'\n\none possible remedy was an ancient practice called kumbh vivah, a ritual whereby a woman first symbolically marries an earthen pot or banana tree to remove the horoscopic error, something my mother had done herself. the objective was to neutralize the negative influence of mars in an effort to transfer the bad luck that would otherwise befall her future husband to the artificial groom (the tree, pot, etc.), thereby allowing the bride to have a peaceful future marriage.\n\nanother solution was to have a puja, a ceremony initiated by a priest whose chants and prayers would ward off the inauspicious energy. i could also wear a suitable yantra (gemstone) per my zodiac sign in what i learned was considered gemstone therapy, and the gem would radiate positive energy and lure away ill omens.\n\nfrankly, none of these solutions worked for me.\n\nindian philosophy views marriage not only as a long-term commitment between two people but as a union of cosmic energy and permanent stability. generations have relied on horoscope matchmaking (especially for arranged marriages) to get assurance that the married couple would enjoy a life of bliss, stability and health.\n\ni understand my parents' intentions regarding the horoscope matchmaking were nothing but positive. throughout my life, my respect for them and my culture had dissuaded me from making decisions they might not agree with. i had silently complied with their need for astrological affirmation because it had never deterred me from what i wanted for myself. but this was where i drew the line. i did not feel comfortable with any of the astrologer's recommendations for fixing our problem.\n\nafter trying to reason that astrology is imperfect and would provide no tangible assurance about the strength of my future marriage, i realized it was time to say what i was really thinking. at that moment, i didn't care that the cosmic bodies had determined that my marital union would be doomed. i was willing to take the risk of spending the rest of my life with my chosen partner, confident that we could overcome any obstacles ― cosmic or otherwise ― together.\n\nmy parents, of course, met this decision with some resistance.\n\nwhat about jyoti, who got married against the astrologer's recommendation? now they're getting divorced! my mom exclaimed about a distant cousin whose five-year marriage ended mutually due to noncosmic reasons. my parents listed other examples of couples with unsuccessful marriages, neglecting the many other reasons those relationships failed besides astrological incompatibility. it was clear they didn't want me to become another horror story or the classic i told you so example that other parents would end up telling their children.\n\nthis made me and my fiancé want to prove them ― and indian society ― wrong even more.\n\nstill, as determined as we were, i will admit our astrological reading did give me temporary anxiety. this was the first time i would deviate from what astrology told me to do and for a moment, i wondered if i was going to jinx my marriage.\n\ni very quickly realized i was being irrational. my relationship with my partner was built on a foundation of mutual understanding, communication and real-life work. it is this same approach that we will rely on as a married couple, with no space for the universe's opinion. for me, love is not a mystical phenomenon ― it is a manifestation of the respect and unconditional care that two people have for each other and that makes them want to spend forever with each other.\n\ni am sure there are many examples of others who did not heed the advice of their astrologer and still went on to experience successful marriages. we plan on joining those ranks.\n\nmonths have passed since that fateful reading and my parents have come around with their blessing and are now happily participating in our wedding planning. i thank my lucky stars that, despite some serious moments of doubt, they are supporting us. i realize that deviating from the comfort and certainty that astrology has brought them is a process in itself.\n\nmy fiancé and i are hoping to get married in london this coming september, once the global pandemic is over (or at least much less severe) and we can have our big fat indian wedding safely in the presence of our close family and friends. there are still a lot of unknowns ahead of us but there's one thing i do know for sure: astrology won't be on our guest list.\n\npooja shah is a freelance writer living and working in new york city. you can follow her on twitter at @poojashahwrites.\n\ndo you have a compelling personal story you'd like to see published on huffpost? find out what we're looking for here and send us a pitch!
feb 27 (reuters) - united nations secretary-general antonio guterres called women's inequality stupid and a cause for global shame on thursday, as he pledged to press governments to end discriminatory laws in the face of a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights.\n\nwhile guterres did not name and shame, president donald trump's administration has led a push at the u.n. against the promotion of sexual and reproductive health services for women because the administration sees that as code for abortion.\n\nassociated press u.n. secretary general antonio guterres said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were also being diluted or rolled back.\n\nspeaking ahead of the annual meeting of the u.n. commission on the status of women in new york next month, guterres warned that the state of women's rights was dire and said he would seek to end default male thinking across the united nations.\n\njust as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women's inequality should shame us all in the 21st. because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid, guterres said in a speech to the new school in new york.\n\nhe said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were being diluted or rolled back and that in 34 countries rape within marriage was still legal.\n\nthere is a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights, guterres said. women's sexual and reproductive rights are under threat from different sides.\n\nlanguage promoting women's sexual and reproductive health is long-agreed internationally, including in resolutions adopted by the security council in 2009 and 2013 and several resolutions adopted annually by the 193-member general assembly.\n\nhowever, the united states under trump has pushed to remove such language from new u.n. resolutions. the trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the u.n. population fund because it believed it was linked to an abortion program, but the u.n. said that was an inaccurate perception.\n\nthe u.s. supreme court ruled in 1973 that women have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion but the issue is still divisive in the united states.\n\nthe u.n. should not put itself in a position of promoting or suggesting a right to abortion, whether it is humanitarian or development work, u.s. ambassador to the united nations, kelly craft, said in october.\n\nthe united states has received support for its stance from countries including russia, egypt, saudi arabia, united arab emirates, brazil, guatemala, nigeria, democratic republic of congo, mali, sudan, uganda, poland and hungary.\n\ni find it pretty strange that the united states is mobilizing so hard on this issue ... because if you look at the bigger picture is the main threat to the world today abortions? or is it an assertive china? a russia that is expansionist? let's just get our focus right here, said a senior european diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nlast year washington threatened to veto a security council resolution if a reference was not cut citing the need for u.n. bodies and donors to give timely sexual and reproductive health assistance to survivors of sexual violence in conflict.\n\nguterres said on thursday he would urge governments to achieve gender parity in senior leadership. he said he achieved gender parity among his senior leadership team - on jan. 1, 90 women and 90 men were in the ranks of full-time senior leadership, two years ahead of the target date he set.\n\nwomen have equaled and outperformed men in almost every sphere, he said. it is time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential.
did orlando bloom and katy perry get engaged on valentine's day?\n\nthat's the consensus on social media and among multiple news outlets after pop star perry shared a post — simply captioned full bloom — to instagram early friday.\n\nthe image below appears to show perry sporting a sparkler on what many fans believe is her ring finger. in the background of the couple's picture are dozens of heart-shaped red balloons:\n\nbritain's daily mirror tabloid reported that perry's mother, mary hudson, confirmed the engagement news in a facebook post.\n\nbloom shared the same snap on instagram, which he captioned lifetimes. he posted this rumination on relationships the day before:\n\nperry also posted a picture on thursday celebrating happy mushy gushy day.\n\nand in her instagram stories, singer shared this sweet image of her beau:\n\nperry, 34, has dated the 42-year-old british the lord of the rings actor on-and-off since 2016. perry's first marriage to british actor and comedian russell brand ended in 2012. bloom shares a son with supermodel miranda kerr, with whom he split in 2013.
two years ago, after eight years of marriage, my husband moved out and even though the change was good and long overdue, financially it was utterly devastating. i had two kids to take care of, a mortgage to pay and bills that never seemed to stop coming. while part of me was excited to tackle it all on my own, i had only worked part-time while caring for my kids. in that sense, i'd never done it all on my own. i was terrified.\n\ni knew getting my finances under control wouldn't happen without effort. still, my two kids were finally both full-time in school. i saw an opportunity to push further in my career than i'd ever been able to do as a mom at home with the kids. i was excited to sink my teeth into new and exciting work, and i did. i scrimped and saved and cut back on expenses. i put just enough gas in the car to get the kids to school and get back home. but no matter what i did, i'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. i'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.\n\ni felt my financial struggles gaining on me, so i picked up extra jobs wherever i could, bargain-shopped and sold items that were sitting in my garage. i tried hard to get ahead of it. still, i wondered if january 2020 would be the year that it all came crashing down. for a while, it was all i could think about. i wondered how anyone, especially single parents, was able to financially survive in modern times. personally, i felt like i was constantly underwater.\n\nno matter what i did, i'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. i'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.\n\ni used to love christmas, but this past year, as soon as all the gifts were unwrapped and i'd polished off the last sugar cookie while standing over the sink, all i felt was relief. there had been arguing with my estranged husband about holiday plans, and a sad, toxic mediation session that took place just a few days before christmas. i had burst out crying in the first five minutes. in an effort to stand up for myself and my kids, i yelled and raged, and i left feeling angry and broken, wondering why on earth we had decided to schedule mediation so close to the holidays. but mostly, what kept me up at night was a heavy, consuming financial stress that had been building for months.\n\ni couldn't sleep for weeks leading up to dec. 25. i stayed awake refreshing my bank account on my phone to see if my paycheck had cleared. it finally did on the evening of the 23rd, and i frantically went out and did all of my shopping ― for my two kids and everyone else ― on christmas eve. mostly, i crafted and made cookies and wrote heartfelt notes to teachers and people i wanted to do more for but couldn't, financially.\n\nregardless of having slapped christmas together, the whole vibe of the holidays was off, at least for me. i was so consumed by stress, i hadn't felt like myself. i had been catching myself too overwhelmed to offer a smile to a stranger, or do the things i would normally do, like drop change in a bucket or make a donation to an important charity or take a hat out of my glove compartment and give it to someone on the street ― things i like to do but this year felt i couldn't. emotionally and financially, i was maxed out, and that meant i wasn't in the spirit of helping others, even though i wanted to.\n\ni was about one late payment away from serious repercussions. i had to fill the income gap, and fast. truthfully, i was starting to panic.\n\neven though i'd recently gotten a more steady job as an editor and had been picking up other work as much as i could, a gap in my income still meant i couldn't pay my january mortgage. because i'd made late payments before, it wasn't good. i was about one late payment away from serious repercussions. i had to fill the income gap, and fast.\n\ntruthfully, i was starting to panic. i whispered affirmations to myself. i brainstormed ways to make up the money. i sold my engagement ring for $250, picked up freelance assignments and i reached out on a facebook community where fellow writers and editors often discuss work opportunities. in a moment of panic, i wrote a quick note about my situation and let members know i was available for some quick jobs if anyone had anything to toss my way.\n\nalmost immediately, a member responded. i was excited because i didn't know if the message would get overlooked completely or if maybe someone had a quick writing or copyediting job to offer. the group member sent me a private message. she asked me what my venmo name was. i responded immediately, assuming she wanted to connect for future payment, after i completed whatever work she had to offer, maybe transcribing something that wouldn't take too much time. i had said i was open to anything. instead, my phone dinged immediately ― it was the sound of a venmo payment coming through. this complete stranger had sent me $350 ― the amount i had specified that i was needing to earn in the next few days to make up the gap.\n\nalong with the payment she wrote a note. happy new year to a badass single mama ― no strings attached. i was completely blown away. are you kidding me!? i wrote her back, my fingers flying on keyboard. we chatted briefly. i thanked her profusely but i was stunned. i didn't know what action to take.\n\nit was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. i'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason.\n\npart of me felt like sending the money back. it was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. i'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason. but i realized, this woman really wanted to help, and clearly she was able to. she didn't seem to need a lot of thanks or even acknowledgment ― she didn't want anything at all. it was hard to find the right words to express my gratitude.\n\nshe had no idea how much it meant, though. with this gift, i'd finally be able to get out of the hole i had basically been in for two years since getting separated. i'd be starting 2020 with a clean slate, rather than yet another late mortgage payment. it was maybe the most meaningful gift i'd ever gotten and it came from someone i'd never met or even spoken to before online.\n\ni wondered why she had done it. had she once been a struggling single mother? had she recently read something that made her want to pay it forward? had the note i'd quickly jotted asking for an odd job, or any job, struck a nerve? did she just go around doing things like this for others all of the time? i didn't know the answer and i'd probably never get it. still, regardless of the reason, her action filled me with gratitude.\n\npeople are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined.\n\nwhile i had begun the year exhausted by stress and financial worry, i felt a shift in my mentality after the first week of january. i realized how unexpectedly kind people can be. it's so hard to see sometimes because most people don't have the means to help others, and i don't just mean financially. people are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined. i certainly was caught up in mine.\n\nlast week, my daughter and i gave a ride to a woman whose car had broken down. it took us five minutes out of our way ― it didn't cost a thing. this gift that was given to me, even though it was financial, helped me remember the tons of ways we can help one another and that we should do them as often as we can, despite our income bracket. the truth is that most people genuinely want to help. when we do, it creates a space for us to keep paying it forward in whatever ways we can. easing someone's burden gives them the ability to help ease someone else's.\n\ni'm back to dropping change in buckets whenever i can because someone dropped change in mine.\n\nhave a compelling first-person story or experience you want to share? send your

jakarta (reuters) - the united nations human rights chief on wednesday criticized proposals in indonesia's parliament to criminalize gay sex and extramarital sex, saying such laws could hurt the country's beleaguered lgbt community and other minorities.\n\nzeid ra'ad al hussein said he had raised the issue with president joko widodo during a three-day visit to the world's largest muslim-majority country, where hostility toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) community has risen sharply in recent years.\n\ndiscussions of (revisions to the criminal code) betray strains of intolerance seemingly alien to indonesian culture that have made inroads here, zeid told a news briefing, adding that he believed the proposed rules were discriminatory.\n\nthe hateful rhetoric against the lgbt community that is being cultivated seemingly for cynical political purposes will only deepen their suffering and create unnecessary divisions, he said.\n\nindonesia's parliament is currently deliberating revisions to a dutch colonial-era criminal code, including proposals to outlaw sex outside marriage, same-sex relations, and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated by law.\n\nthe revisions have broad support in parliament, where few politicians have stood up for lgbt rights for fear of alienating a largely conservative voter base ahead of legislative and presidential elections next year.\n\nmany officials in president widodo's government have said lgbt people, like other citizens, should be free from discrimination and violence. but top officials, including the president, have said that indonesia's cultural and religious norms do not accept the lgbt movement.\n\nactivists have raised concerns that, if approved, the new rules could violate basic rights and be misused to target minorities.\n\ncurrently, indonesian law does not regulate homosexuality, except in the ultra-conservative islamic province of aceh.\n\nzeid, a member of the jordanian royal family who has been in the u.n. post since 2014, said indonesia was among the most progressive states in southeast asia on human rights.\n\nbut he also urged jakarta to address past atrocities - like the 1965 massacre of nearly half a million suspected communists - and human rights abuses in the easternmost province of papua, and the use of the death penalty.\n\nthere are some dark clouds on the horizon but ... i hope the common sense and strong tradition of tolerance of the indonesian people will prevail over populism and political opportunism, he said.\n\nreporting by kanupriya kapoorediting by ed davies and christopher cushing
it's become an inevitable game, of sorts, every awards season for the last several years (particularly in the wake of #oscarssowhite in 2015), for us to tally up so-called diversity and inclusion wins.\n\nat sunday night's golden globes ceremony, there were major accolades for awkwafina, who became the first woman of asian descent to win the award for best actress in a motion picture - musical or comedy. egyptian comedian and actor ramy youssef took home his first major award for best actor in a tv series - comedy, using his time onstage to earnestly explain how much it meant for him to create a show about a young muslim-american man. kate mckinnon presented a lifetime achievement award to ellen degeneres in an emotional speech where she declared, if i hadn't have seen her on tv, i would have never thought i could be on tv.\n\nbut there were surprising losses, too. (this excludes the works that were completely snubbed in nominations, like ava duvernay's stellar when they see us, lupita nyong'o's performance in us and zendaya coleman's role in euphoria.) eddie murphy's comeback performance in dolemite is my name failed to garner recognition; he lost to taron edgerton for rocketman, and dolemite was shut out altogether. billy porter of pose (unsurprisingly) lost the best actor in a tv series - drama award to industry juggernaut brian cox of the wildly popular succession. and, in one of the biggest snubs of the night, odds-on favorite jennifer lopez — dressed in gold — lost the best supporting actress in a motion picture award to laura dern's wonderful albeit glorified cameo performance in marriage story.\n\nchristopher polk/nbc via getty images awkwafina arrives to the 77th annual golden globe awards held at the beverly hilton hotel on jan. 5, 2020.\n\nthis year's globes infamously shut out women in the best director category, despite the abundance of critically acclaimed, money-making films by female directors including lulu wang, lorene scafaria, greta gerwig, mati diop and celine sciamma. their lack of nominations doesn't magically erase the brilliance of the movies they made.\n\nand yet, it says something.\n\nnominate more women, wang, director of the farewell, told variety, when asked on the red carpet what her message to members of the hollywood foreign press association would be. what is the determination of a good film versus not a good film if you can't look at critic reviews or box office?\n\nin a perfect world, such objective (or gesturing toward objective) criteria for nominations would be the norm. but in hollywood, it's not always about quality in determining who gets nominated and who wins. politics, the power of a good narrative and diversity — not only of the performers, directors and others, but those who are doing the nominating — are also key drivers in who ultimately nabs the statue.\n\nlike all questions of progress when it comes to diversity and inclusion, actually quantifying forward advancement, or using award shows to gauge that movement, is tenuous at best. progress usually comes in stops and starts. one year, moonlight may win the coveted best picture academy award. another year, the white savior buddy movie green book may inexplicably take the top prize.\n\nthe golden globes, of course, are fun, but they aren't the academy awards. they aren't even much of an indicator of who may get an oscar; there's no overlap between golden globes voters and academy members.\n\nand yet sunday's awards were a great microcosm of the interesting place hollywood now finds itself in, five years after #oscarssowhite, three years after #metoo. the host of the night, ricky gervais, made a few pithy attempts at jokes about diversity, calling the hfpa (who vote for the winners) racist, and calling out the lack of female director nominees.\n\nwe were going to do an 'in memoriam' tonight but … when i saw the list of people who died, it wasn't diverse enough, he quipped. it was too many white people.\n\nit's a cute enough joke, but it also distills the beginning and ending of so many diversity and inclusion conversations that we've had in recent years. much of the hollywood establishment believes that the point of contention is always about whether there are too many white people, or too many men and so on.\n\nreally, it's about something else.\n\ndiversity is all well and good, but there's also a question of taste, of discernment. award ceremonies are supposed to be the purveyors of what's next, what's exciting, what's enriching the culture as a whole. so-called diverse filmmakers and actors shouldn't win or be nominated for awards just by virtue of existing, no. but when genuinely stellar work by these creators goes unnoticed for the sake of lauding the same revolving cast of characters, it raises a singular question.\n\nif an awards show in 2020 shuts out several brilliant female directors as nominees in favor of predictable male directors, if it completely snubs one of the best miniseries of last year, when they see us, is it even relevant anymore?
i'm referring, of course to valentine's day. and what a blessed relief it is to hit the pause button, take a break from hatred and celebrate love. i can't remember a time we needed it more.\n\nbut before we get into that, did you know that the feast of saint valentine (or valentine's day) wasn't always about couples expressing their love for each other?\n\nthat only happened later, first in the 14th-century, when geoffrey chaucer incorporated saint valentine's day into his love poem, the parliament of fowls and then, in 18th-century england, when lovers began giving flowers, confectionary and sent greeting cards.\n\nbefore that valentines was anything but loving.\n\nlegend has it that way back in the third century the roman emperor claudius ii was building up a military and thought single men made better soldiers. so he outlawed marriage for young men. a priest, named valentine, disagreed and thought the ban was unfair, and he continued to perform marriage ceremonies secretly.\n\nmore and more i hear canadians making mean and disparaging comments about those who disagree or have different points of view. i also hear racist remarks, which is terribly distressing.\n\nyep, claudius got pissed and had the priest killed. i suppose we should be grateful that president trump just takes to twitter.\n\nsome of you may wonder why i harp so much on donald trump. there are a few reasons, not the least of which is that i detest everything he stands for. it just goes against all i believe in and hold dear. plus, if he continues to head down this same path he's currently headed on, i believe he will put america -- and very possibly other countries, canada included -- in danger.\n\nhis influence, his message of hatred and hostility, are alarmingly far-reaching and that really concerns me.\n\nmore and more i hear canadians making mean and disparaging comments about those who disagree or have different points of view. i also hear racist remarks, which is terribly distressing. it's not who we are as a nation. some of the things said after the shooting at the mosque in quebec made me feel like i was at a trump rally.\n\nand i'm not ashamed, or afraid, to say i don't like it.\n\nwe need to nip it in the bud before we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of a rebellion here, in canada. we cannot delude ourselves into thinking we're immune. we have plenty of issues of our own -- like income inequality, like aboriginal issues, like the keystone pipeline, like electoral reform -- and i sure hope justin trudeau's paying attention. because the trump effect crosses borders, we're already seeing some evidence of that. and i'd prefer us to solve our problems our way, not his.\n\nthere may be another way to counter his revolution of hate and it's valentine's day that's made me think of it. maybe it's time we -- and by we i mean the world -- had a revolution of our own. maybe it's time for another love-in.\n\nwhat if every time donald trump tweets something hateful, we tweet something loving and kind.\n\nwhat if we respond to every nasty act of his, by being considerate.\n\nwhat if every time he points fingers, we give hugs.\n\nwhat if we smile at strangers on the subway, in the elevator, on the street, in restaurants and cafes and supermarkets.\n\nwhat if we always remember to take the extra minute to say thank you.\n\nwhat if we all wore little red heart pins on our lapels.\n\nwhat if ...\n\nif you enjoyed this story click on become a fan at the top of the article right next to my name. you'll be notified every time i post.\n\nfollow huffpost canada blogs on facebook
london (ap) — lawyers for the duchess of sussex asked a british judge on tuesday to settle her lawsuit against a newspaper before it goes to trial by ruling that its publication of a deeply personal letter to her estranged father was a plain and a serious breach of her rights of privacy.\n\nthe duchess, 39, is suing associated newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over five february 2019 articles in the mail on sunday and on the mailonline website that published portions of a handwritten letter to her father, thomas markle, after her marriage to britain's prince harry in 2018.\n\nassociated newspapers is contesting the claim, and the full trial is due to be held in the autumn at the high court in london.\n\nthe duchess is seeking a summary judgment that would find in her favor and dismiss the newspaper's defense case. her lawyer justin rushbrooke argued that the publisher had no real prospect of winning the case.\n\nat its heart it's a very straightforward case about the unlawful publication of a private letter, he said tuesday at the start of a two-day hearing, held remotely because of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nclive mason via getty images the duchess of sussex attends day twelve of the wimbledon lawn tennis championships on july 14, 2018 in london.\n\nrushbrooke said meghan had every expectation that a heartfelt plea from an anguished daughter to her father would remain private.\n\nlawyers for the duchess say thomas markle, a retired television cinematographer, caused anguish for meghan and harry before their may 2018 wedding by giving media interviews and posing for wedding-preparation shots taken by a paparazzi agency. in the end he did not attend the wedding ceremony after suffering a heart attack.\n\nrushbrooke said meghan's letter, sent in august 2018, was a message of peace whose aim was to stop him talking to the press.\n\nhe said the duchess took steps to ensure the five-page, 1,250-word letter would not be intercepted, sending it by fedex through her accountant to her father's home in mexico. the letter implored thomas markle to stop speaking to the media, saying: your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces.\n\nthe last sentences, read out in court, were: i ask for nothing other than peace. and i wish the same for you.\n\nlawyers for associated newspapers argue that meghan likely knew the letter would one day be published.\n\nthey also say she made personal information public by cooperating with the authors of a behind-the-scenes book about her and harry, finding freedom, in order to present a version of events favorable and flattering to her.\n\ntoby melville / reuters an employee holds a copy of 'finding freedom', an unofficial biography on prince harry and meghan, the duchess of sussex, at a waterstones bookshop in london on aug. 12, 2020.\n\nmeghan denies collaborating with the authors — though she acknowledges allowing someone close to her to speak to them — and the book is expected to feature prominently in the trial.\n\nrushbrooke said the fact that the duchess is a public figure does not reduce her expectation of privacy in relation to information of this kind.\n\nhe said the sad intricacies of a family relationship … is not a matter of public interest.\n\nthe defense will respond on wednesday.\n\nin october, judge mark warby agreed to meghan's request to postpone the trial, scheduled to begin this month, until october or november 2021. he said the reason for the delay should remain secret.\n\nmeghan, an american actress and star of tv legal drama suits, married harry, one of the grandsons of queen elizabeth ii, in a lavish ceremony at windsor castle in may 2018. their son, archie, was born the following year.\n\na year ago, meghan and harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to north america, citing what they said was the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the british media. they recently bought a house in santa barbara, california.

a week after getting engaged, i woke up in the middle of the night soaked in my own stress sweat. the excitement of the proposal had worn off and the questions began to race through my mind.\n\nhow would our relationship change once we got married?\n\ndo we need to get married or can we just ditch the legal document?\n\nwill i have to drain my savings account to fund this wedding?\n\nspeaking of money, what will happen to my money once we're married?\n\nthat last question has stuck with me for quite some time. my fiancé and i have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. we've discussed topics like having kids, raising kids with a certain religion and our future career and relationship goals. we've always found ourselves seamlessly getting on the same page.\n\nwe've also talked a lot about our finances, disclosing to each other what our cash situation looks like and what kind of money mistakes we've made in the past. but one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word ― prenup.\n\nfor a while, i didn't think getting a prenup was something we needed to do. neither of us were walking into this marriage with major assets. we just figured we'd keep our separate bank accounts, for a while, and figure out how to split bills and financially plan together, while keeping some things separate.\n\nin new york, where we plan to get married, the money you make becomes marital. which means, it's shared. money or assets from the past become marital, too, unless you protect them with a prenup or don't add any money to your savings account, investments or assets.\n\nmy fiancé and i have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. but one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word -- prenup.\n\nbut the more i thought about the word marriage and the legal bindingness of it, the more i began to panic. i knew i had to talk to my fiancé about our financial game plan and perhaps even about getting a prenup.\n\ni thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more i researched that, the more i realized i was wrong. essentially, prenups are something for anyone to consider, regardless of how much money you have to your name, who wants protection or a legal game plan of what will happen if the marriage ends. why argue about all of the assets you came into the marriage with, when the marriage is crumbling and on its final leg? why not get that out of the way beforehand. the idea of a prenup or a legal financial document started to sound more and more attractive.\n\nwhen i brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. he questioned why i had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. for starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.\n\ni thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more i researched that, the more i realized i was wrong.\n\nit also would be something that could calm my pre-marriage anxiety, which i find normal. you're about to legally bind a lot of yourself to another person, shouldn't that feel a little scary? we decided to educate ourselves on what a prenup would mean and in the process, figuring out the best moves for ourselves individually and as a couple.\n\nbefore continuing any financial conversation together, we decided to spend time separately going through our finances. we each created a spreadsheet with the current state of our bank accounts, our investments our retirement funds, and our debt. we also decided to write down what we both felt we were comfortable combining and what we wanted to keep separate (to be used for a potential future prenup).\n\ntaking this step not only allowed us to both organize any outstanding financial mess (like the need to merge an old 401(k) into a sep ira) but also have all our assets documented in an easy to consume way.\n\nafter sharing our spreadsheets, we decided to reach out and get help. a lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. we both had different ideas about how to go about doing this; i wanted us to live on a tight budget to increase our savings and my partner wanted us to invest more now.\n\na lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. we both had different ideas about how to go about doing this.\n\nan entire coffee shop of people stared at me as i yelled and cried one afternoon while we went over our credit card statements and talked about the kind of purchases we could cut back on. i found myself feeling strong and sensitive about the fact that i've been single and independent for most of my twenties and have worked hard for my money. though i've made money mistakes along the way, i was proud of my accomplishments, and at times, exposing my errors to my fiancé made me feel weak.\n\nwe spent full day in silence after a conversation about how to split our money and wages went south after discussing the potential scenario of having kids. i would have to temporarily stop working for a few months, and we both freelance so there's no such thing as paid maternity or paternity leave for us. we didn't reach a resolution.\n\nwe realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. these were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.\n\nwe sat down with someone at the financial gym, which according to their website is a group of financial trainers looking to put you in control of your finances, one step at a time.\n\nwe realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. these were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.\n\nwe met with a financial trainer who asked us questions about what our individual and joint financial goals were, analyzed our assets and helped us determine how much we should budget and save for our ideal retirement and investment plans.\n\nturning to an expert helped us power through a difficult set of conversations about basic finance and how things will work once our money is merged and the money we make becomes shared. once we knew what we were both bringing into the relationship, and were close to agreeing on how to implement shared money habits, we decided it was time to think about whether or not we wanted a prenup. while i always thought prenups were for people who had millions of dollars in assets, it turns out i was wrong.\n\nbefore making the decision, we decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date, to talk about what kinds of terms we could include in a prenup and what we could potentially add to it later on. this felt like a smart and proactive choice to help protect us from outcomes we weren't necessarily ready for since we weren't planning for them to happen.\n\nwe decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date.\n\nwhen we go to that appointment next month, we'll be ready to share our assets with the divorce lawyer, our future concerns and how we'd like to handle the worst case scenario of our relationship, an unexpected ending. either way, we're way past the awkwardness of having the prenup or financial protection conversation. now when the word comes up, we laugh and share with our friends proudly that we're considering getting one. a lot of them look at us with wide eyes of shock.\n\nover dinner with another engaged couple, we talked about the p word and the only thing they could share with us was that they are concerned we're approaching our engagement journey in a negative way, by planning for the worst.\n\nnone of my friends have ever openly talked about getting a prenup before their marriage and if they did get one, they kept that secret and swallowed the idea of releasing that information to their close friends. some people feel the decision is private, but society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life ― the actual wedding day.\n\nsociety tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life -- the actual wedding day.\n\nthe more i talked to friends about this and told them i might want to get one, the more i felt judged. some friends even texted me asking if i was having second thoughts about marrying my fiancé. i'm not. i truly feel like marrying this person is the best decision but that doesn't mean i should feel shamed for wanting to figure out how i will walk out of the marriage, financially, if it ever comes to that. the wedding day will be a great day in our lives, but it's the marriage that's the most important ― and this includes discussing our finances.\n\ni've spent years making money and saving it. when life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), i feel like i have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. it might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but i think it's the opposite. we've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.\n\nhave a compelling first-person story or experience you want

it's no secret that money problems are a leading cause of stress in relationships. and for a significant portion of americans, debt is a major source of money strife that doesn't bode well for their love lives.\n\nmore than half of millennials in relationships agree that they don't want to get married until their finances are in order, according to a survey by credit karma. forty-two percent say transparency about a partner's finances is key to a healthy relationship, while 71% say it's at least somewhat important their partner's finances be up to certain standards before marriage.\n\nso, what if you or your partner is dealing with a load of debt? is it a death sentence for the relationship?\n\nmoney is a complicated beast in the therapy room, and in real life. it is a charged topic that is, for many, taboo, said joy lere, a psychologist with a practice focused on the merger of money and mindset. it is more than simple math … differences in money management and unspoken rules about how it is discussed (or not) can lead to significant friction or fracture in a relationship.\n\nif you're concerned that debt will ruin your relationship, know that's not necessarily the case. it depends on how you and your partner handle it together.\n\ndebt is simply a catalyst\n\nwhen it comes to couples with debt, the money alone is not the root cause of relationship problems. it's the pressure and conflict that often arises from dealing with that debt that can bring to light other issues in the relationship.\n\ndebt can serve a stand-alone stressor, but when superimposed on other relational strain can amplify problems in a relationship, lere said. issues such as secrecy about spending, disagreements on how to handle finances and varying levels of comfort carrying a balance can all be sources of tension.\n\nthat's because money also is a sort of emotional currency in relationships. it can be a vehicle for communicating certain messages that are not being put into words between two people. when misused, money can be a bid for power, control or punishment. spending can also be used as a stand-in for other unmet needs.\n\namy rollo, a psychotherapist and owner of heights family counseling in houston, agreed. as a couples therapist, it is actually rare for money stress to be the biggest issue. for most couples, it is difficulty managing conflict, feeling disconnected, trust issues, commitment difficulties or an inability to create shared meaning in their relationship that causes the most distress, she said.\n\nwhile some couples may view debt as a deal breaker, rollo said that for most, it's dishonesty. i've had several clients present to couples counseling because they feel deceived by their partner. they share they did not realize their partner's debt burden until they were already married or engaged, rollo said.\n\nlere put it this way: money is rarely just about numbers. for a couple to solve financial issues that may be leading to strain in the relationship, they need to develop insight into their own relationships with money and figure out the psychological reasons behind the mismanagement.\n\nadditionally, lere said that the circumstances and spirit under which the debt was accumulated can color the impact it has on a couple. if a disproportionate amount of debt belongs to one person (whether it was accumulated before or during the relationship), it can lead to feelings of resentment if the repayment requires deep sacrifice of a partner.\n\npeopleimages via getty images money is rarely just about numbers, said psychologist joy lere. but it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker.\n\nthat's not to say that dealing with a massive amount of debt isn't stressful on its own. debt is a major burden that makes it difficult to spend on activities and shared goals as a couple. but when it comes to the relationship, it shouldn't be something that tears you apart unless there are other factors, such as communication and coping skills, that need some work, too.\n\nin my work with couples, i've found debt can negatively impact a relationship, but doesn't have to, said brent sweitzer, a marriage counselor in cumming, georgia. family therapist virginia satir famously said, 'problems are not the problem. it's the coping.' i see this truth play out daily in couple interactions and communications.\n\nafter all, higher levels of debt ― particularly student loan debt ― are becoming the norm for millennials entering relationships and starting families, according to sweitzer. what seems to make the difference for couples that are able to navigate it successfully and even get closer through managing debt is how they communicate about it, he said.\n\ncommunication is more than just talking\n\nwhen you get down to it, the root of most problems between couples is communication. if debt is placing undue stress on you or your partner and it's leading to conflict, there's a good chance that your communication about the problem needs some work ― or isn't happening at all.\n\nhowever, sweitzer points out that communication is much more than simply airing your grievances to each other. it's seeking to understand the other person and the many factors that shaped them, he said. for instance, how did the person with the debt get in that situation in the first place? what did they learn from childhood about managing money and the ethics of debt? did they learn to cope with emotional difficulties by spending, by depriving themself?\n\nif both people can seek to understand, they can both feel understood, sweitzer said. then debt could be a catalyst for connecting at a deeper level and uncovering solutions to problems that each person wouldn't have come up with on their own.\n\ndebt can make or break a relationship\n\nto say that debt is ever a blessing is probably a huge stretch. however, it can serve as a tool for helping couples learn how to work together.\n\nfor couples who are honest from the start, the debt might not be a big deal or it can even be something that strengthens the couple, rollo said. you can join forces to tackle the debt and really feel like you're on the same team, working toward a larger goal.\n\nhowever, if you struggle to see finances in the same way, or have different values when it comes to money, it can be helpful to work with a couples therapist. counseling can help each person learn how to express their needs, while also providing validation and empathy for their partner's needs and viewpoint, according to rollo. the way we view money can be such a personal thing … this is why it is important for each partner to really get to the root with empathy and respect, she said.
if you're anything like me, you've been waiting for something as entertaining as downton abbey to come out, holding out but little hope.\n\nalas, your tiny hope is not to be in vain! this friday marks the release of pride and prejudice and zombies, a rather wily take on the jane austen classic, adapted from the book of the same name. in this zany flick you get all the wit and wisdom of austen, and all the apocalyptic gore of zombies, in one awesome package. if you did have plans for this weekend, they're obviously all now going to be taking a backseat to seeing this movie.\n\nin honor of the original and the unmatched pride and prejudice as well as this refreshingly irreverent take on feminism and great literature, here are a few things we all can learn from p&p heroine elizabeth bennet -- the old and the new.\n\nliz bennet wouldn't have gotten married. she'd have been too busy slaying zombies.\n\nway too many people get married because they have very few other goals at a particular moment in time; it just seemed like the obvious next step. i think a good way to remedy this in modern life is to introduce a zombie apocalypse.\n\nif she did get married, liz bennet would have had a prenup.\n\nwhy? because she's a realist. prenups aren't just for ceos marrying supermodels, folks -- they're for everybody. much like that extra dagger she keeps tucked in her corset, liz bennet knows only chumps don't have backup.\n\nif she decided to get divorced, liz bennet would have kicked ass in court. and out of court.\n\nas is evident from the pages of the novel itself, liz bennet is no slouch when it comes to laying down the law. in short: don't mess with her. she'll end you.\n\nliz bennet would be an awesome co-parent.\n\nshe's able to keep her emotions in check under stress, she (usually) makes excellent judgments, and she knows how to work as part of a team -- this is what makes her great zombie-killing and co-parenting alike.\n\nliz bennet is okay with an imperfect reality.\n\nthis film is taking liz bennet's ability to adapt to a whole new level, making the most of her well-known tolerance for irritants -- whether they come in the form of zombies or men who don't know how to communicate their emotions properly.\n\nso life wasn't exactly what you had in mind. liz bennet would tell you, quite rightly, to get your s*** together and slay some zombies.\n\nso, what's your favorite liz bennet moment? did she perhaps even inspire you during a tough divorce? and most importantly, are you seeing this movie?\n\ntweet your responses to @nycdivorcelaw or leave me a comment on our firm's facebook page.\n\nrespectfully,\n\njames j. sexton
barcroft media via getty images pro-choice campaigners stage a demonstration on june 5. 2018, in parliament square in london demanding the british government decriminalizes abortion in northern ireland following the result of the referendum in the republic of ireland last month.\n\nireland just expanded the legal definition of domestic violence to include emotional and psychological abuse.\n\nas part of the country's domestic violence act 2018, which went into effect on new year's day, coercive control is now recognized as domestic violence and is punishable by up to five years in prison. the legislation defines coercive control as psychological abuse in an intimate relationship that causes fear of violence, or serious alarm or distress that has a substantial adverse impact on a person's day-to-day activities.\n\nthe new law makes ireland one of only a handful of countries that have set such a precedent. it's an important step in ireland, where one in five women experiences some form of emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse by an intimate partner in her lifetime, according to the irish anti-domestic violence organization women's aid.\n\nthe new law recognizes that the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship, ireland's minister for justice and equality, charlie flanagan, said in a statement on wednesday.\n\nthis new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he continued.\n\nthe domestic violence act 2018 also criminalizes forced marriage, allows restraining orders for couples who do not live together and restricts media coverage in cases of gender-based violence.\n\nwomen's aid director margaret martin said her organization will be closely monitoring the implementation of the legislation.\n\nfrom january 1, 2019, women must feel change quickly. it must be positive, it must be practical and it must make them and their children safer from abuse, she said in a tuesday statement.\n\nshe noted that budget constraints could hinder the law's effectiveness. what is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence, martin said. we are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence. cases of emotional abuse far exceeded reported cases of physical abuse in ireland in 2017, according to data obtained by women's aid. that year alone, there were 15,833 reports of domestic violence. of those, 10,281 were cases of emotional and psychological abuse, and 3,502 were cases of physical abuse. additionally, there were 1,443 reported cases of financial abuse and 607 reported cases of sexual abuse.
transportation secretary pete buttigieg credits the friendly skies for uniting him and his husband, chasten.\n\nappearing on late night with seth meyers this week, the former south bend, indiana, mayor shared select anecdotes about his nearly three-year marriage, including the reason he opted for a somewhat unlikely location ― chicago's o'hare international airport ― to pop the question in 2017.\n\ni know that not everybody understands that o'hare can be a romantic place, but it absolutely can, buttigieg said monday. the first time chasten and i ever communicated was on this app called hinge, and he was sitting at gate b5 at the airport. ... i always remembered that, in a certain technical sense, even though it was remotely, that was where we first met.\n\ntwo years after that initial 2015 exchange, the couple were visiting o'hare before embarking on a vacation, where buttigieg had planned to propose. and as it turns out, air travel turned out to be a fitting metaphor for their relationship.\n\ni told him [marriage] would be a lot like being in the airport, buttigieg recalled. life with me would be hard to steal private moments, but also full of adventure. luckily for me, he said yes.\n\nprior to his chat with meyers, buttigieg briefly alluded to his personal connection to o'hare in december, while accepting the nomination to serve as transportation secretary under president joe biden.\n\ntouting his personal love of transportation, he said: travel in my mind is synonymous with growth, with adventure, even love ― so much so that i proposed to my husband chasten in an airport terminal.\n\ndon't let anybody tell you that o'hare isn't romantic, he quipped.\n\nofficials at o'hare have taken notice of buttigieg's rare affection for the world's sixth-busiest airport. in december, the airport thanked the transportation secretary on twitter for appreciating all the connections we make possible, and pledged to work with him as we continue to make our airport lovable for decades to come.\n\nboth o'hare and united airlines commemorated the site of the buttigiegs' first meeting and subsequent engagement with heartwarming photos on social media.\n\nit was b5. proof that love actually is all around. 💙😊 https://t.co/9sioupjmkf pic.twitter.com/fvacl9ch4r — united airlines (@united) december 16, 2020\n\nmeanwhile, pete and chasten's love story will soon be making its way to the small screen. on monday, amazon studios announced plans to release mayor pete, a documentary directed by jesse moss that will examine buttigieg's 2020 campaign as the first openly gay presidential hopeful from a major party.\n\naccording to variety, mayor pete promises to go behind the scenes of buttigieg's historic victory in the iowa caucuses, and show him and chasten at their indiana home.
a woman who works for an aircraft company on the west coast happened to be looking outside her window recently when she thought: wouldn't it be funny to skywrite a giant message attacking donald trump?\n\nwhen that turned out to be too expensive, she ended up arranging two florida sky banners instead. they became part of a mini-flurry of anti-trump messages that hit the news after air restrictions were dropped over the former president's mar-a-lago golf resort, where he's now living.\n\na banner saying convict trump and lock him up flew over mar-a-lago on friday, and gop grow a spine and expel trump floated over the daytona international speedway during practice runs for sunday's daytona 500 race.\n\nthird attack banner trolls donald trump from the florida skies. https://t.co/7fn3ed5ldq via @huffpostpol — the progressive (@1progressivism) february 13, 2021\n\ncourtesy aerial messages in the air.\n\nclearly, they weren't exactly persuasive, and republican senators on saturday acquitted trump of incitement of insurrection for the storming of the capitol last month.\n\nit was expected yet infuriating, the woman who wanted to be identified as s told huffpost sunday. still, the banners were absolutely worth it, she added.\n\ns — whose identity was confirmed by the aerial company that flew the banners — asked huffpost not to use her name because she doesn't want to be harassed by trumpers.\n\nshe hadn't been politically active in the past, but 2020 really got me, and the pandemic took the cake, she said. i couldn't believe what i was seeing. when trump started talking about a third term and then started a chant at a rally of '12 more years,′ i thought: 'that's it. that's a dictator.'\n\nshe added: my parents immigrated from cuba in the 1960s. they know what a dictator looks like. trump and his supporters are authoritarian, completely offensive; they stand for what's completely contradictory to this country's ideals.\n\nwhen s reached out to daytona beach-based aerial messages, ceo remy colin was really enthusiastic, she said. he suggested she lengthen her original message because the price covers 45 characters. so i added the lock him up part because of what trump always said about hillary clinton, s said.\n\nwhile colin confirmed s arranged the latest banners, two earlier messages over mar-a-lago — trump you pathetic loser go back to moscow and trump worst president ever — were ordered by a guy, whom he declined to name.\n\nthe london times reported sunday that he's a physician who doesn't want his identity revealed because family members fear for their safety. nevertheless, he told the times: i want to show people that they can tell donald trump what they think of him — and that their emperor has no clothes.\n\ntrump is getting warm welcome from the skies near mar-a-lago today pic.twitter.com/s6uufx3t30 — daniel uhlfelder (@dwuhlfelderlaw) january 24, 2021\n\ncolin said aerial messages is the only company currently flying political banners because of the heated atmosphere in the u.s. the company does repeat advertisements for major companies, and personal messages (including marriage proposals), but also touts on its webpage: take your political message to the sky!\n\nhe emphasized that aerial messages is nonpartisan. the company flew several pro-trump banners in florida in the 2016 election paid for by chinese and russian entities, he noted. flying banners usually cost $950 an hour, which includes two to four flyovers, depending on the distance from an airport.\n\ncolin said he gets lots of calls and interest after a political banner appears in the news. people on twitter have responded to tweets about the banners offering to happily chip into a gofundme site for more anti-trump missives. others pitched in to help cover the cost of s's gop grow a spine message.\n\ncolin also gets complaints.\n\ni listen to what they have to say, then i explain that we do banners from both sides. one guy was telling me how irresponsible it was to inflame political attitudes with the anti-trump messages. i'm listening politely, but i'm thinking to myself, 'what the hell? your side just stormed the capitol.'
joaquin phoenix is having the last laugh — albeit a very maniacal one — at the golden globe awards.\n\nthe actor picked up the best actor in a drama trophy for his harrowing performance in joker at the 77th annual ceremony on sunday in perhaps the most competitive category of the evening.\n\nphoenix, who famously lost over 50 pounds to play the troubled arthur fleck/joker, beat out christian bale, another actor known for his on-screen transformations; antonio banderas; jonathan pryce; and adam driver of marriage story in an awards season dominated by male-centered movies.\n\nphoenix delivered an at times rambling, expletive-laden speech from the golden globes stage, first thanking the hollywood foreign press association for making the evening's meal entirely plant-based before paying tribute to his fellow nominees.\n\nwe all know there's no fucking competition between us ... i'm inspired by you. i'm your fucking student. i can't believe the beautiful, mesmerizing and unique work you've all done this year, he said. i really do feel honored to be mentioned with you.\n\ngeorge pimentel via getty images joaquin phoenix attends the 77th annual golden globe awards at the beverly hilton hotel on january 05, 2020 in beverly hills, california.\n\nhe then went onto apologize to joker director todd phillips for being such a pain in the ass.\n\ncontrary to popular belief i don't want to rock the boat, but the boat is fucking rocked, he continued, pivoting his speech to address everyone in the room.\n\ni've not always been a virtuous man. i'm learning so much and so many of you in this room have given me opportunities to try to get it right and i'm deeply grateful. but i think together, hopefully, we can be unified and actually make some changes. it's great to vote, but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves, phoenix continued, pointedly adding that his fellow actors don't need to be taking private jets to palm springs.\n\nthe film about the titular batman supervillain went on to gross over $1 billion worldwide, becoming the first r-rated film in history to do so.\n\nbut the road to box office glory was paved with much controversy, as some vocal critics have labeled the film dangerous and irresponsible over its empathy toward an angry white man who essentially becomes a self-radicalized domestic terrorist.\n\nphoenix, who took a method acting approach to his performance, has also raised some eyebrows with his behavior during production after a video of the actor cursing out a crew member for whispering in a scene made the rounds on the internet. he also reportedly clashed with co-star robert de niro during filming.\n\nthe famously press-averse actor hasn't been too keen on weighing in on the backlash, preferring to let the film speak for itself.\n\ni didn't imagine that it would be smooth sailing, phoenix told vanity fair about the polarizing response to the film. it's a difficult film. in some ways, it's good that people are having a strong reaction to it.\n\nthere's so many different ways of looking at it, he continued. you can either say here's somebody who, like everybody, needed to be heard and understood and to have a voice. or you can say this is somebody that disproportionately needs a large quantity of people to be fixated on him. his satisfaction comes as he stands in amongst the madness.\n\nthe late actor heath ledger posthumously won a golden globe for portraying the same character in 2008's the dark knight in the supporting actor category.\n\nphoenix has previously been nominated for globes five times over his career for films like her and gladiator, but has only taken home the award once before for his role in walk the line, which also scored him an oscar nod.
usa, new jersey, jersey city, portrait of young couple sitting on couch\n\nif your relationship is good, you shouldn't have to work on it, right?\n\nfairy tales promote the effortless happily-ever-after marriage myth when we are at an impressionable age. later we view romantic movies and read novels with happily-ever-after endings.\n\nconsequently, it's easy to develop unrealistic, fantasy-based expectations about marriage. many of us spend more time maintain a car -- checking tire pressure, changing the oil, and getting the recommended inspections, and son on -- than we spend on keeping our most important relationship in good working order.\n\nobviously, we humans are more complicated than cars. we have infinitely complex bodies to maintain. we also have feeling, different ways of thinking, different hopes and dreams. and then, when you put the two of us together...\n\nbenefits of weekly meetings\n\nholding a weekly marriage meeting takes a small investment of time each week and yields a great return: more intimacy, romance, and teamwork; and smoother resolution of the kinds of concerns likely to arise in any close relationship.\n\nsome people resist the idea of a formal meeting with their spouse. they think it sounds like work. why not just talk about things as they come up? talking on the fly sounds very nice, and that is fine if you are able to do this effectively.\n\nbut you might want to mention something when your partner is watching television, reading a book, or is otherwise occupied. you might be waiting for a right time that never comes. and if you do bring up a sensitive matter when it's the last thing your spouse is in the mood to discuss at the moment, you might feel like you have entered a minefield.\n\nsimilarly, your spouse may want to discuss a concern when you are busy. it is easy to take one's partner for granted, to forget to express appreciation. chores can pile up or not be handled well. you may forget to plan dates and other enjoyable activities. by scheduling a time for a marriage meeting, you will get to reconnect every week.\n\ncommunicating with intention\n\na wife who attended one of my marin county, california marriage meeting workshops, continued to hold weekly meetings with her husband. she reports: at first the process felt contrived, but after a few meetings we got used to the meeting's structure. i learned that it's much better to communicate with intention than to communicate without intention.\n\nweekly meetings foster direct, positive communication that addresses concerns at a time when both of you are likely to be receptive. you get to feel appreciated and valued, gain a smoother-running household by coordinating chores, and add romance by planning dates. issues are resolved and challenges are met before they escalate into crises and grudges. romance can continue throughout your marriage, but this usually will not happen automatically.\n\none small example of a benefit: when i'm home sometimes i wear a kerchief on my head that makes me feel like i look like a less than attractive peasant from the old country. so i was happily surprised when during the appreciation part of one of our weekly marriage meetings, my husband complimented me for looking cute wearing the kerchief. this gave me a warm feeling inside and an outward smile. we've been holding these meetings for twenty-seven years. i practice what i preach!\n\ninformation is power\n\nyou can learn just what you need to know how to hold effective marriage meetings before conducting one. guidelines, a simple agenda, and positive communication skills are explained in detail and step by step in my book, marriage meetings for lasting love: 30 minutes a week to the relationship you've always wanted. included are way to address the concern of how to convince a partner who's reluctant to hold a marriage meeting to give it a try anyway.
blake shelton woke up on the shadier side of the bed on thursday morning.\n\nthe country singer seemingly took a shot at ex-wife miranda lambert, who's been accused of beginning a relationship with her current boyfriend, turnpike troubadours frontman evan felker, while he was still married.\n\nbeen taking the high road for a long time.. i almost gave up, the voice coach wrote on twitter. but i can finally see something on the horizon up there!! wait!! could it be?! yep!! it's karma!!\n\nbeen taking the high road for a long time.. i almost gave up. but i can finally see something on the horizon up there!! wait!! could it be?! yep!! it's karma!! — blake shelton (@blakeshelton) april 25, 2018\n\nshelton went on to retweet a fan's response to the tweet with a lyric from girlfriend gwen stefani's song this is what the truth feels like.\n\nshelton and lambert, the country music world's former golden couple, announced their split in 2015 after four years of marriage and another six years together.\n\nwhile neither has commented on the reason for the divorce, rumors about lambert's infidelity have long swirled thanks to shelton's 2016 song she's got a way with words, which takes aim at a cheating ex.\n\nwhen we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, i was only six months removed from when all the crap went down, shelton told billboard about the inspiration behind his post-divorce album. when you have a broken heart — at least, when i do — you got to get it out of your system. you want people to sympathize with you. i was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.\n\nkevin winter via getty images miranda lambert and blake shelton arrive at a screening of nbc's the voice in 2013.\n\nmonths after the split, lambert found love with singer anderson east, whom she dated for two years. multiple outlets confirmed earlier this month that the two were no longer a couple.\n\nin january, she invited felker's band to join her on her livin' like hippies tour. at the time, the frontman was reportedly still married to wife staci nelson, who later filed for divorce in february, according to people. reports claim that lambert and felker's romance began while they were both still in relationships.\n\nstaci found out that he had filed for divorce because a friend called her after seeing it in a local newspaper, a source told e! news. staci wasn't even served with divorce papers so she filed her divorce papers a couple weeks after finding out that evan filed. he never communicated that to her.\n\nthe tin man singer seemingly made mention of her recent relationship struggles in an acm awards speech earlier this month as she accepted the trophy for female vocalist of the year.\n\nthank you guys so much for sharing my broken heart with me, she said onstage.\n\njason merritt/acma2018 via getty images blake shelton and gwen stefani attend the 53rd academy of country music awards.\n\nshelton, meanwhile, has been dating stefani for nearly three years after the fellow voice judges bonded over mutual heartbreak. in 2015, the former no doubt singer was also going through a divorce from her husband of nearly 13 years, gavin rossdale, who reportedly cheated on her with the family's nanny.\n\n″[i]t it was like being handed this gift of a friend who was going through the exact same thing at the exact same time, stefani told vanity fair in 2016.\n\ngwen saved my life, shelton later explained. who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? you can't even imagine the similarities in our divorces.
i wear my red kabbalah string. i wear a gold good luck piece around my neck.\n\nof the two lucky items, my red kabbalah string is far more significant in its meaning. i do believe at times good luck knocks on our doors... a chance happening, a force, causes good things to appear.\n\ni believe, in 99% of instances, you and i must make our own good luck.\n\nnevertheless, i continue to wear my red string and my gold charm around my neck. my red kabbalah string is truly comforting; guards and protects me (in my mind) and reminds me to always 'be aware' of the force of luck lurking around my corner. it makes me listen to my inner feelings.\n\nmy gold charm is lovely to look at with its many lucky charms embedded into its circular disc. a four leaf clover, an elephant, a horseshoe, an evil eye, the arabic good luck sign, a heart and a number 13. i don't feel strongly about it but i figure, every bit of luck helps. i am very attached to a tiny gold chai (meaning long life in hebrew) hanging on the same connecter, a gift from my brother, scott, brought back from jerusalem. my good luck pieces feed my spirit. they do not bring me luck.\n\npeople, circumstances my attitude and my brain bring me luck. and dear readers, people and circumstances and your attitude and brains do the same for you.\n\nat this passage in our lives, we have to keep our eyes, ears and minds open to the suggestions and advice of others for some will shed information that will impact our lives and bring us good fortune. that is, if we listen and act. the source does not have to be a person we know well or a person at all. it can be an article we read or a speaker we hear or even a visual we see.\n\none of my close friends, tova, said to me a few weeks ago, it is not what you know, it is who you know. she was referring to medical situations. who you know, not what you know, dear readers, may save your life and bring you luck, a long life. use your brains.\n\nwe are informed by doctors we should have a yearly mammogram, a once a year body skin check with our dermatologist, a yearly physical and a routine chest x-ray. you initiate your own luck by being proactive. your life is in your hands. use your brains.\n\nlistening to others and being proactive has saved my life more than a few times. did i look at my red string, the charm around my neck and ask god to bless me. i sure did. but it was my brains that thrust me into my luck, not my good luck pieces.\n\non the issue of dating for those of you widowed or divorced or never married... you are your own good luck charm. don't turn down a date. you may meet someone other than your blah date that evening. keep yourself fit, informed and spirited and most importantly...be a good picker. don't rush. it is the most important decision you will make in your life. use your brains.\n\na wonderful land or cruise vacation is not guaranteed by luck. you have to do your research. i suggest not using some travel agent behind a computer who has probably traveled less than you. ask traveled friends for the name of their travel agent. if you enjoy the same type of travel ask friends or acquaintances, you respect, for restaurant and hotel suggestions. my southern friend, norma jean, taught me how to persuade the clerk, in every hotel, how to get 'a room with a view.' we are never too old to ask and never too old to learn, dear readers. just use your brains.\n\nwe all love our good luck pieces, as we should. but we must be frank with ourselves: we cannot wait for good things to happen to us. i do believe, as stated above, we make our own good luck.\n\ni am quite certain you have looked at another person and said to yourself, she is so lucky. well maybe she is but so can you be lucky because i think we all get a chance to get lucky in life.\n\nmy tips:\n\n1. feel more than you think. listen to your inner voice, your intuition.\n\n2. venture out. meet and greet. who knows who you may meet?\n\n3. focus. work on friendships, happy marriage, and close relationships with children.\n\n4. try. try things. let your energy flow. be open to possibilities.\n\n5. trust. trust people. listen and learn and then act.\n\n6. belief. believe in yourself. your inner strength, your resiliency.\n\n7. curiosity. be curious about everything. be an explorer.\n\n8. proactive. stay healthy by being proactive.\n\n9. optimism. optimistic people create a lot of good luck. people who feel they are lucky actually are lucky. shoot for the moon.\n\n10. gratitude. last but not least a lucky woman is a grateful woman. our life is not a rite, it is a gift.\n\ndear readers of mine, we will all continue to wear or carry are good luck objects. they are our comfort, like crossing our fingers when we need luck or praying please dear god let all be well in our family. we all want a little bloomin' luck.' so wear your good luck pieces but when glancing at them, think about your lifestyle and how 'you' can add another dimension of luck to your life.
rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii) dropped out of the 2020 democratic presidential primary race on thursday and offered her full support to former vice president joe biden in his bid for the white house.\n\ngabbard's announcement comes as the coronavirus pandemic drastically changes the presidential race and other 2020 campaigns. the leading democratic candidates — biden and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) — have been forced to suspend typical campaign fixtures such as rallies and door-to-door campaigning as cases of the disease have been reported in all 50 states.\n\nbut gabbard lagged behind much of the crowded 2020 field in polling over the past year, failing to win even 1% of the vote in iowa or new hampshire, the first two states to hold primaries.\n\nshe had a meager showing on super tuesday, the most important day of the democratic primary race. her most successful contest was in american samoa, an unincorporated u.s. territory where she was born.\n\nwith roughly 29% of the support, she finished a distant second in the territory's caucuses, behind former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, who garnered about 50%. bloomberg ended his presidential bid a day later.\n\ngabbard exited the race having only won two delegates.\n\nas the first female combat veteran ever to run for president and the first american samoan member of congress, she was neither a traditional democrat nor a traditional candidate.\n\nthe hawaii representative was the only member of the house to vote present on the two articles of impeachment during the december vote to impeach president donald trump. she later explained that she could not in good conscience vote either yes or no on the two articles.\n\nin the days after the historic vote, former hawaii gov. neil abercrombie urged gabbard to resign her congressional seat. abercrombie, a democrat who served nine terms in the house from 1993 to 2010, expressed concerns that gabbard had been unable to juggle her responsibilities as a member of congress and her presidential campaigning.\n\nabercrombie pointed to gabbard's present votes and frequent absences from the hill as examples of this imbalance.\n\ngabbard also clashed with hillary clinton shortly before a democratic primary debate in november. the former secretary of state suggested the congresswoman was being groomed by russia. in response, gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against clinton, alleging the 2016 democratic presidential nominee lied about gabbard with obvious malicious intent to hurt her 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nduring the november debate, democrats piled on gabbard over her support for nationalist and authoritarian foreign leaders, including egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi and syrian dictator bashar al-assad, as well as her close ties to fox news, trump's favored news network.\n\nmichael wyke/associated press rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii) answers questions at a she the people presidential forum at texas state university in april.\n\ngabbard did two tours of duty in the middle east and is currently a major in the national guard. she went on to serve on the foreign affairs committee and the armed services committee for over six years. gabbard was also the vice chair of the democratic national committee until 2016, when she resigned in order to endorse sanders' presidential campaign.\n\nshe said she endorsed sanders at the time because he supported ending unnecessary wars.\n\nthere is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, gabbard said on cnn when she announced her run for office in january.\n\nin 2018, gabbard introduced the no more presidential wars act, a resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from congress in order to engage the military against any enemy. she also introduced a resolution that would make a presidential war an impeachable offense.\n\nthe last time congress officially declared war was dec. 8, 1941, the day that the united states entered world war ii, she said at a news conference. ever since, congress has failed to uphold this constitutional responsibility and has ceded this power to the president ― presidents of both parties.\n\ngabbard, who has spoken out against interventionist wars in the past, was heavily criticized for a 2017 meeting with assad on what her office called a fact-finding mission. she said had not initially planned to speak with assad but when the opportunity arose to meet with him, i did so, because of the possibility of achieving peace, gabbard told cnn's jake tapper in 2017.\n\nassad was accused by the united states and its allies of using chemical weapons to attack civilians during syria's civil war. gabbard, however, said she didn't think there was enough evidence to hold assad responsible then and still doesn't now.\n\ni think that the evidence needs to be gathered, and, as i have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such, gabbard said at a cnn town hall in march.\n\nshe also came under fire for her former anti-lgbtq views. gabbard worked with her father at the alliance for traditional marriage, a political action committee aimed at opposing lawmakers and legislation that promoted gay rights.\n\nhowever, gabbard reversed her public position on lgbtq rights.\n\nshe said she regretted the views she previously held and noted her recent support of lgbtq legislation. i'm grateful for those in the lgbtq+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey, she said in january.\n\ngabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.\n\nshe supported transitioning to 100% renewable energy. she wanted to get rid of tuition and fees at four-year public universities, and she supported free community college for everyone. she also advocated for raising the federal minimum wage to $15.\n\nthere are a lot of challenges that are facing the american people that i'm concerned about and that i want to help solve, she told cnn.\n\ndominique mosbergen, hayley miller and liza hearon contributed

valentine's day - also known as saint valentine's day - began as a liturgical celebration. it has since morphed into an almost worldwide celebration of love. what should divorcees do to increase their chances of finding love again? as a mediator, who deals primarily with divorce and family conflict, i have a few suggestions on how to find love after divorce.\n\n1. forgive yourself (and your ex)\n\nmany of my clients harbor an enormous amount of guilt for their failed marriage. let go of guilt. william pinsof (president of the family institute at northwestern university) reported in the death of till death do us part: the transformation of pair-bonding in the 20th century, that, for the first time in the human history, divorce has replaced death as the most common endpoint of marriage. this unprecedented shift in patterns of human coupling and uncoupling requires a new paradigm, that is, a more humane approach for social policy, family law and marital therapy. (remember gwyneth paltrow and chris martin consciously uncoupling). by seeking a more humane approach to navigating your divorce and post-divorce life, it's easier to forgive yourself and your ex.\n\n2. love yourself (and your ex)\n\nstrive for agape, the unconditional love despite flaws and demonstrated by your behavior towards another person. love yourself and your ex for what you once had - the good and the bad. when conflict arises, take the high road. if you divorce with dignity, it's much easier to love yourself throughout the process.\n\n3. embrace yourself\n\nembrace the opportunity to reinvent yourself and your love life. i encourage my clients to leave their history in the past where it belongs. it best to use the past to help craft a better future. be present and choose behaviors today that will positively impact your tomorrows. separate the person from the problem. recognize that we are all innately good and prone to make bad choices. recognize and capitalize on the good choices you make while realizing and mitigating the bad choices you make.\n\n4. refresh yourself
when my wife and i got married i knew there would be some things i would be giving up. most men worry about never sleeping with another woman again or not having the freedom to go out with the guys. i'll grant you that the first absolutely applies. the second? not necessarily.\n\nin a truly amazing marriage the most challenging things for guys to give up have nothing to do with surface stuff. you may even get to do more guy type things. in fact i've done jumping over fire and swimming through mud that was five feet deep...with my wife right by my side.\n\nbut here are three things i sacrificed for an amazing marriage. if you're a man you'll likely want to do the same.\n\n1. pride\n\neven though i grew up in a broken home my parents gave me one very important characteristic. they repeatedly told me i could accomplish anything i put my mind to. i loved it and reveled in how much they believed in me.\n\nbut there was a downside. i came to a point where i was sure i knew more than anyone else. in my mind no one was as intelligent as me and i was not terribly shy about sharing my knowledge. when my future wife and i were dating this side of my personality showed up. repeatedly. but she knew exactly how to handle it. she simply broke up with me. seven times! every time i got out of line she dropped me. it was some pretty hard core training, but i eventually learned.\n\nif you are going to have an amazing marriage then you'll need to let go of your male pride.\n\n2. selfishness\n\nfor a period of time i was an astronomy professor at a university and also took students on field trips to check out regional geological phenomena. as a professor i was respected and people generally followed my lead. i soon became accustomed to having whatever i wanted and however i wanted it. in short i pretty much always got my way. this is what men like.\n\nonce when preparing to leave for yet another field trip my wife came to me in tears. our time together had been dwindling and her heart was breaking. she asked me not to leave. i so very much wanted to go on this particular trip. but i didn't fight or argue. given the option of seeing and studying beautiful rock formations vs loving and caring for my beautiful wife i chose the latter.\n\nliving in an amazing marriage means giving up the male desire to always have my own way.\n\n\n\n3. control\n\njust before our 10th wedding anniversary we were in desperate need to find a new place to live. the house we rented was being donated to a local non-profit and part of the deal was we must vacate the premises. we spent a significant amount of time searching for a new place in the local area.\n\neventually we came across what appeared to be a perfect home. closer to my work, fair rental price and owned by a sweet christian woman. the day came to sign the lease. i was a man on a mission headed to seal the deal. but out of the blue my wife called and told me this just doesn't feel right.\n\nremember we had to get out of our current home soon and we had searched and searched until we found just the right place. my male need to be in control wanted to just brush her off for having unnecessary anxiety. but we are people of faith and i trusted her intuition in spiritual matters. so i called off the deal. she was right. not long after i received an offer for a better paying job that required moving out of that area. had i not listened to her we would have been locked into a 12 month lease.\n\nto have an amazing marriage sometimes you need to give up your manly need to be in control and trust your wife.\n\n\n\nyou may think from these stories that i'm a pushover and never have anything i desire. my friend, nothing could be further from the truth. i live in a home filled with joy and have a wife who always looks forward to spending time together. she loves me dearly and does whatever she can to give me the things i want.\n\ni didn't really sacrifice anything to have an amazing marriage. everything i let go has been repaid back many times over the years in terms of peace, harmony and love. what did i give up? strife, anger, pain and suffering. what did i gain? a marriage beyond anything i could have ever imagined.\n\nthis post first appeared on the good men project.
level17 via getty images\n\noffice romances may be an hr nightmare, but they happen nonetheless.\n\nin a 2017 careerbuilder survey, 41 percent of workers 'fessed up to dating a co-worker, and 30 percent of those relationships led to marriage. regardless of how common it is, asking your work crush out on a date requires a lot of tact, especially with all the workplace sexual harassment scandals that have unfolded over the last year.\n\nhow do you go about it without being a creep? below, human resources and dating experts share six things to keep in mind before asking someone out at work.\n\n1. check what hr policies are in place.\n\nyour workplace is just that: a workplace, not a bar or a dating app for download. none of the hr experts we spoke to encouraged actively looking for love at the office, but they acknowledged it happens. and while it's less common for businesses to enforce or even have a non-fraternization policy, it's still important to determine if your company has one, said teresa marzolph, founder of culture engineered, a human capital consulting firm in phoenix.\n\nthe few policies still in existence often focus on relationships that put the company as risk, such as a romantic relationship between a manager and their employee, or one that runs contrary to the checks and balances that exist within the company ― like quality assurance and customer service or finance and sales, marzolph told huffpost.\n\nif no guidelines exist, marzolph recommends gauging the workplace culture around you: have you heard of other office relationships developing in the past? does the company encourage after-hours camaraderie among the staff?\n\na company that sponsors or hosts non-work events and activities may be an example of a culture that's much more tolerant or even supportive of relationships in the workplace, marzolph said.\n\n2. be friends first.\n\navoid going from zero to 100 by establishing a friendship first, said lynn taylor, a workplace expert and author of tame your terrible office tyrant: how to manage childish boss behavior & thrive in your job. this way, you'll find out early on whether you have anything in common besides mutual disgust of your boss' tupperware lunches.\n\nestablish a foundation and find out if you're compatible, personality-wise, taylor said. then, take cues. gauge your next actions off the responses you generally receive from the person.\n\n3. suggest getting coffee.\n\ntake some of the stress out of the situation by suggesting a casual location for your date, said neely steinberg, a dating coach and image consultant.\n\ncoffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? steinberg said. plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' if you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.\n\n4. when you do ask, don't make it weird.\n\nin the 12 years marzolph has worked in human resources, sexual harassment complaints have almost always been about how someone went about asking, not the fact that they had asked.\n\nthe common theme is that the interaction left one person feeling uncomfortable, she told us. whether intended or not, most filing a claim or complaint describe the pursuing employee's approach as awkward or inappropriate.\n\nto avoid becoming an office-wide pariah, be mindful of your surroundings and your body language when floating the idea of a date, marzolph said.\n\ndon't come on too strong or corner the person, and ideally, approach them outside of work or in the communal area, marzolph said. try to keep your approach light; be ready to give the person an easy out if they're not interested, so you both can continue working together without tension.\n\n5. if they say 'no,' maintain professionalism throughout the experience.\n\ndon't take it personally if your crush is just not that into you, taylor said.\n\nif the person declines, remember that this is a risky proposition, she explained. your co-worker might have otherwise said 'yes' if you hadn't met at work. many are averse to dating co-workers as a personal policy.\n\n6. if they say 'yes,' still maintain professionalism throughout the experience.\n\nfrom the beginning, recognize that this is an imperfect dating situation. asking a colleague out isn't simply about two people getting together ― it almost always complicates the workplace dynamic, said s. chris edmonds, a human resources expert and founder of the purposeful culture group.\n\nluckily, some work relationships work out great, edmonds said. i met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. you just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. pda or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.\n\nwhatever happens, edmonds recommends keeping your personal policy on interoffice romances as simple as possible.
some audience members at this year's annual national prayer breakfast in washington likely did a double take when president donald trump hailed people of faith for their abolition of civil rights.\n\nsince the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith, trump declared in his speech thursday.\n\ntrump credited people of faith with the 'abolition of civil rights'??? pic.twitter.com/lo7ekcuus8 — nowthis (@nowthisnews) february 8, 2019\n\nthat's probably not exactly how the president intended to put it.\n\nno matter, because some gleeful twitter users enjoyed another opportunity to chortle at an apparent trump gaffe. amid the religious right's efforts to limit such rights as abortion access and same-sex marriage, others concluded that the president may have seen the light.\n\nhe would be correct. they are leading the abolition of civil rights today. https://t.co/lmqomeb5xj — rep. poncho nevárez (@poncho_nevarez) february 7, 2019\n\nso now he decides to be honest. finally! — james shoff (@jamescshoff) february 8, 2019\n\nsomeone needs to educate trump - preferably someone like betsy ross and not @betsydevosed — fred lin (@fredofca) february 8, 2019\n\ntrump finally said something honest at the national prayer breakfast.\n\n\n\nwhen you've got kids in cages and refuse asylum seekers who are already in the country, abolition of civil rights pretty much covers it. #thursdaymotivation #thursdaythoughtspic.twitter.com/9qj1dg4haj — holly figueroa o'reilly (@aynrandpaulryan) february 7, 2019\n\nthey celebrate it in russia — orient expresso (@orient_expresso) february 8, 2019\n\nscary thing is he might secretly be telling the truth 😳 — carlitosafc (@carlitosafc) february 8, 2019\n\nwishful thinking on his part. surpised he didn't include from enslavement of anyone on medicaid, food stamps, in public housing, or any other type of public assistance — dennis hicks (@realdennishicks) february 8, 2019\n\nlet me guess..and the audience applauded? who's in the audience again? — jeffersonr (@rrondo0891) february 8, 2019\n\n@realdonaldtrump finally admits he wants to take away everyone's civil rights as directed by @franklin_graham and other #fakechristians #fakeevangelicals. — mhp_1776 (@mhp_1776) february 8, 2019\n\nha ha ha ha ha h trump told you truth by mistake pic.twitter.com/qjzq3qknuf — chillin the most.

shotshare via getty images i'm not the same person i was before i took my job at the grocery store.\n\nwhen i spent $100,000 earning two degrees, i never imagined i'd end up working as a cashier at my local grocery store but i needed the job.\n\na year earlier, i'd left my corporate marketing job. while working there, it seemed as if i was working to pay for child care and little else. i also struggled to be there for my kids' sick days and school events. but my year off had nearly broken our family financially, and i needed to return to work.\n\ni needed to find a job that i could do at night once my husband came home. that way we'd eliminate our child care costs entirely and i would still bring in some extra money to help ease our other financial burdens. that's what i was offered by a grocery store located in the affluent town we could barely afford to live in.\n\nthe store hired me the same day i applied, and a week later, i began working as a night cashier. simple, i thought as the training supervisor showed me how to greet customers, find produce codes and ring items.\n\nbut it wasn't.\n\ntwo weeks after i started, the shift supervisor came over.\n\nhey, your ring times are a little bit low but we're going to get them up, he said, pausing before adding, but you're great with the customers.\n\nhe was trying to be kind, but i was mortified. the idea of being corrected by a 19-year-old kid i was old enough to have mothered stung. i managed to convince myself that ring times didn't matter and then i cried the whole drive home.\n\nnicole? i heard a customer say at the beginning of my next shift. the tan woman placed her groceries on the black belt, a mix of party goods ― drinks, paper plates and snack foods.\n\ni didn't know you worked here, she continued.\n\nshe did know because i'd mentioned it the last time i dropped my son off at school. maybe she'd forgotten.\n\nwhat a great way to get out of the house and away from the kids for a bit, she said.\n\ni remember that day i'd pushed a couple of coupons i intended to use under a bag of rice, hiding them, when i saw this woman approach. i hated that i had moved to the other side of the register and was now serving her.\n\nmonths before, we'd greeted each other in the checkout line as we discussed a school fundraiser she was organizing. she didn't need to work. her family appeared to live well as a single-income family. i remember that day i'd pushed a couple of coupons i intended to use under a bag of rice, hiding them, when i saw this woman approach. i hated that i had moved to the other side of the register and was now serving her.\n\ni stopped listening to what she was saying and instead focused on ringing up her purchases, while i listened for the beeps. i didn't want to double-scan any items or go too slowly. i could be friendly or i could be conscientious ― i wasn't capable of both. this, i realized, was the reason for my slow ring times, so i'd have to give the customer less of me and give the scanner more. i couldn't believe how awful i was at this.\n\nwell, she said, i guess i'll see you at drop-off.\n\ni waved without explaining that this job was not a way to escape my kids, but a necessity. it allowed me to work nights and make money i desperately needed to pay bills. like many of the affluent customers we served, i don't think she could understand.\n\nas the next few weeks went by, i did my best to bring up my ring times and even tried to memorize some of the produce codes. my co-workers helped, including the young supervisor. but i still found myself hiding when mothers i knew walked by. while i couldn't shut my light off and pretend my lane was closed, i did other things.\n\ncan i run to the ladies' room? i'd ask the supervisor on duty. i tried to flag down another shopper so they'd get into my line before the lawyer mother i knew who had just returned from a weekend of skiing did. i didn't want to ring up her organic dragon fruit or imported cheese.\n\nif all else failed, i'd offer to wipe down the registers or handle returning items to the shelves, which, of course, was also risky. there was always the possibility of running into someone i knew in the aisles. then i would be forced to listen as they droned on about their latest vacation, or worse, asked me where something was. i'd have to admit i often didn't know because i worked at the front of the store instead of in the center.\n\ni'm a writer, i told a random man one day, though he never asked. he was purchasing an expensive bottle of liquor. please don't put the bread on the bottom of the bag, he said and returned to his phone call. he never looked at me, not once, throughout the entire transaction.\n\ni was capable of more than ringing and bagging his groceries, i wanted to shout, hopefully jarring him from a call too important to allow him to acknowledge a fellow human being ― me. instead, i looked at my growing line and thought of my ring times. i'd just have to make the next customer understand: i was not just a cashier. this was not a real job for me. i pushed the button to move their items down the belt and allowed myself to get lost in the hum of the store.\n\ncourtesy of nicole johnson the name tag nicole johnson wore while working at a grocery store.\n\ni worked mostly nights and sundays. sundays were the worst because they were the hardest days to hide. it seemed like every family i knew shopped after church or their kid's sporting events. and it was on a sunday that i broke down.\n\nit was not a grand display of wailing and moaning. instead, i cried silently as i pushed the metal carts. i slid one into another, creating a chain that i jammed into the nearest corral while weaving in between customers and cars. it was mother's day and i'd forgotten to put in for the day off. people rushed past me in their cars, the rain lifting off the pavement and soaking the day-glo vest i was forced to wear whenever i did cart duty. how the hell did i wind up here, i asked myself as i wiped at the tears i tried to pass off as rain on my face.\n\nas i stood in the parking lot, soaking wet, i was finally able to admit what i'd tried so hard to hide ― both from others and myself: i was embarrassed by my job. a job that was supposed to be a bump in the road for me. i was 40 years old and had a family at home. after spending thousands of dollars earning my degrees, i never imagined i'd end up pushing carts in the pouring rain. i shopped at this store ― i wasn't supposed to work here! i took my vest off and headed inside.\n\nyou ok? one of my co-workers asked. she had worked her entire career in the store and could tell that i wasn't remotely ok. don't let the customers get to you, she said, placing an arm around my shoulder and leading me toward the break room. there's free pizza and salad today. you look like you could use some.\n\nthese were the people that i worked with. they brought me bags of their leftover school supplies for my kids. they offered me advice on marriage and parenting. they shared my love of horror movies. and it killed me to realize that the whole time, while i tried to profess my merits to customers who judged me, i had judged my co-workers.\n\nyou, boy ― bag my groceries like this, the woman said to the bagger i was working with at my register. hasn't anybody taught you anything? she asked while sighing loudly to the surrounding customers.\n\ni was appalled. i wanted to tell her that the particular man she was belittling had escaped a war-torn nation to come here for new opportunities. she was looking down on him and it wasn't right.\n\nso many of our customers did this without knowing whom they were talking to. and as i handed her the receipt without meeting her eyes, it hurt me to know that i was once one of them. no, i never belittled them or acted rudely, but i did think i was better than them. maybe it was the education or the house in the affluent town, the one i could barely afford.\n\nthese people offered their service every single day to so many people who judged them unfairly, who judged them based on their titles of cashier and bagger without seeing who they were ― working single mothers, kind-hearted retirees, teenagers saving for college, middle-aged college grads down on their luck. the people who served us our food, rang up our groceries and made it possible for us to do what we needed to every single day aren't so different from us. they were more similar than i ever knew. i was just too wrapped up in myself and my own privilege to ever realize it ― until i became one of them.\n\nas i stood in the parking lot, soaking wet, i was finally able to admit what i'd tried so hard to hide ― both from others and myself: i was embarrassed by my job.\n\ni remained employed at the store for three years and only left because i eventually took a job in a local school working in special education. recently, i popped in to pick up some groceries and saw an old manager.\n\ni miss working with you, she said as she organized a display. i miss you too, i told her. and i meant it.\n\ni'm not the same person i was before i took my job at the grocery store. i now know what it's like to be on both sides of the register and i understand how hard that job ― and facing all of the judgments and misconceptions that come with it ― truly is, and it changed me. and i hope that no matter where i'm working or what i'm doing, i'll remember what i've learned from that experience and all of the incredible people who shared so many of their days and nights and stories with me so i can continue growing and approaching and understanding the world in new ways.\n\nnicole johnson is a freelance writer whose work has been featured on the washington post, redbook, parents, ms., scary mommy, your teen for parents, yahoo, msn and vox curbed. she is the creator of suburban sh*t show, a site where she discusses the real and raw truths of motherhood, midlife, childhood dysfunction and marriage. nicole is also a fiction writer and mother of four.\n\ndo you have a personal story you'd like to see published on huffpost?

six months after acquiring whole foods, amazon (amzn) is working on reorganizing whole foods shelves by first adding amazon private label products and, soon, it may add popular consumer packaged goods like coca-cola. behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, yahoo finance has learned.\n\nwhen asked if whole foods will add consumer packaged goods like coca-cola, whole foods spokesperson brooke buchanan said, as you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don't meet those quality standards. if there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there's always that consideration. amazon declined to comment.\n\nin june, whole foods ceo john mackey called the marriage with amazon, love at first sight. and the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; amazon echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on whole foods products for prime members.\n\nbut the honeymoon may be over as amazon and whole foods butt heads over what to stock store shelves with. would adding coke sacrifice the healthy, organic image whole foods has long held dear?\n\nlucy nicholson / reuters boxes of coca-cola are seen at a grocery store in los angeles, california on november 21, 2017. (reuters/lucy nicholson)\n\nadding coke would signal greater changes\n\nwhole foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats, according to its website. that rules out coca-cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version.\n\namazon's plan to change whole foods' shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant's initiative to make whole foods profitable. whole foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by amazon. after amazon's takeover, whole foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier — the biggest in two years.\n\nwhile whole foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like walmart and costco have started to sell more organic produce. whole foods owns just a 4% share in the total u.s. grocery market, a far cry from walmart's 25% and kroger's 10%, according to a susquehanna analyst note last june.\n\nthen amazon came. as a consumer-centric company, amazon is leveraging whole foods to satisfy customer needs. that has become more urgent after amazon provides free delivery of whole foods groceries for prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like coca-cola and pepsico snacks.\n\nwhole foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can't scale and be profitable, says brittain ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant. amazon doesn't want to maintain the status quo. they can't see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in whole foods.\n\nlindsey wasson / reuters amazon founder and ceo jeff bezos laughs as he talks to the media while touring the new amazon spheres during the grand opening at amazon's seattle headquarters in seattle, washington on january 29, 2018. (reuters/lindsey wasson)\n\nwhole foods resistance\n\namazon could add private label products as soon as march, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from whole foods, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nif that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers, a longtime whole foods store employee in austin told yahoo finance. that's what makes whole foods market different from our competitors.\n\nbut food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the whole foods. last year, bloomberg reported pepsico's frito-lay developed organic doritos marketed under the name simply, which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in whole foods. industry experts said whole foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base.\n\nit's painful, but whole foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone, neil saunders, managing director of globaldata retail told yahoo finance. there are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and amazon is helping whole foods in that direction.\n\ndo you think whole foods should carry more consumer packaged goods? write to krystal hu via krystalh@oath.com or follow her on twitter\n\nread more:
so, you're 23 and rocking it.\n\nor you've just had your 26th birthday, and feeling adulthood hit you hard.\n\nyou're excited about getting married soon.\n\nor you're single and loving life... or single and wishing you had a husband.\n\ni have been through all of it, and i'm currently just a little bit past it, but not too far ahead. the 20s are a very formative decade, and come with so many changes it's hard to keep your head on straight sometimes. after i got married at age 26, i began to settle in and adjust to my new life, and realized there were a lot of things no one ever told me about this specific time. while it is different for everyone, just between us girls, here are several things i wish someone would have told me about that would have been extremely helpful in navigating this season:\n\nthe false positive pregnancy tests:\n\nthis was one of the most emotionally exhausting experiences of my life. while i was aware that home pregnancy tests always need to be confirmed by a doctor, i really didn't realize that false positives were very much of a possibility. the instructions even say that false negatives are more likely than false positives, and that both are extremely rare. the over 99 percent accuracy that is advertised on all hpts leads one believe that they are trustworthy. imagine the toll on my emotions when, after taking a test one day, i peeled back the shower curtain to discover a little blue plus sign. shock, excitement, fear, anxiety, and general head-spinning were in order. i stared at the test for a good five minutes before bringing it outside, taking a few pictures in different lighting to make sure it wasn't all in my head, all in between a pounding heartbeat and clasping my hand over my mouth and wondering how in the world i was going to tell my husband. would he be worried since this was before we had decided to get pregnant? how would we pay for all of this? how would i continue working during the dreaded vomiting of the first trimester? i immediately ran out to the store and picked up different brands of tests to confirm. i waited until the next morning to test again, only to be greeted by only one pink line, not two. the test was negative. how can i possibly explain the confusion that washed over me after a night of extreme emotional ups and downs? i could barely concentrate at work, and ended up asking my boss if i could leave early to go to the doctor. was i pregnant or not? needless to say, i really wish someone would have told me about false positives, and how they are apparently more common than we are all lead to believe. this entire experience caused a very unnecessary roller coaster of emotions that, when paired with an already hormonal time of the month, absolutely wore me out.\n\nthe changing cycle:\n\nthe above leads me to the reason for the pregnancy test in the first place. i really had no idea how much my cycle would change after getting married. it was very difficult to adapt. i'm sure it has to do partly with getting older and into my upper twenties, but i know marriage plays a role as well. my cycles had been like clockwork since the very beginning. from age 12, i always knew exactly when to expect their arrival, and never once were they missed or late. i do not exaggerate when i say i never missed a period, even during my early twenties when i was constantly traveling, changing time zones, and alternating my sleep schedules from day-shift to night-shift and then back again. the thing was a rock that wouldn't budge. fast forward to my life as a new wife, and pair that with turning 26, and you get a recipe for disaster. well, not really disaster. maybe just extreme stress. several times during my first year of marriage, my period was late. not just a few days. late, as in 2 weeks, sometimes 3. what do you think this resulted in? me rushing out for pregnancy tests. oh my gosh, why is it so late? it's never late! i've got to be pregnant! nope, not pregnant. just late. this left me very frustrated. not only did this change occur, i also noticed changes with symptoms, intensity, and other variables. it seemed to be becoming a lot more sensitive to things such as exercise, sickness, and general life, whereas before, the thing did not falter during times of extreme physical, mental and emotional changes. i thought, now is not the time for my periods to become irregular - they've had nearly 15 years to be irregular. now is the time to be consistent and trustworthy, so i can properly carry out married life without the stress of trying to prevent pregnancy or become pregnant. sadly, this was not the case. after visiting my doctor, i received the wisdom that i wish i would have received before this started happening. there is absolutely nothing wrong with you. you are very healthy. you are older now, so your body is changing. this is is your new normal. as frustrating as this was, i was comforted by this being my new normal. i just so wish i would have been told to expect my cycle to change, as this would have saved so much unnecessary stress.\n\nthe body image wrestle and win. while the age at which this occurs is different for all of us, there comes a time in every woman's life where she decides that she is going to love her body. i am lucky that this age for me came early on in my life. of course i have wrestled with certain things i don't like about my appearance, and things i wish i could change, as we all have. but i have been blessed with people in my life who encourage me in this area, most especially my husband. i think the wrestle ended before we even got married. what really drove it home was coming to the place where i knew that god created me this way, just how he wanted me to be, no more and no less. he wanted every detail about my appearance to be there. once i accepted this, i was awestruck by the truth of it. thinking of who wanted me to be this way, blew my mind. i can honestly say that i don't struggle with my body-image now. of course some days are better than others, and there are days in every woman's life where she feels average, plain, not pretty. but there is something about this stage of life that just makes us throw our hands up and say i'm done. we throw out all of the lies. we get tired of hearing that we're not perfect. so we take you're too____. and you're not____enough. and we punch 'em in the face. ain't nobody got time for that!\n\nthe ease of confident self-care. this ties right in with the above. i wish someone would have told me how much the opinions of my husband regarding my appearance would bring me to a place of self-acceptance that i never knew before. this played out in the simplest of things such as shaving my legs. of course my goal is always to be well-kept, but i am amazed just how much insecurity regarding how i look has been lost. i just don't really care anymore. this is not to say that i no longer care about keeping up with my appearance. quite the opposite - my husband's affirmation of my looks and him telling me regularly that i am beautiful gives me the extra boost of confidence i need to care just enough. not too much to where i obsess over my appearance, but not too little to where i become lazy and unkempt. while i love how good and confident it feels to be well-kept, i also know that my husband just doesn't care if it's been 4 days since i shaved my legs, or if i wake up and decide not to do my hair. this is one of the best and most beneficial things i've found about marriage so far. and i do know that some husbands can have the opposite affect on their wives, based on how they affirm, or how they cut down. a spouse is a powerful person, and carries great potential to directly influence the self-confidence of their significant other.\n\nthe blossoming individuality:\n\nhere is something i was not even close to being prepared for after getting married. i had no idea that being married would bring out so much of who i am as a person, to the point where i now feel more like myself than ever before. i believe this has everything to do with marrying a very good man. the right person will always enable you to flourish in your self-esteem, self-care, hobbies, interests and passions. i found myself moving towards things i'd always wanted to do, exploring my passions with great zeal for life, and completing tasks and projects i'd always meant to finish. being with the right person has a way of giving you that zoom of strength you need to be fully and 100% yourself. the knowledge that someone not only loves and accepts, but also genuinely enjoys, you as a person, brings a steadiness to the heart like never before. i grew to a place where it didn't really matter anymore who thought what about me. i felt no shame in being 100% myself. i believe that a good and solid marriage does this for both people.\n\ngirl, you got this. you're strong, brave and beautiful. you are a powerful woman who is fully capable of rocking out this adulthood thing. you're in your twenties - maybe single, maybe married, maybe soon to be - and you are simply amazing. don't worry. stay close to your father, and your sisters, and rock some red lipstick when you feel down. i'm here for you. go kick some a**!
twenty-five years ago, as hurricane andrew bore down on northeast mississippi, a teenage girl vanished without a trace in the town of tupelo. she wasn't a casualty of mother nature. she was, according to police, a victim of a cold and calculating individual who took advantage of the chaos caused by the storm.\n\nthe hurricane, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached tupelo, left no permanent mark on the city, which is best known as the birthplace of elvis presley. however, the disappearance of 13-year-old leigh marine occhi did, and it still hangs like a thick cloud over the city.\n\nfor more than two decades, authorities have dissected and combed through the evidence. theories and suspicions abound, but the teenager has yet to be found.\n\nstill, there is hope for resolution. the case is now being analyzed in a new podcast, titled 13: the search for leigh occhi, which is being released episodically by local nbc affiliate wtva news.\n\nthere's a lot of apparent coincidence in this tale, wtva's jason lee usry says in the preview episode of the podcast, which can be found on itunes or soundcloud. a lot of coincidence, a great deal of mysterious behavior, and somewhere within one of the players in this story, a terrifying level of cruelty.\n\nthe case, which this author first covered on the criminal report daily blog nine years ago, began on aug. 27, 1992. as torrential rains and gusting winds began to hit tupelo, the alarm clock at the yarbrough home went off at about 6:45 a.m.\n\naccording to vickie yarborough, she and her daughter, leigh occhi, had slept in the same bed the previous night because the girl was afraid of storms. the blond-haired, bright-eyed leigh had recently celebrated her thirteenth birthday and was supposed to go to an open house at tupelo middle school with her grandmother that afternoon.\n\nyarborough had recently separated from leigh's stepfather, barney, and she told detectives it was just her and her daughter on that rainy thursday morning. according to the police report, yarborough said her daughter had been alive and well when she left for work at about 7:40 a.m. that morning.\n\nyarborough later said she'd heard there were tornado watches in the area and decided to call from work and check on leigh at about 8:30 a.m. nobody answered. concern turned to worry, prompting yarborough to drive home, according to the report.\n\nthe door was unlocked, and i opened the house and it was all dark, so i didn't see leigh anywhere, yarborough told detectives. i said, 'leigh,' like that, and nobody answered me, and then i went in.\n\nshe added, i saw blood right there splattered on the walls and then i screamed ... and dialed 911.\n\ntupelo police department an undated photo of leigh occhi that was distributed by police.\n\nat about 9:00 a.m., yarborough made a frantic 911 call to the tupelo police department. she requested immediate assistance at her home on a cul-de-sac on the city's west side, telling the dispatcher that her daughter was missing and that she'd found traces of blood inside the house.\n\nwhen police arrived on the scene, they observed blood stains in the hallway and bathroom, and a bloody stain containing strands of hair on a door frame facing the kitchen area. authorities said there were indications that someone had attempted to clean up the blood in the bathroom. in leigh's room, a bloody blue nightgown and bra were discovered. the only items missing were the teen's shoes, reading glasses and underclothes.\n\nthere was no sign of forced entry into the house, police said. based on the evidence, authorities surmised leigh had been killed inside.\n\nthe next day, the leading headline in the daily journal read, federal troops ordered to fla. a much smaller headline, within a subsection of the paper, read, 13-year-old tupelo girl reported missing.\n\ndavid lohr the house where leigh occhi was last seen alive.\n\npolice conducted multiple ground and aerial searches, but found no sign of leigh. the case was coming to an abrupt standstill when, on sept. 9, 1992, yarborough contacted police and told them she'd received a package in the mail containing leigh's missing eyeglasses. they'd been delivered in an 8-inch envelope, addressed in block letters to b yarborough. the return address was the same as the mailing address.\n\nauthorities determined the package had been mailed from booneville, a small city located roughly 30 miles north of tupelo. the envelope was sent to the state crime lab in jackson for handwriting analysis and dna testing, but nothing of evidentiary value was found.\n\naccording to tupelo police chief bart aguirre, investigators became suspicious and asked yarborough to take a lie detector test. she was polygraphed three different times ― once by a local polygraph examiner and twice by the fbi – and failed it three times, the chief said in a 2009 interview with this author.\n\nyarborough was named a person of interest at the time, but no charges were ever filed against her.\n\nin 2009, the same year the police chief revealed the alleged results of the lie detector tests to this author, yarborough said she was well aware they'd considered her a person of interest.\n\nthat has never been a bother to me, she told this author.\n\nit's never been about me. it's about finding leigh, and i didn't care and i [still] don't care what anyone says about any of it ... i have never not cooperated with anybody [and] i am not fazed by what they say.\n\ndavid lohr tupelo police chief bart aguirre in a 2009 photo.\n\ndetectives investigated leigh's step-father, but ultimately cleared him, police said. other suspicions ― directed at a man who was known to leigh's family and later incarcerated for similar crimes ― failed to pan out.\n\ndespite the police department's belief that leigh was murdered, her mother was unwilling, in 2009, to give up the hope that her daughter was still alive.\n\ni am not going to accept anything for sure, she said. i am not going to do that ... i have to keep focused on factual things ... or i wouldn't be able to cope very well.\n\nit's unclear if she still holds that belief. attempts by huffpost to reach her were unsuccessful.\n\nleigh's father, donald occhi, says he believes his daughter is dead. a master sergeant in the army, he and yarborough had met and married while serving together in the military. leigh was their only child. when the marriage ended, yarborough left the service and made her way to mississippi, while donald occhi was transferred to another base.\n\ni want to live to see her body located, so that i can see that she is properly buried, he said. then i will smile when the son of a bitch who did this dies in the mississippi state death chamber.\n\ntupelo police department an undated photo of leigh occhi that was distributed by police.\n\nin the last two decades, there have been plenty of maybes and what ifs, but the complete portrait of the crime has remained blurred. now, 25 years after the fact, wtva news promises to reveal new twists, turns and developments in the long-dormant case, though it's unclear whether there will be any answers.\n\nanyone with information in the disappearance of leigh occhi is asked to contact the tupelo police department at 662-841-6491.\n\nsend david lohr an email or follow him on

courtesy of the lima family democratic rhode island state rep. charlene lima and her husky, keiko. lima has introduced a bill in the state legislature dealing with pet custody, a growing issue in divorce cases.\n\nthe divorce court judge was frustrated. the husband, in tears. the wife, adamant. the couple's love for each other had ended, but each professed to love and want the dog. how would the judge decide?\n\nthe husband offered thousands of dollars to his soon-to-be-ex for the pit bull terrier mix named sweet pea. the wife wouldn't accept the compensation, and insisted the dog was hers — a gift, in fact, from her husband.\n\nthis was a mutt they got at the pound, and it wasn't worth money, said family attorney erin levine of oakland, california, who represented the husband and said the judge gave her grief for not settling the dispute out of court in the 2015 case. there was no way we weren't going to litigate this; they were so attached to the dog.\n\nthe woman produced a greeting card from her husband saying this [dog] is your gift for christmas. i love you. finally, the judge gave her custody of sweet pea. her husband, levine remembered in an interview, was inconsolable.\n\nit's that kind of messy pet custody case that a new california law is supposed to help solve. former democratic gov. jerry brown, owner of two first dogs, corgi mix lucy and bordoodle cali, signed the bill, which took effect jan. 1.\n\nwhile pets are not considered children and are technically property, the california law, recognizing what it calls pets' unique nature, sets up special assessments that judges can use to determine custody in contested cases.\n\nthe law allows people to petition for custody of a pet. it empowers judges to take into consideration the care of the pet when determining sole or joint ownership. questions like who walked the dog? and who took the cat to vet appointments? are now permissible criteria for determining custody.\n\nonly alaska and illinois have similar statutes, both of which took effect in 2017. but the california law is the most specific, and at least a handful of other states are looking to it as a model.\n\nthis is something i think you could see creeping up in statehouses across the country, said crystal moreland, california state director for the humane society of the united states. once california gets involved in something, you tend to have a national effect.\n\nanimal court\n\nthere's apparently plenty of need for the laws. a 2014 survey by the american academy of matrimonial lawyers showed that respondents reported a 22 percent increase in pet custody hearings in the preceding five years.\n\ndogs were the most disputed family animal, with 88 percent of the cases. cats were a distant second at 5 percent. horses made up 1 percent, while the category of other registered 6 percent — including an iguana, python, african grey parrot and even a giant 130-pound turtle.\n\nin addition, 20 percent of the attorneys surveyed cited an increase in courts determining that pets are an asset in a divorce.\n\nother than in states with the new laws, pets are generally considered property to be divided between warring couples. that didn't make sense to rhode island state rep. charlene lima, a married democrat who authored a best interests of the pet bill last year.\n\nalthough the bill stalled in committee, lima, who owns a very spoiled 8-year-old husky named keiko, is readying a new bill modeled on california's for this year's session.\n\nshe said she has had constituents tell her about contentious divorce fights that end up costing them tons and tons in legal fees over the pets. she maintained her bill would smooth the process by setting out criteria by which judges could make the determinations on pet custody.\n\ndo we want to treat them like humans? she said. no, but we don't want the pet considered like the couch either.\n\nthe california law allows judges in divorces with pets to take into consideration:\n\nwho feeds the pet?\n\nwho adopted the pet?\n\nwho purchases food, toys and other things for the pet?\n\nwho walks the pet?\n\nwho takes the pet to the vet?\n\nwho protects the pet?\n\nwho spends the most time with the pet?\n\nhave there been allegations of domestic abuse or abuse of the pet?\n\ndemocratic california state assemblyman bill quirk, the bill's author and owner of a 13-year-old maltese shih tzu mix named luna, which he and his wife adopted from a shelter two years ago, said he was looking to write a law that would encourage judges to consider the pets' best interests.\n\npets are very emotional, quirk said. as the owner of a rescue dog … i thought it was very important that their welfare be taken into consideration.\n\nbut he said judges and family lawyers were concerned about how long it would take to settle pet custody in already-time-consuming divorce cases and that the new law might give spouses another avenue for revenge.\n\nbut what does the dog want?\n\nmembers of the association of certified family law specialists in june testified before a california senate committee that they opposed the bill because cases of marital dissolution and legal separation already face significant delays and issues of contention in court, particularly surrounding child custody.\n\ndorie rogers, family law specialist in southern california and associate director of the family law association, said her members were worried that clients would have one more thing to fight over.\n\nbefore the new law, she said, she had to explain to clients that since pets were property, they simply had to try hard to settle matters before it got to a courtroom.\n\nshe expects the new law will encourage more of them to go before the judge, now that they know what criteria might be taken into consideration. with more people, especially millennial couples with no children, treating their pets like kids, she said, cases are about to get very complicated.\n\nrogers also said her group opposed the law because of worries about increased time and cost of litigation in divorce cases.\n\ncertifying the welfare of the animal will be difficult and might require expert testimony, rogers said. how do you prove that? did you feed the dog, did you take it to the vet? who's going to be the tie-breaker? are you going to bring in the vet? she said in a phone interview.\n\nto try to address those concerns, quirk amended his bill to make courts' special consideration in pet custody cases voluntary rather than mandatory.\n\nmarie sarantakis, a family law attorney in illinois, one of the other states with a pet custody law, said she has handled divorces in which one spouse uses a pet as leverage. in one case, she represented the wife, who had a beagle that she'd owned before the relationship. out of the blue, sarantakis said, the husband filed for divorce and asked for the dog.\n\nthat completely caught her off guard, sarantakis said. she never would have guessed it was something he wanted. she believed that the purpose of asking for the dog was to gain power and ask for other things. luckily the case got resolved, and she kept the dog.\n\nsarantakis said the pet custody cases can sometimes become more emotional than disagreements over children.\n\nthe children can vocalize. with the dog, you don't know what they want, she said. she noted that sometimes judges award custody of pets in the same manner as children — when the kids go with mom, for example, so does the pet.\n\nwhile pleased that the new law attempts to ease what she said is a challenging and emotional issue for a lot of people, california family law attorney deborah marx, immediate past president of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers chapter in northern california, is skeptical that it will make a difference in divorce cases.\n\nshe noted that even though the law aims to take pets out of the property split in a divorce, the statute is in the property division section of the law, not in the family code section. but, she said in a phone interview, it's in a section that deals with unusual provisions, in what is generally a community property state where marital assets are divided equally. that puts the pet question in a special category.\n\nthe unusual provisions section addresses situations such as when one spouse receives a personal injury award during a marriage, allowing courts to award that spouse the entire amount. similarly, a pet could be considered the property of one person, she said.\n\nbut marx said much is still up to the judge's discretion and that couples with pets get very differing receptions from the judges depending on how judges feel about pets. some are sympathetic and some are 'why are you wasting my time?'
women's rights groups are sounding the alarm about president donald trump's nominee to head a key federal agency charged with reducing violence against women.\n\nshannon lee goessling, a republican, is under consideration to lead the office on violence against women, which administers grants to support victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. advocates say goessling has limited experience working in the domestic violence field, and has a history of opposing rights for lgbtq people and immigrants.\n\na date for goessling's nomination hearing at the senate judiciary committee has not been set.\n\nin a statement last year, the white house pointed to goessling's record as a district attorney in georgia, where she prosecuted crimes against women and children in the 1990s. from 2004 to 2015, she was the executive director and chief legal counsel of southeastern legal foundation, a conservative public interest law firm and policy center with a record of advocating for gun rights and religious freedom.\n\nduring goessling's time at southeastern legal foundation, the group filed an amicus brief arguing in favor of same-sex marriage bans, and sued the governor of alabama for offering driver's license exams in languages other than english.\n\neleanor smeal, president of the feminist majority foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to women's equality, told huffpost that goessling is an unsuitable choice and wholly unqualified for the position.\n\nthis is a top job, for god's sake, smeal said. you should have a person here who has experience in this field.\n\ntrump's announcement about goessling's nomination noted that she previously worked as the director of the crimes against women and children prosecution unit in atlanta after almost a decade as a state prosecutor. however, her linkedin page indicates she only held that position for nine months.\n\ngiven her views, which are most obvious from her tenure at southeastern legal foundation, we are very worried about her ability to enforce the violence against women act, and to understand all the complexities of the communities that it serves, smeal said.\n\nsmeal noted that domestic violence affects people of all classes, ethnic groups and backgrounds.\n\nin each of these different communities, there [are] different complexities. the person who runs the office must not only understand that, but also be sympathetic to it, she said. we're worried that a vote for her would exclude lgbtq and immigrant survivors from protections and resources.\n\ngoessling did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nif confirmed, as the head of the office on violence against women, goessling would have a large influence over which domestic violence and sexual assault programs get funding, smeal said, and which issues take priority.\n\nsmeal said she was especially concerned with goessling's record on guns. in 2008, goessling authored an amicus brief arguing that firearms help protect women from violent attacks, and quoted a researcher who wrote that women who are confronted with a sexual assault are significantly less likely to experience a completed rape if they resist with a weapon.\n\nhowever, susan sorenson, a gun violence researcher at the university of pennsylvania, noted that goessling's brief relied in part on research that is more than 30 years old.\n\nwe have learned a lot about sexual assault and other violence against women in the intervening decades, she said. the person who is most likely to sexually assault a woman is a man she knows — and resistance takes a different form when it's someone you know.\n\nsorenson said she is unaware of any current research that supports the idea that a woman who resists with a weapon is less likely to be sexually assaulted.\n\nsome might find it to be an appealing idea, but we don't have any research that supports it, she said. what we do know is that women who purchase a handgun are more likely, in the days, weeks, months and years afterwards, to be the victim of homicide and suicide.\n\nguns are, indeed, known to make domestic violence incidents more deadly. one study found that victims are five times more likely to be killed if their abuser has access to a gun.\n\ntoni van pelt, president of the national organization for women, said that when she reviewed goessling's background, she was overcome with a sense of fear.\n\ni don't feel that she has the empathy or the emotional experience to do a good job in this role, she said. once again, we are looking at another trump nominee that will do the exact opposite than what is required of the position.\n\nin addition to distributing grants, the office on violence against women is meant to give victims a voice on the national stage, said richard gelles, professor of social policy at the university of pennsylvania.\n\nthat is not an exceptionally high priority of this administration, he said.\n\nneed help?

tmz reports that paula patton has been granted a temporary restraining order against ex-husband robin thicke, whom she she accused of physically abusing her amid their ongoing custody battle over their 6-year-old son, julian.\n\naccording to court documents obtained by people magazine, a los angeles judge ruled thursday that thicke must remain at least 100 yards away from patton, the former couple's son and patton's mother, joyce, noting that thicke has a history of domestic violence.\n\npatton and thicke's nine-year marriage ended in 2014, and they finalized their divorce in may 2015. but their custody battle rages on.\n\naccording to patton's 52-page request for a domestic violence restraining order, the 41-year-old claims, robin had a temper and could be volatile at times, and went on to provide examples of abusive incidents. patton lists their son's birthday in april 2013 as one such occasion.\n\nin the documents, patton also claims that she observed thicke having inappropriate contact with the masseuse and says he became so enraged that i had interrupted his 'massage' that he broke down the locked door. patton goes on to explain that thicke became physically violent with me. he pushed me down and kicked me.\n\nanother incident allegedly took place at the cannes film festival in 2013. we began fighting. robin hit me with a closed fist to my upper body and then pushed me onto the ground, patton claims in the document.\n\nshe also contends that thicke endangered her with his infidelity and says the singer admitted to having unprotected sex with seven other women.\n\nthicke is denying the allegations. his lawyer responded to the documents, telling people in a statement, paula never reported any domestic violence until she was in a position of contempt by violating the custody orders. dcfs asked both paula and robin to drug test. robin agreed and submitted to his test, but paula refused to test. infidelity has nothing to do with custody. she is attempting to throw anything at him to hurt him, but robin's focus is their son.\n\nneed help? in the u.s., call 1-800-799-safe (7233) for the national domestic violence hotline .
there's no doubt that being in a long-distance relationship comes with its challenges: trying to coordinate time to talk across different time zones, making plans to see each other when your work schedules or finances (or the current pandemic) don't allow for it and going long stretches of time without that coveted face-to-face connection.\n\nbut as people in ldrs will tell you, there are also some positive aspects to the experience that you may not have considered before.\n\nfor more than two years, missy eames was living in new york while her now-husband harley was living in australia; the pair eloped in july at brooklyn bridge park in brooklyn, new york. the long-distance path was difficult at times but it also strengthened their relationship, she said.\n\nlong distance was not always ideal. it came with struggles, loneliness, longing and then a pandemic happened and made it a bit harder for a short time in our situation, eames told huffpost. that being said, the nature of our relationship has left us with tons of memories and experiences that are irreplaceable.\n\nbelow, people who have been in ldrs, presently or in the past, share the surprising perks to their relationships.\n\nresponses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\n1. you don't take the little things for granted.\n\nsure, date nights are great. but we actually find ordinary life together downright magical. morning hugs in the kitchen. going to the grocery store together. just seeing his toothbrush next to mine. swoon! — cris gladly\n\n2. you get to maintain more of your independence.\n\nperhaps one of the best things about a long-distance relationship is the space that you have. you have lots of time for the things you love, for yourself, for missing each other. you get the benefits of being in a relationship, but can still enjoy your free, independent life.\n\nas a person who's been through two years of transatlantic dating — and going on six years of marriage — i believe that it's healthy to retain some level of distance in a relationship, even for couples who do live under one roof. maybe that's a weekend away with your girlfriends while he's fishing with his friends. distance helps each of you stay self-sufficient and makes it easier to maintain respect towards each other. — olga baker\n\n3. you become pros at communicating.\n\nbeing in a ldr has created a stronger level of communication than i think would have developed if we were in a 'traditional' relationship. at any given point, we had a 14-to-16-hour time difference between us, sometimes more if i traveled out west. this worked really well for me because i worked overnight shifts, so most of the time we were both awake at the same time. on days off, one of us either woke up early or stayed up late to ensure that we could talk to each other.\n\nconsidering that months would often pass before we could see each other again, communication was all we had. in turn, i found that we were both very open about our emotions, how we felt about each other and how we felt about our situation moving forward. from almost day one, we have been very open and transparent with each other, and i think that made us stronger as a couple. — eames\n\nwe actually find ordinary life together downright magical. morning hugs in the kitchen. going to the grocery store together. just seeing his toothbrush next to mine. - cris gladly\n\n4. you make the most of whatever time you have together.\n\none of the perks was the memories we got to make when we'd see each other. on my weeklong trips to visit dan in portugal or colombia, it was like a constant back-to-back date night because we had to pack it all in before i had to fly home again. we look back on those trips knowing that we spent such excellent quality time together in only seven days that it turned out to be like more quality time in total than the time that couples have together in a regular month living in the same place. — becca of @halfhalftravel\n\n5. you're uniquely prepared for a pandemic.\n\ncovid has kept so many loved ones apart. but being in a long-distance relationship prepared me and my husband well. we already know exactly what to do to keep love strong and alive while apart. we've been doing those things for years! — gladly\n\n6. you find creative ways to keep your sex life hot.\n\nit's easy to let your sexual relationship fall to the wayside when you're with your partner every single day, especially during a pandemic. but a thriving sex life takes work and commitment. in ldrs, people are forced to nurture aspects of their relationships that they might not have otherwise — this is especially true with sex. we don't have a playbook for ldr sex lives so we can get creative with it. it can become a multimedia erotic love fest between nude pics, facetime sex, mutual masturbation and sexting. — gigi engle, author of all the f*cking mistakes: a guide to sex, love, and life\n\nyou get the benefits of being in a relationship, but can still enjoy your free, independent life. - olga baker\n\n7. you get to explore new places together.\n\ni love traveling and seeing other parts of the world, which is coincidentally how we met. since we started dating, i have been to australia two more times and my husband has come to america four times before moving here. during those trips, we were able to play tourist in our respective homes and even see bits of each other's countries. in between those visits, we also got to travel together to vietnam and peru together. he proposed at machu picchu, which is something i will never forget. we figured that seeing each other would always require a flight on one end or the other, but we could break it up and meet each other somewhere, and then experience a new country together. — eames\n\n8. over time, two places start to feel like home.\n\ni get to live like a local in two cities on opposite sides of the planet. we have friends in both places. favorite hangouts and coffee shops in both places. two vastly differently environments now feel equally like home. — gladly\n\n9. you're forced you to make some tough, but ultimately rewarding choices.\n\nldrs are not an easy feat. they take work, no matter how serious or mutually casual the relationship. these kinds of relationships make you answer the very nerve-wracking question: what do i want from this and am i willing to do the work to make it happen? this is a terrifying aspect of romance that many millennials and gen z babes avoid in the never-ending quest to try and be 'chill.' ldrs don't really have room for 'chill' and force us to figure out our values and get clear about what we want. ultimately, that can leave you with a relationship (or relationships) that sustain you and benefit you in the long-term. — engle

australia's new deputy prime minister is being called on to heal the wounds left by a shocking anti-lgbtqi rant he penned 25 years ago.\n\nmichael mccormack, 53, on monday took up the post as australia's new deputy prime minister after the previous occupant, barnaby joyce, quit following weeks of controversy over his affair with a former staffer.\n\ncongrats to michael mccormack, new deputy pm, who wrote this in 1993 when i was eleven. pic.twitter.com/mlhi80w73k — bec shaw (@brocklesnitch) february 25, 2018\n\nsome lgbtqi rights activists have expressed concern over mccormack's elevation to the office of deputy prime minister.\n\nwhile welcoming mccormack's apologies, just.equal spokesman rodney croome called on him to walk the talk and support initiatives to help lgbtqi australians overcome isolation, prejudice and suicide in parts of rural australia.\n\nthe apologies mr. mccormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he has stepped in to, he needs to walk the talk, croome said in a statement.\n\nhe needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.\n\nmccormack issued a fresh statement in august last year apologizing for the editorial. when he issued the august apology, he was small business minister and had ministerial responsibility for the same-sex marriage postal vote.\n\ni have grown and learnt not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique, he said at the time.\n\naustralian's overwhelmingly voted yes in the national survey, and same-sex marriage was legalised in december last year.\n\nmccormack replaces barnaby joyce, who made global headlines last year when he threatened to execute johnny depp's dogs and more recently when he was forced to quit the role of deputy prime minister following weeks of controversy surrounding his extra-marital affair with a former staffer who is now pregnant.\n\na father of three, mccormack was elevated to the post after he was elected leader of the national party ― a move which automatically makes him deputy prime minister thanks to a long-standing agreement with conservative coalition partner, the liberal party.
things took a surprising turn on the jan. 1 episode of sister wives when a member of the tlc reality show's polygamist family announced she was a lesbian.\n\nas seen in the above entertainment tonight clip, kody and meri brown's 21-year-old daughter, mariah brown, came out to her mormon fundamentalist family in the episode, which aired sunday night. it's difficult to gauge from the clip how mariah's family members reacted, though her words prompted some surprised looks for sure.\n\nafter the emotional episode aired, mariah thanked viewers for their support on twitter.\n\nwow okay y'all making me cry with your support. thank you thank you thank you thank you😌😌🏳️‍🌈 — mariah (@mariahlian) january 2, 2017\n\na day before the episode aired, she seemed to hint at things to come in a dec. 31 tweet.\n\nas hard as 2016 was for me, it was also probably the best year of my life. i am genuinely so blessed — mariah (@mariahlian) january 1, 2017\n\nsister wives viewers will just have to wait until the show's jan. 8 episode to see how the family comes to terms ― or doesn't ― with mariah's sexuality. of course, their devout faith could be an issue. as fundamentalist mormons, the family still practices polygamy, which has been explicitly rejected by the mainstream mormon church, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints.\n\nstill, in november 2015, the mormon church adopted new, rigid guidelines on same-sex couples. under those guidelines, any mormon in a same-sex marriage would be deemed an apostate, or having abandoned the religion, and subjected to disciplinary hearings that could lead to excommunication.\n\nwhether or not the browns would adhere to any of the mainstream mormon church's stances on lgbtq issues in any way is unclear. in a 2013 huffpost live interview, however, the family said they supported marriage equality. we have established our family the way we've chosen to, we've organized it the way we wanted to, kody brown said in that interview, which can be viewed below. we believe that all people should be allowed to have that right.\n\nnoting that she had very close lgbtq friends, robyn added, all adults should be able to choose who they love, and how they structure their family.\n\nhere's to hoping that the browns put those actions into words and continue to support their daughter moving forward.\n\nclarification: this article has been updated with additional information to clarify that the browns identify as fundamentalist mormons. that denomination is separate from the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, the mainstream mormon church.
