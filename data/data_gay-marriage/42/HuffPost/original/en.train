And there are relationships in which both partners are perfectly content with infrequent sex or not having sex at all. But for many couples, it is an integral part of sustaining a physical and emotional connection.\n\nWe asked sex therapists to share some signs that a couple might be heading toward a sexless marriage. Below, 10 potential warning signs to look out for:\n\n1. You're starting to feel more like roommates than intimate partners.\n\nWe underestimate the importance of physical attraction in long-term relationships. In the beginning, couples make commitments to grooming, wearing clothes that make them feel desirable and feeling good about themselves. When you start to feel like roommates, you might need to change out of your sweats and comfy clothes and get ready for an intimate night together. Take a long bath or shower, put on something that makes you feel good about yourself, and put energy into feeling sensual. Even if you are staying in for the night, put something on that makes you feel open for sex and connection, like your favorite lingerie or use a new massage oil or perfume. ― Shannon Chavez, psychologist and sex therapist\n\n2. You're not comfortable talking about sex together.\n\nIf you've never had an open conversation about sex, it's likely that you'll have a sexless period in your relationship. Communication is essential to a healthy sex life, and intimacy just can't flourish without it. ― Vanessa Marin, sex therapist and creator of Finishing School, the online orgasm course for women\n\n3. You're giving all of your time and energy to the kids.\n\nWhile most new parents need to focus much of their time, energy and resources on the newborn, it's important to recognize that you need to nurture yourself and your relationship once the baby is a couple of months old. There are many parents who struggle to go out on a date after having children due to financial constraints. It's important for partners to engage with one another as adults with a variety of interests other than their kids in order to keep the erotic energy going. You can have sex while your kids are sleeping, but if all you've been doing night after night is reading stories and cleaning up after dinner, the routine can become old and exhausting. It leaves little time to connect romantically and sensually with your partner.― Sari Cooper, sex therapist and director of the Center for Love and Sex NYC\n\n4. You avoid watching romantic or erotic scenes on TV or in movies together.\n\nSex scenes in movies or on TV may inspire couples to get it on. They may see something they want to try, or they may get aroused just watching. If watching erotic scenes makes you uncomfortable, this may be indicative of a problem in your own sex life or trigger some aspect of your own sexuality that is shameful or confusing. Being able to enjoy a sexy scene with you partner is a sign of sexual health. If shame or embarrassment is getting in the way, it may be a sign of a problem. If you struggle to maintain sexual attraction to your partner, watching a sexy movie may serve as a painful reminder that you 'lost that lovin' feeling.' It may also spark a conversation that you do not want to have. Honesty is the best policy. Communicating directly about your sexual satisfaction, expectations and preferences is the best way to avoid a sexless relationship. ― Kimberly Resnick Anderson, sex therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at UCLA School of Medicine\n\n5. You stop flirting with each other.\n\nWhen your partner is starting to feel like a 'best friend' that you want to gossip on the couch with after a long day at work instead of connecting in a sensual and intimate way, it's time to create some space for being lovers and bring erotic energy into your connection together. Flirt, make eye contact, use body language to feel sexy and sensual. Move your body and be intentional about turning your partner on. Instead of turning to your partner and saying, 'Do you want to have sex?' at the end of the night, work on creating anticipation, hints outside of the bedroom, texting and communication that show you are interested in being connected and intimate together. ― Chavez\n\n6. Your partner makes fun of your sex drive, or lack thereof.\n\nIf your partner regularly mocks or derides your sex drive, that's not a good sign. All couples have sex drives that are mismatched to some degree, but it's important to be respectful of each other's needs even if they don't match our own. ― Marin\n\n7. You rarely touch each other inside or outside of the bedroom.\n\nPerhaps you haven't touched in months, even to kiss hello or goodbye. And you don't touch while you watch TV on the couch or hold hands in the car.  ― Tammy Nelson, sex therapist and author of Getting the Sex You Want\n\n8. You purposely stay up later than your partner to avoid the 'Not tonight, honey' conversation.\n\nBeing in the same bed at the same time as your partner increases the likelihood of having sexual contact. If you find yourself avoiding going to bed until after your partner is asleep, you may be consciously (or subconsciously) decreasing the odds of having sex. You need to ask yourself some tough questions: Why don't I want to be awake in the same bed at the same time as my partner? Are there aspects of my sex life that are disappointing or anxiety-provoking? Avoiding may feel easier than hurting your partner's feelings, but an honest conversation (first with yourself and then with your partner) may keep you from ending up in a sexless marriage. ― Resnick Anderson\n\n9. You jam-pack your schedule with other obligations, leaving little time for each other.\n\nWhile this could be true of many couples in this day and age — when work can call upon you wherever you happen to be via email or text — the couples that leave some time for fun, pleasure and intimacy are the ones who have a better chance of committing to creating time for sex. There are also hints that one or both partners are unconsciously avoiding intimacy through the overloading of their schedule. ― Cooper\n\n10. You have unrealistic expectations about what sex should be like.
It's been almost four months since I discovered my husband's cheating. Three and a half years of it, some of it in our house, some of it without protection.\n\nWe had been monogamous, or so I thought, for 16 years.\n\nWhen people used to tell me about how devastating infidelity could be, and what measures to take to prevent it, I took their advice with a grain of salt. Such betrayal would certainly feel crushing, I knew, but surely it could be managed.\n\nBut in September, when a stranger reached out proffering a photo album of incriminating screenshots ― a Tinder profile showcasing my husband's smiling face, in which he claimed he was slightly married, a series of graphic sexual text messages, and time logs of hourlong phone conversations ― I realized that these earlier claims weren't exaggerated or relegated to a sensitive few. The knot twisting in my stomach proved their validity.\n\nI suddenly found myself careening through a type of grief, as if the person I thought my husband was had died. As if, in fact, a part of me had died. What remained was now being dragged, kicking and screaming, through an existential metamorphosis into something new and unknown.\n\nAt first, I thought divorce was our only option. Once a cheater, always a cheater looped in my head, along with the imagined porno film of what my husband had done. I couldn't sleep. I could barely eat. I lost weight. The walk to the STD testing clinic felt like a funeral march. And through it all, that horrible movie kept playing on repeat, torturing me with all the visuals and sounds and smells that I imagined had occurred in his adulterous moments. In a frenzy of despair, I banished a couch ― the couch of sin I called it ― onto a truck-bound journey that assured I would never see it again.\n\nI was destroyed and couldn't fathom recovering.\n\nThe idea of separation seemed foregone, logical, natural even. But extensive therapy and time with thoughtful, open-minded friends (some of whom possess decidedly unorthodox relationship arrangements) slowly nudged me out of my misery. I began to tentatively question the ideologies I had been acculturated into, and to wonder about the very nature of sex and love and relationships.\n\nThe notion dawned on me that perhaps some of the pain I was feeling stemmed from a preventable social malady rather than abject personal failure. Maybe, to a certain degree, our institutions had misunderstood love, and taught it to us all wrong.\n\nWhat if the lack of respect that made infidelity so agonizing was less about sex and more about dishonesty? If honesty could be achieved and mutually maintained, then, could my husband and I develop a level of empathy that would allow for more sexual freedom without damaging our partnership? Could we think and feel past the societal taboo of sex outside of marriage and discover a truer definition of love? Was there a third viable path hidden alongside divorce and forced monogamy?\n\nMy husband and I had talked about opening up our relationship nearly a decade ago, before we got married. It had been my idea at the time, and he had nixed it over concerns that I would have much more success at the endeavor than him. I now understand that his worry was rooted in the kind of abandonment fear that fuels jealousy and a tit-for-tat mindset. The kind of visceral half-conscious terror that, when left unexplored, upholds institutions like monogamous marriage and vilifies other ways of living.\n\nIt's a kind of fear that's baked into our society, and that's reinforced on each of us with the overrepresentation of monogamous romance we see in life and in fictional narratives. Even the idea of a couple, as synonymous to a relationship, signifies that the only ethical partnership exists in pairs of two. And yet in modern society, there are so many examples of successful throuples and open arrangements, and so many more examples of failed monogamies, many of which fell apart solely due to cheating, lacking other toxic dynamics.\n\nSo in the wake of my husband's infidelity and the philosophical renaissance it catalyzed in me, I found myself at a crossroads, wracked by cognitive dissonance. I understood intellectually that ethical non-monogamy could perhaps be a truer expression of love than traditional monogamy, but emotionally I was still bound to the traditions into which I was raised. Disney princesses. Happily ever afters. All or nothing. Good or evil. True or false. I felt that familiar fear of abandonment ― of being replaced ― clawing at me.\n\nMy husband told me he needed to be non-monogamous to feel whole. He said he was sincerely sorry for what he had done, and claimed he could be monogamous now, but would not be truly happy if he was. He also said he could be safely, honestly, and ethically non-monogamous, if I would allow it. He was willing to do the necessary work to address the dishonest parts of himself, he claimed, in order to enter this new chapter from a place of trust and respect.\n\nI could feel the alluring tug of potential new romances too; I understood where he was coming from. I decided to give non-monogamy a try, with the understanding that I could end it if other toxic aspects of our relationship ― unexplored resentments, dishonesty, bullying ― remained unresolved and rendered things too fraught. If we couldn't tackle our personal demons through therapy and introspection, we couldn't hope to bring additional people into our relationship in a healthy way.\n\nWe sat down together and wrote a list of guidelines unique to our situation, some of them hard rules ― like using protection and not meeting up with established friends or family ― and some softer, more malleable but requiring open conversation. We agreed at the outset that we would remain each other's primary partner, and though we would still be capable of developing deep, meaningful connections with other partners, the main purpose of opening things up would be for friendship and sex. We knew the only way we could successfully navigate the ocean of gray we were introducing into the black-and-white narrative of our traditional marriage was through radical honesty and compassion. We needed to be able to sit with and articulate our emotions without becoming blinded by jealousy, depression or anger.\n\nI understood intellectually that ethical non-monogamy could perhaps be a truer expression of love than traditional monogamy, but emotionally I was still bound to the traditions into which I was raised. Disney princesses. Happily ever afters. All or nothing. Good or evil. True or false. I felt that familiar fear of abandonment ― of being replaced ― clawing at me.\n\nWe continued couples therapy under the banner of our new plan. My husband began individual therapy in order to process the resentments and emotional regulation issues that had driven him to cheat in the first place. And as we started dipping our toes into dating, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery that made me feel more alive than I had in years ― in all of the joyous and terrible ways one might imagine.\n\nI felt the elation of attachment and the dejection of it not being reciprocated. I was let down, and had to let others down, and had to learn to be content with both. I learned ― and am learning ― about new people, with interests and life stories vastly different from my own. In meeting with others in an atmosphere of such complete emotional openness, interpersonal barriers I once thought immutable seemed to fall away. I've forged deep connections, some of which, with luck, could endure for a long time.\n\nI feel those barriers falling away between my husband and myself too. Jealousy and fear have posed their threats, and have made some days unbearable, but overall the experience thus far has been one of reconciliation rather than division. We're gradually learning to talk more candidly and empathetically about our feelings and experiences, to work through past and present traumas, and to see the other in ourselves.\n\nFour months ago, I never would have imagined that I could feel truly happy when my husband had a nice date with another woman, just as he now has the capacity to feel happy for me when I enjoy time with other men. We talk frankly about our experiences, about what worked and what didn't, and though at times there's still jealousy, we have an emotional toolkit to work through it healthfully.\n\nI'm learning about myself as well and have developed a sense of confidence and self-contentment that I never before thought possible. My obsessive need for self-care that I had been clinging to for years as a coping mechanism for anxiety and self-loathing is finally, bit by bit, transforming into self-love. In experiencing sex and intimacy outside my marriage, I'm becoming a freer, more actualized sexual being. I feel more comfortable physically exploring and being vulnerable, and am able to bring what I've learned back into the proverbial marriage bed to strengthen our primary bond. Through the compassionate eyes of others, both new lovers and old friends, I see now that I have value and am on the cusp of no longer needing that external validation to know my worth.\n\nAnd for those who aren't compassionate? (Dating apps possess their fair share of selfishness and manipulation, after all.) The more I know myself, the more I know which red flags are stop signs. With safety as the number one priority, I'm developing the ability to vet people, and to see the inherent beauty and collaborative growth potential in each person I decide to meet.\n\nBoth my husband and I are balancing our push toward radical open-mindedness with a mitigating dose of risk management. COVID-19 exposure and testing are now a part of the conversations we have with potential partners about their STI history. We try to coordinate dates at someone's house rather than at restaurants or bars, and we've focused most recently on seeing just one or two regular partners, bringing them into our quaranteam, so to speak, rather than further expanding our bubbles.\n\nPerhaps most beautifully, though, I'm remembering the gratitude and love that drove me to marry my husband in the first place. More and more, we're returning from our individual sexual experiences with a newfound appreciation for, and desire to be with, one another. In its finest moments, this experience has been a reminder, to both of us, to not take each other for granted, a notion that I would have thought counterintuitive before living it.\n\nWill things between my husband and I progress into the mutually empathetic utopia I imagine? Only time will tell. One or both of us could prove emotionally unfit to sustain an open arrangement and our experiment could fail. And there are sure to be bumps, some jarring, even if we succeed. I still have moments when I think I ought to consider separation as an act of self-preservation, when I wonder whether the mental load of our new arrangement destroys more than it builds. Inevitably, though, those darker moments are followed by the conviction that the true act of self-preservation is to maintain courage in the pursuit of happiness ― to follow whatever paths, no matter how unorthodox, lead to that place of self-actualization. And for now, at least, the most promising path involves walking with my husband, side by side.\n\nMelissa Gabso (she/her) is a writer, graphic designer, and illustrator living in central Connecticut with her husband and two four-legged house gremlins.

When it comes to infidelity, it's a rookie relationship mistake to assume you and your partner define it the same way.\n\nCheating is murky territory: Does following and sending flirty messages to a stranger on Instagram cross the line? What about creating a deep but nonsexual emotional bond with someone? (Answers to that last question may fall along gendered lines: A 2013 study suggested that physical infidelity unnerves men a lot more than emotional cheating, whereas the opposite is true for women).\n\nIn the age of Tinder and easy sexual accessibility, it's even more important to clarify how you define monogamy and infidelity.\n\nYou'd be surprised how many people get married with absolutely no clue that their beliefs about monogamy are incompatible, Los Angeles marriage therapist Virginia Gilbert told HuffPost recently. [You have to] get specific. Ask: Do you believe online sex ― chats, cam videos ― is OK? How much porn do you watch and would you be willing to watch less if it's interfering with our sex life?\n\nRecently, we asked real couples to share how they each define infidelity and monogamy. See what they had to say below.\n\nTodd and Tyler\n\nTyler and Todd Married couple Tyler and Todd Gibbon-Thorne both say an emotional affair is just as crippling to a relationship as a physical one.\n\nCheating to me is sharing or doing something intimate that you would only do with your partner. This both includes emotional and physical relationships. I trust my husband; he and I share similar values, discuss what we are each OK with, and genuinely know each other on a deep and personal level. I trust that his moral compass will guide him correctly; if his stomach gets a pit in it, he feels a guilty twinge, or if he thinks his actions and feelings would cause me pain, then that is cheating to me. I know my husband would never physically cheat on me because he would be honest enough to end it first, so this really pertains to the emotional relationships. That can be such a tantalizing experience, connecting with someone else distantly removed from your day to day. It provides a new thrill you haven't felt in a while, all from the comfort of your couch. In my eyes, that is truly cheating. ― Todd Gibbon-Thorne, vlogger at Tyler and Todd\n\nEach relationship is different, but we're monogamous, so cheating means sleeping with another person. However, cheating isn't as black and white as a physical betrayal. With the emergence of social media, it's easier now than ever to have an emotional affair by simply sliding into someone's DMs. I could eventually forgive my partner for a physical affair but not for an emotional one. While a physical affair would be devastating and a breach of trust, the betrayal of an emotional affair for me is something you cannot come back from. My husband and I have been together for nearly 10 years; he gets to see a part of me that no one else does and understands me more than anyone else, largely because I feel comfortable enough to be that vulnerable with him. The thought of that intimacy and vulnerability being breached is a betrayal far greater than physical intimacy. ― Tyler Gibbon-Thorne, vlogger at Tyler and Todd\n\nLauren and Jake\n\nEmotional infidelity isn't on par with sexual infidelity, says lifestyle blogger Lauren Hamilton.\n\nI define cheating as having secret and deep intimacy, usually physical intimacy, outside of a committed relationship. To me, sexual intimacy is the most romantically intimate you can be with another person. Emotional intimacy outside of the relationship is disloyal, but in most instances, is not an equivalent to sexual intimacy. ― Lauren Hamilton, creator of modwife.co, a marriage and lifestyle blog\n\nWhen an emotional connection forms between two people, it usually leads to a relationship. Cheating is often portrayed as somatic or physical, but anything you're hiding from your partner could be interpreted as cheating, as it could lead to a loss of trust.  ― Jake Hamilton\n\nJulia and Eileen\n\nPhoto courtesy of Julia Zelg Julia Zelg (right) considers an emotional affair more of a betrayal than physical infidelity.\n\nIf a partner cheated on me emotionally, it would be worse than if she did so physically. I'd be unable to forgive her, and our relationship would be forever broken. We're all human, and it's natural to become interested in other people, but my sense of trust and fidelity would be crushed if a partner engaged with another woman in an emotionally intimate way, including kissing, texting or WhatsApping. ― Julia Zelg, lifestyle vlogger\n\nCheating is any break in the emotional and/or physical integrity of a committed intimacy. Unless a couple has established rules for allowing emotional and/or physical intimacy outside the primary relationship, any kind of breach of it is breaking the promise of monogamous fidelity. That said, there are alternatives to monogamy that work well for many people. The central component of every relationship is boundaries and the clear definition of them. This is no different for alternative relationships (polyamory, etc.). Negotiating rules and defining boundaries are essential to every type of intimacy. ― Eileen De Freest, writer\n\nThe central component of every relationship is boundaries and the clear definition of them. Negotiating rules and defining boundaries are essential to every type of intimacy. - Eileen De Freest\n\nBruce and Tammy\n\nCheating is when you betray the trust established with your partner. For me, even if I kissed another person beyond a 'hello' peck on the cheek, it would be cheating on my wife if I did it behind her back. However, on the other hand, she and I may agree that we can explore sexual expressions with someone else if we're all together in the same room, and that may be OK since we haven't abandoned the implicit or explicit trust. In fact, even if we 'played' privately, it wouldn't necessarily be deemed cheating ― as long as it was agreed upon, we both understood what would be going on and, most importantly, we shared the experience with each other, which could then even turn the experience into a source of erotic energy for us to use at another time. Cheating is really more about secrecy than anything else: Keeping secrets from one another is where the trouble begins. Besides, I have a great relationship with my wife, so why on earth would I want to screw it up for a momentary joy ride? ― Bruce Hirshfield\n\nThere's a difference between secrecy and privacy. I think if I am hiding any kind of relationship from my spouse, it would be a slippery slope toward cheating. Why hide? If I am feeling nervous that he might find out something I'd rather not tell him, then it's probably cheating. Or at least micro-cheating, which is most likely going to lead to an affair. Texting, sexting, emailing, lunches, dinners, whatever. But personally, I find I can barely find time for my own spouse, and I struggle to think how I might find the time for a lover. If I did want to cheat, I'd probably end up telling my husband; it's so hard for me to keep a secret. I'm not that good at it. ― Tammy Nelson, a New Haven, Connecticut-based sex therapist, sexologist and the author of Getting the Sex You Want\n\nPascal and Bryan\n\nPhoto courtesy of Pascal and Bryan Pascal and Bryan share the same definition of infidelity.\n\nSimply put, engaging in a physical relationship with another person is cheating. Some suggest that flirting or having intimate conversations with someone else also crosses that line; we agree to a certain extent. For a couple to endure, it is essential for both members to be as honest as possible with each other. That said, having private conversations with other people, to us, does not necessarily count as cheating, but it is wholly inappropriate and unfair to the other party. To cheat is to act on the impulse which pushes you to look outside of your relationship for short-lived pleasure. That breaks the bond of your relationship, it jeopardizes the couple, and is an unforgivable betrayal. ― Pascal and Bryan, vloggers at Him and Him\n\nAngela and John*\n\nAnything you do that is outside the agreed-upon boundaries of the relationship is cheating. With that said, it is helpful to define the relationship so you are aware of the boundaries. There are different stages in relationships, and at every stage, boundaries should be clarified because most people are not actually on the same page when they assume the boundaries. This can be complicated when people are in open relationships. However, people who are poly/open seem to be more direct about setting boundaries and being honest about what they are OK with. ― Angela Skurtu, sex therapist and marriage counselor in St. Louis, Missouri\n\nBasically, I feel anything you are not willing to tell your partner about and you fear the possible ramifications of if caught is cheating. For example, if you're in a committed relationship and you're on a dating app browsing and you hide it from your partner, that is a form of cheating. ― John (*not his real name)
My commutes are the most infuriating parts of my day. The traffic, the missed lights, the minivan in the right lane that has no intention of turning right -- it's as if Houston's motorists have conspired to give me hypertension. And I'm far from being an aggressive driver.\n\nWhile my everyday demeanor lands somewhere between mild mannered and half-comatose, it becomes something else behind the wheel. I'm fidgety and anxious, high-strung and hard-edged.\n\nThis anger is incited by the drivers I encounter, from the snails and the texters to the clueless who don't move when the signal turns green. I'm exasperated when nobody lets me merge, or when that person enters an intersection they can't get through, or when that idiot stops traffic to make a turn they almost missed.\n\nThese incidences are infuriating, my reactions to them comical. But what I've noticed lately is that my interpretation of them is, at its core, egocentric. Because when I'm banging my steering wheel in frustration, asking how could that person be doing this, what I'm really asking is, how could that person be doing this to me?\n\n*****\n\nTo be young is to be selfish. That's not a theory based on psychological fact but on observations of the children that now surround me. Exhibit A is my 2-year-old nephew's hilariously declaring, Me! Me! Me! when pointing out whatever it is he wants, right here, right now.\n\nThis selfishness isn't anybody's fault, and with age, it's steadily filtered out of us. We learn to share when we make friends, and we learn to wait our turn when we enter the ballpark trough-urinal line. Eventually, we settle in the middle ground, striking a balance between respecting others and taking care of ourselves.\n\nBut the more attention I pay to my thoughts, the more I worry that I've strayed from that sweet spot. While my actions are seldom selfish, my mindset is. Every aggravation, every inconvenience I endure is interpreted as a personal attack, as if the guy who gets on the elevator before I can get off is determined to derail my universe. And it's wearing on me.\n\nMy parents raised me to be caring and compassionate, to consider others before I consider myself. Yet too often I see the world through my eyes alone. And if I no longer have the excuse of youth, what's left to blame for my narcissism?\n\n*****\n\nThis selfishness is as irritating as it is inconvenient, considering I've now entered the selfless arrangement of marriage. Since saying, I do, though, my mindset's been recalibrating one Yes, dear at a time. Actually, I've never said that phrase, partly because I'm not on a sitcom, and partly because my wife, Emily, and I keep things as balanced as possible. She has her areas of responsibility, I have mine.\n\nThe functionality of our home, for instance, falls under my jurisdiction. When dishwashers won't wash and light fixtures won't light, it's on me to get the proper repairmen to fix them, because lord knows I can't do it myself.\n\nConversely, the house's decor resides in Emily's domain. So when we settled on buying a new coffee table, she took charge, ordering it, coordinating the logistics and clearing her schedule so she could accept the delivery.\n\nBut on the day before the table's arrival, Emily realized she had a can't-miss work meeting in the middle of the delivery window. She couldn't be there, so I would have to be.\n\nThese things happen. Rationally, I understood that, and I reminded myself of it repeatedly. But I couldn't shake my frustration, not with Emily, but with the situation. I was frustrated to have to go to work early so I could then race back home, and I was frustrated to miss my standing lunch date with my mother and uncle. I didn't like having to do something I wasn't supposed to have to do.\n\nThat frustration only heightened the next day when a series of miscommunications delayed the operation. Standing outside, looking back and forth down our street as if that would make the truck appear, I was struck by my Me! Me! Me! attitude. Somehow, I was 2 years old again.\n\nSo what if I had to get up early, and eat lunch late, and wait 17 minutes longer than expected? What was the big deal? These were my problems?\n\nThis was absurd. I was absurd. Nobody had done this on purpose, and nobody had done this to purposely put me out. And at the end of it all, what was I going to be left with? A beautiful wife, a beautiful home and a beautiful coffee table. None of which I deserved.\n\n*****\n\nI don't know when, why or how I became like this, but I do know it's time to change. Marriage is already helping, and if I'm lucky enough to have children, it's obvious I won't have any choice but to. Maybe it's good I'm tuning into it now.\n\nBelieving everything revolves around you, it's a heavy, weighted-down way to live. Bothered by every breath of wind, you're always harried, under pressure and under attack, like you're the butt of every joke. There's no rolling with the punches or going with the flow or any other easygoing cliche you can think of. Just think about how it feels when you're legitimately attacked. Now imagine subjecting yourself to that feeling for every minuscule, mundane annoyance you inherently experience in everyday society.\n\nLord knows I'd feel a lot lighter if I didn't take it all so personally. And I shouldn't, because it's not about me. I'm not that important.\n\nBesides, who am I to get upset at anybody else? That dude who cut me off, and that person taking forever to check out, and that delivery driver who hasn't shown up, they're not carrying out some personal vendetta. They're just trying to get somewhere, and do their job, and grab some laundry detergent on their way home. Just like I am.
In a candid post on his Facebook page Tuesday, Ben Affleck revealed that he recently completed treatment for alcohol addiction.\n\nThe father of three, who is currently co-parenting with his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, wrote that he decided to seek help in order to live a full, happy life with his family.\n\nI have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront, the 44-year-old wrote. I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step. I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do. This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.\n\nAffleck and Garner are committed to raising their children ― Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5 ― together. Although there were rumors of a reconciliation, the pair are reportedly still moving ahead with their divorce, which is currently on hold, according to People. They initially announced their separation in June 2015 after 10 years of marriage.\n\nThe actor previously entered rehab for alcohol abuse in 2001.\n\nI went to rehab for being 29 and partying too much and not having a lot of boundaries and to clear my head and try to get some idea of who I wanted to be, Affleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012. It was more a 'let me get myself straight,' before it became a rite of passage.\n\nAffleck was last seen publicly at the Oscars on Feb. 26, where he presented with Matt Damon and watched his younger brother, Casey Affleck, win Best Actor.

It might be time to consider a sleep divorce.\n\nFor many of us, getting a good night's rest is a nightly challenge ― and the pandemic has only made things worse. A Kaiser Family Foundation study found that 36% of Americans reported difficulty sleeping due to pandemic stress.\n\nAs much as you love cuddle time with your S.O., the last thing you need when you finally doze off is to be woken up by the bright light of their iPad or an errant arm hitting your face.\n\nSleeping in separate beds or rooms is more and more sounding like a dream for some couples ― especially if you're working from home together, said Wendy Troxel, a senior behavioral and social Scientist at the RAND Corporation and author of Sharing the Covers: Every Couple's Guide to Better Sleep.\n\nGiven the extra 'togetherness' we have been sharing with our family during extended stay-at-home orders, sleeping apart, at least temporarily, during COVID may also benefit some couples who are just feeling starved for some alone time, she told HuffPost.\n\nThe key, though, is making this decision as a couple and to make it clear that the decision is for the benefit of your relationship, not a sign of abandonment, she said.\n\nJennifer Colbourne, a Ph.D. student in Austria who studies tool use in cockatoos (but not their sleeping habits, alas), is among the married people currently going it alone come bedtime.\n\nShe and her husband often live apart for stretches of time when Colbourne is collecting data. When she came back from one such research trip in the middle of the pandemic, the pair struggled to sleep side by side in a small double bed.\n\nIn all fairness, we have a particularly bad situation, because I have several sleep disorders, Colbourne told HuffPost. I no longer sleepwalk or scream in my sleep now that I have a CPAP machine to treat my sleep apnea, but I still have restless leg syndrome and I still thrash, moan and steal blankets.\n\nMy spouse, on the other hand, is a very light sleeper and struggles with insomnia. It's a lethal combination! she joked.\n\nThere's a stigma to sleeping separate, but being tired and resentful of your partner can't be good for your relationship. - Jennifer Colbourne, a Ph.D. student who sleeps in a separate bed from her spouse\n\nThey recently moved to a new place and decided to start sleeping in separate beds. Now they're both resting more soundly.\n\nTo be honest, our relationship is the best it's ever been in the 10 years we've been married, she said. There's a stigma to sleeping separate, but being tired and resentful of your partner can't be good for your relationship. Finding that balance of being independent but still needing each other without being codependent is a fine line to walk, and I think having your own personal space can help with that.\n\nIndeed, research shows that when you are well-rested, you're a better communicator, happier and more empathic ― all important attributes in developing and sustaining healthy, long-lasting relationships. If you can swing an extra bed or extra room, sleeping separately is a pretty sweet deal, Troxel said.\n\nThere are are just times when strategically, it makes sense for a couple to 'divide and conquer' by sleeping apart, so at least one partner gets some much needed shut-eye, she said.\n\nFor example, she said, for sleep-deprived parents of newborns, giving each partner an occasional break to spend the night in a separate room while the other parent takes on infant caregiving duties for the night is a great way to ensure that both parents don't become chronically sleep-deprived.\n\nSleeping a la Lucy and Ricky Ricardo can also be beneficial if you and your partner have different sleep cycles, said Jennifer Adams, the author of Sleeping Apart Not Falling Apart.\n\nThat was one of the major reasons Adams and her husband decided to sleep in separate rooms. Her husband is an earlier riser, while Adams is a night owl.\n\nI would head to bed and want to read when he was asleep and had to get up early in the morning for his job and then when he wakes in the morning, gets up and dressed, and ready for work, he would wake me, she recounted.\n\nMy husband rolled over and open mouth snored directly into my eyes last night if you're wondering how we keep the magic alive. — Maryfairyboberry🧚🏻‍♀️ (@maryfairybobrry) December 11, 2019\n\nIn their waking hours, both were left with guilt and some residual resentment ― which is actually a common experience among co-sleepers. A 2013 study from the University of California, Berkeley found that one partner's restless night caused by disturbances from the other partner can lead to conflicts in the relationship the next day. Another study showed that sleep issues and relationship problems tend to crop up simultaneously.\n\nThe reality is, your sleep cycle is hard-wired, Adams said. It's incredibly difficult to change your inbuilt sleep rhythms to satisfy those of another person.\n\nThis whole sleep separation pitch sounds promising, but let's turn to the question on everyone's mind: What about sex? Does sleeping in separate rooms or beds put a damper on a couple's sex life?\n\nNot at all, said Raquel Fuqua, a Colorado woman who decided to sleep divorce her boyfriend over the summer due to some pretty incompatible sleep habits. (He sleeps diagonally and punches and kicks through the night. She sleep-talks and kicks, too. It's all very MMA, but unwittingly-in-your-sleep MMA.)\n\nI think sleeping apart allows us to decide when we want to cuddle ― we just get into the other's bed, she said. Sleeping in separate beds has increased and improved our sex lives.\n\nIf anything, the nightly absence makes the heart grow fonder.\n\nWe do wake up missing each other because you're not rubbing up on them all night, Fuqua said. It makes you crave physical affection a little more, especially in the mornings. We both work opposite work schedules so this works for us.\n\nSujay Kansagra, an associate professor at Duke University Medical Center and sleep health expert for Mattress Firm, said that there's no need for intimacy to take a hit because of arrangements like this.\n\nReally, beds should be used for only two things — sleep and sex, he said. When you walk into your bedroom, your mind should start focusing on sleep or intimacy and not on things like work or watching TV.\n\nIf you recognize that, it can help maintain intimacy as a priority in the bedroom, should you go forward with a sleep divorce, Kansagra said.\n\nFor couples who aren't interested in a sleep divorce but want to improve their co-sleeping regimen, syncing up their sleep schedules can positively impact their intimacy. (Granted, this advice isn't too helpful for people working different work schedules.)\n\nIf you can make this adjustment, some great activities for couples to engage in that will help sync their sleep routines include drinking herbal tea to relax, massages and being intimate, Kansagra said.\n\nWhatever tweaks you make to your bedroom regimen ― sleeping separately, syncing up schedules ― make sure that you explicitly communicate your relationship expectations and boundaries with your partner, Adams said.
We open with the women discussing that Taylor expected to win the two-on-one, which she didn't. Then we cut to Nick and Corinne at dinner, which is interrupted by Taylor, who stalks in and calls Corinne a liar. She asks to talk to Nick alone, and tells him that he was lied to, and that Corinne is making Taylor look like a bully, which Taylor insists isn't true, and Taylor goes on to say that the other women in the house don't like Corinne either. Nick says he doesn't think Taylor is a bully and he appreciates her sincerity. Then he returns to Corinne at the table, and says his decision was about where his heart was, not what either woman says about the other. Spoiler: it's in his chest cavity. Nick and Corinne continue their date with making out and staring into each other's eyes. Her boobs are exposed to full effect, enjoying the night air.\n\nCocktail party. The women approach the New Orleans mansion, wearing beautiful dresses which attempt to draw attention away from their massive inferiority complexes. But wait! Chris Harrison says there will be no cocktail party, because Nick knows what he wants to do. And it's have sex with all the women at once. But nobody says that last part. Nick addresses the women and thanks them for an amazing week. The roses are given out one by one to adoring and grateful recipients. And who didn't make the cut? The curly haired bisexual, the tall blonde, and SHARK COSTUME GIRL! I have no idea how she stayed for that long. While the rejects cry and leave, the winner's circle finds out that they're headed to St. Thomas!\n\nNext stop: scenic and beautiful St. Thomas, where the ladies frolic along the shore. Who's your favorite this season? Mine is Rachel, the attorney. But Kristina, the mysterious Russian, gets her first one-on-one. The two fly away on a seaplane. Jasmine cries with jealousy, and the other women comfort her. Nick and Kristina drink beer and kiss on a secluded island. They talk about her family, and he finds her fascinating. He thinks she's guarded and wants to knock down her walls, and we see that in this relationship, he will be the pursuer and she will be the distancer.\n\nBack at the house, Lorna, the maid, introduces herself to the girls. Corinne bonds to her instantly and says she's the St. Thomas version of the nanny she has at home. She is like a small child.\n\nBack on the one-on-one, Nick and Kristina sit down to dinner, and he tries to plumb her depths again. Since it's not fantasy suite time, he must use his words and not his penis. Disappointing. She says that growing up, she didn't really have much, and we can see his rescue fantasy come to life. She says her mom wasn't around much, and she remembers not having any food and having to eat a lipstick. She ran away as a small child and ended up in an orphanage, where her mother never came to visit her. She says many turned to prostitution in Russia, and she didn't want that, so, at age 12, she came to America and left her sister and friends behind for a new life and a new chance. She cries remembering her friends from the orphanage, and this is the most serious we've ever gotten on the Bachelor. Nick talks about her mature grasp and appreciation for life and of course she gets the rose. Don't worry, Kristina, even if Nick doesn't marry you, dudes are going to be coming out of the woodwork to take care of you and make up for your unhappy childhood. Many will be far cuter than Nick.\n\nWe adjourn to a group date on a boat headed to the beach. At the beach, the women play volleyball and show off their hot pre-baby bodies. Nick, it's a feast for the senses. Corinne gets upset that she didn't get enough attention so she goes off to take a nap. Nick goes after her to get her back, which annoys the neonatal nurse. Then, Jasmine gets uber-competitive during the game, out of apparent frustration that she hasn't gotten a one-on-one yet. And something must be in the air, because Vanessa also appears to be having somewhat of a nervous breakdown about not having enough time with Nick. This group date is going awry, with all the women resenting Nick. Even the calm neonatal nurse starts to cry! Nick's voiceover indicates that he's aware that the date is devolving into a disaster. What an insightful guy.\n\nEvening. Nick steals Rachel away after the initial toast, because she's his favorite. She says that she hates group dates, and he says, I would wig out if you left, or something absurd like that. Jasmine says everyone is getting validation except her. Raven says, Jas is making a turn into the emotional side, which is code for going bat#$% crazy. Jasmine tells the camera that she is planning to tell Nick to his face: don't you dare overlook me. That should go well.\n\nNick finally asks to steal Jasmine, and the other women are worried because they know how insane she's acting. Jasmine immediately launches into a diatribe about being overlooked, and how upset she is that she hasn't had a one-on-one yet. She starts crying, saying she sees a future with him and she's been the realest person in this whole thing but hasn't had a chance to show him her true (crazy) self yet. She says she wants to choke him so bad but when she sees how much that freaks him out, she tries to backtrack and say it's a sexual thing called a chokey, and asks if he wants one from her, and she says that she can be the first girl to give him one, and he is even more weirded out, and this gets cringingly (chokingly?) awkward. He then tells her that it may be best to say goodbye. After leaving, she tells the camera that Nick doesn't know what he wants. This is untrue, as it certainly appears that he does not want to be choked.\n\nTwo-on-one with Danielle L. and Whitney. Who the heck is Whitney? Did they just insert her into the show this episode? Oh, she's the Pilates instructor! Nick takes Whitney aside to tell her that she's really attractive. So he's going deep on this date. Next he talks to Danielle L., who apparently is called D-Lo in the house by the women, and tells her how well their first hometown date went, and then he tells her to wait a moment, and he returns to Whitney. He tells Whitney that he can't give her the rose. That was quick, to the point of insulting. She says that it's easier to envision a relationship when you've spent more time with the person, implying that she and he haven't spent as much time together as he has with Danielle L., but he kicks her to the curb anyway. Super weird. Why did he even take her on the damn date? Is he allergic to hot Pilates instructors? Another potential Bachelor Pad contestant. She cries as the helicopter flies away with Nick and Danielle L. inside.\n\nNick and Danielle L. sit down to dinner and talk about how much fun they had dancing on their one-on-one. It is evident that she isn't as smart as he is. He asks her to describe her ideal relationship in a few words. She says love and trust and he says, Adventurous. Raw. WTF. Take a CrossFit class, Nick. Danielle says that she feels that she and Nick are on the same page and that she's falling in love with Nick. But, hearing that, he doesn't look terribly happy. She starts to look worried, and for good reason. He's dead silent. In his interview, he starts crying, saying that he feels differently. He tells her that he wanted to fall in love with her and to give her the rose, but in his heart, he can't. And maybe it's him. And he's sorry. Et cetera. She drives away in the limo, crying, saying maybe he's overanalyzing his relationships, and she doesn't know why he changed his mind about her. Poor Danielle L. Nick worries, Maybe it's me that unable to reciprocate the type of love she's ready to give... Maybe I want this so bad that I'm trying too hard to make it work. Good self-reflection, Nickerdoodle.\n\nNick comes crying to the other women in the hotel, telling them he sent both women home. He shares (unnecessarily) that he had been really into Danielle L., till it fell flat. He cries that his biggest fear is that something like that could happen with the other women, the women whom he is addressing (again, unnecessarily) in this pity party. He says I don't know if I can keep doing this, which is a total overdramatic lie. The women wonder, What happens now? and they watch Nick run off to the limo. Next episode, we see whether Nick really left the show or whether he's having a tantrum that will resolve shortly before the sex dates, I mean, Fantasy Suite dates, start.

Mike Coppola via Getty Images Eleanor Lambert and Diane Lane attend the New York premiere of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice at Radio City Music Hall on March 20, 2016.\n\nDiane Lane knows the challenges and joys of motherhood.\n\nThe actor has a daughter, Eleanor, with ex-husband Christopher Lambert. She later took on the role of stepmother during her nine-year marriage to Josh Brolin. Since becoming a mom in 1993, Lane has shared snippets of her experience, from matters of breastfeeding to work-life balance to parenting books.\n\nIn honor of her birthday, here are 12 quotes about motherhood from Lane.\n\nOn Becoming An Empty Nester\n\nIt's bittersweet, for sure. You get comfortable in the role that you've been in for so long, and then you give them a pair of car keys and you're lucky if you even get a text. It happens pretty quickly, let me tell you. It's very unceremonious, that switchover, but I'll certainly miss her.\n\nOn The Challenge Of Parenthood\n\nI had no idea. There is no rehearsal. Everybody tries to warn you. You don't believe them. It's all true and you should have listened to them. Sleep is something from my youth.\n\nOn Her Daughter's Name\n\nMy grandmother was actually named Eleanor. But we chose it because it had to sound good in French and English. It's a little tricky. Some of the American names don't really click. ... [My husband] wanted to name her Bebe for a while. It seemed like a pinup name.\n\nOn Going Back To Work Shortly After Giving Birth\n\nIt was so heartbreaking for me just to be away from her at that time. I don't know how working moms do it. ... I lost her to the breast. She went on the bottle. I got so mad I cut all of my hair off after we wrapped.\n\nOn Quality Time\n\nI just wanted to curl up in a fetal position with my baby, just smile at her and absorb her. She is pure sunshine.\n\nOn Her Approach To Parenting\n\nI tend to be a pleaser. But I just read a book that completely shifted my behavior as a parent. It's called 'Get Out of My Life, But First Could You Drive Me and Cheryl to the Mall?' by Anthony E. Wolf. They should hand a copy to every mother when their daughters hit 12. The basic premise is, you do not need to justify your decisions as a parent to your children. Your job is to set the boundaries and keep your kids safe. So now, when my daughter says, 'Why, Mom? It's not fair!' my smile just gets bigger and more beatific, but I don't budge and I don't explain. I might say, 'I know it's not fair,' but that's all. Otherwise, you watch your status and your usefulness as a parent disappear. There's a voice inside children that knows right from wrong. I call it listening to your inner Jiminy Cricket. I tell my daughter, 'If you're thinking this is not the best idea, it probably isn't.'\n\nOn The Power Of Parents\n\nI think that there's a through line of the investment in believing in ourselves. And where does that come from? Where does anyone have the audacity to believe in themselves? I think if you look behind the curtain of great people who have accomplished much, there's a parent who believed in that person.\n\nOn Being Present\n\nOne day about a year and a half ago, I realized I can't put these responsibilities in a jar and tend to them later, especially when it comes to time with my family. Life isn't 'when the kids get a little older.' ... Right now is all we've got. ... To me, there's no greater reward than being around people you care about and can be present with. To be at home doing the crossword puzzle cheek to cheek with my daughter — that's a moment.\n\nOn Breastfeeding\n\nNursing is so rewarding emotionally. You are so indispensable in the most primal way.\n\nOn Parenting Teens\n\nScary! Humbling. Poignant. Challenging. Frustrating. Sometimes I think opposable thumbs were invented so teenage girls could use text messaging. And now boys are coming into the picture. I'll get questions on that that just knock my socks off. I'll pretend to be cool about it, but inside I'm ... [pretends to faint]. But, hey, bring it on! I can answer that question about sex and try not to sound insane! These are girls, you must remember, who are growing up watching 'Gossip Girl' and movies like 'Sex and the City.' My daughter saw 'Sex and the City' and said, 'Mom, don't go. You can't handle the sex.'\n\nOn Being A Stepparent\n\nIt gets complicated with merged families. I remember I was upset with the girls about something once and my daughter said to me — in front of my stepdaughter — 'You take everything out on me!' My stepdaughter said, 'Hey, I'm right here.' But it's true — the way I understand stepparenting is you're more the cheerleader than the disciplinarian with your stepchildren.\n\nOn How Motherhood Affected Her Acting
A lesbian softball coach for a Michigan Catholic school was forced to resign after her employer found out she wanted to get married.\n\nKristen Nelson, a coach at West Catholic High School for five years, revealed on Friday that a parent concern about her relationship with her girlfriend had recently provoked a series of unpleasant conversations with school administrators and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids. Nelson said that the Catholic leaders made it clear that if she got married, she wouldn't be able to continue coaching for the school.\n\nSo Nelson decided to resign.\n\nI am hurt and mostly disappointed that I will no longer be able to continue, Nelson wrote in a statement posted on her Facebook page. I hope you can understand that I simply cannot continue to work in an environment that refuses to support me.\n\nNelson, a 2008 graduate of West Catholic High, said that she always wanted and intended to give back to the community I came from, a community my family and I have always loved and supported.\n\nThe coach helped lead her softball team to a 16-15 record, according to MLive.\n\nShe added that she doesn't believe her sexual orientation has ever hindered her ability to coach her team, but, unfortunately, leadership does not agree.\n\nIn a Facebook post published on Sunday, West Catholic High claimed its leaders were saddened and disappointed by Nelson's resignation, especially this close to the softball season.\n\nWhen someone is living outside of Church teaching or participating in behavior not in line with Church teaching and makes it known publicly, they cannot fulfill their primary mission to lead by example, the message read.\n\nThe school insisted that it was not judging Nelson by enforcing Catholic teaching on same-sex marriages and said that the coach was still a welcome and beloved member of our community.\n\nThe administrators said it was Nelson's planned public act of same-sex marriage and not her same-sex attraction that stood in contrast to Catholic teaching. Same-sex attraction is a phrase commonly invoked by conservative religious groups to attack queer relationships by creating a distinction between feeling attracted to someone of the same sex and acting upon those feelings.\n\nThe teachings of the Church are written for happiness, the statement read. This issue is about love and wanting what is best, not necessarily in the immediate moment, but for a lifetime.\n\nHuffPost's requests for comment from West Catholic High were directed to the Diocese of Grand Rapids. Annalise Laumeyer, director of communications for the diocese, refused to confirm whether Nelson was a paid employee of the school or discuss how the diocese learned about the coach's upcoming marriage.\n\nIn a statement, the diocese said that its leader, Bishop David J. Walkowiak, was grateful to the administrators at West Catholic High School for standing by the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAs a mission of the Catholic Church, Catholic schools are places where students come to learn and know the Church's teachings, one of which is the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, the statement read. For this reason, Catholic school administrators, teachers, or staff members that persist in public acts that are contrary to Catholic teachings disqualify themselves from the opportunity to continue in their leadership role within a Catholic school.\n\nOn Facebook, Nelson's girlfriend, Maria Roberts, was critical of how the school treated her partner, saying that this is not how God would treat someone.\n\nYour students will remember this, their parents will remember this, Roberts wrote on Facebook. The players will remember how you pushed away their coach, how you ripped a role model from their lives, how you made it clear that you may preach love but contradict yourself time and time again.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday that the Constitution's ban on excessive fines applies to the states, an outcome that could help efforts to rein in police seizure of property from criminal suspects.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the court's opinion in favor of Tyson Timbs, of Marion, Indiana. Police seized Timbs' $40,000 Land Rover when they arrested him for selling about $400 worth of heroin.\n\nReading a summary of her opinion in the courtroom, Ginsburg noted that governments employ fines out of accord with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence because fines are a source of revenue. The 85-year-old justice missed arguments last month following lung cancer surgery, but returned to the bench on Tuesday.\n\nTimbs pleaded guilty, but faced no prison time. The biggest loss was the Land Rover he bought with some of the life insurance money he received after his father died.\n\nTimbs still has to win one more round in court before he gets his vehicle back, but that seems to be a formality. A judge ruled that taking the car was disproportionate to the severity of the crime, which carries a maximum fine of $10,000. But Indiana's top court said the justices had never ruled that the Eighth Amendment's ban on excessive fines — like much of the rest of the Bill of Rights — applies to states as well as the federal government.\n\nThe case drew interest from liberal groups concerned about police abuses and conservative organizations opposed to excessive regulation. Timbs was represented by the libertarian public interest law firm Institute for Justice.\n\nThe decision is an important first step for curtailing the potential for abuse that we see in civil forfeiture nationwide, said Sam Gedge, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities have dramatically increased their use of civil forfeiture in recent decades. When law enforcement seizes the property of people accused of crimes, the proceeds from its sale often go directly to the agency that took it, the law firm said in written arguments in support of Timbs.\n\nAs it did in earlier cases applying parts of the Bill of Rights to the states, the court based its decision on the part of the 14th Amendment that says no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. That same provision, the due process clause, also was used in cases that established a woman's right to an abortion and knocked down state laws against interracial marriage and gay sex.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was passed after the Civil War to ensure the rights of newly freed slaves.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say he would have used a different part of the 14th amendment to achieve the same result. Thomas has long been a critic of the court's application of the due process clause, which also is found in the Fifth Amendment. He wrote that cases that employ the provision are some of the court's most notoriously incorrect decisions, including the abortion rights landmark case Roe v. Wade and the 1857 Dred Scott case that held that African-Americans were not citizens.\n\nThomas said he would have relied on the Constitution's language forbidding states from making or enforcing any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch also expressed his preference for the privileges or immunities clause.\n\nThe case is Timbs v. Indiana, 17-1091.
Half the fun of watching Netflix's Bridgerton is the over-the-top, delightfully decadent fashion.\n\nThe frothy Regency era rom-com series (produced by Shonda Rhimes) drops us into London high society during a season, a yearly tradition in which debutantes are presented at court to signal their readiness for marriage.\n\nNaturally, they're dressed to the nines. The series' costume designer, Ellen Mirojnick, brings the fashion of 19th century England back to life with vibrant colors; airy, era-specific silhouettes; tons of embroidery and lots of outlandish prints.\n\nLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX The Featherington sisters, Penelope, Prudence and Phillipa, are always dressed in bold prints and vibrant colors.\n\nIt's like a big ice cream sundae with all the toppings, Mirojnick told WWD in a preview of the costumes in mid-December.\n\nIt's a total feast for the eyes, especially in the middle of a pandemic. If you're secretly pining to dress like a Featherington or Bridgerton sister while wearing your sweats and athleisure wear, you're not alone.\n\nAccording to online fashion store Lyst, searches for Regencycore have soared since the show premiered on Christmas Day: There's been a 123% spike in searches for corsets and a 49% spike in pearl and feather headband searches. Searches for long gloves are up 23%, and searches for empire line dresses have jumped 93%.\n\nLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX Empire line dresses are in high demand since the premiere of Netflix's Bridgerton.\n\nYou're probably not going to slip on a super-embellished, empire-waisted gown any time soon, but who says you can't have a little fun in a casual dress that's reminiscent of the Regency era?
KatarzynaBialasiewicz via Getty Images\n\nA marriage therapist ― even one who's worked in the field for years ― can't know a couple's full story by the first therapy session. They can tell quite a bit, though. (A spouse's tendency to avoid eye contact, for instance, reveals more than words could ever say.)\n\nBelow, marriage therapists who have been working with couples for years share nine things they can glean about a couple after the first therapy session.\n\n1. They know when you're lying.\n\nWhat people report in a therapy session has to make sense. If it doesn't, I know one or both are leaving out important information. Part of the challenge is some people cover things up, some are worried about what I'll think of them and others lie or have a distorted sense of reality. ― Becky Whetstone, a marriage family therapist in Little Rock, Arkansas\n\n2. They can tell when third parties are more than just friends.\n\nWe can tell when spouses are already in love with other people. The tell-tale sign? When they adamantly defend 'friendships' that their partners say have been intrusive and or harmful to their relationships. When you love your spouse and want to keep your relationship from splintering, you acknowledge their desperate requests over the other person. ― Laurel Steinberg, a New York-based sexologist and adjunct professor of psychology at Columbia University\n\n3. They read your body language and recognize if it's telling an entirely different story.\n\nExperienced marriage therapists can read code. That means we can look beyond what is being said and learn about the underlying issues by observing the body language of the couple sitting in front of us. When I notice one partner leaning in, reaching across to touch the other, nodding and gesturing in the direction of the other and the other partner leaning away and avoiding eye contact and physical touch, I know we've got a problem. No matter what is being said verbally, the body language is speaking volumes and it's important for me to listen. ― Vikki Stark, a psychotherapist and the director of the Sedona Counselling Center of Montreal\n\n4. They recognize when someone in the relationship is a bully.\n\nThis one is pretty easy because usually the partner tries to bully me. The difference is, I haven't lived with the client for years and had my self-esteem torn to shreds so the bully doesn't scare me. The thing about bullies is that they really will back down if you call their bluff and let them know where the door to the office is if they don't really want to get help. ― Stephanie Buehler, a Southern California-based psychologist\n\n5. They can sense if you're willing to own up to your mistakes.\n\nRight off the bat, I ask each half of the couple to describe for me and for each other why they reached out and how I can be helpful. The answer often involves excellent insights about what they wish their partner could do differently. Then I ask each person if they can describe what they are contributing to the problem. If both people can provide even a modest answer to this question, the couple is well positioned to develop a more fulfilling relationship. I want to see a spark of ownership and awareness. The moment one spouse begins describing their contribution to the problem, a look of warmth and relief often spreads over the other partner's face that transforms the energy in the room. ― Elisabeth J. LaMotte, a psychotherapist and founder of the DC Counseling and Psychotherapy Center\n\n6. They can tell if one spouse is an enabler.\n\nYou know one partner is an enabler because that person answers questions for the other and defends behavior. When I ask something like, 'Do you drink every night?' and a partner rushes to answer, 'She drinks as much as anyone else,' then it makes me feel that maybe this person makes excuses for their spouse's behavior in other realms as well. This often gives rise to a parent-child dynamic where one partner acts in a caretaker role for the other, to a less than functional degree. ― Samantha Rodman, a psychologist in Takoma Park, Maryland\n\n7. They know that you should have pursued therapy a lot sooner.\n\nResearch suggests that most couples wait six years after trouble emerges before they ask for help. We also know that most couples who divorce do so within the first seven years. So therapists know when you're coming in later than you should have. The average couple lives with unhappiness for far too long. ― Zach Brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter\n\n8. They can tell if the couple had a solid foundation to begin with.\n\nAs a marriage therapist I reach to see if there was a time in the relationship when the two people were truly connected and had an intimate bond that we can hopefully restore. Usually, the tension softens as couples tell me about their courtship and the qualities that drew them to each other. When a couple is so entrenched in a negative space that they have difficulty recalling a special time in their relationship, resolution is less likely. ― Linda Lipshutz, a marriage and family therapist in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida\n\n9. They know if one partner is already out the door.
Anne Edgar - unsplash\n\nCreating a strong marriage is hard work. A truth I was clueless about on my wedding day. Back then, I thought marriage would be fun and fabulous, like in fairy tales. As a veteran wife of 32 years, and a Marriage Coach for over 20 years, I've learned these 10 things about men, in general, and my husband in particular, that have made me a better wife!\n\n1. His efforts to 'fix it' are expressions of love and care.\n\nMen like to do something. Simply listening and empathizing with us doesn't make them feel effective or helpful. Their suggestions and strategies to solve problems is how men show their love.\n\n2. He needs time to process and think during our conversations.\n\nMy mind works at warp speed, and I communicate for a living. My husband is a methodical thinker and a high introvert. Just imagine our conversations! Once I learned that his silence meant he was thinking and processing, and not ignoring me, I learned to stay quiet and wait, instead of adding more information, asking questions, or changing topics.\n\n3. He tends to compartmentalize.\n\nPicture the difference between waffles and spaghetti. Waffles have neat, individual squares. Spaghetti is a mass of intertwined and interconnected noodles. Men think and process emotions and interactions like waffles, one at a time. One morning, my husband and I had an argument, and the issue remained unresolved when he left for work. I fretted all day. Midday, I called him to chat, only to find out that the tension in our relationship wasn't on his mind or disrupting his day at all. Our argument was in another waffle square, and would be revisited later. He was at work, mind, body, and emotions.\n\n4. He doesn't want to be my best girlfriend.\n\nGirlfriends can talk for hours about every nuance, possibility, and angle of any subject. John prefers the shorter and more succinct version, without endless processing and discussion. Shifting my expectations and viewing him as my best guy friend helped lessen pressure and tension.\n\n5. He considers sitting side by side watching sports, or doing other activities together, without any conversation, as quality time together!\n\nThis is radically different from my idea of quality time, but I am learning to lean in and enjoy this time together.\n\n6. He rarely responds to my nagging him.\n\nShocker… right!? Asking him and reminding him only once or twice is more likely to work.\n\n7. He is emotional too, but expresses it differently than me.\n\nRecently we watched a movie together and John's eyes teared up. He didn't say a word, but clearly he felt moved by the storyline. I wanted to talk about what he was feeling, to ask what provoked his emotion. Instead, I smiled tenderly and held his hand while the movie continued.\n\n8. He cannot read my mind.\n\nWhile this would be a terrific superpower for husbands to have, the only way they know our thoughts and feelings, is if we tell them!\n\n9. He wants to know that I respect and appreciate him.\n\nRemembering to thank him for all the efforts he makes, on behalf of me and our family, offering words of praise, being interested in the things he wants to discuss, all communicate my respect for him.\n\n10. He connects more through sexual intimacy than verbal/emotional intimacy.\n\nSex IS his way of connecting. This is the Chicken and egg question of every marriage. Wives say, If we connected more emotionally, we would have more sex. Husbands usually respond, If we had sex more often, I would connect more emotionally. This is true for us, and almost every marriage I have worked with in the past 20 years. Naming this as normal has helped me understand him and connect in his way more often!\n\nWhile every marriage is unique, these 10 things can apply to most because they are true about most men. Learning them has helped me be a better wife, as well as equipped me to help couples improve their marriages as well.

Courtesy of Anton Komar I'll never forget when a producer told me, 'Watching you interact with everyone, it's safe to say that you may be too normal for this.'\n\nI still remember the exact moment when a casting agent reached out to me about auditioning for a role on MTV's Are You the One? I was in college and had been doing a little modeling. The casting agent said she liked my look and all I had to do was be single (check!) and be open to finding love (check!) and possibly winning money (check!!).\n\nI really didn't think I'd be cast because I'd never watched reality TV (except for the Food Network) and I've never been particularly dramatic. However, I am a strong believer that when an opportunity lands at your feet, you should be open-minded and give it your all. So, that's exactly what I did. Two phone interviews and a couple of video chats later, I was being flown out to Los Angeles for a final round of casting in front of a panel of producers.\n\nThe show brings together 20 single people ― 10 women and 10 men on most seasons ― to try to find their perfect match. They have 10 weeks to discover who they are meant to be with (as determined by the producers), and if there are 10 pairs of perfect matches at the end of the show, the 20 contestants split one million dollars.\n\nThere have been seven more seasons of Are You the One? since my season, which was the first and aired in 2014, and they've all been a bit different, especially the latest season, which featured 20 pansexual individuals. But what made my season completely unique is that my fellow castmates and I had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. We had no idea what the budget for the show would be or whether it would even get a prime-time spot when it aired. The producers didn't even know the name of the show until after filming and we were introduced to the premise of the series in front of the cameras at our first challenge.\n\nMy family thought I was absolutely crazy. My mom and dad, who are immigrants from Taiwan and fairly traditional, always try their hardest to support my decisions but they definitely lost some sleep over this one.\n\nMy friends were all extremely excited for me. Some were a little confused because I was never the type to want fame or try reality TV. I had always been that responsible friend who would volunteer to be the designated driver. But I do have a surprisingly wild streak.\n\nAt one point I pulled a producer aside and said I wanted to go home. I didn't think I was cut out for reality TV and I felt completely over my head.\n\nWhen I initially got to the Are You the One? house, which was located in Kauai, Hawaii, I was overwhelmed by the huge personalities of the other contestants. I thought I had a standout personality, but when I met everyone else, I immediately became more reserved.\n\nThere was no way I was going to fight for camera time ― that just wasn't how I operate. Two days into filming I hadn't yet had a real conversation with Ethan (who ended up being my perfect match and now my husband) and I was feeling really out of place. At one point I pulled a producer aside and said I wanted to go home. I didn't think I was cut out for reality TV and I felt completely over my head.\n\nI'll never forget when another producer told me, Watching you interact with everyone, it's safe to say that you may be too normal for this. Regardless, she talked me into giving it a few more days. That same night, I sat down with Ethan and we had our very first conversation. Something big and dramatic was going on with Shanley, another contestant, so the camera crew wasn't hovering around Ethan and me, which probably made me feel more comfortable.\n\nWe talked about everything from our family values to our hobbies, which were remarkably similar. Honestly, we didn't even have to say much ― the vibe and presence of Ethan was so warm and comforting that I immediately felt at home with him. I was surprised by that, but our almost instantaneous and seemingly deep connection gave me the motivation and confidence to want to ride out the rest of the show.\n\nBeyond that conversation, there was a moment that didn't make it on air when Ethan really took my breath away. While we were talking, we heard some of the other cast members getting ready to play spin the bottle. As fun as that sounded, I didn't want my time alone with Ethan to be cut short. Before I knew what was happening, Ethan had a cheeky little smile on his face and he was leading me to the side of the house behind some bushes where he proceeded to give me the biggest kiss. It was what most people would refer to as a fairy tale kiss ― he spun me around, dipped me, and I swore the world was melting around me. He told me he took his chance right then and there because he didn't want our first kiss to be during a stupid game of spin the bottle. I was officially smitten.\n\nAfter that initial spark with Ethan, I felt more comfortable really being myself. Although committing to him might not have made for the most dramatic storyline, I know that it helped to lay a solid foundation for our future marriage and parenthood.\n\nCourtesy of Cheryl LaPlante Some of the cast on MTV's Are You the One? (Season 1).\n\nThe funny thing about finding love on reality TV is that you're getting to know people for who they are without any of the distractions that can come from prejudging them based on their social media reputation or their friends or sizing them up based on what kind of car they drive or job they have. Living in the Are You the One? house meant you could escape some of the superficial things that can play a big factor in making or breaking attraction in the real world.\n\nThe first time Ethan and I saw each other after the show was over and we'd left Hawaii, I was so nervous. It's one thing to feel really connected to someone while you're both isolated in some absurd alternate reality, but it's quite another to take that connection and try to make it work in day-to-day life.\n\nStill, as nervous as I was, Ethan was even more nervous. He had been driving an old beat-up car and was waiting tables to get through college. Did I care about any of that? Absolutely not! But it was not something he boasted about in Hawaii or even brought up. I think he thought the reality of his lifestyle would scare me away. But the exact opposite was true: It wasn't until I visited Ethan in Colorado and saw him exactly as he was, living his life, that I actually fell in love with him.\n\nOff-camera, Ethan was so much more himself ― confident, charming and so incredibly thoughtful. It was so refreshing getting to know each other better without cameras everywhere. I think things started getting really serious when he came out to visit me in Texas and I got sick with pneumonia. I stayed in bed and slept all day and Ethan just hung out in my living room by himself and took care of me until his flight home.\n\nAlthough my parents were extremely hesitant about how quickly and seriously I was falling for my TV show boyfriend, the moment they met him they understood why he was my perfect match. I first introduced Ethan to my parents at a super authentic Chinese restaurant (one of my faves) and not only did he eat absolutely everything that was served, he loved it and proceeded to learn some Chinese phrases. My parents were definitely impressed. On top of that, Ethan and I were constantly finishing each other's sentences during dinner. I had never been in a relationship that fit so perfectly and my parents could tell.\n\nMy friends also fell in love with Ethan the moment they met him. However, one thing that did concern my Texan friends was that he couldn't two-step to save his life! We went to a country bar with one of my best girlfriends and when she took him on the floor for a spin, he not only stepped on her ― he fell on her. But other than the dancing, Ethan was perfect in my friend's eyes.\n\nMaking a TV relationship work after the filming ends might be the toughest thing I've ever had to do. Fans might assume that because we were a 'perfect match,' our relationship has been nothing but a fairy tale. They couldn't be more wrong.\n\nMaking a TV relationship work after the filming ends might be the toughest thing I've ever had to do. Fans might assume that because we were a perfect match, our relationship has been nothing but a fairy tale. They couldn't be more wrong. When the filming was over, we weren't supposed to be seen with each other until months later ― after the final episode aired ― to prevent any spoilers. But, of course, it would have been impossible to carry on a relationship without seeing each other for that long. So we snuck around to spend time together anyway.\n\nAs I noted earlier, it was during this time that we truly fell in love with each other. But what no one prepares you for is the time when your show starts airing, more and more people begin paying attention to you, and you can't be public about your relationship. This is the period when many reality TV couples break up.\n\nFans were sending Ethan uninvited nudes on every social media platform and people were tweeting hateful things about us as an interracial couple. One of the most hurtful tweets was somewhere along the lines of Golden boy Ethan deserves better ― go back to China to pick rice, Amber. But that was only one of hundreds of awful comments that people posted in hopes of driving a wedge between us ― or just to be cruel. We had to be the bigger people and understand that being in a public relationship means our communication is that much more important.\n\nEvery time Ethan got an uninvited nude or sexy DM, he'd show me and we'd laugh together about it. Although being OK with that is something few normal relationships ever have to withstand, we had to put our jealousy aside and realize that we were not in a normal relationship. There was no guidebook for making a reality TV relationship work. We had to communicate, set our boundaries and figure it out on our own.\n\nIf you had asked me eight years ago if I thought I would ever be on a reality TV show and then get married to another contestant and have two children together, I would have laughed in your face. I never saw this coming, but I am so happy that I took the leap and embraced the opportunity.\n\nCourtesy of Laura Morsman The author with her husband, Ethan, and one of their daughters.\n\nBeing on Are You the One? was definitely a wild experience. Not only was it a once-in-a-lifetime kind of fun, but I learned so much about myself and gained some real self-awareness about how I handled things under pressure ― while isolated with a bunch of strangers and having much of it broadcast to the world.\n\nI'd definitely do reality TV again, although it would have to be the right kind of show. The moment Ethan and I became parents, we flipped a switch. Nurturing our family and raising strong children is now our priority, and that means we'd stay far away from any show that entertains viewers with catty drama (which is, honestly, most of them). However, if a more family-oriented opportunity were to present itself (like Dancing With the Stars, The Amazing Race or something on HGTV), I think we'd be up for it.\n\nFinally, I never expected that reality TV would give us the crazy yet loving MTV family that we now have. No matter what kind of drama went down while in the Are You the One? house, being on such a unique adventure with these other people created a bond among us. Most of our cast is still on good terms with each other (minus the ones who had some ugly breakups), and I love that the show's recent availability on Netflix, nearly seven years after Season 1 originally aired on MTV, has reunited a lot of us. Over the years, we've kept up mostly with Ryan, Adam, Shanley, Jessica and Wes. Uncle Adam lives in Austin and has come to our kids' birthday parties and baby shower.\n\nEight seasons of Are You the One? later, we are the only perfect match from the series that is still in a solid and successful relationship.\n\nUltimately, even though being level-headed, understanding and patient isn't the sexiest thing on TV, it is exactly what helped us become the only perfect match to survive whatever the world has thrown at us. It's also provided a strong-as-hell foundation for us to build our amazing family on. Ethan and I believe that if we can stay together under the scrutiny of a very public relationship, there's nothing we can't do together.\n\nBorn and raised in Austin, Texas, to Taiwanese parents, Amber Lee Diamond is now married to Ethan, her perfect match from Season 1 of MTV's Are You the One? They have two children. In addition to being a devoted wife and mother, Amber loves to cook, get in a good workout, share her favorite fashion finds, discuss Asian American representation in Hollywood and, of course, offer relationship tips.

I often get asked why I work such long hours at the age of 21, when I could be traveling, partying or just generally doing what most people my age do. It's a fair question as running a business at 21 isn't the most common thing in the world. However, I strongly believe there is no better time to launch a business. In this article I'll discuss some of the main benefits but also some of the downsides of being a young entrepreneur.\n\nNo Real Commitments\n\nThe entrepreneurial lifestyle is suited to younger people. Most entrepreneurs in their 20s have not taken on any major life responsibilities such as mortgages, children or marriage. The time it takes to create and establish a successful business means people with children and other responsibilities can struggle to manage it all. Having no real commitments means you're able to focus solely on your business.\n\nThe older you get and the more responsibilities you have, the harder it is to commit to something as massive as starting a business. The risk can be too much for some people. I'm by no means saying you can't do this, I'm just stating it's harder.\n\nLet's take Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, for example. Mark was only 19 when he launched Facebook (thefacebook.com back then). He did it from his Harvard dorm room. No commitments (other than his University work), just all the time in the world to create what is now one of the biggest businesses in the world.\n\nYou can use Your Age to Your Advantage\n\nSomething I've learned over the years is that people are willing to help you. You just need to ask. And there's nothing wrong with asking for help. Being younger also gives you a distinct advantage when it comes to asking for help because people tend to be more open to helping younger people.\n\nI've been able to get a lot of meetings with some big names by just playing to my age. In the business and entrepreneurial world, there's a lot of giving back. Entrepreneurs who have made it love helping young entrepreneurs and so why not take advantage of that? Send some emails to business owners that you want to talk to. Tell them you're a young entrepreneur and ask if they'd be willing to meet and give you some feedback on your business idea! I guarantee you'll get some replies.\n\nTime is on Your Side\n\nThis might be an obvious statement but it shouldn't be overlooked. Starting a business in your twenties gives you so much time to learn. You can fail and still have years and years to develop and adapt.\n\nThis also links back to having no commitments. If you do fail, it literally doesn't matter. As long as you learn from it.\n\nOne of the biggest things I've learnt recently is the importance of patience. Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of VaynerMedia states the single biggest reason businesses fail is because they lack patience. Being a young entrepreneur, you have the luxury of being able to be patient because you have such a long time to build a successful business.\n\n\n\nIt's Not All Glamorous\n\nStarting your own business might sound great, especially when you're young but you have to be prepared for the downsides as well. The reality is, your social life will probably suffer. Whilst all of your friends will be partying and generally having a good time, you'll be working. You'll be skint and will probably have a lot of sleepless nights.\n\nBut if you're a true entrepreneur, you wouldn't have it any other way. I certainly wouldn't.\n\nGavin
On-screen representation for women in Hollywood has improved steadily over the last few years — but not all progress is equal, a new study shows.\n\nThe number of female characters in box office hits reached a recent historic high in 2019, with 40 of the year's top 100 highest-grossing films featuring female protagonists, according to It's a Man's (Celluloid) World, released Wednesday by San Diego State University's Center For the Study of Women in Television and Film.\n\nHowever, the annual study found that most of those gains went to white women.\n\nAmong all of the female characters in the films analyzed in the study, 68% of them were white. White women made up an even higher percentage — 70% — of major characters, which the study defined as appearing in more than one scene and are instrumental to the action of the story.\n\nRepresentation for some women of color decreased slightly from 2018. For example, the percentage of Black female characters declined to 20% in 2019 from 21% the year earlier, according to the study. The percentage of characters who were Asian women decreased to 7%, the same as in 2017. The number had risen to 10% in 2018 — but as the study noted, those gains were due largely to one film: the blockbuster rom-com Crazy Rich Asians, the first major studio movie in 25 years to feature a majority-Asian cast.\n\nLatina representation increased slightly, to 5% in 2019 from 4% the year earlier, the study found.\n\nMovies released by mainstream studios, the researchers pointed out, showed particular gains in the number of female roles.\n\nStill, the study showed persistent problems across the board. For example, the ages of characters for female performers still trend younger than those for men, as female characters experience a precipitous drop from their 30s to their 40s, and few women age into their 60s, the study said.\n\nIn addition, many roles for women still focus on their personal lives, like marriage or children, rather than their professional lives. By contrast, men on-screen were more likely to be depicted in primarily work-related roles and have an identifiable occupation, according to the research.\n\nAnd the results show Hollywood is still nowhere near gender parity. Overall, audiences were almost twice as likely to see male characters as female characters in the top-grossing films of 2019, the authors noted.\n\nThe study also adds to research that shows a correlation between on-screen and behind-the-scenes representation. When women are hired in positions of power, like producing, directing, and writing, they are more likely to create movies with women in prominent roles on-screen.\n\nA study of female directors released last week by the University of Southern California's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that the percentage of women directing major Hollywood films rose significantly in 2019. Yet the report stressed that progress for women of color in the director's chair has been slower than it has been for their white counterparts.\n\nThe uneven progress on Hollywood representation has also been reflected at the top of the movie industry. Major awards like the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs (the U.K.'s equivalent of the Oscars), and the Directors Guild of America awards all failed to nominate any women for their top directing prizes this year, despite a number of worthy contenders. Some Oscar prognosticators are predicting a similar result when the Academy Awards nominations are unveiled on Monday.\n\nTuesday's BAFTA nominations also included zero nominations for women actors of color, with Scarlett Johansson and Margot Robbie each receiving two nominations. No male actors of color were nominated for BAFTAs, either.
My friend knew that I wanted to meet someone ― not even to get serious, I think just to get laid, to be completely honest with you ― and he brought Karl, she told British Vogue in June about their first meeting. I instantly felt something ― then he turned around and started talking to the blond girl next to him, and I was, like, 'Wait, what?' But he later told me that he was just nervous.\n\nKravitz announced their engagement in an interview with Rolling Stone in October 2018, saying that he popped the question while the two were at home a little drunk after his plan to propose in Paris fell through.\n\nHe nailed it, she told the magazine. And I love that it wasn't this elaborate plan in Paris. It was at home, in sweatpants.
Claudia Daut/ Reuters Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, son of Cuba's President Fidel Castro, talks to Argentine human right activist and member of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo group Hebe de Bonafini during the inauguration of the International Book Fair in Havana February 8, 2007. REUTERS/Claudia Daut/File Photo\n\nHAVANA (Reuters) - The eldest son of late Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, committed suicide on Thursday aged 68 after being treated for months for depression, Cuban state-run media reported.\n\nThe nuclear scientist, also known as Fidelito, or Little Fidel, because of how much he looked like his father, had initially been hospitalized and then continued treatment as an outpatient.\n\nCastro Diaz-Balart, who had been attended by a group of doctors for several months due to a state of profound depression, committed suicide this morning, Cubadebate website said.\n\nFidelito, who had the highest public profile of all Castro's children, was born in 1949 out of his brief marriage to Mirta Diaz-Balart before he went on to topple a U.S.-backed dictator and build a communist-run state on the doorstep of the United States during the Cold War.\n\nThrough his mother, Castro Diaz-Balart was the cousin of some of Castro's most bitter enemies in the Cuban American exile community, U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and former U.S. congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart.\n\nHe was also the subject of a dramatic custody dispute between the two families as a child.\n\nCuba scholars say his mother took him with her to the United States when he was aged five after announcing she wanted a divorce from Castro, while he was imprisoned for an attack on the Moncada military barracks in Santiago.\n\nCastro was able to bring Fidelito back to Cuba after the 1959 revolution.\n\nA multilingual nuclear physicist who studied in the former Soviet Union, Castro Diaz-Balart was head of Cuba's national nuclear program from 1980 to 1992, and spearheaded the development of a nuclear plant on the Caribbean's largest island until his father fired him.\n\nCuba halted its plant plans that same year because of a lack of funding after the collapse of Cuba's trade and aid ties with the ex-Soviet bloc and he largely disappeared from public view appearing at the occasional scientific conference or diplomatic event.\n\nFidelito had been working for his uncle President Raul Castro as a scientific counselor to the Cuban Council of State and Vice-president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences at the time of his death.\n\nA former British ambassador to Cuba, Paul Hare, who lectures at Boston University's Pardee School of Global Studies, said Castro Diaz-Balart had seemed thoughtful, rather curious about the world beyond Cuba at a dinner in Boston two years ago.\n\nBut he seemed a bit weary about having to be a Castro, rather than himself, Hare said.\n\nJonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a Cuba expert at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, said Fidelito had provided him with invaluable help in the 1990s while he was writing a book on Cuba's nuclear program.\n\nIn 2000 they met again at a conference in Moscow and Fidelito worked the room full of international nonproliferation experts, diplomats and journalists with aplomb, speaking no less than four languages -Spanish, English, Russian and French.\n\nBenjamin-Alvarado said he suspected Fidelito's title as scientific advisor was largely ceremonial as his views on energy development were not incorporated into national policies.\n\nHe had written extensively on Cuba's need for developing renewable energy resources, Benjamin-Alvarado said. And yet almost all efforts by the Cuban government were geared to maintaining the status quo of oil dependency.\n\nI imagine that was disappointing for him.\n\nFidelito's death came just over a year after that of his father on Nov. 25, 2016, aged 90.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Lonely thoughtful girl sitting on the floor\n\nFinding inner peace after divorce takes a long, long time for most people. The journey is a struggle that often feels hopeless. It consists of a roller coaster of emotions along with lots of mistakes and self-reflection, mingled with those moments of sheer joy and surprise at inner strength and courage you never knew you had.\n\nOf the tens of thousands of comments and questions I have received over the years, this one might be one of the most inspiring:\n\nDivorce sucks. I did a lot of the wrong things in my marriage and don't blame her for leaving. I own it. I do wish however she stayed to see my transformation and give us another chance. I hate that we can't be together as a family with the kids. I hate some other male figure will be in my kids lives. But I did it and own it. At least I am becoming a better person as a result #getcleanandsober\n\nWhoever this guy is, I want to give him a huge hug and tell him how extremely amazing I think he is.\n\nI don't blame her for leaving.\n\nI own it.\n\nI did it.\n\nI am becoming a better person as a result.\n\nThese are statements that only winners would make. As devastated and knocked down as this guy is, he has STRENGTH and COURAGE, which led him to the one thing I think paves the way to finding inner peace after divorce:\n\nSelf-awareness\n\nHis hash tag at the end: #getcleanandsober speaks volumes. I'm not sure if this guy realizes how special he is. Countless men and women with addiction issues don't have the self-awareness needed to overcome the addiction, in my opinion, even after a divorce. This is a real man who has guts, and I respect him unbelievably.\n\nSelf-awareness is defined as knowing self well, but put in the context of divorce, I think it means having the courage to look in the mirror and say, Hey, a lot of this (or all) was my fault. That is something I RARELY hear from any men or women getting divorced, and so many refuse to take ANY accountability for the split.\n\nThink about it. When asked Why did you get divorced? people answer:\n\nMy husband left me.\n\nMy wife cheated.\n\nMy husband's an asshole.\n\nMy wife's a bitch.\n\nWe grew apart.\n\nWe never loved each other..\n\nThe only time I ever heard someone take blame for any part of his divorce was a couple years ago when I was sitting at a Bears game and I met this guy sitting behind me. I'll never forget. He said,\n\nI really didn't treat my ex-wife like I should have. I loved her so much and I did some really stupid things that I truly regret now. I tried very hard to get her back but couldn't and I have to live with that now.\n\n\n\nIsn't that more refreshing and honest than someone who plays the victim and takes NO RESPONSIBILITY for anything that went wrong?? It's maddening how some people just can't see anything. It's like they are blind. Who knows? Maybe it's easier to point blame at someone else instead of owning up with the intent to do better moving forward.\n\nThe bottom line is, I think to find peace, acceptance and happiness in life after divorce--to really move on, a person needs the courage and strength to become self-aware. Self-awareness is the first step to making changes in your life to be the person you really want to be.\n\nNo one is perfect, but I think we would all agree that each of us strives to continue to grow and evolve into a person we like more and more with each day.\n\nNo one can teach a person how to obtain self-awareness.

You may now kiss the branch, er, bride.\n\nA group of women in Oaxaca, Mexico, recently had a marriage ceremony that was truly tree-mendous: All the grooms were trees. The blushing brides are all activists.\n\nThe mass marriage was meant to draw attention to illegal logging, a serious problem in Mexico, where a third of the land area is covered by forest, U.K.'s Metro reports.\n\nTree bride Dolores Leycigi said the ceremony was a serious statement about the planet's future.\n\nMarrying a tree is a way of protesting, to say that we need to stop exterminating Mother Earth every day, every minute, every second, she tells Ruptly, a news agency, in the video above.\n\nThe marriages aren't legally binding, but tree bride Andrea Tanat said getting hitched with a tree still requires a serious commitment.\n\nI thought it was very interesting that we have a commitment, not only with this tree, but with all of nature, she says to Ruptly. I thought about how much we've already damaged nature, so I decided to come and get married.\n\nYou can see photos of the ceremony below.\n\nPATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images An environmental activist kisses a tree during an event called Marry a Tree in the community of San Jacinto Amilpas, Oaxaca State, Mexico, on Feb. 25, 2018.\n\nPATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images Marry a tree began as a ritual of giving thanks to Mother Earth carried out by the organization Bedani, and later gave way to a symbolic wedding based on Inca customs where women and men marry trees in a rite led by Peruvian actor and environmentalist Richard Torres.\n\nPATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images\n\nPATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images\n\nPATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images A group of environmental activists plant a tree.\n\nPATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images A group of environmental activists hold a traditional ceremony.\n\nPATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images Environmental activists hug and kiss a tree during the event.
Zach Gibson via Getty Images Mat Staver (far right), the founder of Liberty Counsel, at a demonstration outside the Supreme Court on Dec. 12, 2018. After backlash against his opposition to an anti-lynching bill, the group claimed that listing protected categories in the legislation would limit its application.\n\nAfter more than a century of inaction from Congress, the Senate unanimously approved legislation in December that would make lynching a federal hate crime.\n\nBut some conservative evangelical Christian activists are upset that the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act contains language that specifically protects people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nMat Staver, the founder of the conservative litigation group Liberty Counsel, told the Christian news site OneNewsNow that his team is talking to House politicians to ensure that the act is stripped of this inclusive language.\n\nThe old saying is once that camel gets the nose in the tent, you can't stop them from coming the rest of the way in, he said in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nWhile emphasizing that he's generally in favor of banning lynching, Staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer Americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts.\n\nThis is a way to slip it in under a so-called anti-lynching bill, and to then to sort of circle the wagon and then go for the juggler [sic] at some time in the future, he said.\n\nLiberty Counsel has spent years advocating against LGBTQ rights, prioritizing the religious liberty of conservative Christians over the civil rights of queer Americans. The organization represented Kim Davis, the now-former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical Christian heroine, comparing her at one point to Jewish people who were persecuted by the Nazis.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Staver (left) at a news conference discussing a trial on same-sex marriages in San Francisco in 2006. In a recent interview he said his team is talking to House politicians to ensure that the anti-lynching bill is stripped of language protecting LGBT people.\n\nOn its surface, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act isn't about queer rights. The bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. According to the NAACP, lynching was used after the Civil War to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in America from 1882 to 1968.\n\nSince a new session of Congress has begun, the Senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the House that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.\n\nAs of now, the Senate bill defines lynching as two or more people willfully caus[ing] bodily injury because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nStaver told OneNewsNow that if passed, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nPizer said LGBTQ Americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, only a minority of states have laws that specifically protect queer people.\n\nLambda Legal, the ACLU, and other progressive organizations have been pushing for the passage of the Equality Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination against queer people in employment, housing, education and other areas of their lives.\n\nBecause there continues to be confusion and debate about whether LGBTQ people already are legally equal — and whether or not we should be equal — we need the law to be inclusive and crystal clear, Pizer told HuffPost in an email.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Mike Huckabee (left), Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis and Staver, her lawyer, after her release from jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Kentucky. Liberty Counsel has for years advocated against LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn response to backlash it received for Staver's position on the anti-lynching bill, Liberty Counsel released a statement Thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the OneNewsNow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would limit the law's application.\n\nLynching should be prohibited no matter the person's reason for committing this violent crime, Staver said in the statement.\n\nThe organization also said it has received death threats over the issue.\n\nIn a YouTube video defending the organization, Jonathan Alexandre, Liberty Counsel's public policy director, said that some politicians and media organizations are using lynching's horrible history to push unrelated political agendas. He confirmed that Liberty Counsel is questioning members of Congress about the created list of protected categories.\n\nThe historical victims of lynching should not, as I do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda, he said.\n\nLiberty Counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes LGBTQ Americans should not be treated as a protected class.\n\nPizer said she believes Liberty Counsel has repeatedly used an ends-justify-the-means approach to furthering its goals.\n\nWith the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against LGBTQ people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension, she said. That it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by Christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-LGBT advocacy can become.
Photo by Michelle Herrera, Muse Moments Photo The author and her husband during the Chinese lion dance that was part of their wedding weekend.\n\nI finally feel like I don't owe my parents anything anymore.\n\nThis was the heavy confession I told our couple's counselor last August, as my husband and I returned from our honeymoon in Hawaii. It was a deep sigh, a release from the weight of so many years of tiger parenting deeply ingrained in me as the child of immigrants.\n\nMy parents came to the U.S. from Taiwan in 1982, lured by the opportunity to build a new life. They adopted Western names, William and Mimi, to better assimilate into American society. While my father had dabbled as a small-time soap opera actor and my mother briefly studied fashion design, they hung up these dreams for more sensible endeavors: working as a waiter and waitress in a family friend's restaurant. As the children of Chinese Nationalists who lost everything when they retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War in 1950, they simply understood when it was time to grow up.\n\nWe did not have much as I was growing up, and my childhood was filled with the expectation that I would be the future of my family. This was particularly true for my mother's side of the family, of which I was the first American-born grandchild.\n\nWe did not have much as I was growing up, and my childhood was filled with the expectation that I would be the future of my family.\n\nFor the first five years of my life, I was sent overseas to live in Japan while my parents worked long hours in the restaurant in Dallas. In Yokohama, my mother's sister and her Japanese husband had no children and they cared for me as their own. They were loving and doting, but the price of their guardianship was the constant daily reminder that I would eventually need to return the favor. Will you feed us someday? Will you bathe us when we are old? Can we live with you? Look at everything we do for you. Look at how much we love you ― do you love us, too?\n\nSlowly, I learned to oblige with a meek nod and to mumble some satisfactory answers, hoping they would change the subject. In those formative years, I learned to give emotional support, but never found the words to ask for it myself.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S. to begin grade school, I was relieved of the daily questioning I received in Japan, but quickly learned that life in America was all work and no play. For Christmas one year, my parents gifted me a Hooked on Phonics program to ensure that no one would mistakenly enroll their daughter in an English as a Second Language class. A few months later, my mother asked my father for a piano for her birthday so that I could begin music lessons. When we were able to afford a computer, they brought one home -– a clunky, grey NEC -– so that I could learn to type well before my peers.\n\nMy parents spent every dollar making sure I was at the top of my class for the components they valued: academics and white-collar office skills. For years, they shuttled me from piano and violin lessons to advanced math classes and SAT prep. And each year, they asked for perfect grades, glittering trophies from piano competitions and an obedient daughter.\n\nMy parents spent every dollar making sure I was at the top of my class for the components they valued: academics and white-collar office skills.\n\nThis life is not new to millions of mixed-culture Asians growing up across the globe. A quick scouring of Subtle Asian Traits, a popular Facebook group for relatable posts on Asian culture, yields tons of stories related to Asian parenting. Many of us have carried this burden with us well into adulthood: We must make our parents proud, we must provide for our families, and most importantly, we cannot fail because they sacrificed so much.\n\nFor me, this pressure has always manifested in the form of a singular, overarching goal throughout different junctures of my life. As a youth, I was expected to graduate at the top of my high school class and get into an Ivy League university. In my 20s, I had to land a well-paying job and establish a solid career. And now, in my 30s, I needed to find a life partner they approved of and get married. Done, done and done.\n\nGrowing up, I never questioned the impact of my upbringing and carried it with me in stride. It gave me immense pride knowing that the tireless work ethic and focus my parents had instilled in me could inspire my best moments. I thanked them in my high school graduation speech as valedictorian. I gifted my first year-end bonus to my parents entirely in cash, knowing my father would never deposit a check.\n\nWhile we argued often during my formative years, my teenage rebelliousness in action only went as far as choosing, against their wishes, to participate in a school play my junior year of high school and staying out until midnight the summer between high school and college. Deep down, I knew that they loved me and only meant well –- after all, the price of success was having a little less fun than everybody else.\n\nNow, at 31, I've examined my upbringing through the harsh lens of depression, anxiety and imposter syndrome. Each time a major life event triggered a need for therapy, I desperately sought to understand, Why am I not happy? Why is this still not enough?\n\nThrough a handful of failed relationships in my late 20s, I unearthed a whole slew of unpleasant side effects that I carried with me into adulthood: difficulty showing weakness and asking for help, a constant need to be the best, and endlessly seeking external approval.\n\nNow at 31, I've examined my upbringing through the harsh lens of depression, anxiety and imposter syndrome.\n\nPerhaps the hardest thing for me to stop doing is that I make my life much harder than it has to be, because I expect extraordinary things of myself every single day. I was devastated to realize that tiger parenting had taught me how to achieve, but never how to truly live.\n\nAnd so, my wedding meant so much more to me than just a chance to celebrate the love my husband and I had nurtured over the years. It was my ticket out of the mental prison of expectations that my family had laid the foundations for, and that I had continued to build around myself – a chance to show my parents that I understood them and a way for me to make peace with myself.\n\nMy parents were very hands-off throughout the wedding planning process. They didn't ask for much, but they didn't need to. I had been to enough family weddings to know what was expected of me: a tea ceremony, a red qipao and a father giving away his daughter. I also knew that this wedding would be a reflection of my parents, and I had to give them something to be proud of, to honor them and to recognize their sacrifices.\n\nLike so many things in our family –- feelings, illness, conflict –- this was just another unspoken understanding. With the weight of this pressure on me (much of it self-imposed), I broke down multiple times throughout the last year of wedding planning. Would they notice the little touches? Oranges to signify wealth, chopstick favors for fertility, roast pigs to symbolize the bride's chastity? Would they be able to hear the playlist I had painstakingly curated, full of nostalgic Chinese ballads from the 1980s?\n\nFor months, I agonized over tiny touches, dug deep into my childhood to find the right details, and feared if it was not good enough, it would all be a missed opportunity.\n\nI knew that my wedding would be a reflection of my parents, and I had to give them something to be proud of, to honor them and to recognize their sacrifices.\n\nAnd so, last August, my husband and I got married in beautiful Mammoth Lakes –- a destination wedding in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California that reflected our love of the great outdoors. To properly honor our Chinese heritage and to make the travel worthwhile for our guests, I insisted that we do the traditional Chinese tea ceremony and a 10-course dinner banquet the day before our actual wedding. We rented a rustic, raw space, hired the best Chinese restaurant we could find in the area to cater and planned for an evening of dance and musical performances.\n\nI also designed and hand-made most of our decorations to save money: a 4-foot diameter double happiness sign, 1,000 paper cranes strung up in garlands to honor my Japanese relatives, hand-cut menus and table numbers printed at Office Depot, meticulously wrapped floral arrangements and so much more.\n\nPhoto by Michelle Herrera, Muse Moments Photo The author's mother giving a speech at the American wedding reception.\n\nAs the event came together that Saturday, I was enraptured watching my parents throughout the night. From the first few thumps on the drum, my mother's face lit up in delight as the lion dancers made their grand entrance for a daring bench routine. They clapped along enthusiastically to an upbeat tai chi dance choreographed by my friends from a college dance troupe. And as my husband's cousin performed a moving rendition of the Butterfly Lover's Concerto, I could see my father's eyes welling up knowing too well why I had chosen this musical number.\n\nI had poured my heart and soul into this event, and I left that evening with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that my parents understood the day had been orchestrated for them ― my ultimate gift in appreciating all they have done for me.\n\nYet the closure I got from our wedding weekend actually came from our American-style wedding day. My husband encouraged me to give a speech about my parents and I found myself at a loss for words. While I felt relieved, even somewhat triumphant by the way Saturday had unfolded, my feelings toward my parents were still a complicated, tangled mess. I had spent my whole life trying to prove myself to my parents and meet the unrealistic expectations they had heaped on me from a young age. I grew up knowing that while I was loved, I was also an investment to my family. I had not experienced a normal childhood. But look at what we had to show for my troubles!\n\nI grappled with this never-ending cycle of nagging resentment and immense guilt toward my parents, a constant inner battle between my American independence and Chinese reverence.\n\nI could not help but recognize that they only meant well and had paved the way for me to have a better life. Like so many of my peers, I grappled with this never-ending cycle of nagging resentment and immense guilt toward my parents, a constant inner battle between my American independence and Chinese reverence.\n\nOn the Sunday morning of our wedding, I finally found the right words to express what I felt. I realized I wanted to tell them that I had been watching them, observing quietly and learning from the way their relationship grew through the years. Under a canopy of lush red florals, I told the story of my parents' whirlwind romance: How they met during a typhoon, married after three months of dating and moved to a new country together. I shared that they were not college-educated but had forged fulfilling careers for themselves in Dallas, where my father runs the city's leading Chinese newspaper and my mother found her calling as a professional bridal seamstress.\n\nI spoke of my family's harrowing experience with cancer, when my mother was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, and how I came to comprehend real, unconditional love by watching my father care for her on a daily basis throughout those difficult years. But most importantly, I told my parents that they no longer needed to worry about me because I had married a man who treated me the way my father treated my mother.\n\nI proudly proclaimed that I recognized that they tried their best, that what they did for me was more than enough, and that I loved them so much. The irony is not lost on me, that the same words I wanted to hear my whole life were the words I tearfully told them as a newly married woman.\n\nThe irony is not lost on me, that the same words I wanted to hear my whole life were the words I tearfully told them as a newly married woman.\n\nLater that evening during our father-daughter dance, I quietly asked my father if he was happy with the wedding. He replied, In this lifetime, I have never been happier.\n\nAs the post-wedding bliss begins to dissipate these last few months, I still feel as if a weight has been lifted. In some ways, marriage was the most significant milestone to usher me into adulthood. My parents have long let go of trying to dictate my life, but these days I've also let go of the resentment I've harbored all these years. I've vowed to take the lessons from this experience to help me be a better mother to my own children ― to let them live normal lives, express their emotions and, most importantly, learn how to be happy.\n\nI am sure that my depression will rear its head again in the coming years and I will fall into old patterns from time to time. My marriage will have difficult days ahead; my mother has already begun speculating whether I am pregnant or not, and when the time comes, I will torment myself over what it means to be a good mother. But for now, I share this story because it is worth celebrating a rare moment in which two vastly different Asian generations can reach a deep understanding of the love they have for each other. For now, I feel free.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story or experience you want to share? Send your story description to pitch@huffpost.com.
A dean at a New Jersey university resigned saying the school's decision to not consider bringing Chick-fil-A to campus because of its opposition to the LGBTQ community made her feel like I had been punched in the stomach.\n\nCynthia Newman, former dean of Rider University's College of Business Administration, said her views as a very committed Christian and the fast food chain's views mirror one another.\n\nNewman's resignation was first reported Tuesday by Campus Reform, a conservative news site that bills itself as a higher education watchdog.

By this point, we're probably all familiar with the idea that social media creates echo chambers. Even though we essentially have everyone in the world at our fingertips, we inevitably fall back into our in-groups. HuffPost can reveal that ― shock, horror ― the people we rely on to weigh evidence and make decisions on behalf of the American people are not immune to this.\n\nFollowing last week's dive into the followers of the potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, we decided to turn things around and look at the interests of the politicians themselves: We've compiled an enormous data set that shows who people in both chambers of Congress are following on Twitter. The results point to a significant partisan divide and give a glimpse into the wildly different places where Democrats and Republicans get their information.\n\nThe Nerdy Bit: Methodology\n\nTo put this together, we attempted to compile as complete a list of congressional Twitter accounts as possible ― which was harder than you might think, as there is no central list. When a member of Congress had multiple accounts ― for example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has @ewarren and @SenWarren for her campaign and her congressional office, respectively ― we lumped together the follows rather than try to arbitrate which was the real account. So, in this example, if @ewarren follows a given account but @SenWarren doesn't, that still counts as a follow. For the purposes of keeping count, we've decided to count independent Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Angus King (Maine) as Democrats because that's who they caucus with.\n\nThese numbers are inevitably not going to be 100 percent accurate: There could be accounts we missed or other errors ― not to mention the simple fact that politicians follow and unfollow accounts all the time. But we believe our data is good enough to draw the following interesting conclusions, even given those caveats.\n\nTo keep things clear, we stuck to using data from the House only in the tables below ― but on the bar charts toward the end you'll see we also collected Senate data. You can use the widget at the bottom to explore data from both chambers.\n\nA Congress Divided\n\nFirst up, let's take a look at the Twitter accounts most likely to be followed by House Republicans. The most followed accounts are directly related to their work, with the GOP leadership and recently departed Speaker Paul Ryan at the top of the table. According to our data, not everyone in the House follows President Donald Trump.\n\nFox News is ranked pretty high, as are insider news outlets Politico and The Hill. Perhaps most revealing here is the appearance of The Heritage Foundation, an all-powerful right-wing think tank.\n\nMost Followed Twitter Accounts By House Republicans Rank Screen Name R - House D - House 1 HouseGOP 169 28 2 GOPLeader 167 39 3 SpeakerRyan 162 58 4 realDonaldTrump 155 59 5 FoxNews 149 55 6 Heritage 147 10 7 politico 145 172 8 thehill 142 164 9 cathymcmorris 139 22 10 SteveScalise 139 26\n\nThe blue team is similarly obedient to its leaders, with Democrats following their leadership and their most recent president. The appearance of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is interesting: He's not in leadership, but he's chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, where much of the Russia investigation action takes place.\n\nMost Followed Twitter Accounts By House Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 BarackObama 184 32 2 HouseDemocrats 182 20 3 nytimes 172 105 4 politico 172 145 5 NancyPelosi 171 35 6 washingtonpost 170 129 7 AP 167 129 8 WhipHoyer 165 27 9 thehill 164 142 10 RepAdamSchiff 157 19\n\nThe divide also extends to the media.

The Democratic top-10 list also features Chuck Todd of MSNBC, Jake Tapper of CNN and Mike Allen of Politico. What is really striking is the disparity in numbers for some other journalists, like Ezra Klein and Nate Silver, whom some detractors might characterize as liberal. For example, as you can see in the table below, 119 Democrats ― but only 37 (out of 199) Republicans ― follow Silver of FiveThirtyEight. It's also interesting to note that despite Fox being… well, Fox, Chad Pergram is still clearly someone whom Democrats in the House are interested in hearing from.\n\nMost Followed Journalists By House Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 maddow 151 16 2 chucktodd 146 90 3 jaketapper 138 96 4 ezraklein 136 33 5 chrislhayes 129 20 6 mikeallen 122 101 7 NateSilver538 119 37 8 daveweigel 114 48 9 ChadPergram 113 132 10 mitchellreports 113 43\n\nThis, however, is just scratching the surface.\n\nFollow The Leader\n\nWe decided to see if the data could tell us anything about the 2020 Democratic primary. Perhaps Twitter follows by people in Congress could be a useful proxy for establishment support ― in which case, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is narrowly leading the pack of potential presidential candidates, closely followed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren.

For example, here are the results for Katy Perry, who was one of Hillary Clinton's most high-profile supporters in 2016 ― she's followed by 22 House Democrats and one Republican:\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nTaylor Swift has more bipartisan appeal, and is followed by eight House Democrats and seven House Republicans:\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nThe ghost of culture wars past are still reflected on Twitter. Here's the follower breakdown for Chick-fil-A, which became a cause celebre for Republicans in 2012 after a top executive commented publicly on his opposition to same-sex marriage. (Sadly, no one in Congress appears to follow Gillette, so we couldn't surmise anything about its ongoing controversy.)\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nAnd now the best part. As we did last week, we've built a widget so you can go through the data yourself. Enter the name of a Twitter account, and it'll show you how many Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate follow that account. There are over 70,000 accounts, so get going ― and be sure to tweet us with the most interesting results you've found.\n\nJames O'Malley tweets as @Psythor.
LONDON (AP) — A lawyer for the publisher of the Daily Mail newspaper said Wednesday that the Duchess of Sussex had no reasonable expectation of privacy for a letter she sent to her estranged father after her marriage to Prince Harry.\n\nArguing against the duchess' privacy-infringement claim in a London court, attorney Antony White said it's to be inferred that the letter was written and sent by the claimant with a view to it being disclosed to third parties and read by the public.\n\nHe said ex-employees of Meghan and Harry would be able to shed light on the creation of the letter when the case comes to trial.\n\nThe former Meghan Markle, 39, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over five February 2019 articles in the Mail on Sunday and on the MailOnline website, which published portions of a handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, after her 2018 wedding to Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAssociated Newspapers is contesting the claim, and a full trial is due to be held in the autumn at the High Court. In hearings this week the duchess is seeking a summary judgment that would find in her favor and dismiss the newspaper's defense case without a trial.\n\nWPA Pool via Getty Images Meghan Markle chats with people inside the Drawing Room during a visit to Cardiff Castle on Jan. 18, 2018, in Cardiff, Wales.\n\nMeghan's lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, argued Tuesday that that the publisher had no real prospect of winning because it's a very straightforward case about the unlawful publication of a private letter.\n\nRushbrooke said Meghan's five-page letter, sent in August 2018, was a message of peace intended for her father alone.\n\nBut the defense argues Meghan wrote the letter as part of a media strategy to rebut a negative view conveyed by her father, and with help from the communications team in the royal couple's Kensington Palace office.\n\nWhy was the Kensington Palace communications team involved at all in the wording of the letter if it was a wholly private letter? White said.\n\nHe said a full trial would be able to hear important evidence from former palace employees about how the contested letter was written.\n\nLawyers representing four former Kensington Palace staffers, including ex-communications secretary Jason Knauf, said in a letter submitted to the court that one or more of our clients would be able to provide insight on whether or not the claimant anticipated that the letter might come into the public domain, and whether or not Meghan directly or indirectly provided private information to the authors of a book about her and Harry, called Finding Freedom.\n\nMeghan, an American actress and star of TV legal drama Suits, married Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born the following year.\n\nA year ago, Meghan and Harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. They recently bought a house in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nJudge Mark Warby said he would give his ruling on the application for summary judgment as soon as possible.

Perhaps your friends, family, or co-workers have no clue what you've been going through. You may have covered it well and hidden the truth masterfully. I've been there too.\n\nYou might think in your head that once you leave this relationship you'll be asked what went wrong. The list may be so long and so secret that you don't even know where to begin. The abuse may have been swept under that rug so deeply that to lift it would be an avalanche of reckoning.\n\n\n\nI know.\n\nSometimes this person you're with is the definition of charm.

You are worthy of comfort and respect from your partner.\n\nNo amount of wondering or what ifs will spare you from this situation. It doesn't matter if you were prettier, smarter, or more interesting in some way. It doesn't matter if you lose weight or if you keep the house cleaner. None of that will change this shi**y relationship if it is indeed what I have described.\n\nWhat you're forgetting is that you are a beautiful spirit and you made a mistake. You chose to love someone who failed to respect your boundaries or show you compassion. Many of us have been there - some of us many times over.\n\nIt is possible to break the cycle. You can get there if you just let go of the familiar pull of negativity and pain.\n\nSometimes we get used to being treated badly until we forget what it's like to be treated well. It happens. Never be ashamed of your own learning process. It's a journey. And the beginning of your journey needs to start with taking care of you.\n\nDon't be embarrassed to tell someone you need help. Don't be afraid to say what you've been hiding. People will understand more than you think because many have been through this.

ASSOCIATED PRESS I realized that it was time for me to affirm myself as gay, wrote David Matheson, a practicing Mormon who used to run a so-called gay conversion therapy practice.\n\nA Utah-based proponent of the medically denounced practice of so-called gay conversion therapy has announced that he identifies as gay.\n\nDavid Matheson, a practicing Mormon, told the LGBTQ nonprofit Truth Wins Out late Sunday that he has embarked on a new life-giving path that has already started a whole new growth process.\n\nI continue to support the rights of individuals to choose how they will respond to their sexual attractions and identity, he added. With that freedom, I am now choosing to pursue life as a gay man.\n\nEarlier that day, Truth Wins Out released details from a post in a private Facebook group by another conversion therapist, Rich Wyler, who said Matheson had gone from bisexuality to exclusively gay and was seeking a male partner.\n\nMatheson opened up further in a long Facebook post Tuesday.\n\nA year ago I realized I had to make substantial changes in my life, he wrote. I realized I couldn't stay in my marriage any longer. And I realized that it was time for me to affirm myself as gay.\n\nStill, he didn't denounce his participation in the conversion therapy movement, adding, What you can take from this is that my time in a straight marriage and in the 'ex-gay' world was genuine and sincere and a rich blessing to me.\n\nI remember most of it with fondness and gratitude for the joy and growth it caused in me and many others, he continued. But I had stopped growing and I had to change. So I've embarked on a new life-giving path that has already started a whole new growth process.\n\nAccording to a 2007 New York Times article, Matheson ran a full-time therapy practice in New Jersey with an active roster of about 50 clients. At the time, he was a co-organizer of a weekend program called People Can Change and ran an organization called the Center for Gender Affirming Processes.\n\nIn 2013 he published a book, Becoming a Whole Man, which is described on Amazon as the result of a six-year quest to understand and respond to the most difficult challenges facing men with unwanted homosexuality.\n\nFifteen states have passed legislation prohibiting licensed mental health professionals from practicing conversion therapy on minors — including Delaware, Hawaii, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island and, most recently, New York.\n\nThe American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have discredited gay conversion therapy, which attempts to end or reduce people's same-sex attraction or sexual activity. But the practice continues to be promoted, often by members of conservative religious communities. Still, one of Matheson's reported former clients, Chaim Levin, said he remained skeptical of the news. While I am pleased for Mr. Matheson that he has found a path forward for his life, I can't help but think of the hundreds if not thousands of people who are still stuck in the closet, a closet that was created in part by Mr. Matheson himself, he told Truth Wins Out. I hope that Mr. Matheson will do whatever he can to rectify the harm that he's inflicted on many people in the LGBTQ community, myself included, Levin added.
Gwyneth Paltrow welcomes you to The Goop Lab on January 24 pic.twitter.com/ZzeEEbAy9L — See What's Next (@seewhatsnext) January 6, 2020\n\nOr wait ― isn't it a vulva? (Spoiler alert: It is.)\n\nBut if you didn't already know that, the third episode of the controversial series offers viewers a basic anatomy lesson that helps answer that very question.\n\nThe episode, The Pleasure is Ours, seems to be the most well-received of the series, thanks to 90-year-old sex educator Betty Dodson, her no-bullshit attitude, and her protege Carlin Ross. In the episode, Dodson and Ross discuss their work destigmatizing pleasure while helping women find self-acceptance (and orgasms).\n\nThe Board of Gynecologists came out and said, 'We know [Paltrow] screwed up with the vagina eggs, but this episode has real information, and we stand behind it,' Ross told HuffPost over the phone last week. I was like 'Whoa,' she said, laughing.\n\nRoss, an attorney, joined Dodson on her decadeslong mission in 2009 after interviewing Dodson, who has a Ph.D. in sexology and is widely regarded as a pioneer in women's liberation, for a podcast. They shook on the partnership that day, and Ross now calls herself keeper of all things Betty Dodson. She runs their website, is president of the Betty Dodson Foundation and leads their workshops and certification program.\n\nBoth Betty and I saw in each other that we've always been criticized for being too aggressive, too male, Ross said. Whenever you know what you want, do what you want, like to have a fifth drink, like to have a good fuck, it's like, 'Oh, you're a man.' I'm not a man. I'm a full woman.\n\nThat confident attitude contributed in part to Ross agreeing to show her vulva, masturbating ― and orgasming ― on screen during their Goop episode, which features Dodson's Rock 'n' Roll technique.\n\nRoss told HuffPost she was the one who suggested appearing so openly in the episode, but she was in denial about whether it would actually happen.\n\nDodson & Ross Betty Dodson and Carlin Ross' mission is to help women find self-acceptance and pleasure.\n\nI knew I would shoot it because it's an opportunity, she said. I thought of how different my life would be if, in my teens or 20s, if I had seen this kind of information. But there was a part of me that felt like they were going to shelve it, and part of me wanted them to.\n\nAmong Ross' trepidations was how she thought the episode might affect her four-year-old son.\n\nI'm like, 'Is he going to be on the playground and his friends will be like, 'I saw your mom's vulva!' she said. I don't want to be like, that sex mom. I always make sure our house doesn't have dildos all over the place, you know?\n\nUltimately, though, Ross's desire to educate outweighed her concerns, a mission that has driven Dodson throughout her decadeslong career.\n\nWhen they showed my vulva on the big screen at the premiere of the episode, I grabbed Betty's hand and was like, 'It's so big!' But then you laugh and go, is it such a big deal? Carlin Ross\n\nWomen travel from all over the world to take our workshop, Dodson told HuffPost over email. I can't believe it sometimes. We had two women from China who weren't fluent in English. During the last ritual, I ask the women to choose one word that sums up their experience. They said 'sisterhood' and 'freedom.' Bodysex is deeper than words.\n\nRoss told HuffPost being with Dodson makes a person feel like they can do anything ― including shooting that scene.\n\nWhen they showed my vulva on the big screen at the premiere of the episode, I grabbed Betty's hand and was like, 'It's so big!' But then you laugh and go, is it such a big deal? You go into the Met and there are penises on every statue, penises everywhere. Everyone's sending you unsolicited dick pics. It's like, 'Was it so crazy over-the-top?' It was, but it shouldn't be.\n\nDodson & Ross Betty Dodson in 1970. She has made sex and pleasure education her career for decades.\n\nRoss said she and Dodson are floored by the overwhelming response to their episode and the positive reactions. She tries to answer every email she receives ― many of which detail sexual trauma ― personally.\n\nThey don't just say, 'I saw you on the show,' she said. They say, 'I was in an abusive marriage,' or 'I was gang-raped and I've been carrying that' or 'I never got any information and I'm 50 and I've never had an orgasm.' I never feel overwhelmed by the work, but I tear up sometimes and sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the need. These women are so isolated. What I always lead with is, as women, we've all been traumatized to some degree; you're not alone.\n\nDodson and Ross travel the world hosting workshops, record videos discussing sex and love, and sell products ― including a stainless steel barbell Dodson created that serves as a pleasure device and vaginal exerciser that sold out immediately after appearing on Goop Lab. It's all part of their mission to help women find and embrace pleasure.\n\nPleasure is about self-love and independent orgasms, Dodson told HuffPost. Once a woman is orgasmic, she's dangerous because she can't be kept down. She's in her power. I'm an old feminist warhorse who never thought we'd see a vulva and an orgasm on any screen, let alone Netflix. Fuck me, it feels wonderful.\n\nOnce a woman is orgasmic, she's dangerous because she can't be kept down. She's in her power. Betty Dodson\n\nRoss added that having frank discussions about women's bodies and their pleasure is a powerful way to move the culture forward in regards to sexual wellness and shatter the shame associated with sex and genitals.\n\nWe do our workshops nude, and at the beginning, we go around the circle and say, 'How do you feel about your body and how do you feel about your orgasm?' Ross said. No one says, 'I feel great about my body, I have multiple orgasms all the time.' You connect because you hear your story in everyone else's, you realized we have all been oppressed. That, in and of itself, is very liberating.\n\nWatching Dodson work is equally as liberating. At 90, she told HuffPost she doesn't recognize her aging body, but her self-love rocks (and rolls) on.\n\nPartners have come and gone, but the love affair I have with myself keeps on going, she said. I love me. I don't masturbate as often but I have orgasms. Your clitoris never ages.\n\nAs for what she thinks of her Goop Lab episode and the reactions to it?\n\nIt's about time, she said.\n\nLearn more about Dodson and Ross' work here.
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a man who goes on The Bachelor is in search of a wife. Whether the Bachelor is successful in that quest is a question without a consistent answer.\n\nAs anyone who watches the show — or anyone who takes a wild guess at whether reality TV is conducive to finding love — will tell you, couples formed within the larger Bachelor universe tend to break up. In recent seasons, those endings have become more and more dramatic. (Perhaps you heard about the fence jump seen 'round the world.)\n\nCuriously, that narrative can also be applied to the contemporary Democratic Party. During the finale of Delta pilot Peter Weber's season of The Bachelor on Tuesday night, primary results for six states began to roll in — and it struck me how much Weber's season has, improbably, mirrored the 2020 Democratic primary.\n\nI know! I know what you're thinking. But if you're even mildly interested in both subjects, bear with me. (I hope it goes without saying but, to be perfectly clear, I don't think the stakes of The Bachelor are as high as those of the Democratic presidential nomination process.)\n\nOn Tuesday night, former Vice President Joe Biden was building a delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) after a surprisingly successful Super Tuesday a week earlier, which had followed a month of decent poll results but lackluster debate performances and a series of Biden's typical gaffes.\n\nFor months, Biden and his campaign were not particularly exciting, but they were trucking along. Sanders' candidacy was generating hype and enthusiasm, but how that would translate into primary votes remained fuzzy. Biden and Sanders were arguably in the best positions as the nominating contest ramped up: Each man's name recognition among Democratic voters was matched only by the other's, and both had very high favorability ratings among primary voters.\n\nSimilarly, Hannah Ann Sluss and Madison Prewett, the final two women vying for Weber's hand, were strong contenders from the start: Sluss received the coveted first impression rose, and Prewett got the first one-on-one date with Weber — victories that have historically boded well for contestants. Weber's subsequent interactions with Sluss and Prewett made his attraction to both contestants clear.\n\nThe two women also managed to stay above the fray of most of the season's petty drama, especially after Sluss was implicated early on in a low-stakes spat in which she accidentally opened a bottle of Champagne that did not belong to her. Sanders faced a similar path on the campaign circuit: After his heart attack in early October, his support in the polls continued to grow, but it was not the story that dominated the primary, as various other candidates' profiles rose and fell.\n\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden both have something to say during a presidential primary debate in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nBiden and Sanders remained active in debates, but they faced predictable criticisms, and their responses were the same each time. While other candidates lobbed barbed attacks at each other, the senator and the former vice president filled their preset roles, largely without changing the arc of the race. The same was true for Sluss and Prewett, who sailed through the bulk of the season scot-free, rarely involved in any of the show's typical blowups.\n\nThen, in recent weeks, stories emerged about Biden and Prewett that seemed to predict the beginning of the end. Biden began telling a bizarre story about how he had been arrested trying to visit Nelson Mandela in prison — despite the fact that it hadn't happened. (Maybe the anecdote was meant to be a Hail Mary after Biden's earlier missteps on racial issues, which included an outdated defense of his anti-busing position in the 1970s.) Prewett revealed that she was saving herself for marriage, obliquely suggesting to Weber that she would not be able to go forward with their relationship if he slept with the other remaining women, despite producer-sanctioned intimacy being one of the show's main gambits.\n\nTo risk overextending this comparison: Neither Democratic primary voters nor Weber wanted to deal with this new information, and neither appeared to let it affect their decisions in any negative way.\n\nWhich brings us to Barbara Weber, the Bachelor's mother, whose incredible reactions on the finale gave us something we so rarely get on the show: sass from people over 40. From the beginning of the season, previews of upcoming episodes included a dramatic clip of Barbara Weber begging her son, through tears, to bring her home. On Monday, the first night of the two-part season finale, it became clear that she was talking about Sluss. Throughout the primary season, Sanders received similarly passionate support from many voters under 40, who voted for him in disproportionately high numbers.\n\nThings looked really good for Sluss and Sanders: She got engaged to Weber, and he won the first two primary states. And then, within 30 minutes of reality TV and two days of primary voting, everything changed.\n\nWeber, whose connection with Prewett became more and more obvious as the final episodes dragged on, ended his engagement with Sluss, who delivered an eloquently self-righteous speech and then gave Weber a brutally necessary talk to the hand as she left his house. With nearly all the other moderates dropping out of the primary, Biden emerged from Super Tuesday with a competitive delegate count and all but locked up the nomination after this Tuesday's voting.\n\nOnce the pre-taped footage came to an end, Weber was forced to face Sluss in front of a live studio audience. As the two talked, a dedicated camera captured his mother's unhappy reaction. Meanwhile, Sanders supporters under 40 tweeted their shock and vehement disappointment in his losses.\n\nWhen Prewett joined Weber onstage — after telling The Bachelor MC Chris Harrison that she is still in love with Weber — she received a tepid welcome from the studio audience. Weber seemed over the moon; his mother did not and proceeded to tell Prewett why, exactly, she didn't like her. Sanders supporters have recently published similar arguments about Biden in various progressive publications.\n\nJohn Fleenor via Getty Images Madison Prewett and Peter Weber smile at each other on Tuesday night's finale of The Bachelor.\n\nPrewett seemed to bristle at the implication that she owed Barbara Weber an apology for being three hours late to a date with Weber's family. And Biden has repeatedly scoffed at some of Sanders' signature proposals, which are exceedingly popular with young voters.\n\nPrewett and Barbara Weber did not end the TV series on a positive note. Democrats ought to hope that my already overstretched comparison stops here and that Biden is able to excite voters under 40 if he wins the Democratic nomination.\n\nPolitics are rarely explicitly discussed on the Bachelor franchise, though traditionally conservative viewpoints are often points of principled tension. (As just one example: Prewett's pre-marital chastity and the chauvinist comment her father made about praying for her future husband when she was just an infant.)\n\nNotable exceptions to the franchise's conservative leanings include Rachel Lindsay, who was so rattled by Donald Trump's victory in 2016 that she drank too much and fell asleep on her fantasy suite date with then-Bachelor Nick Viall. (Lindsay later became the franchise's first Black lead.) And Derek Peth, who appeared on The Bachelorette in 2016, more recently canvassed for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in Iowa.\n\nAs for Warren, her clear corollary on Weber's season was Iowa native Kelsey Weier, who had a rocky start, unabashedly clashed with other contestants, scored a series of conversations with Weber that demonstrated their mutual affection, said she was falling in love with Weber (which she admitted, seemingly sincerely, she had not expected to happen), made it to the final four (aka hometown dates), and was then, fairly unexpectedly, dumped during a rose ceremony at an airplane hangar.\n\nTwo months after her stint on Weber's season ended, Weier deviated from the Bachelor playbook of basically ignoring politics. On Feb. 3, she posted on Instagram, It's caucus day in Iowa! Make sure you go out and do your part! And in Bachelor Nation, that's analogous to announcing a plan for big, structural change.
When my 12-year-old daughter informed me of her life plan, all the ugly parts of my parenting came to the surface. Her (current) ideal includes buying a farm, rescuing donkeys, baking scones every day and bearing a whole tribe of babies whom she plans to homeschool.\n\nHusband optional.\n\nHere's how my inner ugly inner parent sounded:\n\nShouldn't she want a career?\n\nWhat are we paying private school fees for?\n\nRescuing donkeys won't pay the bills.\n\nShe's going to homeschool the intended FIVE children?\n\nAll that talent wasted -- the development netball, her ability with words, her love of history, her keen mind and capacity to understand the depths of a concept beyond her years.\n\nHow's she going to buy that farm?\n\nMy Mama Muzzle had to get whipped out pretty darn quick, because, well, this is all my fault.\n\nHaven't I created a family philosophy and environment in my home to support her choices?\n\nHasn't she been fortunate enough to have been born into a country that allows her the privilege to sculpt her life?\n\nAnd then, in addition, haven't I done everything I can to empower her to trust herself and completely reinvent her world if she changes her mind?\n\nThis is what I've taught her.\n\nI owe so much of my resilience, compassion and understanding about life to the lessons my own mother taught. She was my only parent, so there was a good while where her opinion was my only opinion, which suited her fine.\n\n\n\nIn the ever-evolving path we follow, there comes a junction where we step beyond the knowledge and successes of our mother into a new trail, blazed by our own curiosity. This is how we grow a humanity.\n\nIt's life's lust for expansion, even though it sometimes upsets our own mothers. If you're lucky, like I am lucky, your mum will pack her growth suitcase and come along with you.\n\nSo, what am I now showing my daughter, besides what she's already gleaned this far from watching me as a young'un?\n\nShe already knows that she can be financially resourceful and reliant on herself in a crisis; because I've shown her that.\n\nShe knows that divorce and heartbreak aren't the end of the story. She knows that being unceremoniously dumped on your bum doesn't mean the end of your joy. I've proven that.\n\nShe also understands that staying married to someone who adores you is often seriously hard work, even if your values are aligned. She sees that marriage is tough, frustrating, joyful and messy and terribly, fantastically worth it. She knows because I've shown her that.\n\nShe knows that sometimes you just have to say yes to terrifyingly out-of-your-comfort-zone opportunities, then scurry around like a rabid fruit bat to get the job done. I've taught her that.\n\nShe knows that illness, inability and despair cannot rule. She comprehends that we all have coping mechanisms that can spring like weeds from barren ground and create a foundation for success. I've shown her that.\n\nShe knows that in order to be of assistance in a community and help those around you, you've got to save yourself first. I've taught her that.\n\nShe knows that children change everything. That they are both a responsibility and a freedom and that the love of a new baby after a decade, only increases the love in the home, not divides it. I've shown her that too.\n\n\n\nThe birth of our new family business has shown her fresh lessons.\n\nWhile we are growing something sustainable and clever at our kitchen table, there are seeds of confidence being watered in her soul. Because, if at any time she feels as if the life she's structured isn't as blazing and brilliant as she wants, she'll have seen her Mum completely morph a situation with sheer determination. She will have watched me emancipate myself from an unbalanced career to unfolding into a creative businesswoman.\n\nShe will watch me take something I love, invest in my own talent and turn it into an award-winning, sustainable business within a year.\n\nShe will have witnessed me second guess myself, then strike a power pose and fire on. She was there the moment I realised my own value, charged accordingly and changed our lives.
Julie Scagell\n\nAs part of our Blended Family Friday series, each week we spotlight stepfamilies to learn how they've worked to bring their kids together. Our hope is that by telling their stories, we'll bring you closer to blended family bliss in your own life! Want to share your story? Email us at divorce@huffingtonpost.com.\n\nWith three kids under the age of 12, Julie Scagell is one busy mom.\n\nBesides my full-time job, I'm a part time-taxi driver, laundry folder, booger picker and wine connoisseur, Scagell recently joked with HuffPost.\n\nBelow, the mom of three -- who blogs for BLUNTmoms and other sites -- tells us how she de-stresses and why she's grateful for her big blended family (including her ex and his spouse).\n\nHi Julie. Please introduce us to your family.\n\nThere's me, my husband David and our three kids: Maggie (12), Charlie (10) and Gavin (4). Maggie and Charlie are from my previous marriage. David and I have been together for almost seven years.\n\nWhat were those early years like? How did having Gavin change the dynamic of the family?\n\nWhen David and I met, I was certain I was done having kids. I felt lucky to have two healthy, happy children and had mentally moved on from the baby phase. The experience of having a child from birth was really important to my husband. We decided to leave it to fate and I got pregnant six weeks later (insert shock and awe). Now that Gavin is here, I cannot imagine life before he existed. He has completed our family. Watching the relationship our three kids have developed is inspiring.\n\nJulie Scagell\n\nWhat have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced over the last seven years?\n\nThe guilt of watching the kids having to go back and forth, from our home to their dad's. When my ex and I first told our daughter we were getting divorced, she cried and said, So we aren't going to be a family anymore? It was the single worst moment of my life. Since then, I believe my ex and I (and our spouses) have done everything in our power to make sure they feel like we are all a big family and still love each other. But the guilt of watching them go from one house to the other never fades. I hate when they have an event coming up, they have to ask, Will I be with you or Daddy? Now that the youngest is 4, he knows when the older kids won't be with us and is always asking when they'll be back home. It's heartbreaking at times. But I trust my ex implicitly and know my kids will be adored, scolded, challenged and supported the same way they are in our home. All things considered, I feel grateful.\n\nJulie Scagell\n\nWhat makes you proudest of your family?\n\nWe have all worked extremely hard to keep things as consistent as possible for our children. My husband and my ex-husband's wife have selflessly adopted the same mantra. It's why we all live in the same neighborhood, sit together at sporting events, discuss punishments and try to keep the lines of communication open as much as possible. There have been struggles, bitten tongues and arguments over the years, but our collective job is to raise happy, well-adjusted children. End of story.\n\nWhat advice do you have for other blended families who feel like a peaceful family dynamic is out of reach?\n\nThe best advice I can give is this too shall pass. There were times in the early days that I never imagined we'd have the relationship we have now. Every single person involved has to have a kids-first attitude. When you do that, it's easier to let things go. It is a constant give and take but if you can put the needs of your kids first, everything else falls into place. Whenever I feel irritated or inconvenienced, I always think, They didn't choose this life, this schedule. It puts things into perspective. Wine also helps.\n\nJulie Scagell Gavin and Maggie\n\nAre you as happy as you could be?

Kelly Clarkson recently shared how songwriting has helped her heal during her divorce from Brandon Blackstock after nearly seven years of marriage.\n\nThe singer has spoken publicly about the difficulties of going through a divorce on a number of occasions since news of their split broke last June.\n\nClarkson recently told Entertainment Tonight that the divorce process has inspired her to write about 60 songs, according to an interview published on Thursday.\n\nI have written like 60 songs, it is an insane amount of getting it out, she said.\n\nI think that's a blessing in itself. Anytime you go through some life, it's such an awesome thing to have that outlet, regardless of whether people hear it or not.\n\nThe Voice coach also told ET that she was working on a really honest record.\n\nI don't know how anybody, I'll just be real with you, goes through grief like divorce, any kind of grief, any kind of loss, without having an outlet like this, she said.\n\nFrazer Harrison via Getty Images Brandon Blackstock and Kelly Clarkson attend the 25th Annual Critics' Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on Jan. 12, 2020 in Santa Monica, California.\n\nClarkson shares daughter River, 6, and son Remington, 4, with Blackstock, who's also father to teenagers Savannah and Seth from a previous marriage.\n\nDuring a candid interview with Willie Geist on Sunday Today in September, Clarkson said her life had been a little bit of a dumpster and that she had been turning to friends who have also been through a divorce for advice.\n\nIn December, Clarkson said during a segment of The Kelly Clarkson Show that the hardest part of divorce was worrying about her kids.\n\nI always think as women, especially, we're trained ― Alicia (Keys) and I were talking about earlier ― to take it all on and you deal with it and you're fine, but it's your babies that you worry about.\n\nOutside of her own songwriting, Clarkson has turned to music from her fellow Voice coach John Legend to help cope with her divorce, she said elsewhere in her interview with ET. Legend released the album Bigger Love last year in June.\n\nIt's all about that kind of love that you find, that kind of connection you find, and it was so helpful for me, she said. Just separately — as a fan, not friend — just to be in a place where you're hopeless and then to have a record like that.
It's amazing how quickly it happens, isn't it? One day you're two. The next, you're three. Not parents and then parents. All of a sudden there's this little creature who shares both of your DNA staring at you from a bassinet. It's incredible how quickly a baby's presence completely retools every relationship you have — with yourself, your friends, your family, your job, and, especially your partner. And if you don't react to the change, your marriage can suffer.\n\nClaudia Luiz, the author of The Making of a Psychoanalyst, puts it bluntly: Children really do ruin marriages. Not that that's always the case, she notes, but the groundwork for real trouble is there from the moment a baby arrives. The relationship changes from being one where you're going in the same direction with the same goals to being competitive, she says. Suddenly you're competing for time. Because the baby needs so much, there's so much dependency and you get strung out. Per Luiz, there's nothing you can really do to prevent those feelings, because you've moved into this new developmental phase. There's grief over what you've lost when you become a parent. You've lost your freedom, your sleep, money. It's very depriving.\n\nNow, don't go mourning your old marriage for too long. Luiz adds that this doesn't have to be the norm. If you and your spouse both can stay the course, communicate openly, and be willing to ride out the storms when they hit, then you'll be okay. In fact, you might just decide to do it all again. In any case, here are some common relationship issues new parents face and how to keep them from spiraling out of control.\n\nThe Problem: Sex is Off the Table\n\nThe Cause: It's not just a question of being tired all the time. There's also a sense of neglect that can build up when all of the attention is being lavished on the squalling newcomer in your home. Because there's so much neglect and competition when a new baby is born, says Luiz, that can arouse anything that's been unresolved.\n\nThe Solution: It's really a matter of negotiating the energy, Luiz says. Often couples end up feeling triggered and like they have nothing to give each other and the first few months with the baby are a complete and total nightmare. But for couples who are enjoying the fulfillment of the baby, they won't feel that shift in sexual need and desire.\n\nThe Problem: One Partner Stops Taking Care of Themselves\n\nThe Cause: Let's be honest, when you're up at three every morning, covered in regurgitated formula and baby poop, looking sexy isn't top of your to-do list. But, for some couples, whether dad has chosen to not shave and forgo pants or mom opts not to wash the Enfamil out of her hair, not taking care of your looks can trigger some unexpected issues. Where the developmental need in courtship is to be attractive, as soon as you get into child rearing, the developmental need is to be available to the child, says Luiz. So becoming attractive, there's no motivation for it. This can be experienced by the spouse as a rejection. 'Well, why don't you want to be attractive? What is going on?'\n\nThe Solution: A lot of it has to do with the feelings of security that one brings into the marriage. If you and your spouse are confident in each other and yourselves, then how you look won't make a difference. Some of it also depends on your own upbringing. If your parents could weather the storms of deprivation and sacrifice, then it won't be that big a deal when you fight, Luiz says. You might enjoy this unsexy phase of the marriage.\n\nThe Problem: One Partner Keeps Getting on the Other's Case\n\nThe Cause: Personality traits have a lot to do with it, says David Silverman, a licensed marriage and family therapist in New York. If you have one person who's a controller and one person who's more relaxed about the way they do things, you get a lot of resentment or fighting on both sides. It becomes the focus of their relationship. You can get into a power struggle and once you get into a power struggle, you're not going to be able to work as a team anymore.\n\nThe Solution: They should definitely talk about shared responsibility, says Silverman. Sometimes it's going to be a lot more responsibility for one partner than the other because one might be working and the other one might not be. But they should talk about shared responsibility so that they don't get resentful.\n\nThe Problem: You Have Different Parenting Strategies\n\nThe Cause: Some parents take a very relaxed approach to raising a kid and, in the abstract sense, that can be all well and good. But, when the reality sinks in, it can be a game changer and one parent's fast-and-loose style of child-rearing might be at odds with the other parent's more focused and disciplined approach, and problems can arise. A lot of couples don't discuss this before the child is born and they can have a lot of difficulties later on, says Silverman. The most important part of being a good parent is that the two of you work as a team together, not where one says one thing and then the other one does the opposite. Kids are a lot more successful when they have two parents that agree.\n\nThe Solution: Make sure you both know what you're signing up for at the outset and how you're going to handle it. Preplanning is an important part of doing things, Silverman says. If you were building a house, you wouldn't want to just start building the house, you'd want to preplan it. You'd want to get all the dimensions and the drawings first before you start laying down the bricks and the concrete. Otherwise, the house is not going to stand up straight. That's the same thing in raising a family. You have to kind of set your goals and your priorities before you get into the thick of it. It just makes it easier.
The chanting of the two boys sitting under the tree reminded me of my Bar Mitzvah class over 60 years ago. The language was different – Amharic, not Hebrew – as was the religion – Ethiopian Orthodox, not Jewish -- and the boys bore little resemblance to the pudgy, pasty pre-adolescent friends of my youth, but the sounds were eerily similar.\n\nWell, maybe not so eerie. As the ancient crossroads between Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, all kinds of people passed through this region thousands of years ago, depositing customs, practices and ceremonies along the way. In Ethiopia these cultural artifacts have been blended into a melange not unlike the array of food on a disk of injera, the fermented bread that is the staple of the Ethiopian diet.\n\nHistory lives in Ethiopia. This isn't history as an abstract and academic discipline. It's one thing to read history, it's another to experience it. While the practices, dress and decorations reflect the religious roots of the western world, the familiar is often counterbalanced by the strange in this evocative, mysterious land.\n\nThe first week of my trip, which was hosted by local operator Jacaranda Tours (http://www.jacarandatours.com), was spent in the historic north where early trade routes shaped the cultural and religious traditions of the country, as well as the striking features of both the women and men who live here.\n\nWe started in Bahir Dar on Lake Tana, the first stop in the historical circuit. Outside a 14th Century monastery across the lake is where I encountered the two boys sitting under a tree chanting from the Psalms of David.\n\nAfter a brief stop in Gondar, the 17th Century capital of Ethiopia, noted for its medieval style castles, royal intrigue and history, we took a short flight further north to Lalibella. This is where the familiar gets really weird. By familiar I mean Christian religious practice and ceremony. As a Jew my familiarity with Christian ceremony is mostly secondhand though I have attended my share of Christian weddings, including Catholic and Orthodox; I have even been best man at a couple. So Christian ceremony is not that strange to me, but what I witnessed and experienced in Lalibella was way off my cognitive grid.\n\nIn the dark, underground, rock-hewn churches, enveloped in incense and chanting, surrounded by men and women wrapped in white, I had what could only be described as a religious experience. If not from another world, this was definitely from another century – the 13th to be exact.\n\nFeeling like an intruder, I weaved my way among the worshipers, taking photos in the faint light.\n\nThey didn't seem to mind. As we were leaving, a blind priest greeted us and, as translated by our guide, told us how pleased he was to welcome us to his church. He thanked our guide for bringing visitors who traveled across oceans and continents to get his blessings, and wished us a safe return home.\n\nMaybe the chanting, incense, other-worldly surroundings, or the priest's welcoming embrace nudged me toward the spiritual end of my science/metaphysics belief scale. Whatever it was, I choked up with emotion. It took me several minutes out in the air and sunshine before I completely regained my composure.\n\nFrom Lalibella, we headed to Axum, the oldest and holiest city of Ethiopia, and the location for the St. Mary of Zion Church, where the ark of the covenant is supposedly kept (I say supposedly since no one, other than the priest who runs the church, has ever seen it. I guess we just have to take his word for it.).\n\nLess than an hour outside of Axum was the most breathtaking, parched and dramatic scenery of the trip, reminiscent of the canyon country and deserts of southern Utah and northern New Mexico. But in place of Native American pueblos, rock-hewn churches stand on the mesas and hug the cliffs.\n\nAfter Axum we spent a week in the south, a very different kind of experience. The scenery is lush with many lakes and the wildlife -- mostly hippos, crocs and birds -- is decidedly more abundant.\n\nBut the main draw of the region is the indigenous people in various tribes living much as they have for centuries. Among the tribes we visited were the Dorze in a traditional village high in the hills, famous for their bee-shaped houses and colorful weaving; the Konso in their 1000+ year old village of rock walls, terraces and narrow muddy paths;\n\nthe Mursi people with their elaborate decorations, facial makeup, lip plates, and the women's casual disregard for wearing anything above their waists;\n\nand the Hamer, the tribe with the most attractive people sporting great hairdos, body painting, and smiles.\n\nEthiopia is definitely authentic. But authentic can also mean mud, flies, intermittent water and electricity, long drives on rough roads and troublesome cultural practices such as forced marriage. However, for travelers interested in diverse indigenous peoples and a fascinating history that is also immediate, real, and personal, Ethiopia is a must see destination. The comforts and conveniences we tend to take for granted may be in short supply, but the experience will be both exotic and reassuringly familiar, and as authentic as it gets.\n\n(for more information and photos look up Africa, then Ethiopia on the blog on Don's website http://www.adventuretransformations.com)
Bachelor star Peter Weber and his final choice, Madison Prewett, announced they have split two days after deciding to get back together on the show's season finale.\n\nWeber, 28, and Prewett, 23, each announced the breakup on Thursday separately via their personal Instagram pages.\n\nIn his post, Weber said that he learned so many lessons from being on the show and thanked Prewett for your patience and unconditional love.\n\nHe also called Prewett the epitome of a woman who carries herself with grace, stands by what she believes in, and loves whole heartedly, before announcing that they have mutually decided to not pursue our relationship any further.\n\nWeber said it wasn't an easy decision, but after a lot of honest conversations, we have agreed that this is what makes most sense for the two of us.\n\nWeber also addressed Hannah Ann Sluss, whom he proposed to after Prewett pulled out of the show over concerns that Weber slept with other women in the show's Fantasy Suites. Sluss famously called out Weber's wishy-washy behavior on the season finale.\n\nHannah Ann, you set an example for women everywhere a couple nights ago. You are such a strong, confident woman and you deserve all the love in the world. I accept full responsibility for my mistakes in our relationship and wish you only the best.\n\nIn her post announcing the breakup, Prewett said she was so incredibly thankful for this amazing journey I've had the honor of being a part of, and said she has learned the importance of acceptance, forgiveness, and grace.\n\nAs Peter and I have decided to go our separate ways, I am confident that we will both move in the direction of our purpose and never forget that God has a plan in all things. I will always love and respect him. I am convinced our paths were meant to cross and we are both better because they did.\n\nThe breakup won't be a surprise to many, who noted there were serious lifestyle differences between the couple.\n\nFor example, Weber famously had sex four times in one night in a windmill with former Bachelorette Hannah Brown, while Prewett planned to wait until marriage for sex.\n\nIn fact, Weber's own mother, Barbara Weber, predicted the relationship wouldn't last and said during Tuesday's show he'd have to fail to succeed.
A lot of us have exes.\n\nWe have to deal with our exes on a regular basis because we share a beautiful child or children with them.\n\nThere are certain things that you should never, ever, do when it comes to dealing with your ex in front of your children.\n\nSomebody wrote in the other day.\n\nDavid,\n\nMy ex-wife came to pick up my kids.\n\nEvery single time my kids showed her the Christmas gifts I got them, she would make some kind of snarky comment.\n\nMy daughter loves stuffed animals, like most daughters probably do, so I got her a whole bunch of new ones to play with.\n\nMy ex looked and said, that's all she needs, more stuffed animals.\n\nRight in front of my kids.\n\nI bought my daughter a couple of toys from the Disney store that were apparently repeats. My ex had to say, those are the same ones we have at our house. She even spelled out S-A-M-E over and over again.\n\nMy oldest kid knows how to spell, and was watching in disbelief.\n\nThere were a few other comments she made that I don't really feel the need to go into.\n\nHow should I deal with this?\n\n1. Don't engage\n\nYour ex wants you to engage. She sounds like a bitter person. A person who can't control herself in front of her children because she is angry about the split.\n\nSo when she does something like that, she wants you to engage to validate her actions.\n\nI'm sure that was not the first time she's cut you down in front of the kids. Perhaps it's something you've even spoken to her about.\n\nRealize it's who she is. She's not happy and is looking for you to engage. She cuts you down because she sees things that reflect poorly on her. It's not about you. Classic signs of a narcissist.\n\nWho knows and who cares at this point.\n\nIf you've spoken to her there's nothing you can do about it. Just realize this is her behavior, her issue, and the kids are going to start seeing it. The kids understand more than you think about who their parents are.\n\n2. Let it go -- they're just words\n\nA good friend of mine said to me one day, they're just words and that's it.\n\nIf you engage with an ex, that's what they're looking for. It's a marriage (or relationship) argument and you're not married anymore. Focus on the relationship you have now. If you are co-parenting, keep the conversations about that and avoid the trap of a 'marriage' argument.\n\nYour ex might be looking for confrontation. It's how they get off. It's probably what they think is passionate. It's probably what they witnessed their mom and dad doing to each other when they were a kid.\n\nThey are repeating the same pattern.\n\nIgnore it and focus on the relationship you have now, not the one you had in the past.\n\n3. Protect the children\n\nThe children are going to see it. The kids are going to know who their parents are regardless of how you imagine you are shielding them. They are remarkably perceptive and intuitive.\n\nIf one parent demeans or bad mouths the other to or in front of the children, it's going to backfire. Every time. A child will always hold this behavior against the parent that spoke badly about the other.\n\nAs they mature, they're either going to walk away from that parent, or they're going to finally say something to them.\n\nI know how tough it is to deal with an ex, especially when you share kids. But the only thing you can do is be a great parent. And that's it. Never speak badly about your ex in front of your children.\n\nThe ex? Be glad you're no longer with them. Be glad you're no longer romantically involved and living together.\n\n4. Focus on the 'now'\n\nRemember the old adage -- sticks and stones may break my bones, but names and words will never hurt me.\n\nThey're just words.\n\nThey're your ex's own frustrations coming out at you. Their fears, insecurities and doubts.\n\nFocus on what you have to do now, as in today. Once again, realize you just need to be a good parent.\n\nThe insults are going to come. Ignore them. After a while, they will stop coming. You have to lead your ex through this jungle by example. Show them what your relationship looks like now.\n\nDon't engage, don't talk, don't comment, don't defend yourself. That's what they're looking for. It doesn't serve you or mean anything to you today.
A hopeless romantic in Grimsby, England, asked his girlfriend to marry him 148 times over the course of six months, but she didn't even notice.\n\nRay Smith discreetly placed a card reading Will you marry me? in 148 photographs he took of and with his partner, Claire Bramley, from July to December last year. But she remained blissfully unaware.\n\nSmith ended up playing Bramley a montage of all the images, which included family and friends also popping the question on his behalf, on Christmas Day.\n\nYouTube/Ray Smith Claire Bramley, left, had no idea that Ray Smith, right, was popping the question in the pictures they took together.\n\nThe clip ended with Smith directly asking Bramley for her hand in marriage more than six months after his first proposal. She said yes.\n\nThe couple are now planning their wedding for 2017, and Smith's video is going viral, according to the Grimsby Telegraph.\n\nI had no clue, I was totally oblivious to it all, Bramley, 33, who is eight months pregnant with the couple's first child, told Metro. He told me he was taking the pictures to create memories for the baby, so I just let him get on with it.\n\nSmith, 38, said it was hard work not getting caught.\n\nYouTube/Ray Smith Bramley didn't notice her boyfriend was asking her to marry him because he took different versions of each photo, sometimes without the message.\n\nAccording to a YouTube post, Smith took numerous photographs of each situation, sometimes without the card in the shot. That way, he could show Bramley those photos if she asked to see them.\n\nDean Smith, no relation, pulled a similar stunt before popping the question to his girlfriend, Jennifer Kessel, in Aruba last January.
Retire your sad Ben Affleck memes because the actor is back in action after a tumultuous few months out of the spotlight, and he's singing the praises of ex-wife Jennifer Garner.\n\nThe Alias alum inevitably came up during a Today show interview with Affleck on Monday morning and, of course, human ray of sunshine Hoda Kotb was the one to note how the Oscar winner lit up talking about the mother of his children.\n\nWhen Kotb told Affleck you can tell you still love her in reference to Garner, he immediately responded, Of course, she's wonderful. Somebody's the mother of your kids, they're going to be the most important, central person in your life, and that's good.\n\nThe former couple, who share three children together, finalized their divorce in November 2018, three years after announcing their separation following 10 years of marriage.\n\nPascal Le Segretain via Getty Images Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner attend the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars after party.\n\nWhile the stars have since moved on to new relationships ― Affleck has recently rekindled a romance with ex-girlfriend Lindsay Shookus ― the two are spotted on regular family outings and celebrate holidays, as well as vacation, together with their children.\n\nAffleck called fatherhood the the focus of my life and praised Garner in the interview for ensuring they co-parent successfully.\n\nI hope I'm a pretty good dad. I certainly try very hard, he told Kotb. I'm lucky they've got a great mom, and she helps out a great deal with making sure that we co-parent in as good a way as possible.\n\nHe added: It's what makes me happy and the rest of the stuff kind of follows.\n\nBut while Affleck has seemingly maintained a steady presence in his kids' lives, he's battled some personal demons as of late.\n\nIn October, the Argo director completed a 40-day stay at a treatment center for alcohol addiction, his third rehab stint. Garner was photographed driving him to a rehabilitation facility in Malibu, California, in August after reportedly staging an intervention.\n\nIt doesn't really bother me to talk about alcoholism and being an alcoholic. It's part of my life. It's something that I deal with, Affleck explained. It doesn't have to sort of subsume my whole identity and be everything, but it is something that you know you have to work at.\n\nAfter exiting the rehab facility, Affleck posted a candid, emotional note on Instagram, explaining he hopes that his own struggles might inspire somebody else to get help.\n\nI feel like I had a problem and I really want to address it, and I take some pride in that,  he continued. It's about yourself, your life, your family, and you know people ― we encounter these kinds of hurdles and we have to deal with them.\n\nGarner, meanwhile, has reportedly been dating businessman John Miller for months. The two were spotted on a romantic dinner date in Santa Monica just last month.
Rob Melnychuk via Getty Images\n\nFalling in love is a little more complicated when your parents are divorced. Children of divorce may be extra cautious when it comes to commitment and a little slower to trust the people they fall in love with, no matter how great their partner is.\n\nStill, when they do take the leap and commit, they tend to do so with their eyes wide open and with a greater understanding of what it takes to make a marriage last. Below, writers with divorced parents share the reasons they still believe in marriage.\n\n1. I still believe because my parents divorced before their marriage turned toxic.\n\nIt might sound strange, but I think I believe in marriage even more because my parents got divorced. Right now, I remember a decade of my parents living as loving partners. If they hadn't ended it when they did, those good years would be overshadowed by several more decades of animosity and misery for everyone. I imagine the model of a bad marriage would have soured my ideas about the topic far more than the experience of my parents' responsible separation. When bad marriages end and good marriages are left, the overall perception of the institution improves. ― Tara Eisenhard, author of The D-Word, Divorce Through a Child's Eyes\n\n2. My parents' divorce makes me want to work harder on my own marriage.\n\nMy parents' divorce makes me work harder to create the type of family I wish I had. As a stepmom to three and a mom to one, every day I strive to provide the kids with a stable, loving environment. I'm not going to lie, being a stepmom and a second wife in a blended family isn't always easy but I think being a child of divorce has made me more dedicated to my marriage and to my family. I know firsthand how it feels to be a child of divorce, and I don't want that for my daughter, and I certainly don't want my stepchildren to have to go through that a second time. ― Jamie Scrimgeour, blogger and creator of The Kick-Ass Stepmom Project\n\n3. My mom showed me the value of being single and being in love.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 6 years old. By the time I was a teenager, I had experienced a decade of my mom modeling what it means to be a strong, independent, self-sufficient woman, and wondered if I would ever want to get married simply because marriage didn't seem necessary. It was around that same time that she began dating the man that she would marry and spend the next 25 years with, until he passed away two years ago. Their marriage was full of love and laughter, and demonstrated that it is possible for two individuals to share a life together without having to sacrifice their own interests or independence. They also showed me that even though marriage isn't necessary, with the right person, it sure can be a lot of fun ― and 15 years in, mine just keeps getting better. ― Susanne Kerns, blogger and contributor to But Did You Die? Setting The Parenting Bar Low\n\n4. I view all relationships as experiences you learn from, no matter how long they last.\n\nAs a child of divorce, I've experienced the sting of loss and I'm fine-tuned to the signs of rejection and abandonment. However, I've always believed that whether they last three months or three decades, relationships can provide their participants with the love, understanding and intimacy they need at the time. Often, the courage to end a relationship that is no longer meeting both partners' needs shows the greatest strength. Growing up in a divorced home taught me that marriage will never be my sole source of happiness so it's important to pursue your dreams to the best of your ability. ― Terry Gaspard, author of Daughters of Divorce: Overcome the Legacy of Your Parents' Breakup and Enjoy a Happy, Long-Lasting Relationship\n\n5. My parents divorced, but they both eventually found The One.\n\nMy parents split up before I was 2 years old. My father went on to marry a total of seven times. My mother found true love with another woman. And me? I've been divorced twice. But I still believe in marriage, partially because although it took my parents several tries to find their soulmates, they both eventually did. Mom and Pat have been together over 40 years. Dad and Tricia have been together over 20. They have taught me to never to give up on finding true love. ― Lara Lillibridge, author of the forthcoming Girlish: Growing Up in a Lesbian Home\n\n6. I know that life is a little bit easier with a partner that's your equal than on your own.\n\nI was too young when my parents divorced to get the concept of marriage before it was gone. My ideas about marriage, therefore, came from watching my grandparents. Their lives together seemed effortless and comfortable like a locomotive on a schedule that always made it on time. My parents' lives seemed laborious in comparison with a never-ending track change.
Courtesy of Laura Lynne Jackson Psychic medium Laura Lynne Jackson and husband, Garrett Jackson, pictured here with their three children, will celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary later this year.\n\nLaura Lynne Jackson is wife, mom and former high school English teacher from Long Island, New York, who has a supernatural skill set: She is both a psychic and a medium.\n\nHer psychic gifts, which she first noticed as a child, allow her to read people's energy and pick up on information about their past, present and future; her mediumistic abilities help her communicate with people who have died and relay their messages to those who are still living ― but more on that later.\n\nWhen Laura was just beginning her career as a teacher 20 years ago, she went on a first date with Garrett, who is now her husband. On their second date, she opened up to him about her psychic medium gifts.\n\nIt's not something I can really hide, said Laura, author of The New York Times best-seller The Light Between Us. Anyone who knows me well, knows this is part of me. So, on our second date, over dinner, I told him about my abilities and some of the experiences I'd had related to them.\n\nCourtesy of Laura Lynne Jackson\n\nSo what's it like to be married to someone with these otherworldly capabilities? The Jacksons fill us in below.\n\nHow did you respond when Laura first told you about her psychic medium gifts on that second date?\n\nGarrett: I was intrigued by it. My stepmother had gone to psychics for years, and I was fascinated by stories she relayed to me. She was told very specific factual details about her life during some of these readings that the psychic could not possibly have known beforehand. I knew there had to be something to it.\n\nLaura: He was actually pretty open-minded about it and interested. In retrospect, it was a good litmus test as to whether I should date him or not.\n\nWhat is the difference between a psychic and a medium?\n\nLaura: There is a saying in the industry: All mediums are psychic, but not all psychics are mediums. Being psychic means that you perceive energy and can read someone's aura. It also means that you pick up on information about a person's past, present or future. When I read psychically, I am retrieving the information, or looking to see, feel and gather information.\n\nBeing a medium means that in addition to having all your psychic abilities wide open, you can also shift your own energy in order to hear, perceive and connect with the consciousness of those who have left their physical bodies ― in other words, those whose physical bodies have died. When we leave our physical bodies, we are still conscious thought energy. Mediums can, using their own consciousness, shift, tune in (kind of like turning on a radio and tuning in) and connect with those who have crossed and receive information and messages.\n\nBeing a medium is like being in the role of a translator, translating a universal emotional language into English ― and at times, hearing words and phrases, feeling impressions of things or watching little movie clips. It is a receiving of information rather than a retrieving of it.\n\nAt what age did you realize you possessed these gifts? What was that like for you, Laura?\n\nI have always been psychic since a young age. As a child, I would feel other people's energy and emotions and see people with superimposed color ― blue, red, orange ― around them. But I just assumed this was the way the world worked and that other people perceived things in the same way. It seemed normal to me.\n\nHowever, at age 11, I realized something was wrong with me, so to speak, when I knew my grandfather was going to die right before he did. In retrospect, that knowing, too, was a gift, not a curse, because I got to spend one last day with him. He communicated with me in a dream after I crossed, which was also my first mediumistic experience. It took me decades, though, to understand that my abilities were a gift and to embrace them fully. At times, they scared and overwhelmed me.\n\nCourtesy of Laura Lynne Jackson\n\nGarrett, after almost 20 years together, what do you think about Laura's gifts today?\n\nIt is very humbling to get to see firsthand the healing that Laura has brought into so many people's lives. I have had the privilege of meeting many of these people in person and hearing their stories directly from them. She has brought peace and healing to so many people whose lives were otherwise hopelessly frozen in grief. Many of these people tried unsuccessfully for years to find any relief from their grief through counseling, support groups or other traditional means. It was amazing to meet these people and hear from them directly how Laura's work gave them hope and perspective to begin living their lives again after years of living in darkness and despair.\n\nAlso, through my own personal experiences, I can say with absolute certainty that the afterlife is real ― which is a concept that many people spend their lives grappling with, never 100 percent sure. There are paranormal phenomena that exist on the peripheries of our physical world that, although rare, are indeed real.\n\nWhat do you do for a living, Garrett?\n\nI am an attorney.\n\nWhen you tell people what Laura does, how do they typically respond?\n\nI typically don't bring it up to acquaintances unless someone asks me directly what she does, or unless they express an interest in the paranormal. The topic of psychic mediums can be somewhat polarizing ― some people are fascinated by it and other people believe it is impossible. I honestly don't blame intelligent, rational people for being skeptical. I don't know that I would believe it either unless I had firsthand experience with it.\n\nAll of my family, friends and co-workers know about it. They are largely very supportive. Generally speaking, I find that the majority of people I mention it to are fascinated by it and are often eager to share some kind of personal experience that they, or a family member or friend have had previously with the paranormal.\n\nI honestly don't blame intelligent, rational people for being skeptical. I don't know that I would believe it either unless I had firsthand experience with it. - Garrett Jackson\n\nGarrett, what challenges ― if any ― has it presented in your marriage?\n\nThe psychic part of Laura really doesn't factor into our marriage as much as you might think. Laura is largely unable to read people that she is very close to. Therefore, it isn't a situation where I have to worry about her peering into my thoughts and activities without my knowing it. Plus, even if she did, I am pretty well-behaved for the most part and spend virtually all of my time either at work or with our family. She knows where I am at all times and I am pretty predictable!\n\nWhat's something people wouldn't know or realize about being married to a psychic medium?\n\nOur lives are astonishingly normal. We live a totally typical suburban family existence. The fact that Laura is a psychic medium rarely factors into our marriage or family life. We are a close family and love spending time with the kids doing normal family stuff. We explained to our kids from any early age what Mommy does and it is totally normal to them.\n\nCourtesy of Laura Lynne Jackson\n\nLaura, do you ever do readings for your family?\n\nEvery now and then. I can do it, but it is harder when you know someone so intimately to stay neutral with regard to the information coming through. Also, I try to stay in normal mode most of the time, because mediumship is extremely draining to me and I can get physically sick if I stay open all the time. I found this out the hard way. So now I set pretty clear boundaries with the other side.\n\nMy mediumship door stays locked like a bank vault unless I am actively shifting my energy to do a reading. The psychic information I get is another story, though. I can't shut off or tune it out, but reading psychically is much less draining than reading mediumistically, and using it can be a helpful tool to navigate the world! I can also look to see if my kids have homework they are not telling me about, for example.\n\nCourtesy of Laura Lynne Jackson\n\nWhat do your kids know and think about your gifts, Laura?\n\nThey are completely comfortable with what I do and it is normal to them. I have never tried to hide it or keep it secret, so they have grown up with it being commonplace. They each have their own gifts, and they are open to embracing and accepting them. Even my husband, who claims to not be psychic, seems to have involuntarily honed his psychic abilities. He will often just know things, but he will still shrug it off and not own that he is psychic. It's kind of funny.\n\nOverall, we are a pretty normal family ― only, I suppose, our dinner conversations are maybe a bit different than average ― and how we approach and navigate problems may be a bit different. For example, if something goes missing, we tune in to find it, and follow the pull to it.
The news that Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, is teaching at D.C.-area school that openly bans LGBT+ faculty and students ― and any manner of pro-LGBT+ belief or affiliation ― seemed to generate a lot of surprise among my peers. Not a surprise that the nation's second lady would work there, but that such a school would exist — right in liberal Northern Virginia!\n\nI wasn't surprised. I'd grown up attending such a school. I figured they were a dime-a-dozen.\n\nAt first, I wasn't keen on reading any of the news stories, but something caught my eye. Immanuel Christian School, in Springfield? I didn't go to a school like that; I went to that school. From 1989–1997. I'm also gay.\n\nIt's bizarre reading about little ICS in the national media. A common description affixed to it, in this latest culture war dust-up, is an anti-LGBT school. It's an odd label, as if being anti-gay were its raison d'etre. But it is, I must say, more than fair.\n\nI've been following the reporting, the commentary, the vice president's public diatribe in response to the backlash against his wife and the school and, given my own experience, I can't say I'm sympathetic to his claims of persecution. Let's be clear, nobody is arguing that private, religious schools can't exist or can't legally discriminate. It's a clear First Amendment right. And what I was hearing was merely criticism, or in most cases matter-of-fact reporting, of the school's policies.\n\nThat harsh light of visibility, the audacity to call hate, hate, seems to anger Mike Pence. And his angry response has only further offended those who were appalled by his wife's choice to teach there in the first place. And 'round and 'round it goes.\n\nWhat's missing, I think, when people talk about a discrimination policy like this, is the practical experience of what that actually looks like. It certainly sounds unfair. But it's so much more than that.\n\nNo student was, to my knowledge, ever expelled for being gay. That would never happen, because no student would ever dare come out in the stifling environment of ICS.\n\nGrowing up, we had no clue our school had the policy statements or hiring forms it does. No student was, to my knowledge, ever expelled for being gay. That would never happen, because no student would ever dare come out in the stifling environment of ICS. No openly gay or lesbian teacher was ever turned away, because it would have been clear from a mile away this wasn't the place for them. The policies were there, I'm sure, in a file cabinet somewhere. They stated what would, to anyone attending the institution, go without saying. And they enforced something much more consequential, namely the curriculum.\n\nIt does have to be said that ICS was a good school. It was small, intimate, and — aside from a middle school biology course that seemed to focus 90 percent on debunking evolution, without actually teaching any of its underlying principles — the academic education I received there was stellar.\n\nIt was also a hotbed of right-wing fanaticism, shoved down the throats of impressionable children at every turn. The community of teachers, students and families was fiercely like-minded and almost exclusively Republican. In 1992, they held a school-wide vote for the presidential election. George H.W. Bush, seeking a second term that Bill Clinton would deny him, won by a staggering landslide.\n\nThe effect of this environment went beyond the official coursework. Teachers, especially in the later grades, where students started to converse about the topics of the day, would constantly editorialize and share their opinions about the world. They were encouraged to do so, I'm sure, and they presented their views as Gospel fact.\n\nI learned at a very young age how our country was lost and had the blood of innocent babies on its hands. Gay marriage was an affront to the natural order. Nobody even brought that one up — our teacher came in one day, in 1996, fuming that a court in Hawaii had suggested otherwise.\n\nHuffPost A school photo of Cronkhite when he was in 6th grade in 1994.\n\nIt was also, apparently, vital to the spiritual survival of our country to always, unwaveringly support the state of Israel. Which, to us students, was a country far, far away where Jesus was from.\n\nBasically, if James Dobson or Rush Limbaugh was saying it, we were hearing it. While many of the messages were probably typically the kind you'd hear in any Christian school, I think they had a particular intensity there. We weren't in Oklahoma; we were inside the Beltway, in the lion's den, and the world around us was an evil, corrupt, and frightening place. One day, when we graduated, we would have to go out into this world. We would have to be prepared.\n\n\n\nKaren Pence is going to fit right in.\n\n\n\nEventually, in middle school, discussions would touch on sexuality. Obviously, homosexuality was evil. They didn't talk about this a whole lot; it was best not to dwell on it, but the unfortunate topic had to be broached. What was shocking, even to me then, was the vitriol. These were Christians and generally very kind people. Evangelicals have a way of talking about sexual minorities in public. They use the word love a lot and talk softly of hating the sin. When they're among themselves, they tend to be more candid. Needless to say, it was made very clear to me, and to all of us, that there was nothing worse than being gay. They were disgusting perverts who hated Christians and had a nefarious agenda to dismantle society.\n\n\n\nAs a boy on the cusp of puberty, only just beginning to realize I was different, this wasn't a nurturing message, especially coming from a trusted teacher and echoed enthusiastically by everyone I had ever called a friend. I remember wanting to turn invisible, imagining they could tell that maybe, just maybe, I was one of those perverts.\n\nThey're not trying to deny employment to gay people out of spite. They're trying to keep gay and gay-friendly people from their students. That's not beneficial to the students, and it certainly wasn't great for me.\n\nThey couldn't tell though, and I wouldn't have dared say it. I could barely admit it to myself back then. But time marches on, and I'm now happily married to my husband (despite what my 6th grade teacher would say about that). I made it out. Still, I carried that sense of fear and isolation well into public high school. I grew depressed there. I never attempted suicide, but I certainly thought about it a lot. I wonder sometimes about the other LGBT+ students who went through Immanuel Christian School, before and after me. Were they as resilient? Have any killed themselves?\n\nWhat I do know is any school can be a rough place for a gay kid. There are always bullies. It doesn't help when the teachers are in on it. Once, in my public high school, when some boys made a cruel, homophobic joke, the teacher cut them off. He then berated them to the point I thought they would cry. I had never seen an adult stand up for people like me before. I didn't even know that was possible. ICS made sure of that.\n\nThat's what their discrimination policy is all about. They're not trying to deny employment to gay people out of spite. They're trying to keep gay and gay-friendly people from their students. That's not beneficial to the students, and it certainly wasn't great for me.\n\nWhile part of me would love to see the supposed liberal-fascist machine shut down schools like ICS, that won't ever happen. Religious schools are part of this country. So, instead, I would like to see them change from within. And that won't happen if we refuse to even talk about them. I'm glad we're talking about this school, and I'm glad people are being critical. Now maybe the Pences are the ones who will have to learn some resilience.\n\nIan Cronkhite grew up in Northern Virginia.

The largest protests to hit Iran in almost a decade have swept across the country in recent days, sparking violent retaliation from government forces. U.S. President Donald Trump's provocative tweets have further inflamed hostilities as Tehran's crackdown intensifies.\n\nWith a rising death toll and growing international attention, the anti-government demonstrations present an unpredictable challenge for Iranian authorities, who swiftly blamed the nation's enemies. As the clashes threaten to drag into a second week, here's an outline of what's happening, and why.\n\nWhat Are The Protests About?\n\nProtests erupted in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, on Thursday. Hordes of Iranians took to the streets, angrily decrying dismal economic conditions, rising inflation and unemployment, and allegations of widespread corruption.\n\nProtesters are disappointed by the limited economic improvement the nation experienced as a result of Iran's historic 2015 nuclear agreement with six other countries. After decades of diplomatic friction between Tehran and the West, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from stifling economic sanctions.\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani, a key architect of the deal who was re-elected in May, promised it would revive the economy and create millions of jobs.\n\nThe nuclear deal is overwhelmingly supported by the Iranian public, but there was an expectation that much more economic development would come out of it, Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, told CNN.\n\nIn recent days, the demonstrations have spread to dozens of cities and towns, including the capital Tehran.\n\nThe Iranian people's demands have been put off too long, a protestor identified only as Yaser told the BBC from the city of Talesh. None of the authorities have allowed a platform for these demands to be heard. The protesters are decent, not saboteurs. ... They want jobs, an income and marriage. No protester deserves a bullet.\n\nStephanie Keith/Reuters Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has urged restraint from protesters and security forces.\n\nHow Is Tehran Responding?\n\nIran's supreme leader, ultra-conservative cleric Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the chaos on Iran's foreign rivals.\n\nIn recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic, Khamenei, the country's highest-ranking authority, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAt least 21 people, including members of Iran's security forces, have been killed in the demonstrations. Police have arrested more than 450 protesters in Tehran. Authorities also have temporarily restricted access to certain social media channels, including Instagram and Telegram, a messaging app.\n\nRouhani, in a pre-recorded speech broadcast on state media Sunday, declared: We are a free nation. And according to the constitution and citizen rights, the people are free to express their criticism and even their protests.\n\nThe president cautioned that criticism should not be accompanied with violence or vandalizing public property.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed praise for the protests, sparking backlash from Iranian authorities.\n\nThe Trump Factor\n\nTensions between Tehran and Washington have soured since Trump took office, and continue to worsen with the U.S. president's support for the protests.\n\nTrump has vowed to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, triggering international alarm, and moved to decertify it in October. He could terminate the agreement later this month and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.\n\nTrump, on Twitter, has praised the protests, and encouraged Rouhani's government to respect their people's rights, including right to express themselves. His administration also urged Tehran to unblock the restricted social media sites.\n\nTrump shared two video clips of his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September, in which he called Tehran an oppressive regime.\n\nThe people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime, Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, warning, The U.S. is watching!\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi addressed Trump's remarks.\n\nInstead of wasting his time by publishing offensive tweets to other nations, Trump should focus on internal affairs of America, Qasemi said.\n\nTrump doesn't carry any credibility in Iran, the National Iranian American Council's Parsi said. This is not about Trump, and Trump stepping into this is not necessarily helpful, Parsi told CNN.\n\nSocial Media / Reuters The protests have spread to dozens of Iranian towns and cities in a matter of days.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nThe demonstrations don't necessarily signal the beginnings of a revolution or coup, according to Reza Marashi, National Iranian American Council research director.\n\nAs things currently stand, these protests more closely resemble a continuation of Iran's long-standing civil rights movement rather than an attempt to overthrow the government, Marashi recently wrote for HuffPost.\n\nMarashi served in the U.S. State Department's Office of Iranian Affairs in 2009, when Iran's Green Movement, a massive public display of discontent, unfolded in the wake of disputed elections.\n\nPolitical, economic, and social aspirations of the Iranian people have long been unmet – by the Islamic Republic, as well as its predecessors, Marashi said. Until these issues are addressed in a sustainable, comprehensive fashion, the gap between state and society will not fully heal.
Don't feel guilty if you can't remember the last time you and your partner got it on; sexless marriages have become almost endemic in modern society. According to data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, the top-searched marriage complaint on Google is sexless marriage ― and it only takes a second to stumble upon advice forums, like the Dead Bedrooms board on Reddit.\n\nBut couples in sexless marriages don't have to go on quietly suffering. Below, psychologists and sex therapists share their best advice for revving up your sex life.\n\n1. Work out your marital issues first.\n\nNothing kills your sex drive quite like unresolved relationship issues. If there's emotional baggage between you and your partner, address it head-on, said Chris Maxwell Rose, a sex educator and the creator of the Pleasure Mechanics online courses.\n\nPractice radical honesty and forgiveness outside the bedroom, she said. Take a walk or a drive together and share all of the emotional baggage that has been getting in your way. Then, make a joint commitment to move forward together.\n\n2. Acknowledge that there's a problem in the bedroom.\n\nThe most effective intervention to a sexless relationship is surprisingly simple: Partners need to acknowledge the problem and express interest in reconnecting sexually, said Kimberly Resnick Anderson, a sex therapist in Los Angeles, California.\n\nJust having an honest conversation can quickly shrink the elephant in the room, she said. Honoring the value of sex in a relationship is the first step toward reconnecting. Believe it or not, it's not uncommon for couples who have avoided sexual contact for years to leave my office after just one session and go home and have sex.\n\n3. Spend a few hours every week getting touchy-feely.\n\nSex isn't always going to be spontaneous. To get things started again, carve out two windows of time a week where all you do is touch. Think of it like a grownup makeout session, said Gracie Landes, a sex therapist and marriage and family therapist in New York City.\n\nFocus on your own sensations while you touch your partner, then gradually add in more mutual touch and slowly build up to intercourse, Landes said. But only pursue that last step when you're both ready, comfortable and confident.\n\n4. Use your memories to your advantage.\n\nIt's going to take some time to get in a sexy frame of mind. To get there, New York City sex therapist Megan Fleming recommends reminiscing about a really hot sex experience from your past.\n\nReplay it in your mind's eye, like watching a movie, she suggested. You have to really allow yourself to reconnect with how the experience felt, incorporating all five senses. It's important to realize you have the power to turn yourself on long before your partner enters the room.\n\n5. Read erotica or watch porn together.\n\nIt helps to have an active imagination during sex, but if you're struggling to imagine something that gets you or your partner off, outsource the job, advised Ian Kerner, a sex therapist and the author of She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman.\n\nMany of the couples I work with are surprised at how hot it can be to read erotica together, he said. Others enjoy watching porn and letting their fingers do the talking.\n\nKerner's top erotica recommendations include old-school works like Emmanuelle by Emmanuelle Arsan, the Story of O by Pauline Reage or Delta of Venus by Anais Nin. If you're more of a visual person, you may want to give ethical, women-friendly porn a chance. (Kerner recommends the films of Jackie St. James or Erika Lust.)\n\n6. Find out what your partner is craving sexually, and learn how to give it to them.\n\nChances are, your turn-ons have changed over time. The same is probably true for your partner. Take the guesswork out of the equation by talking openly about your sexual interests, said Keeley Rankin, a sex therapist in San Francisco, California.\n\nSexual needs can change over time and it's important to ask every once and a while, 'hey, what have you been craving sexually?' Once you find out, learn how to give that to them, she said. If they want something you're not familiar with, let them teach you.\n\n7. Develop new sex menus together.\n\nTry to picture your sex life this way: Just like there are different food groups that make up the food pyramid, there's a limitless amount of sex positions and kinks to explore to keep your sex life vibrant and healthy. Read the Kama Sutra, search sex positions online ― do whatever it takes to get excited about sex again, Kerner said.
Have you seen those photos of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston? my sister asked me casually over the long weekend.\n\nUm, of course I had. Logging onto Facebook Sunday night, doing that obligatory bored-on-the-weekend scroll, I couldn't escape the posts about the exes' backstage run-in at the 2020 Screen Actors Guild Awards. (And I kid you not, at least three of the articles had breaking news tags. Relax, news orgs.)\n\nGranted, they are pretty great photos. Let's recap:\n\nEmma McIntyre via Getty Images Fancy running into you, Bradley.\n\nBackstage, congratulating each other for acting-award wins for their respective roles in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Morning Show, the former husband and wife were positively beaming.\n\nVivien Killilea via Getty Images As the body language experts will breathlessly tell you, their posture shows their love never died!\n\nAlexa, play The Way We Were. (There is something vaguely Katie Morosky/Barbra Streisand and preppy Hubbell Gardiner/Robert Redford about the way they look, right?)\n\nEmma McIntyre via Getty Images The photos -- especially the one of Pitt reaching for Aniston's hand -- made a splash online over the weekend.\n\nYeah, I saw them! I told my sister, pulling them up again just for good measure. They were everywhere.\n\nBut just as I was getting my Google image search on, I got reality checked.\n\nWeren't there all these rumors he cheated on her with Angelina Jolie? my sister said with the ignorant bliss of a younger sibling who was in elementary school when it all (allegedly!) went down.\n\nOh, dammit, yeah. Aniston and Pitt broke up in 2005 after five years of marriage and rumors that the actor had fallen for his Mr. And Mrs. Smith co-star, leading Aniston to famously tell Vanity Fair that Pitt was missing a sensitivity chip. Ouch.\n\nBORIS HORVAT via Getty Images Before the split: The couple arrive at the Cannes Film Festival for the official release of Troy on May 13, 2004.\n\nNow, they're racking up awards for their work and both conveniently single at the same time, much to the public's glee. (Don't judge; 2020 is already off to a rough start, news cycle-wise — we need this!)\n\nFor what it's worth, they both seem to be thrilled for each other's success. When Aniston went up to accept her SAG award for Female Actor in a Drama Series, Brad was seen watching with a big grin on his face backstage:\n\nWe forever want to watch Brad watch Jen receive her Actor® #sagawards pic.twitter.com/4arINQhKQx — SAG Awards® (@SAGawards) January 20, 2020\n\nBut, reality check number two: By all accounts, the exes are just friends, have been for years now (Pitt even turned up at Aniston's 50th birthday last year), and have no plans to return to their 2000s super-couple glory.\n\nThat hasn't stopped people from really wanting a reconciliation to happen. It's hard not to project with these pics, said Tom Fitzgerald, one half of the fashion-blogging duo Tom & Lorenzo and the co-author of the upcoming book Legendary Children: The First Decade of RuPaul's Drag Race and the Last Century of Queer Life.\n\nMy husband and I never had any dog in this hunt, but even we were surprised by our own reactions to the pictures, Fitzgerald told HuffPost. There were literal gay gasps when we saw that shot of him grasping her wrist as she turned away.\n\nFitzgerald has a few theories on why the internet responded the way it did. (Besides the fact that knee-jerk histrionics is kind of Twitter's thing.)\n\nPart of the reason everyone reacted so strongly is because Brad and Jen are both so iconic now and nearly an entire generation has grown up without seeing contemporary pictures of them together, he said. But another reason is because those shots ― especially the wrist one ― were so ridiculously romantic in tone.\n\nTherapist: so what brings you in today?\n\nMe: *slams this picture of Brad Pitt holding Jennifer Anniston's hand on the table* pic.twitter.com/RtiuRue5YJ — Brett S. Vergara (@BrettSVergara) January 20, 2020\n\nFitzgerald doesn't think there's any romance brewing, though. He's more inclined to see the moment as an instance of old friends and lovers simply showing some affection for each other and doing that thing that time tends to do for old lovers: forgive and forget the past.\n\nThat said, the writer gets why people are rooting for a reconciliation. As he pointed out, we tend to view celebrities as avatars for our fears, hopes, desires and perceptions.\n\nCelebrities become stand-ins or representations of our own emotional states, Fitzgerald said. It's why Jen became this patron saint of heartbroken women in the eyes of the public for so many years. It wasn't fair to her, but she became a stand-in for how people feel about women who are unlucky in love; whether those people were themselves unlucky or whether they enjoyed judging women who were.\n\nSure, it sounds a tad silly, but to see Pitt and Aniston ― two nearly perfect avatars of the concept of a failed marriage ― so publicly embrace each other gives hope to the rest of us that it's possible to mend a broken relationship. (And in this case, it's extra nice to see Pitt rehab his image and enjoy critical success after getting sober. Aniston, too, is finally getting recognition she's long deserved for her dramatic work. Why not tack a love story onto that feel-good narrative, too?)\n\nMe: Brad and Jen are mature adults who can be friends without the world freaking out every time they're in the same room together ok?\n\n\n\nMe after seeing The Photo: do we call them Braniston or Anipitt — Rachel Simon (@Rachel_Simon) January 20, 2020\n\nFor the romantic realists among us, it's not so much a desire for them to get back together that most of us feel, as much as a sweet confirmation that the pair are still connected and bonded in spite of everything that allegedly went down, said Katherine Schafler, a psychotherapist in New York.\n\nHere we have two exes supporting each other, there's not one winner and one loser, it's so platonic, she said. Their connection reminds us that even when things don't end the way you were expecting them to, you can still have a happy ending in other ways. In true Hollywood fashion, we all love a happy ending, perhaps that why we can't get enough of these two. \n\nIt's kind of like how you'd be thrilled if your friends who dated for years are finally fine with being in the same room again; no more weirdness at parties!\n\nCollectively, we can leave the past in the past: Pitt and Aniston will forever be the chillest couple to ever chill in Hollywood, a golden pair with golden tans to match. (Seriously, how do two people get so matchy matchy with their tans?)\n\nBut for all the diehard fans, there's always going to be steadfast critics.\n\nAlicia Mintz, the co-host of the pop culture podcast Trashy Divorces (of course they covered the Aniston-Pitt split) is still firmly Team Jen, however the chips may fall.\n\nMy co-host Stacie and I actually hold fast to the controversial hot take that people split up for a reason, and should probably stay that way, she said. In our episode on this whole sorry Jen-Brad-Angelina spectacle, I had a very personal message for Jen as she and Brad revived their friendship post-Angelina: Don't do it!
Getty Images\n\nThis is Part 1 of a three-part series on the Modi government's plans to build a tracking database for every Indian. You can read Part 2 and Part 3 here.\n\nNEW DELHI — The Narendra Modi government is in the final stages of creating an all-encompassing, auto-updating, searchable database to track every aspect of the lives of each of India's over 1.2 billion residents, previously undisclosed government documents reviewed by HuffPost India establish.\n\nIf the plans of Modi's bureaucrats and advisors are realised, this system will automatically track when a citizen moves between cities, changes jobs, buys new property, when a member of a family is born, dies or gets married and moves to their spouse's home. The interoperability of modern database systems means there is no technical limit to the extent of data that can be collected and indexed by this master database of databases. In a meeting on October 4, 2019, for instance, a special secretary of the NITI Aayog even proposed geo-tagging every single home and integrating it with Bhuvan, a web-based geo-spatial portal developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\n\nFive years in the making, the proposed National Social Registry has thus far been described by the Indian press as a routine exercise to update the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) to prevent the misuse of pro-poor government schemes by ensuring that benefits and entitlements reach the right people. The fact that the Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for the SECC has helped further this impression that the SECC update is an innocuous bureaucratic task.\n\nNow, documents obtained through the Right To Information Act by Srinivas Kodali, data and internet governance researcher, and this correspondent suggest quite the opposite: Under the guise of creating a SECC that automatically updates itself in real time, the National Social Registry (or the Social Registry Information System or SECC Social registry as it is also known) will either be a single, searchable Aadhaar-seeded database or multiple harmonised and integrated databases that use Aadhaar numbers to integrate religion, caste, income, property, education, marital status, employment, disability and family-tree data of every single citizen.\n\nThe National Social Registry, the documents make clear, will not be restricted to sucking up data on below-poverty-line families who rely on state support, but every single Indian citizen.\n\nUnlike the Indian population census — governed by the Indian Census Act of 1948 that legally mandates the confidentiality of those enumerated — the SECC has no such safeguards.\n\nYet this registry is no pipe-dream.\n\nFile notings, meeting minutes and interdepartmental correspondence reviewed by HuffPost India reveal that the government has taken concrete steps towards building this database:\n\nAn expert committee has been set up to implement the social registry by next year, i.e 2021. The committee is in the final stages of planning a pilot project to test the best way to get it done.\n\nThis expert committee has proposed amendments to the Aadhaar Act to allow the government to capture this information without running afoul of the 2018 Supreme Court judgment that restricted the use of Aadhaar and reiterated individual privacy as a fundamental right.\n\nThe Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has decided to amend the Aadhaar rules, the minutes of the October 4 meeting show. If implemented, these changes will render the 2018 judgment meaningless by removing the few privacy safeguards that are part of the original Aadhaar law.\n\nUIDAI informs Aadhaar rules amendments are in the pipeline.\n\nUIDAI has suggested a Data Exchange Framework to ensure that the hundreds of government-administered databases scattered across several ministries and departments at the state and central level can easily exchange data. HuffPost India could not establish if this proposal has been accepted.\n\nThe World Bank has also assured cooperation, according to a file noting dated June 17, 2019, and has agreed to an initial $2 million grant under the bank's Non-Lending Technical Assistance programme.\n\nThe World Bank has 'assured cooperation', according to a file noting dated June 17, 2019.\n\nThese revelations are particularly significant at a time when India's Home Minister Amit Shah of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has openly spoken of creating a National Register of Citizens to weed out so-called foreign infiltrators that Shah claims are hollowing out India like termites. Shah has never provided any evidence to support his claims.\n\nIf the registry is implemented in its current form, privacy experts warn, the government can use opaque algorithms to sift through reams of data and arbitrarily designate individuals as citizens or non-citizens. HuffPost India has previously reported on how the use of such algorithms may have robbed millions of citizens of their right to vote in the Telangana and Rajasthan state elections in 2018.\n\nThe SECC's decade-long mutation, from a foundational census to ostensibly efficiently deliver benefits to the poor into an mass-surveillance system, reveals how the Indian government is rapidly building surveillance infrastructure under the guise of poverty alleviation and how organisations like the World Bank are happy to offer advice to developing countries building intrusive systems that may not pass muster in places like Europe.\n\nSuch an unrestrained mass surveillance system could threaten liberty like never before, said Chinmayi Arun, Fellow of the Information Society Project at Yale Law School, who taught law in India between 2010 and 2018.\n\nIndia's safeguards for state surveillance have always been weak. But this near-complete Orwellian surveillance would overturn the balance of power between citizens and the state, Arun said. It may be safe to say that if the state manages successfully to watch us so closely, India's democracy will gradually become unrecognisable.\n\nA 'dynamic' registry\n\nIn 2011, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's United Progressive Alliance government embarked on India's first caste-based census since 1931. The 2011 SECC, as its name makes clear, was a census, not a survey: this meant the government sought to collect data on the caste, incomes and set social parameters of every single Indian citizen.\n\nThe project was coordinated by the Ministry of Rural Development but conducted by three different government agencies: The ministry of rural development handled rural India, the urban census was carried out by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, and the politically-sensitive caste census was administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs: Registrar General of India (RGI) and Census Commissioner of India.\n\nOn July 3, 2015, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government published the socio-economic data captured by the SECC, but withheld the politically-sensitive caste data.\n\nThe SECC heralded a quantum shift in the way the Indian state understood the question of poverty and entitlements. For decades, Indian policymakers had defined the poor as families whose annual incomes placed them below a threshold defined as the poverty line.\n\nThe SECC sought a more granular picture of entitlements to capture the increasing financial complexity of the lives of Indian citizens, and the increasingly focused nature of government support schemes. State and central governments were now rolling out schemes that looked at indicators other than annual family income — like school scholarships earmarked for girl students, loans to start small businesses, etc.\n\nThe SECC data, Chaudhary Birender Singh, the Union Minister for Rural Development at the time, said, addresses the multi-dimensionality of poverty and provides a unique opportunity for a convergent, evidence based planning with a Gram Panchayat as unit.\n\nOn 13 October, 2015, the Ministry of Rural Development proposed a social registry system to ensure greater benefits from SECC data to the Parliament Standing Committee on rural development, according to a November 2015 file noting reviewed by HuffPost India.\n\nOn November 27, 2015, the then-Economic Advisor of the Ministry of Rural Development, Manoranjan Kumar, composed a detailed note that would serve as the basis for an ambitious project to turn the SECC data into a continually updating registry.\n\nTo be effective social registry SECC would need continuous updating to become dynamic social registry, Kumar wrote in his note.\n\nThe system should update itself automatically, Kumar's junior Dhruv Kumar Singh suggested. The proposed system is subject to auto-updation in future since the profile of beneficiaries will change once they receive any support.\n\nThat way, the government would know when a family on the brink of impoverishment suddenly became eligible for assistance, or conversely, when state benefits offered to a poor family might have improved their financial security to the point they were no longer eligible for state support.\n\nFurther, families were constantly moving from rural to urban areas, and back again — implying that the distinction between urban and rural families (eligible for corresponding urban and rural welfare schemes) was becoming harder to maintain.\n\nKumar's solution was to come up with a centralised database, or registry, that relied on Aadhaar-enabled transactions to capture vast swathes of information about every Indian.\n\nThe MoRD needs to opt for the largest set of database (all the households in the country) if the country has to deal with poverty in a non-asymmetric manner, Kumar wrote.\n\nManoranjan Kumar, then-Economic Advisor of the Ministry of Rural Development, said in his detailed note that all households will be part of the social registry.\n\nWhere government departments had previously maintained lists of scheme beneficiaries, the Social Registry would capture what Kumar called potential beneficiaries — and since everyone in India could potentially, at some point, avail of some government scheme, the system would capture everyone.\n\nKumar's idea was in line with the government's increasing focus on hi-tech solutions, led by Aadhaar, to deliver welfare schemes. Experts believe these solutions have not worked the way the government claimed they would.\n\nThe past experience of when the government uses data and hi-tech tools to target the right beneficiaries has not been good or efficient, said Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, an organisation that campaigns for transparency in implementation of welfare schemes. The power structures provide wrong or fake information to ensure their own inclusion, at the cost of the poor and marginalised.\n\nWhat the government has done with the tools like Aadhaar is that they have excessively collected information and have then used privacy as an excuse to keep it away from the community, Dey said. The potential of misuse of techno-managerial tools is huge.\n\nAlways watching\n\nKumar's note triggered a five-year long process that continues to this day. Over the years, various departments, ministries, think-tanks and agencies like the NITI Aayog, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and the World Bank have weighed in with suggestions.\n\nIn theory, a dynamic database that helpfully points out everyone who needs government assistance sounds like a great idea. But the only way to do so in practice is by continuously monitoring the economic and social lives of every citizen — something that experts with the best intentions did not realise at the time. Over three years, every additional suggestion has only made the Social Registry more and more intrusive.\n\nIn January 2016, for instance, the Ministry of Rural Development constituted an expert group under the former finance secretary Sumit Bose to define criteria for identifying beneficiaries of various welfare schemes using the SECC. The committee submitted its report endorsing the idea of a dynamic database in November 2016.\n\nYet, some members of the committee said they would never have endorsed a database as intrusive as the Social Registry appears today.\n\nSuch profiling of the entire population, through seeding of Aadhaar, was never our recommendation, said Himanshu, associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi, who was part of the Sumit Bose committee that recommended creation of the social registry in 2016.\n\nOur suggestion was to create one common register of all eligible families for all the subsidies and welfare schemes using the SECC, which can be constantly updated, so that there is convergence of the schemes, Himanshu told HuffPost India in an interview. But the government never got back to us.\n\nIn March 2016, the government had also roped in the NITI Aayog to offer their suggestions.\n\nThe NITI Aayog said the concept of family tree must be built into the information system for added advantage, according to a note dated May 13, 2016, penned by Senior Statistical Officer S.C. Jha.\n\nFor the Social Registry to be relevant all times and its utility for various government programs the NITI Aayog said it must be linked to birth, death and marriage Registers, to account for migratory changes. The ministry agreed to incorporate the suggestions, shows a note dated May 20, 2016 by Dhruv Kumar Singh, director in the ministry.\n\nNITI Aayog proposing family tree and linking with birth-death registries\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations and conversations between the government and the World Bank's India office continued apace. But by March 2017, some officials in the Ministry of Rural Development appeared unimpressed by the Bank's suggestions.\n\nAll options offered by the WB are feeble cases, far weaker than many states in India have to offer, Manoranjan Kumar, the economic advisor to the Rural Development Ministry at that time, wrote on March 15, 2017. He suggested the ministry should look at the Social Security System of the USA as a model, which not only helps track the economic status of individuals but also traces individual's interaction with any government program.\n\nIn June 2017, the ministry constituted an Inter-Ministerial Expert Committee for examining the feasibility of updating the SECC 2011 data and suggesting institutional framework for managing the Social Registry.\n\nThe committee had members from the UIDAI, the World Bank, National Informatics Centre, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Centre for Digital Financial Inclusion and the Direct Benefit Transfer Mission.\n\nThe committee, the file notings suggest, has met four times between June 2017 and October 2019.\n\nThe Ministry of Rural Development, the UIDAI and the Registrar of General of India under the union home ministry did not respond to HuffPost India's queries despite repeated reminders.\n\nThe World Bank confirmed its engagement with the Rural Development Ministry on the Social Registry. The Bank's support did not warrant any lending and involved limited exchange of knowledge, a spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost India.\n\nViolation of privacy and misuse/surveillance are of utmost concern for the central and state governments and the Bank, the Bank said. As part of the Technical Assistance, the World Bank shared multiple examples and approaches of different countries highlighting the importance of privacy, protection and sharing of data.\n\nThe bank, however, refused to share its submissions to the government, saying they were in deliberative stages.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, the Prime Minister Modi signed off on a proposal to update the SECC. The specifics and safeguards of the SECC were yet to be ironed out, but one thing was clear — it was now a question of when the registry would be built, rather than if it would be built at all.\n\nThe Aadhaar effect\n\nWere it not for Aadhaar, the Social Registry would never have gotten off the ground. The presence of Aadhaar as a single identifier has made it easy to merge several databases into a single registry.\n\nFor instance, imagine two separate lists — of PAN numbers and cell-phone numbers — each seeded with their respective unique Aadhaar numbers. It is now easy to create a unified database of PAN numbers and phone numbers using Aadhaar as the common identifier.\n\nBut there was a hitch.\n\nPrivacy experts had filed a series of petitions in the Indian Supreme Court warning of precisely such a scenario, where the mandatory seeding of Aadhaar in everything from airport boarding systems, to election IDs, to opening bank accounts, to buying mobile connections, to marriage registrations, would allow the Indian government to create a massive surveillance database akin to the Social Registry System.\n\nThe privacy experts were right — as noted earlier, the UIDAI was part of an Inter-Ministry panel on implementing the Social Registry System by June 2017.\n\nBut in July 2017, the UIDAI filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court claiming the opposite.\n\nBy design, the technology architecture of UIDAI precludes even the possibility of profiling individuals for tracking their activities, the authority stated in the affidavit. Dismissing the concerns of privacy advocates, the UIDAI falsely claimed that contention of the petitioners that on the basis of a single identifier, Aadhaar will enable the government agencies to track and profile and do surveillance is completely unfounded and denied.\n\nThe biggest error apparent that the Supreme Court made in the Aadhaar case is it focused on what UIDAI can or cannot do with Aadhaar and ignored entirely what the Government can or cannot do with it, said Anupam Saraph, a privacy advocate and a petitioner in the Aadhaar case.\n\nSaraph said 32 separate petitions had been filed against Aadhaar, highlighting its potential for misuse in everything from money laundering to profiling individuals.\n\nThe Supreme Court converted all of them into one petition against the UIDAI and decided the case on the basis of what UIDAI said it could or could not do, Saraph said. All those 32 cases must be reopened.\n\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court finally gave its judgment, restricting Aadhaar's use cases to only distributing government's subsidies to the poor.\n\nThe following year, in April 2019, the Ministry of Rural Development constituted an Overseeing Team to devise pilot exercises for updating the SECC data and exploring alternative options to Aadhaar as a single identifier across programs, the documents show.\n\nEventually, it was decided to simply change the Aadhaar Act instead. In June 2019, the Ministry for Rural Development prepared a note detailing the changes required to the regulations governing Aadhaar authentication, and the sharing of Aadhaar data.\n\nOn October 4, 2019, in the fourth and latest meeting of the inter-ministerial expert committee, the UIDAI said it was finalizing the amendments to the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations, 2016 and the Aadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations, 2016.\n\nIf implemented, these changes will render the Supreme Court judgment meaningless and even dilute the original Aadhaar rules: one of the key safeguards in the current rules states that the information received from a person in an Aadhaar-enabled transaction can only be used for the specific purpose for which their Aadhaar information was sought. This information cannot be shared further.\n\nOther safeguards relate to the sharing of Aadhaar-authentication logs. These logs contain data on location and time of the authentication, apart from the demographic and biometric information of the Aadhaar holder. At present, the rules forbid an authenticating agency from sharing authentication logs with anyone apart from the holder of a particular Aadhar number.\n\nBut the Social Registry is premised on the notion that citizen information — particularly Aadhaar-related information — shared with any government department can be seamlessly incorporated into a unified database accessible to a third government agency. These safeguards, the officials at the October 2019 meeting complained, would make it very difficult to build the Social Registry.\n\nOne of the solutions proposed by the Ministry of Rural Development was that if a user consents to share their data with one government agency, it shall be assumed that they have consented to share their data with all government agencies.\n\nInter-ministerial committee asks for Aadhaar rule amendments\n\nAs per the minutes of the October 2019 meeting, the UIDAI said, all the amendments are in the pipeline.\n\nUIDAI informs Aadhaar rules amendments are in the pipeline.\n\nThe blanket consent without a finite and legitimate purpose envisaged by these changes would be contrary to the directions of the Supreme Court, said Prasanna S., a privacy lawyer who argued in the Aadhaar case. Any state action that impinges on a citizen's privacy, the court said in the Puttaswamy judgment, must pass the following test:\n\nThe test mandates, 1. That State Action should be lawful - i.e. with the backing of enacted law. 2. It must pursue a legitimate purpose. 3. It must have rational connection to the object sought to be achieved by the law under which such state action happens. 4. Such state action must be necessary to achieve such objective. And 5. Such state action must be proportionate i.e. the least restrictive of all means available to achieve such objective, Prasanna said.\n\nWhen it says it must be for legitimate purpose, it pre-supposes that such a purpose is singular and definite. Collection of data for one purpose and use of it for another purpose without consent or a consent for general purpose data-sharing are incompatible with the purpose limitation principle, he added.\n\nTick tock to 2022\n\nAs things stand, the Modi government remains deeply invested in the Social Registry. Manoranjan Kumar, the man who first penned the foundational note that kicked off the process, has retired but his successors in bureaucracy continue to support the Social Registry in the slogans of the Modi regime.

He talks about himself ― and only himself.\n\nYour date shouldn't be monopolizing the conversation. You may be forgetting to talk about yourself, but a true gentleman will realize you're doing most of the listening and will want to know more about you. I would not recommend pushing yourself into the conversation more than you feel necessary. Simply try sharing a few thoughts, ideas or divulge a little about yourself. If you have to force him to listen to you, you can be pretty sure this is how the relationship will go in the long run. Cut your losses now. ― Amanda Deverich, a marriage and family therapist in Williamsburg, Virginia\n\n2. He asks you to hang out.\n\nDid your date plan a nice night out and is he putting in the effort? Contrary to popular belief, chivalry is not dead; there are plenty of good, thoughtful gentlemen (and women!) out there who care about your happiness and want to meet a wonderful partner. If your date asks you to 'hang out' at their place or doesn't exhibit basic kind gestures ― like asking if you're cold or opening a door ― don't expect them to make the effort later on. People with good manners [who] truly care will make the effort when it counts: Do they attempt to pick up the check? Do they ask if you're hungry or if you'd like dessert or a second drink? Do they ask if you mind sitting outside? A good person will know to be courteous and to care for the needs of their date ― yup, even on a first date. Pay attention and remember how you feel when you're with them: That very thing is what leads many people to divorce: One person feels like their partner never really thought to ask or cared about how they felt or what they wanted. ― Jenny Apple, a matchmaker in Los Angeles\n\n3. He tells you he's divorced, but that's not the full story.\n\nHis dating profile says that he is divorced, but then you find out that he's only separated? Bad sign. Overall, men like being in relationships. They try to bounce back from a divorce and re-partner quicker than women do. You need to find someone who is looking for the right woman, not the first woman who came along. ― Caroline Madden, a marriage therapist and the author of How To Go From Soulmates to Roommates in 10 Easy Steps\n\n4. He's overly dramatic.\n\nIf he spends the entire evening talking about his long history of life challenges ― a string of broken relationships, for instance, or constant moves, or job losses ― it could be a red flag. This may be someone who's so caught up in emotion that he's not able to deal with the practical. You may have a wonderful, emotional romance, and perhaps this will sustain you into happily ever. More than likely, though, life will get in the way and someone will have to deal with the practicality of paying the bills, sticking with a job, cleaning the house, and minding the children. ― Amanda Deverich\n\n5. He doesn't have any passions or hobbies.\n\nHobbies are important, which is why it's a good thing if you have a spouse who loves football, even when you hate it. Ultimately, that means your spouse will have interests and things that make him happy outside of your relationship. In the beginning, most couples spend all their time together. But eventually, you are going to want to hang out with your friends and do the things that make you happy. If he doesn't have his own thing going on, he might guilt trip you by saying you don't care about the relationship. In a relationship, both of you need to have a life of your own.― Caroline Madden\n\n6. He doesn't open up about anything.\n\nIf you're trying to get to know your date and they're having a very hard time opening up, it's a good sign they aren't emotionally mature enough or ready for something as important and deep as a long-term relationship or partnership. It's OK if they don't want to discuss everything at length on a first date, but anyone who is avoiding a topic altogether might have something to hide. Maybe they just had a bad breakup or trauma, which might mean it's too soon to get involved and they are looking for more of a distraction than a love interest. The building blocks of relationships involve vulnerability, and anyone who shows signs of serious avoidance might not be someone you want to trust your emotional life with in the future. They might be ready later on, but don't chase anyone that's not emotionally available. ― Jenny Apple\n\n7. He mentions that money is tight and asks you to foot the bill.\n\nYou can spot your ex-husband on the first date when he shows up at lunch or dinner and claims he is 'broke,' asking you to pay for the meal. If he is broke and unprepared to pay for the first meal, he will avoid responsibility and accountability in a marriage. Send that man packing! You need someone to be an asset, not a liability! ― Joyce Morley, a marriage and family therapist in Decatur, Georgia\n\n8. You feel like you are being interrogated.
Before photographer Travis Magee devoted himself to his camera, he toured the world as a modern dancer. He hasn't been able to shake his fascination with dancers' physiques -- particularly those that have been inked up -- since.\n\nThe dancers' bodies are their canvas and very often they must perform with minimal clothing, Magee explained to The Huffington Post. I've always been fascinated with the dancer who chooses to tattoo his or her body. It is unique, daring, and the first thing that the audience will notice when they first step out onstage.\n\nTravis Magee\n\nMagee's obsession soon became an inspiration, as the artist set out to combine his interests in body ink, movement and photography in one epic photo series. The resulting images feature partially nude bodies entwined beyond recognition, with colorful tattoos seeming to pass from one body to another.\n\nMagee had not met any of his subjects prior to shooting, nor had they met each other, and trust was a crucial factor in the images' success.\n\nIt was important to me that the tattoos appeared to flow seamlessly together, Magee added. I wanted the images of their flowers and vines to connect with one another. This way the dancers were not only connected through their partnering and movement, but also through the designs on their bodies.\n\nTravis Magee\n\nOf course, many dancers choose not to have tattoos, particularly those who practice classical ballet. In classical ballet it is all about the line, Rafael Bonachela, director of the Sydney Dance Company, explained to The Australian. You probably can't even have a suntan, and if you're supposed to be a swan you can't have a great tattoo across your chest.\n\nHowever, as tattoos become less and less taboo outside of the dance world, more and more dancers, from the Bangarra Dance Theatre to ballet icons like Sergei Polunin, are choosing to adorn their body with art that is as expressive as choreography.\n\nIf you'd like to see Polunin's tattoos in action, check out his performance for Hozier's video Take Me to Church, and prepare to be floored.

The first time Mary H. realized something was wrong with her body was the first time she had sex. She was 22, living in New Jersey, and with the high school boyfriend she had been dating since she was 16 years old. During their first intercourse, she felt a sharp pain at the entrance of her vagina that was so intense that they didn't complete the act. She continued to feel the pain during subsequent attempts.\n\nOver the years, she tried to bring up the pain with different health care providers, but was rebuffed. They advised her to drink some wine, relax, and watch movies. One clinic suggested her boyfriend may be coercing her into having rough sex. Another clinician said it could have something to do with her anxiety disorder.\n\nAfter eight years, the pain was so bad that on the rare occasions that she and her now-husband would have sex, Mary would end up crying in the shower afterward. After every climax, she said that cramping was so intense that it felt as if someone had moved her organs around inside her body.\n\nI felt like I was being a bad wife. I felt like I wasn't a woman, Mary recalled. What was I doing wrong?\n\nFor women like Mary who experience chronic, debilitating pain during sex, there can be few places to turn for help. If doctors learn about female sexual symptoms at all during medical school or residency, they are advised to prescribe ways to relax patients, like drinking alcohol. But sexual dysfunction symptoms are more common among people with chronic ailments like diabetes, psoriasis, depression or cardiovascular disease, and they can also be one of the first signs that something may be seriously wrong with a woman's reproductive organs. When a doctor dismisses a woman's concerns about sexual dysfunction, he or she could miss an opportunity to diagnose diseases where sexual dysfunction may be their first or only symptom.\n\n'It's all in your head'\n\nThe definition of female sexual dysfunction is slippery because it depends on an individual woman's own perspective on her symptoms. For instance, female sexual dysfunction is an umbrella term that covers symptoms like pain during sex, low libido, and difficulty with arousal or orgasm. But if a woman experiences these things and is not distressed about them, or if she is satisfied with the quality of her sex life, then she doesn't have female sexual dysfunction. Women can also experience seasons of female sexual dysfunction that come and go, depending on other factors in her life like postpartum recovery, serious illness or the beginning of menopause.\n\nThat may be why it's so difficult to measure how common female sexual dysfunction is in the U.S. One nationally representative survey from 1999 estimates that 43 percent of American women ages 18 to 59 experience sexual dysfunction, on the basis that they said they had experienced, for a period of several months or more, a lack of interest in sex, inability to have an orgasm, pain during sex, lack of pleasure during sex, anxiety before sex or an inability to self-lubricate in the past 12 months. But this number doesn't reveal whether any of these symptoms caused women distress, or whether some of these issues could be related to the woman's sex partner.\n\nDoctors in medical school and residency are typically not trained to approach sexual concerns this way, said Dr. Leah Millheiser, founder of the Female Sexual Medicine program at Stanford Hospital.\n\nAs a resident, I learned that it's all in a woman's head, Millheiser said. She should go home and drink a glass of wine.\n\nAs a consequence, women like Mary are not treated for serious medical problems, and can go from doctor to doctor feeling dismissed about issues that are having severe effects on their health, self-esteem and relationships.\n\nDr. Lauren Streicher, founder of the Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said that she is often the fourth or fifth doctor a woman has seen for a sexual health symptom. And while the causes of sexual dysfunction can be complex, they can also be symptoms of screenable diseases like thyroid problems, endometriosis or ovarian cancer — all things that can cause lack of libido or pain during sex and shouldn't require multiple doctors' visits to find.\n\nStreicher recalled a recent patient, a young woman whose problems were so severe that she hadn't been able to consummate her new marriage. She'd visited 14 other doctors about the pain she experienced during intercourse and was being pushed toward talk therapy as a solution.\n\nBut once Streicher performed a simple physical examination, she discovered an obvious explanation for the woman's problems: a vaginal septum, a rare condition in which a wall of flesh divides the vagina into two chambers. Every time she had tried to have sex, her partner's penis was crashing into the septum, causing her intense pain.\n\nStreicher was able to fix the problem with a simple surgery, but said she still referred the patient to talk therapy because the length of time it had taken to get the correct diagnosis had strained her relationship with her husband.\n\nLike Streicher's patient, some women may have a singular medical cause for their sexual symptoms. However, it's most likely that a complex mix of factors — both psychological and physical — could be contributing to sexual dysfunction. Additionally, one sexual concern could snowball into several other problems.\n\nThat's why an integrative approach to this issue is so crucial, said Millheiser. It's her job to triage a patient's symptoms, getting to the root of when the problem started, exploring factors in her life and relationship that may be contributing to the dysfunction, while also doing full physical workups to look for potential medical reasons for sexual symptoms.\n\nYou can't discount a sexual concern as 'just psychological,' because then a woman might become upset or offended, she said. She doesn't want to be told this is all in her head.\n\nFor most women, comprehensive care is out of reach\n\nThere are no accredited fellowships that allow doctors to specialize in sexual health for either men or women, but this hasn't stopped a handful of doctors from crafting their own training programs and opening medical practices in academic centers. Their goal: to take women at their word about sexual symptoms, which sometimes involves approaching problems as potential medical conditions.\n\nAfter cobbling together their own training on female sexual health, they take a multidisciplinary medical approach to female sexuality instead of simply shunting patients off to talk therapy.\n\nCenters that approach female sexual dysfunction from this perspective are rare, but growing. In addition to Streicher's program at Northwestern and Millheiser's at Stanford, academic medical centers at UCLA, UCSF, Indiana University Bloomington, Loyola University in Chicago, the University of Kansas, Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approach female sexual health in a multidisciplinary way. But Streicher said that most American women don't have access to this kind of comprehensive treatment for sexual health.\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of women, it's a very specialized thing, Streicher said. It doesn't exist.\n\nMaking up for lost time\n\nBy 2015, Mary was 29 and living in Maryland with her husband. She had seen three different doctors and even a reiki healer for the pain she experienced during sex. Her menstrual cramps were also getting worse, to the point that she was falling over from the pain or vomiting during her period.\n\nThe one day, a friend of hers who was teaching a class on human sexuality came across a small blurb in her textbook on endometriosis, a condition in which the uterine lining that usually grows inside the uterus begins to grow outside the organ, rooting itself onto ovaries, fallopian tubes, the colon, and other surfaces in the pelvic region. Then, during a woman's menstrual cycle, the lining begins to shed, causing severe cramping and pain.\n\nShe passed the blurb on to Mary, who immediately started doing more research on the disease. Armed with a list of endometriosis symptoms she had — including painful intercourse — she went to a new OB/GYN doctor who congratulated Mary on diagnosing herself.\n\nShe said, 'You should do this for a living, I can't believe you figured it out,' Mary recalled.\n\nAfter the initial clinical diagnosis, Mary went on to have laparoscopic surgery to confirm the presence of endometriosis and to remove the lining from other parts of her body. The surgeon told her he removed endometriosis from 80 percent of her pelvic region, as it was affecting her bladder, appendix, ovaries, pelvic wall and the area near her rectum. The lining had also created an endometrioma, or large cyst, on Mary's right ovary, pinning it to her pelvic wall.\n\nThat wasn't the end of her story. Because she had been enduring pelvic pain for so long, she had developed vaginismus, an involuntary clamping down of the pelvic floor muscles that made penetration difficult or painful. After the surgery, it took another eight months of pelvic floor therapy to help her ease back into sex with her husband. By then, she was 30 years old.\n\nIt was kind of like losing my virginity all over again, but in a much better way, she said. Now I see what all the fuss is about.\n\nStories like Mary's are exactly what Millheiser hopes to avoid with her approach. While she isn't Mary's doctor, listening to some of the facts of her case align with other patients she has seen. Millheiser said there's no doubt that years and years of painful intercourse would go on to cause more problems down the road. Specifically, that vaginismus is a very common result of untreated endometriosis.\n\n″Vaginismus is an involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, often as a result of fear of pain, Millheiser said. Her body was protecting her from pain.\n\nMary still lives with a small measure of pain — something she describes as completely tolerable, and avoids sex on days when she might have to do something else that might cause her pain to spike, like a long car ride that can jostle her body. But she cries thinking about the years of pain that affected her relationship with her husband.\n\nNow that I am sexually active, there's an added layer of guilt, where [I think], 'Wow, if he rejected me nearly as many times as I did then, I would be crushed,' she said.
You gotta work hard to love yourself and love other humans, the Veronica Mars alum continued.\n\nThe entertainer's words echo sentiments she's shared in the past. Bell has said she and Shepard decided there was no getting around talking about their relationship, likely because the two are both very public figures.\n\nWe could try to take all questions about our relationship off the table for the rest of our lives, and just be incredibly boring, or we could sort of open the kimono — as they say — and allow people to see what our marriage is like, Bell told E's Daily Pop last year.\n\nRecently, people got a look at one of the couple's disagreements, which involved a van, a wild mural, and a depiction of Bell that she wasn't thrilled with, to say the least.
Over 18 million Americans live with depression in any given year, and anxiety affects almost 40% of Americans. Occurrences of both of these individual mental health conditions are also on the rise ― so it's no surprise that there are tons of people who also experience them simultaneously.\n\nMany people are familiar with depression and anxiety on their own, but the challenges of dealing with them at the same time are less understood by those who don't directly live with them. That can lead to a lot of misconceptions.\n\nskyNext via Getty Images A person can have anxiety and depression at the same time, which can lead to many debilitating symptoms like lethargy, rumination, panic and more.\n\nHuffPost chatted with some individuals who have both anxiety and depression as well as mental health experts about what people commonly get wrong about living with anxiety and depression. Here are some of the most common offenders:\n\nMyth: Anxiety and depression are completely unique disorders.\n\nSarah Johnson, medical director at Landmark Outpatient Services, a mental health clinic in Louisville, Kentucky, said that anxiety and depression are two sides of the same coin. In other words, they both affect the same region of the brain (the amygdala, hippocampus and frontal cortex). Therefore, one can trigger the other.\n\nAnxiety may occur as a symptom of clinical depression. On the other hand, it's also possible to have depression that's triggered by an anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder or separation anxiety disorder, she said.\n\nMyth: Both conditions are rare.\n\nWhile it may feel at times like you are the only person in the world experiencing anxiety and depression, the reality is that many people are dealing with it too. Nearly 29% of people in the U.S. will meet criteria for an anxiety disorder in their lifetime and 20.8% for a mood disorder like depression, according to Luana Marques, an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.\n\nIf it is sometimes difficult for you to talk to family or friends about your experiences with anxiety and depression, consider talking to other people who are having similar experiences, she said, noting that you can find support groups for people with anxiety and depression at the ADAA website.\n\nRowan Jordan via Getty Images\n\nMyth: There is something wrong with you.\n\nI think the most common misconception about depression and anxiety is that there's something wrong with the person, as if suffering isn't a normal human emotion, said Calum Hughes, CEO of Allied Corp, a research and development company focused on developing therapeutic solutions for those living with PTSD.\n\nHe highlighted the popular misconception that people with mental illness are weak or can't exist in normal society and noted that mental health issues should be embraced just like any other medical issue.\n\nYou rarely hear of a stigma around people who have health conditions like diabetes; there shouldn't be a stigma around depression and anxiety. They are real medical conditions that are treatable, Hughes said.\n\nMyth: You shouldn't ask questions if someone tells you they have anxiety and depression.\n\nAfter I tell people I suffer with both, the conversation often ends there because they feel like they're not supposed to ask questions out of fear of triggering me or making me uncomfortable ― or maybe they're uncomfortable, explained Chelsea Giacobbe, a Hoboken, New Jersey-based consultant with anxiety and depression.\n\nGiacobbe prefers that people inquire about her condition and ask her questions as opposed to tiptoeing around it.\n\nIf I tell you I suffer from both, then I'm open to talking about it and answering any questions you have, she said. And you never know if something I say will help someone else in need that you encounter, or help you realize there is someone in your life crying for help without vocalizing it or even knowing it.\n\nMyth: The only way to deal with the conditions is to power through them.\n\nPeople often think that the best way of dealing with anxiety and depression is to just power through it or fake it until you make it. But that's not always the case.\n\nAmanda Stemen, a licensed therapist and owner of Fundamental Growth, a therapy, coaching, and consulting business in Los Angeles, stressed that it's OK to feel the poor moods that come with the conditions. In fact, not allowing yourself to process negative emotions can often do more harm than good, she said.\n\nIt's often when we don't allow ourselves to feel the physical sensations that come along with that, when we push them away, that it becomes something bigger, she said.\n\nStemen suggested setting a timer for two minutes, experiencing the feelings, and noticing how they shift and change the next time you're dealing with mood-related symptoms.\n\nWhile it's scary to feel uncomfortable emotions because we're afraid we'll get stuck there forever, it's actually avoiding our feelings that contributes greatly to depression and anxiety ― so feel the heck out of them, she said.\n\nMyth: Everyone with anxiety and depression experiences the same symptoms.\n\nAnxiety and depression are umbrella terms that encompass a wide range of experiences.\n\nFor some people, anxiety can look like worrying a lot about the future ... for other people it might look like having unexpected panic attacks weekly ... and for other people it might look like fear of specific things, Marquest said.\n\nDepression can also present as a wide range of symptoms.\n\nOne person with depression might sleep all the time, have no energy and experience low mood, while another person with depression might feel irritable, experience appetite changes, and lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, she said.\n\nMyth: You always know if you have anxiety and depression.\n\nIt seems absurd that someone won't know they are feeling so afraid they suffer anxiety or so down they are depressed, or a mixture of both. But often anxiety and depression show up as symptoms we might not consider to be anxiety or depression at all, said Winfried Sedhoff, a family physician specializing in treating mental illness in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nHe added that many of his patients don't go in to get an official diagnosis until they start to experience physical symptoms of the conditions such as regularly struggling to get to sleep, excessive worrying, chest pains, dizziness, feeling tired, and feeling washed out all the time without any apparent physical cause.\n\nMany clients I have seen have been thoroughly investigated over months or even years for many physical symptoms that were ultimately typical symptoms of anxiety and depression, he added.\n\nLucy Lambriex via Getty Images\n\nMyth: It's something people can just get over.\n\nAgain, depression and anxiety are considered medical issues. Sometimes that requires treatment, care and time.\n\nWhether you're taking medication or seeing a therapist, treatment for anxiety and depression is not a quick fix, said Emily Guarnotta, a licensed psychologist in New York that specializes in anxiety, depression and postpartum issues.\n\nShe added that successful treatment of simultaneous conditions involves changing long-standing thought patterns, beliefs and emotions and reconstructing new ones. All of this, of course, takes time. According to the American Psychological Association, half of therapy patients notice some improvements after 15 to 20 sessions, though some people take longer.\n\nIt's important to remain patient with the process and let go of any judgments about how long it should take to recover, Guarnotta said.\n\nMyth: Anxiety and depression are just genetic.\n\nRob Scheidlinger, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Westlake Village, California, said that it's largely a myth that depression and anxiety run in families and therefore most people who suffer are predisposed genetically.\n\nWhile there is some evidence that there are a few causes of these disorders that are genetically carried, an overwhelming amount of current research states that most of the causal factors are environmental and situational, he explained.\n\nMyth: People saying they have both conditions are just being dramatic.\n\nCheryl Poldrugach, founder and CEO of Panic Aide in Dallas, Texas, said she's been called dramatic a lot when talking about her anxiety and depression.\n\nFor those of us who truly suffer, it is life-altering. We lie to friends and family as to why we can't go somewhere, lose friends for not showing up, lose jobs, miss school, etc. she said, adding that anxiety and depression are a lethal mix and not to be taken lightly or prodded. It is real.\n\nCarla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist in Sonoma County, California, said that those who suffer from anxiety and depression are generally far from dramatic.\n\nIn fact, my clients often suffer from embarrassment due to their mental health status and the often-uncontrollable nature of their symptoms, she said. Although some of the symptoms may appear to be melodramatic in nature to bystanders, there is no joy or attention-getting benefit in a dual diagnosis of anxiety and depression.\n\nMyth: These conditions will go away on their own.\n\nDepression and anxiety can both be serious medical issues. There is absolutely nothing wrong with getting help for your mental health.\n\nFeeling depressed or anxious is a signal to your brain from your body that there is something going on inside that needs to be dealt with, said Meredith Sagan, chief psychiatrist at Alo House Recovery Center in Malibu, California.
MOSCOW, March 2 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin has proposed amending the Russian constitution to spell out that marriage means a union between a man and a woman and nothing else, a senior politician was cited as saying on Monday by the RIA news agency.\n\nPutin, who has aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, has proposed a shake-up of Russia's political system that critics say may be designed to extend his grip on power after 2024, when he is due to leave the Kremlin.\n\nHe and his supporters see that overhaul as an opportunity to modify the constitution to enshrine what they see as Russia's core moral and geopolitical values for future generations.\n\nPutin on Monday submitted his constitutional proposals to parliament just before the deadline, RIA cited Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the lower house, as saying.\n\nFor me, the most important one is his proposal to enshrine in basic law the concept of marriage as a union between a man and a woman, Tolstoy added.\n\nPutin said last month Russia would not legalize gay marriage as long as he was in the Kremlin.

On May 18, 2018, the moment my baby boy was born, I was overwhelmed with emotions. I cried, the nurse cried; it was beautiful. This is it, I thought. This is the feeling everyone told me about. I had a rough pregnancy, having been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum ― severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy ― early on, so giving birth felt like a relief. Later, I was wheeled into the recovery room and a hospital staffer came in with a checklist: Was I feeling sad? Did I feel worthless? Did I feel like hurting myself or others? My answers were a big no! I wasn't sad at all.\n\nHowever, there was another feeling overpowering any resemblance of joy. It was this overwhelming sense of responsibility and fear weighing down on me. Here was this little, helpless baby, and his life was in my hands. Thoughts of sudden infant death syndrome, illnesses and an immature immune system flooded my mind. I entered a state of panic. I've always been a positive, upbeat and rational person, and, although I've been known to be a planner and sometimes worry over little things, I'd never suffered from anxiety before that moment.\n\nWe went into the hospital at 5 a.m. for a scheduled cesarean section. Late that same night, I was still wide awake. The nurse told me several times I needed rest. I smiled and nodded but wouldn't dare let myself close my eyes. She finally came in and asked why I wouldn't sleep. I broke down. In between sobs, I explained to her that my baby was going to die if I went to sleep, and I wasn't going to let that happen.\n\nAlthough I've been known to be a planner and sometimes worry over little things, I'd never suffered from anxiety before that moment.\n\nWhen we were sent home, I continued staying up all night. I was determined to keep my baby alive by watching to make sure he took every breath. Yes, we had also bought an electronic monitor (at my insistence) to track his heart rate and breathing, but it didn't matter.\n\nWhen I needed to get up to feed or change the baby's diaper in the middle of the night, every step I took caused excruciating pain. I was also weak from excessive blood loss. On most nights, I would cry for hours, feeling frustrated, alone, helpless and hopeless, waiting for the sun to come up and for my baby to make it through one more night. Although I had a lot of support at home from both my husband and my mother-in-law, I did not ask for help. No one can care for my baby like I can, I reasoned. Plus, I needed everyone else to be wide awake in the mornings to watch him for me, in case I dozed off then.\n\nOnce my husband was up in the morning, he'd take the baby and I'd let myself sleep for a couple of hours. I would dream that my baby died and wake up in a panic, never wanting to sleep again. I would spend my days in a room power-pumping, breastfeeding and breaking down crying every time my baby made a noise. In spite of my efforts, I wasn't producing enough milk. I was devastated.\n\nMy baby had a perfect latch. He was born big and strong, and was doing everything right. Yet my body refused to cooperate and do what was supposed to be natural. Breastfeeding advocates reiterated that formula wasn't the best, it wasn't even second or third best, for that matter. Over and over again, support groups screamed that every mom could breastfeed, and if I wasn't, I was just being selfish and I was surely hurting my child.\n\nI searched for donor milk, but my baby was healthy. He wouldn't be on any priority list to receive it. I searched online and came across warnings of premature infants who had died from tainted formula ― I was instantly terrified that would happen to my child. But my baby wasn't a preemie, he was born big at almost 41 weeks. No one understood why I was so concerned, and I couldn't explain it to them. I would hear my baby's stomach while he drank his bottle, and every swallow was a punch to my gut. I tried lactation consultants, power-pumping, weigh-ins and even a supplemental nursing system. Nothing worked.\n\nI felt I was failing this innocent child I had just brought into the world. Throughout the day, I would cry for seemingly no reason at all, but inside I kept thinking of all the ways a newborn could die and how horrible of a mother I was turning out to be. I didn't feel joy, and I didn't feel connected to my baby.\n\nThroughout the day, I would cry for seemingly no reason at all, but inside I kept thinking of how horrible of a mother I was turning out to be.\n\nI thought of how much of a challenge pregnancy was, how I wasn't able to deliver naturally and how my body couldn't feed my child. It was becoming obvious to me that I wasn't meant to be a mom. People say that your maternal instincts kick in as soon as your baby is born and to follow your gut. My instincts were screaming that something was terribly wrong. I was sure the worst would happen at any moment. I knew my marriage would be devastated over it and that I would never recover. I felt I had ruined everyone's lives. I also thought about the end of maternity leave, and how I would go back to work without having enjoyed my baby; and if he lived that long, he would surely die without me at home watching over him.\n\nI would see posts from new moms about how overjoyed they were. I didn't understand. I couldn't comprehend why I didn't feel the same thing they did and why they didn't seem as worried as I was. I remember my husband fawning over the baby and saying over and over again how in love he was. He'd ask me if I was happy. I didn't know how to reply. All I felt was this constant painful and crushing feeling in my heart and in my chest. I was also frustrated that he didn't understand that any breath could be our baby's last.\n\nAt one point, my husband said he was worried about me, and my sister told me I should talk to someone. But at my six-week checkup appointment, when the doctor asked what the most surprising thing about motherhood was, I looked down, embarrassed I didn't have a better answer, and quietly said, The overwhelming anxiety. I wasn't expecting that. He smiled and told me it was normal. But it didn't feel normal. I wanted to scream and cry and beg him to help me. I wanted to tell him I couldn't be a mother. I wanted to tell him my baby was going to die. Instead, I smiled back and told myself that maybe this is how it felt. That maybe others just never shared that with me. That just maybe I would carry this pain, tightening in my chest and shortness of breath the rest of my life. I remember thinking it couldn't be possible to live like that forever.\n\nPeople assured me I was going to miss this newborn stage. Meanwhile, all I kept praying was for my baby to grow. For him to not be a fragile newborn anymore! I was counting down the days before he could have his first set of vaccines that offered some sort of protection. Yet when that day came, I broke down in tears wondering if I had made the right decision. All the warnings I had seen on social media came rushing in. Had I not read the vaccine inserts enough? What if I was injecting my baby with poison? I began recording him on my phone while he slept to have a doctor evaluate his breathing for any possible adverse reaction.\n\nFriends asked me if I was able to see how the rough pregnancy that I endured was worth it. But by the time I had a complete breakdown and snapped at my mother after she coughed during one of her visits, I was regretting the decision to ever become a mother. It was too hard, and my heart hurt too much. I used to be happy. What did I do? Why did I cause myself and my family so much anxiety? Whose idea was it to let me have a child? I had no training, no experience and no real knowledge. Why did they ever let me walk out of the hospital with a baby? That didn't even sound safe. Didn't they know this baby would die in my hands and under my watch? These thoughts were constantly flooding my mind.\n\nLooking back, I now know what I was feeling was extreme anxiety ― a lot of it irrational but still very real to me. My child is now 8 months old and insanely happy. I'm now amazed that my body created this big, healthy, beautiful human being. I don't know exactly how things started to get better. But thankfully they did. Had they not, I would have eventually sought help. Therapy and medication, if needed. I still struggle with wanting to overprotect my child. I still panic and overreact at moments. But I'm working on it every day.\n\nOne morning, my husband woke up and saw me cuddling and talking to our baby and he said, You're feeling better. And you're feeling differently about him, aren't you? He looked so relieved. The entire time I thought I was suffering alone. But, in reality, my anxiety had affected us all.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story you want to share? Send your story description to pitch@huffpost.com.
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas legislation that would make it a felony for doctors to provide medical treatments that help transgender youth transition is unlikely to get a hearing, the head of the committee to which it has been assigned said Thursday.\n\nFour conservative GOP members of the Kansas House introduced the measure Wednesday, drawing immediate and strong condemnation from the Legislature's first transgender member, its two other openly LGBTQ lawmakers and the executive director of the state's leading LGBTQ-rights organization.\n\nIt is among measures in more than a dozen state legislatures targeting transgender youth in sports or medical treatments for them. States are considering them after an executive order from Democratic President Joe Biden prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity in school sports and elsewhere sparked a backlash from conservative groups.\n\nIt turns off the medical interventions that a parent can seek for their child, said Democratic Rep. Stephanie Byers, of Wichita, a transgender woman who was elected last year.\n\nByers added: I've known who I am since I was — before kindergarten.\n\nThe House health committee probably will not have a hearing for the measure because it has too much other work, such as proposals for modernizing the state's mental health system, said Chair Brenda Landwehr, a Wichita Republican.\n\nThe bill would apply not only to performing surgery on transgender minors but also to other treatments, such as prescribing drugs to block the onset of puberty to prepare a child for transitioning. Under the measure, doctors could be sentenced to up to eight months in prison for unlawful gender reassignment service and lose their medical licenses for unprofessional conduct.\n\nOne of the Kansas measure's sponsors, rural northeast Kansas Republican Rep. Randy Garber, said it is designed to protect minors when they are too young to be making those decisions.\n\nAsked about LGBTQ advocates' statements that transgender people often know from a young age that their identities don't match the gender assigned to them at birth, Garber said: They probably know they want to get drunk, too, but we don't let them drink alcohol, do we? Or smoke, or whatever.\n\nKansas is among at least eight states where lawmakers are considering such a measure. At least seven states are considering proposals to restrict transgender students' participation in sports, a measure that was introduced in the Kansas House last year but died without getting a hearing. Lawmakers in Montana and South Carolina are considering both ideas.\n\nEver since (same-sex) marriage was declared constitutional, they've changed their targets, said Tom Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas. Instead of going after grownups, almost every single one of these bills across the country has been targeted at little kids.\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna
Romanticizing the name change\n\nGirls begin doodling their names with their prospective husband's names long before they actually ever really know a man, usually in elementary school (or was that just me?). I had perfected my loopy cursive signature Lindsay Morris (after adorable heartthrob Zach Morris), and covered my Lisa Frank folders with a slew of other intended future names.\n\nWhen a woman gets married, her last name changes. In order to promote a single family unit, carry on the American tradition, and show allegiance to your husband, women change their names. It's a very nice sentiment and certainly one I will not criticize -- every woman is entitled to her choice. However, since this is the most widely accepted behavior, I will not spend time promoting nor defending this tradition -- society and my uber conventional family forcefully advocate this tradition enough.\n\nQuestioning tradition\n\nWhen I was getting married, I assumed I would change my last name. My husband has a great last name; it didn't rhyme with my name nor was it too difficult to pronounce or spell. When our two year engagement was getting down to the wire though, I realized I actually had to make this commitment, which is when I did something really dangerous. Get ready for this, and don't say I didn't warn you: I thought about the decision to change my name.\n\nWHAT?! you're asking. Why would I think about such a silly thing? What is there to think about? I'm so happy you asked. Although I love my husband and even his last name, the fact of the matter is that it is not my name. Changing my name felt like giving up my identity. I did a lot of research on the topic. I listened to lots of people. I have heard it all -- you're not losing your identity, you're gaining a new part of yourself. If you don't change your name, you aren't honoring your husband. If I had a different name than my husband, how would people know we were married? Wouldn't that be confusing? But the most frequently asked question was, and still is to this day: how does your husband feel about it?\n\nThe scarlet F\n\nDuring this whole process, nobody asked how I felt about it. In our society, women change their names, and where I'm from, if you do not change your name, you wear a big, fat, ugly scarlet F on your chest for FEMINIST. When did feminist become a negative word though? Why is a woman supporting women linked to such dirty connotations? I swear the people in my life were one step away from dousing me with holy water to knock some divine sense into me.\n\nAfter discussing my concerns with my husband, I was not surprised to receive his support. Although I was not asking his permission to keep my name, it was important that he understood where I was coming from. Hyphenating my name was also not the right choice for me, as this was still changing my name and my identity.\n\nIf we change names to honor our spouse, then who is honoring the woman? If changing your name isn't a big deal and promotes your new identity, why don't men change their names?\n\nHistory behind the name change\n\nHistorically, women changed their names through marriage because women were viewed as property. So Mary X is her father's property until John Y comes along, and through the transfer of property, aka Mary, she becomes Mary Y. This male-dominated history of such a valued and beloved tradition did not sit well with me. I was not comfortable with a tradition that viewed me as property, ensured I did not have my own identity separate from my husband, and solidified a woman's submissive position in the marriage.\n\nLasting thoughts\n\nThere is no right solution for any woman; my only goal is to share the idea that changing your name after marriage should be a thoughtful decision.\n\nNo matter what your choice, always remember this. Keeping your last name does not make you an unfaithful wife. Keeping your last name does not mean you are a radical woman. Women: you have a CHOICE. You have a BRAIN. You have an IDENTITY. Women, you MATTER. (Men, you do too.)\n\nOh, and you're pretty. Did anyone tell you that lately?\n\nP.S.: Please be mindful when someone does keep her last name to honor her choice. Do not send her mail to Mrs. John Doe, for instance, just because you view her choice as wrong.
Balance is the Holy Grail of 21st century living.\n\nNobody sought balance back in the 1800s or even the 1950s. Back in the Old Days people sought to cultivate traits like virtue (huh?), patience, forgiveness, altruism, objectivity and a kind temperament.\n\nMen worked in the world. Women worked at home. Balance was an unspoken fact of life. Only accountants and tightrope walkers in the circus actually worried about it consciously.\n\nNowadays balance is a big deal. Why? Because we're so freakin' out of balance.\n\nWhole fields of scientific study have arisen from our imbalance. Food scientists weigh in on the proper balance of fruits, dairy, vegetables and proteins to consume on a daily basis. And a fat lot of good that's done us. We're more gi-normous than ever.\n\nSixty years ago kids walked to school, ran everywhere and played outdoors until dark. Adults did a lot of physical work. In 1950 only 10 percent of Americans were obese. Not anymore.\n\nSeventy years ago we ate nourishing whole foods, unprocessed grains and cereals, butter, whole eggs, meats, fish and poultry and there were no organic sections in the stores because everything already was organic.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nNow 80 percent of all calories consumed by Americans come from refined, processed, GMO-laden foods filled with sugar, salt, trans-fats and artificial ingredients.\n\nTo balance this out we go to the gym, which--considering that 70 percent of us over 20 are now officially overweight and/or obese--apparently doesn't balance the scales at all.\n\nWe worry about balancing work and home life--although I just looked up the average number of hours Americans work per week and, having done so, now have no idea what the hell everybody's complaining about. Apparently Americans work an average of 34.4 hours per week. Okay - add five hours a week commuting (including stops for a latte and scone) and we're almost at a 40-hour-work week. But who are these people? Where are they? I don't know anyone who works that little!\n\nFortunately, I'm self-employed and only work about 60 hours a week. And I do so from home. Which means I automatically have the Balance Work and Home Life thing solved no matter what.\n\nGender balance--now there's a biggie. Women STILL aren't being paid equal wages for equal work in the US, women STILL only account for 19.4 percent of legislators and a many-times bankrupt, many-times married, morally disheveled, ill-spoken, ill-prepared, boorish male with a ferocious ego and no public service experience whatsoever can STILL beat the most polite, erudite, qualified political candidate to ever step up to a podium if she happens to be a she.\n\nYes--balance is a BIG deal in our world because there's so damn little of it.\n\nBut as I was getting up from my meditation pillow this morning, feeling all glow-y and balanced and content, it suddenly occurred to me that perhaps the reason we're still struggling to establish balance on the outside is because we haven't found balance individually on the inside yet.\n\nLiving in physical bodies, this isn't surprising. Despite what mysticism and science tell us to the contrary, despite all that talk in church about the Holy Spirit and the soul, most of us fully believe we're physical beings dwelling in a physical world. So a belief that contentment and a certain degree of happiness can be achieved through the balance of our physical activities isn't illogical. It's just that it doesn't work.\n\nAnd the reason it doesn't work is because the physical world isn't reliable. Life is, by nature, mutable. Situations and people change. You can have a 401K, money in the bank, and a house in the burbs and still lose it all. You can sign a marriage contract in blood and still end up divorced. Accidents happen. People die. Pets run away. Children get sick. Hurricanes, floods, tornedoes and earthquakes level whole cities.\n\nThe most balanced, orderly, clock-work regime in the world can go tits up in a heartbeat. That's life.\n\nInner balance on the other hand, once actually established, is unshakable.\n\nIt's the once actually established part that puts most people off, I think. With our focus fixed on the world circus, absorbed by the trials of our own tumultuous lives, seeking outside solutions, we believe we don't have time for such pastimes as meditation. But if we genuinely knew it was a scientifically reliable answer to all the unhappiness and flailing around we do ... ?\n\nIf we genuinely knew that all the answers to all the questions in our hearts lay within us ... if we genuinely knew that peace would prevail on Earth once we located it within our own minds through meditation ... wouldn't we go for it?\n\nWouldn't we?\n\nAnd if not ... why not?\n\nThere's a one-word answer: EGO. But it'll take more than one blog to address that story.
A former Brigham Young University student who served as his school's mascot hopes his decision to come out publicly as gay in a newspaper essay inspires a deeper discussion of LGBTQ issues among Mormon churchgoers.\n\nIn an opinion essay published Tuesday by Utah's Deseret News, Charlie Bird said he felt immense pressure to hide his sexuality during his time performing as BYU's Cosmo the Cougar from 2015 through 2018.\n\nI was hyper-aware of what some of my peers said about the gay community, how they viewed same-sex attraction and the often unkind and insensitive words they used to describe LGBTQ people — people like me, Bird, whose dance moves as Cosmo won national acclaim and went viral online, wrote. The same community that made me feel like a superstar often simultaneously made me feel broken, unloved and defective.\n\nThere are many people like me who suffer in silence, struggling to reconcile complicated ideas with thoughts, feelings and religious beliefs, he continued. There are many who feel misunderstood and heartbroken. We never know who around us might be wearing a mask.\n\nBased in Provo, Utah, BYU is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). To attend, students must abide by an honor code that prohibits homosexual behavior. The Princeton Review ranks BYU as the second-most LGBTQ-unfriendly college in the U.S.\n\nThe LDS church opposes same-sex marriage, and though leaders maintain that same-sex attraction is not a sin, members are expected not to act on such feelings.\n\nBird, who moved to New York after graduating from BYU and now works for an international consulting firm, is hopeful his essay will encourage dialogue about LGBTQ issues among Mormons. In a Wednesday interview, he told The Salt Lake Tribune he'd received many, many, many messages of support from both families and other LGBTQ Mormons.\n\nI have somehow been blessed with an amazing platform where I can make my voice heard, he said. I wanted to make sure I used that platform to give a voice to people who don't have that same opportunity, and share a very real story of what many people are going through.\n\nIt feels even better knowing that I don't have to think of any more awkward excuses as to why 'a nice young chap like me hasn't found a wife and settled down,' he added.
Marriage therapist Jennifer Chappell Marsh hasn't been single in roughly 10 years. To put that in perspective, Tinder wouldn't be created for another two years. The online dating app landscape was considerably different back then, with sites like OkCupid and Match.com appealing to some daters, but certainly not the masses. (The You're online dating? But why, you're such a catch! sentiment was all too common.)\n\nToday, she knows, things are much different. In spite of being out of the game for a decade, Chappell Marsh is familiar with the struggles inherent in dating app use, thanks to her single clients. If you're in therapy and on a dating app, your therapist goes along for the ride, too.\n\nThe stress of online dating is a hot topic in therapy, she said. To help my clients, I've had to learn from them and do my own research to understand online dating norms and terminology. Now I'll regularly quiz my single friends and colleagues so I'm in the know about new apps and all the terms ― sliding into DMs, ghosting.\n\nBelow, Chappell Marsh and other therapists discuss the most common app-related annoyances they hear about from their clients.\n\nMaskot via Getty Images Many singles complain that being on a dating app feels like a part-time job.\n\n1. Being on dating apps feels like a part-time job\n\nTo cast a wide net, many singles have profiles on multiple dating apps, with multiple conversations going on with many people at any given time. Monitoring matches, swiping on profile after profile and sharing good banter with people of interest takes a lot of mental energy. Many singles say that running their dating lives feels almost like a part-time job, Bay Area psychologist Kelifern Pomeranz told HuffPost.\n\nSimilarly, clients sometimes express regret that they'll spend an entire evening messaging someone just to pass the time with no real intention of actually meeting up IRL, she said. Or, they find themselves engaged in a fun and flirty message exchange and then are confused when they are subsequently ghosted.\n\nThe solution to dating app burnout isn't necessarily to get off them entirely (though, of course, that's always an option): What Pomeranz advises instead is to restrict the amount of time spent on online dating apps. Maybe that means 20 minutes per day, maybe it means an hour you carve out every week.\n\nIf it still feels overwhelming, disappointing or time-consuming, take a more significant break, she said. Use that time to try new activities and interests: sign up for a dance class, join a hiking club, go to a Meetup where there's an opportunity to make connections offline.\n\n2. We started chatting and then there was radio silence\n\nBack in the day, romantic rejection from strangers was mostly restricted to the bar and other places where singles congregate. Today's singles have to deal with a one-two punch of rejection: They get rejected in person and on the apps, said Marie Land, a therapist in Washington, D.C.\n\nDating apps give a tremendous amount of opportunity for people to feel rejected before they even meet someone, she said.\n\nLand tells her clients to stay cautiously optimistic but not too invested in the people in their DMs.\n\nAlthough there are many real people on dating apps looking for what you are, that doesn't mean they are going to see you as a real person until you meet them face to face, she said. You have to remind yourself of that: If you're not even totally real, why feel rejected?\n\n3. I'm matching with the wrong type of person\n\nIt can be head-scratching to go on first date after first date but never seem to establish anything beyond that. In therapy, it leads people to wonder, Why do I keep attracting the wrong type of person? Is it me?\n\nOften, the problem lies in how clients are portraying themselves on dating apps, said Chappell Marsh. How you package yourself on dating apps matters: Are your responses to the questions on Hinge true to who you are? Are you coming off as someone who wants to have a good time when in actuality, you're looking for something more serious?\n\nGiving your profile a close read can be a game changer, Chappell Marsh said.\n\nIn many cases, I find that the client isn't accurately portraying themselves, she said. The most common example of this is a client who really wants to find love but gives off the message that they're treating dating casually. Other times, insecurity will show through a profile picture wearing sunglasses or a sarcastic tag line that's trying too hard.\n\nBeing authentic, the therapist said, is the key to matching with like-minded dates.\n\nFatCamera via Getty Images Too many first dates feel like interviews, singles report.\n\n4. First dates feel like interviews, and no one lives up to their profile (or my expectations)\n\nA common complaint among singles is that the experience of online dating feels fake ― and when a match does make it past the preliminary, messaging phase, the meetup is often a letdown, said Liz Higgins, a therapist and the founder of Millennial Life Counseling in Dallas.\n\nA lot of my clients say first dates often feel like an interview, she said. And for clients I talk to who seem to be in a mature stage of readiness to be in a long-term relationship, there's often feedback that they have to wade through a lot of 'crap' to land a person who seems worth conversing with or meeting.\n\nThough Higgins said she doesn't necessarily have a solution for this issue, she sometimes wishes her clients would adopt a two or three date minimum before ruling out a promising match completely.\n\nMany singles are looking for rom com-esque sparks right off the bat. After spending days or weeks texting, the thinking goes, why isn't the banter or connection the same in real life?\n\nThat's the expectation, Land said, but the reality is, a connection must be nurtured and developed, and you probably won't get a full scope or idea of a person's true character ― which is what you should be looking for in a person if you're serious about being in a committed relationship ― after one or two hours together.\n\nYes, you can get a sense of someone's personality, values and whether there's chemistry within an hour or so. But if you're on the fence about someone, a second date will give you a clearer idea of them since those initial nerves are more subdued.\n\n5. Online dating feels too superficial\n\nIn the Bay Area, Pomeranz says gay male clients complain about the online dating world being overly harsh, superficial, status-focused, and isolating, with a focus on quick hook-ups rather than deep connection.\n\nOnline dating as a gay male is particularly difficult for those men whose bodies do not look a specific way, she said. All of this can take a toll on an individual's well-being and self-esteem.\n\nPomeranz tells them ― or any other client who brings this issue up ― that who we are attracted to in the real world is often different from the idealized version that we seek online.\n\nSometimes, it pays to get off the apps and join local LGBT-friendly groups where you can meet others in person, she said.\n\n6. I'm totally out of decent matches\n\nLand says clients in Washington, D.C., often complain it seems like the dating pool is drying up. Land reminds them that in Washington ― as in most big cities ― there are always people moving in and logging onto the apps. In other words, don't sweat it too much.\n\nAnd depending on the app, you may be able to set your preferences to another location.

Struggling to figure out what's really bothering her?\n\nBelow, couples therapists share the most common issues wives say they're frustrated about in their marriages.\n\n1. She's tired from doing it all.\n\nYou lovingly call her superwoman but even superheroes have a breaking point. Far too many women with full-time careers and kids are married to spouses who fail to fully recognize how exhausting that balancing act can be, said Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California\n\nThe conflict and stressors from these competing roles are evident on a daily basis and it usually appears in a pair of arguments: Either a mother works hard and feels guilty for not spending more time with her children or she doesn't work and suffers the scrutiny of her peers for not doing enough. In either case, there is stress and plenty of it.\n\nIn other words, there's a 100 percent chance that your wife could use your sympathy and support ― even if it just means finishing off a bottle of wine and listening to her rant about her coworkers or the catty clique on the playground.\n\n2. She needs time to herself.\n\nMe time becomes non-existent once you have kids. That's why you both have to carve out time for yourselves. The kids will benefit from well-rested, emotionally and physically restored parents.\n\nMaking time to take care of ourselves is extremely important, said Talia Wagner, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California. Because there is so much on most modern women's plates, many chose to forgo this time, not realizing how essential it is to their well being and that of their family.\n\n3. You aren't doing your share of the childcare.\n\nWho does the lion share of childcare in your house? Who picks the kids up from soccer practice? Who makes sure A Wrinkle In Time is read and reported on by the deadline? If the answer is my wife, it's high time you stepped up, said Laurel Steinberg, a New York-based relationship therapist and adjunct professor of psychology at Columbia University\n\nConsider what you can do to help make her life easier, whether it's helping to coordinate carpools, bulk-cooking on Sunday evenings or proactively caring for her and the kids on the weekends, she said. Take an active interest in what they are learning in school. Anything helps.\n\n4. The thrill is gone.\n\nDon't think that just because you're married you can short shrift romance. If you've put date night on the back burner, your wife has no doubt noticed, Wagner said.\n\nWhen women remember the courting phase of their relationship and how different their S.O. was then, it usually brings about disappointment and longing, she said. Many feel like their mate has stopped investing in this very important part of their intimacy.\n\nThat's your cue to call a babysitter and tell your wife about the super exciting plans you arranged for Friday night.\n\n5. She wants you to practice work-life balance.\n\nYou both are concerned with your work-life balance ― but there's a high chance your wife wishes you'd put more thought into the life part of that equation, Howes said.\n\nThe men in my practice talk a lot about work, but their focus is typically on the deals, the strategy and the financial benefits ― not how it affects their relationships, he told us. The women tend to focus on the relational dynamics of their job and home life.\n\nTo put it simply, men need to understand that work choices aren't just about the outcome, it's about how it impacts relationships at home, Howes explained.\n\n6. She feels like a project manager.\n\nYour home is a well-oiled machine and chances are, it's due to your wife's efforts. It may look perfect from the outside, but take a closer look and you'll find a wife who's fed up with being the unofficial project manager of her home, Wagner said.\n\nThe wife is frequently the one handing out instructions regarding the many moving parts of their joint life together: She knows where to find missing clothing, remembers the bills due today, and that next Wednesday it is pajama day at school, Wagner explained. Essentially, she is managing and troubleshooting the internal workings of their lives. Unsurprisingly, many wives feel burdened by this massive responsibility and wish their husbands would take some responsibility.\n\n7. Communication is lacking.\n\nSorry, but what do you want for dinner? and did you pick up Avery from gymnastics? does not qualify as quality communication. Technology makes it easier to connect, but a few hastily sent texts throughout the day can't stand in for quality conversation at the end of the night, Howes said.\n\nWomen are generally more collaborative and verbal than men, and texts don't do a good enough job of allowing a woman to vent and feel heard while she problem solves, he said. Technology is good in a pinch, but it doesn't take the place (yet) of face to face conversation, especially with your spouse!
JGI/Tom Grill via Getty Images Aaron Lucero and Jeffrey Cannon say they were turned away from Texas's Venue at Waterston because the venue's owner doesn't approve of same-sex marriage.\n\nTexas couple Aaron Lucero and Jeffrey Cannon had just begun their wedding venue search when they got an unpleasant surprise: The owners of their first choice, The Venue at Waterstone, emailed to say they shouldn't bother visiting because a gay wedding would be against God's plan and design for marriage.\n\nWhile Texas law doesn't prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation, this refusal of service was still like a punch to the gut, as Lucero told Out last week. The couple had made their list by searching popular wedding planning site The Knot, and the Venue at Waterstone did not indicate the owners' LGBTQ ban in its listing. Lucero and Cannon, like other couples who have experienced similar rejections, say they'd like venues and wedding websites to do more to protect them.\n\nOur prayer is that God will one day open your hearts as well so that you will be able to welcome all of His children into your beautiful venue, Cannon wrote in a reply to Waterstone owner Lyle Wise, which Lucero shared in a tweet. It may not come until you have a loved one that is LGBT and is able to convince you that this is not a choice, as was the case with my family. Until that day comes however, we would petition you to please make your faith known to the public on your website and with theKnot.com so that other same sex couples do not have to go through the same rejection that we have gone through with you.\n\nThis was the eloquent response to them from my fiancé. pic.twitter.com/9CAVd2hkHs — Aaron Lucero (@locolucero) January 21, 2019\n\nWise shared his side of the story with the local NBC affiliate via a statement further explaining why he won't hold a gay wedding. We are a family of believers. We love all people because Christ first loved us; Jeffrey and Aaron included. We cannot violate the convictions God has placed within us. In love, we would never affirm anyone in something that was to their detriment.\n\nAs a result of Lucero and Cannon's experience, The Knot removed the venue's listing. Last year, after the Supreme Court issued its limited ruling in favor of the Masterpiece Cakeshop, Mike Steib, CEO of The Knot parent company the XO Group, took to social media to reiterate the company's anti-discrimination policy, writing: Our terms of service on The Knot prohibit vendors in our marketplace from discriminating against couples based on their race, religion, or sexual orientation. When we learn that a vendor has violated these terms of service, we will remove the vendor's storefront and refund his or her money. We love our couples, and all of our couples deserve a marketplace free of unfair prejudice.\n\nStill, as Out reports, many people planning their wedding have complained that the site only takes down these vendors after people report being discriminated against. Lucero and others would like the site to take a more proactive approach, which would set an example for the rest of the wedding industry.\n\nYes, they have these little badges for LGBTQ+ friendly vendors but you can't filter for that, Lucero told Out, also saying he cried all day after receiving the email from Wise and wound up canceling two other visits to venues who later disclosed their own anti-LGBTQ policies. So the onus is also on The Knot because they can do something to change the experience for gay couples.\n\nLGBTQ couples do have other options for their wedding search. Sites such as Love Inc., Rainbow Wedding Network and Pridezillas promise listings of vendors that support marriage equality. If couples want to go beyond those listings (something that might be necessary for people who live in smaller towns, for instance), Love Inc. founder Brittny Drye shared some tips on The Knot for sussing out whether a vendor is open to serving them. She recommended looking at photos of past client weddings, browsing their social media accounts for clues, and searching for gender-inclusive language on their site.\n\nRead their 'about me section' — are they speaking directly to brides who are marrying grooms, or is their language gender neutral? Drye wrote. If they have a form for you to fill out, does it give gender options or does one of you have to volunteer to be the bride?\n\nThose who haven't experienced discrimination like this might wonder what the big deal is and why couples can't just brush off these rejections and move on to another vendor. Jennifer Pizer, the law and policy director for Lambda Legal, explained to Yahoo Lifestyle last year how harmful and devastating it is to people to have a constant fear of being turned down.\n\nEverybody needs to know they can walk into a place of public business and be served, Pizer said. Nobody needs to worry about having the door slammed in their face just because of who they are, and have to go from place to place wondering where they might be served and where they might be treated like a pariah.
Nicolas Cage has found himself moonstruck again, revealing that he married his girlfriend, Riko Shibata, last month.\n\nIt's true, and we are very happy, the 57-year-old actor said in a statement to People magazine.\n\nThe pair got hitched at a small and intimate wedding at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Feb. 16, a day chosen to honor the birthday of Cage's late father. The couple exchanged both Shinto and Catholic vows and the ceremony included haiku poems as well as the poetry of Walt Whitman.\n\nCage and Shibata, 26, met in Shiga, Japan, more than a year ago, according to Vanity Fair. They were photographed in February 2020 ― with Shibata at the time identified only as a mystery woman ― paying a visit to the pyramid-shaped mausoleum Cage constructed in New Orleans to eventually entomb his dead body.\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Nicolas Cage in 2018.\n\nCage had announced the couple's engagement in August while appearing on his brother Marc The Cope Coppola's radio show, USA Today reported.\n\nShe left New York and went back to Kyoto, Japan, and I went back to Nevada and I haven't seen her for six months, said Cage, who lives in Las Vegas. We're really happy together and we're really excited to spend that time together so I finally just said, 'Look, I wanna marry you,' and we got engaged on FaceTime.\n\nThe proposal included a black diamond engagement ring that Cage sent via FedEx.\n\nThis is the fifth time the Wild at Heart actor has been married. He was previously wedded to Patricia Arquette, Lisa Marie Presley, Alice Kim and Erica Koike. His most recent marriage, to Koike, wasn't quite gone in 60 seconds, but it did last for only four days before Cage filed for an annulment. He said was too drunk to understand what was happening when the wedding occurred.\n\nCage and Kim, who were married from 2004 to 2016, remain friends, and she attended his wedding to Shibata. Cage and Kim's son, 15-year-old Kal-El ― named after Superman's birth name ― also attended.
It was 2005 and I first spotted all five foot nothing of one of the world's most famous faces during the break of this behemoth recovery meeting held in a synagogue just off of Sunset Boulevard. It was Carrie Fisher and she was wearing a black cocktail dress, her hair a bright fuchsia color as she ran, barefoot, like a Haight Ashbury hippie, to the courtyard.\n\nI ran after her and tapped her on the shoulder. I hope you don't think I'm a stalker, I said. I just want to introduce myself and tell you that I worship the ground you walk on. As those stalkerish sentences came out of my mouth, I had second thoughts about approaching this writer/actress/icon. Why would a woman who was best known for playing a role in a series of blockbuster movies in which she who wore a bikini of a golden variety want anything to do with me?\n\nAt this point I smelled--like body odor, cigarettes and mildew. I'd been living in my car in the two weeks that had passed since I'd left the all-female Prop 36 rehab I'd been in for three months.\n\nI had once smelled like Chanel Number 19. I had lived in a lovely two-story townhouse in Pasadena with a Zen garden. I was highly educated and had worked for one of the richest men in the world. In other words, while everything looked great from the outside, on the inside I was dying of alcoholism. I was married to a guy I'd met when we'd both worked at a Hollywood studio--a guy who'd courted me, had sporadic and lousy sex with me for three years and then married me, at which point we had no sex at all. Yes, I went through two different presidents without my husband probing my Department of the Interior.\n\n\n\nMy best thinking back then was that everything would be fine if I could just fix my marriage and get pregnant. Of course, it would have required an Immaculate Conception to knock me up and if I somehow had managed to get pregnant, I would surely have only given birth to a giant Xanax.\n\nI tried to quit drugs cold turkey and found myself driving down a one-way street the wrong way, after which I checked myself into rehab. After being fired from my high-powered job for my previous work ethic (turns out that it's frowned upon to throw work into a drawer and take naps at your desk), my husband had kicked me out. The car it was.\n\nThe combination of detoxing, talking to Carrie and the crisp spring air caused me to break out in a cold sweat and for my hands to shake. But Carrie just put her small and soft hand onto my shaking ones before slipping a cigarette in my mouth and lighting it. She touched my black sweatshirt like a caring mother. I wanted her to be my mother. I wanted her to save me...and she did.\n\nMy story--about being fired by the billionaire, about my husband denying me access to our joint account, about sleeping in my car--tumbled out of my mouth. I was hoping to elicit some empathy, which would make her like me and I was desperate for her--or anyone else's--approval (a character defect I still struggle with).\n\nWhy aren't your parents helping you? Carrie asked point blank. It was a good question.\n\nI think I'm not exactly the daughter they wanted, I told her while I prying my greasy ponytail off the back of my sweaty neck.\n\nThen she announced that she knew my ex-boss and invited me, without hesitation, to come live with her. I had the feeling it was a political move on her part--a way to get back at my ex-boss--but wasn't exactly in a position to say no.\n\nThe next day, I pulled the Camry that had been my home onto her private dirt road. On a hill sat a sprawling ranch house with an expansive deck holding rocking chairs and swings. As I drove further up the driveway, I noticed a massive crystal chandelier hanging from the oak tree in the front yard. Where the dirt road wound left, there was a side house and garage. I pulled my car in front of a parking meter and a green-and-white road sign that said Dildo. It was quirky to say the least and I loved it.\n\nI got out of my car and retrieved the three black Glad trash bags full of clothing that was all I had left in my life. Dragging the plastic bags out of the car, I proceeded up the windy rocky path to the side house.\n\n\n\nWhen I opened door of the side house, my eyes were immediately drawn to a picture of a Japanese woman with long wavy hair and a very wide face that was hung above a set of black-and-red drawer chests. To the left was a huge flat screen TV. You could say that the room had a bit of an Asian motif, as the rest of the wall space was decorated with Asian movie posters of the Carrie in her blockbuster Star Wars role.\n\nThe Japanese woman in the picture was the famous mother of the guy who had occupied this room before I came along--and who would continue to occupy it when he wasn't on tour or out of the country during the months I was there, when I would move to the house. His father had been in the Beatles and, if you must know the truth, yes, I did use his soap on my nether regions just to have some Beatles DNA on me.\n\nThe first night that I was there, I went up to the Carrie's room in the main house and we got into bed together, watched old movies, ate ice cream and chain-smoked cigarettes. We did that most of the nights. I felt a real soul connection with Carrie, we both commented on it. We would literally finish each other's sentences. We talked about our gay ex-husbands, our mothers (who were scarily similar), our fears, sex and writing. We had a true kinship and bond, which helped me tremendously with my sobriety. I didn't feel so painfully alone anymore--in fact, I felt like I was truly a part of life, the close friend of Carrie Fisher, a far cry from the anesthetized mess I'd been before.\n\nCarrie was incredibly generous and always taking in stray dogs like myself; the only problem with this is that if one of those stray dogs happened to be another celebrity, I would be bounced from the side house to the pool house to her bed to a walk in closet.\n\nAs Carrie got busier with work, we spent less and less time together, at which point the inherent problems in the relationship--the fact that when we were out in public together, fans and entertainment industry people would literally push me aside or flat out stand in front of me to get to her--were exacerbated. I had worked for celebrities before and was used to being shoved out of the way but this was different. I wasn't working for her. I was her friend.\n\n\n\nAll those feelings I'd had growing up feeling neglected and insignificant came back to me in spades. I was in the midst of doing step work I noticed glaring example after glaring example of me hiding behind powerful bosses, celebrities and men. I had been eclipsing myself by bright lights for a long time. I came to the realization that the only illumination I needed or wanted was God's and with His help, I could shine brilliantly on my own.\n\nI had been looking for work the months while living with Carrie but not until I came to this realization did I find a job. It didn't pay much but it allowed me to move into my own place. And slowly, little by little, I've been able to build a life back up. I would love to say that Carrie and I remained as close. We didn't. Still, I will be forever grateful to her for everything she has done for me. She truly was my guardian angel--one who eventually taught me that I didn't need live in the shadows any longer.\n\nMy current philosophy on life if that it's one great dinner party and that I can sit at the big fancy table on my own. And if I have any message to give those in early recovery who feel less than, it's this: you're not. Take your rightful place at your dinner party. And may the force (or your Higher Power) be with you.
My husband Wayo and I clicked the instant we met. You know that magical moment when eyes lock and everyone else blurs into the background? That was us ― a fairytale romance. Well, kinda. Let's just say there were a few kinks, starting with he was on a date with someone else that fateful night we met. And, though we ended up getting married in 2017, we still haven't moved in together. Let me explain.\n\nI was coming out of a messy divorce when I first encountered Wayo at a charity event. Though we hit it off instantly, I found it strange he kept interrupting me to announce he was on a date. Fearing the wine caused him to confuse my cordial friendliness for flirting, I stepped away to talk to another group of people and he followed. Again, he announced he was on a date and, since I still hadn't seen this woman, I commented that it's trendy to date ghosts in October. It was dumb, but I didn't care. It was not long before I caught myself smiling while talking to him ― laughing even. In fact, at one point I laughed so hard I accidentally spilled wine all over my shoes and, out of thin air, two beautiful women appeared to wipe up my mess ― that's how I met Wayo's date.\n\nShe was glamorous while I was just a middle-aged klutz who had no interest in playing games. Wayo invited me to join them for dinner and I, of course, declined. The more I resisted, the harder he pursued. It wasn't until my single 70-something-year-old friend with a ranch full of cats pointed out I was going to end up just like her if I didn't give this handsome fella a chance. The crazy cat lady was right. So I told Wayo I had no interest in playboys. That's when he informed me he had dropped his playthings the night after we met to exclusively be with me. In his words, he had waited his an entire life to fall in love.\n\nWayo was unlike anyone I had ever met before. Every word he uttered seemed to be kind, open and true. I had come from a cobwebbed world of sticky manipulations and here was someone who made being together easy. No ulterior motives. No schemes. He was just refreshingly honest. Everything fell into place in such a perfect way, a part of me braced for it all to sour as affairs of the heart so often do ― at least for me, anyway.\n\nTurned out I was right to be concerned. It wasn't long before our whirlwind romance twisted into a tornado. On the morning of our first Valentine's Day together, we discovered a very stinky surprise. My ex had not only broken into Wayo's car and stolen everything in it, but had also packed it full of raw shrimp. That's right ― raw shrimp.\n\nIt was indefensible. And most important, I felt it was my fault for having such an ex. Left with no other choice, I gave Wayo an out by letting him know I did not blame him if he decided to run for the hills. Crazy exes are justifiable deal killers. But that following year on Valentine's Day, Wayo proposed to me in Costa Rica. The year after that, after I bungee jumped off Victoria Falls, we tied the knot in Africa. But, unlike most married couples, we never moved in together. Not yet, anyway.\n\nCourtesy of Susanna Maddrigal The author and Wayo at Victoria Falls on their wedding day in 2017.\n\nIs it weird? Sure, if by weird you mean not mainstream. Most people meet, get married and then move in, though not always in that order. And if we're being honest, there was a time when not following that exact succession was considered scandalous. We never set out to break any molds or rewrite societal norms, we just chose to create our own life's journey with each other instead of following any particular script.\n\nOf course, you're probably wondering how this all works since my husband lives a solid four-hour drive north from where I reside. Right now we are both where we need to be to thrive in our careers. We have never actually had a conversation on the nuts and bolts of how our relationship would work, we've just been winging it. And so far, we're still flying together through blue skies, storm fronts and everything in between.\n\nWhat started out as a temporary inconvenience has now turned into our way of life. Wayo's job is far more flexible than mine, so he's the one who commutes the most, but even still, we never actually cemented any rules outlining when and where we spend our time. Though we talk on the phone several times a day, we typically only spend about two weeks out of the month sleeping in the same bed.\n\nMost, if not everyone, finds our situation questionable. We get it. Truth be told, many of our friends didn't think our unconventional union would survive more than six months, yet, here we still are ― together, just not together all the time. It's really not that different from couples whose jobs split them apart. And that got me to thinking, shouldn't marriage be defined by those who entered into it? The terms should be set by us, not tradition.\n\nLet's face it, marriages are as unique as the people in them. For example, there are those who've lived together for over 30 years yet never married. Does that make their union any less legitimate or loving? I know of a couple who divorced only to reunite after they married and divorced other people. In their case, they didn't realize how perfect they were for each other until they recognized that different isn't always better. So why not redefine marriage in a way so genuine, it's perfectly customized for our imperfect lives?\n\nCourtesy of Sylvia Guerra Fortuin The author and Wayo taking a cooking class in 2017.\n\nRegardless of how a coupling is defined or logistically plotted out, a partnership can only work when there's unshakable trust and open communication. That may be easier said than done, but it gets easier with practice ― lots and lots of practice.\n\nLiving four hours apart would never be possible if either Wayo or I had pretended to be OK with it when one of us was truly not OK. Thankfully, we were both brutally honest with our expectations, wants and needs from the very beginning. It's also crucial that neither of us is jealous or has trust issues. I think the fact we were both in our 40s when we met allowed us to explore, know ourselves and understand what we want more than perhaps if we'd met when we were younger.\n\nWayo and I are fiercely independent and perfectly comfortable taking separate excursions with our friends. I have taken off to Australia, Fiji and New Zealand without him and he'll periodically go out of town without me. Most find this unacceptable, but for us it's perfect to be with someone who understands the need for friendship and space. We've been warned that this behavior will open us up to being cheated on, but the fact is cheaters are going to cheat no matter what the conditions. We are both of the mindset that we have no control over one another. For us, getting married meant being monogamous so if one should stray, we both understand that action will bring an end to our union. I don't want to be with someone who isn't willingly committed to me, and my husband feels the same way. Knowing this allows us the freedom to enjoy each other fully as best friends should. Marriage is hard enough without the added pressure of making it one size fits all.\n\nSharing space and time with another human being is agreeing to share head space, mood swings, dramas, quirks, families, pets, jobs, hygiene and so much more. Wayo's pantries and refrigerator are pure chaos whereas anyone who's opened a kitchen cabinet in my house might consider my obsession with organization to be the work of a psychopath. On the seldom occasion that Wayo and I do happen to argue, he'll purposely move things around in my fridge just to drive me crazy. I've warned him this tactic could put his well-being in danger. Living separately means I know things will be exactly as I left them when I return home at the end of the day and I love that. Wayo does try to adjust to my way of doing things by washing a dish immediately after he's finished with it, but I can see it's uncomfortable for him; and I, too, try to be less stringent by pretending to ignore the collection of glasses he leaves on his nightstand, but it's not easy (and if I'm being honest, I start tidying up the moment he falls asleep).\n\nEven though we're like aliens from different planets, we've sworn to love each other forever and that love exists despite our differences, and, I believe, is even stronger because we choose to accept each other exactly as we are. Sure, I'm sometimes wishing for a magic wand to bippity-boppity-boop him into my idea of tidy perfection and, yes, he's disappointed there's no remote to make me more laid-back, but none of that stuff matters. We have each other, we have lives we love and we have found a way to share all of it without driving each other crazy or compromising who we are.\n\nCourtesy of Kristin Maria The author and Wayo in Reykjavik, Iceland, where the couple renewed their vows in 2018.\n\nSeeing how different we are from other married couples can be intimidating, and I admit sometimes I wonder if our partnership is good enough. I worry about this most often after some dumb fight we've had that usually leads to questioning all my life's decisions but I've learned that comparing our marriage to others and trying to live up to other people's standards does not work.\n\nWhen we got married, we had seemingly perfect couples tell us we were doomed because we were doing it wrong. I even had a close friend tell me my marriage wasn't a marriage at all because it didn't fit into his narrow view of what one should be like. Never mind he's been married four times; he acted as if our choice somehow personally insulted him. Ironically, many of these couples are no longer together. Many of them have dealt with strings of affairs while others live in perpetual misery by continuing to lie to each other, the world and themselves. That's not to say that traditional relationships can't or don't work. Of course they do! But we know what works for us and, though Wayo and I sometimes fight and we have tough times ― just like any two or more humans trying to make a relationship work do ― but we're still happily creating our ever-after four years later.\n\nAt the end of the day, we keep choosing each other whether we're chatting over our morning coffee in the same room or over the phone. A true happily ever-after is never perfect or always happy. But it is lasting. And it lasts because it inspires us both to be better by being honest, understanding and caring enough to care enough. No two relationships are alike, and for Wayo and me, what we have now not only works, it allows us to be ourselves and support each other without the pressure to try and be or live in a way that just isn't us. We simply embrace what is.\n\nWill we one day move in together? Maybe. When it feels right. But for now, we're too busy living our lives and loving each other just the way we are. It's not always easy, and it isn't like the marriages of any of the other couples we know, but it doesn't have to be. It's who we are ― together, apart, and everything in between ― and we love it and each other. And that's what really matters, right?\n\nSusanna Maddrigal, author of A Cat's Tale, former advice columnist for Ask Susa and founder of MADD Media, writes about how she and and her husband have been together since 2014 and, though they have yet to move in together, it seems to be working great for them.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost?

Vic DiBitetto, known as The Italian Hurricane, is wonderfully outspoken in a humorous manner. He may be loud and hysterical on stage but in the green room the polite DiBitetto offered me food and drink as if entertaining me as a guest in his home. His wife, the lovely Lucy was there as well. One can tell that after many years of marriage the two still relish each other as he told me she's my rock. The comedian honored me with a gracious interview before his two sold out shows at Governor's Comedy Club in Long Island.\n\nVic DiBitetto is Truly Genuine\n\n\n\nPhoto by Carol Ruth Weber\n\nIt was a wonderful experience speaking DiBitetto, a man who knows how to make people laugh. Upon entering the venue to see the wonderful funny man perform I spoke with the club manager. I handed her my business card to give to DiBitetto asking him to have his agent get in touch with me so that I may interview him. As I sat down in anticipation for the show, she came running back stating, Quick come with me. We rushed off to the green room at Vic's request so that I may talk to him before the show.\n\nThe short interview began with us talking about life as I asked him one simple question.\n\n\n\nCarol Ruth Weber:How did you get started?\n\nVic Dibitetto: I was always the class clown. Being a Brooklyn boy, my friends urged me to perform at Pips Comedy Club in Sheepshead Bay on an amateur night. I got booed off stage but was hooked. I had been breaking my butt for 33 years when it finally paid off between being in Mall Cop 2 and getting a manager who has been a godsend. I was able to quit my day job. I actually attracted Kevin James to offer me a part in the movie Mall Cop: Blart 2. I played Gino, another mall cop.\n\nNot a bragger by any means, the humble DiBitetto, as if still amazed at his rise in fame, proudly announced to me I sold out both shows tonight and last night [at the Brokerage also in Long Island] and came close to selling out Westbury Music Fair Memorial Day weekend. After taking a couple of photos and allowing me to film him sending my daughter a little hello, in his own fashion, I left him to do his show.\n\nA True Entertainer\n\nVic certainly knows how to entertain, giving his audience tons to laugh at and enjoy. The show was everything expected from such a talent. DiBitetto is wonderfully funny and fresh, never holding back but also does not attack anyone but his own outlook on his life and life around him. On stage DiBitetto proudly states that he and Lucy have known each other for 40 years before going off with his commentary about living as a husband and father. It is obvious how so relatable Vic is to all as the audience burst with laughter and applause.\n\nDiBitetto's bio states He has been called a cross between Rodney Dangerfield and Ralph Kramden but he is certainly his own man when performing and should not be compared to anyone else. That is the beauty of who he is and his comedy, that it is from a fresh perspective, a natural perspective. DiBitetto allows his audience inside his home to see the humor in his everyday life as well as his commentary on life around all of us.\n\nHysterical for every adult age, the wonderful Vic DiBitetto's timing is never off. The Mr. Rogers type bit with, These are the people in the neighborhood, was naturally thrown in at just the right moment to get the audience roaring. What makes DiBitetto's comedy so wonderful is that he is so relatable. The fun never stops with Vic as he seamlessly goes from one routine to another effortlessly. I say what you are thinking, he explains doing his comedy during his act. The statement could not be truer and is certainly why he is so loved. Perhaps the funny man's most perfect commentary on life is his tag line, It is what it is.\n\nIf one has not seen any of DiBitetto's videos, they are all a must see. Beware they do have some crass language but definitely appropriate as a part of his amazing talented act. What makes DiBitetto so funny is that his comedy seems effortless. He speaks from the heart and states, in his comedic way, what most are feeling.
The inauguration of President Joe Biden was a day marked by messages of unity, truth, respect for others and hope for the future. For many, the occasion also offered the opportunity to exhale and enjoy some beautiful fashion without a sense of impending doom about the state of democracy.\n\nThankfully, sitting at home in our sweatpants for nearly a year has not diminished our collective appreciation for great style. From the fabulous coats to the trendy shoes, many inauguration looks were all over social media on Wednesday.\n\nWe've put together a rundown of the fashion highlights from Inauguration Day.\n\nAmanda Gorman's Bright Look\n\nViewers were awestruck watching the 22-year-old poet deliver her stunning poem, The Hill We Climb. Naturally, she sported a symbolism-filled outfit to match.\n\nGorman radiated in a yellow coat and red headband, both by Prada (she admires head designer Miuccia Prada her outspoken feminist beliefs and intellect). Gorman told Vogue the choice of yellow was a nod to first lady Jill Biden, who recommended her for the inauguration role.\n\nShe said, 'I saw this video of you and you were wearing yellow and I loved it,' Gorman recalled.\n\nOprah Winfrey provided accessories, including a pair of earrings and a ring with special meaning.\n\nWhile reciting my poem, I wore a ring with a caged bird—a gift from @Oprah for the occasion, to symbolize Maya Angelou, a previous inaugural poet, Gorman tweeted. Here's to the women who have climbed my hills before.\n\nPool via Getty Images Amanda Gorman recites her poem, The Hill We Climb, in a Prada coat and headband during Wednesday's inauguration ceremony.\n\nThe Air Jordans On Meena Harris' Husband Nikolas Ajagu\n\nKamala Harris' niece Meena and her family frequently accompany the new vice president at public events. For Inauguration Day, Meena's husband Nikolas Ajagu generated a lot of buzz for his choice of footwear ― a pair of Air Jordan 1s from the brand's collaboration with designer Dior.\n\nShoe fanatics quickly identified the kicks as the Air Jordan 1 Retro High Dior, and Meena confirmed it on Twitter with a simple Yes smh. She later followed up with more background on the shoe pick.\n\nWhen Nik was packing for D.C. he actually asked me whether he should bring Jordans or stick to dress shoes, she tweeted. I didn't know which Js he was considering, and apparently I was in a jolly mood so I said 'Do what makes you happy.' He never followed up either way. Anyway what a great day.\n\nNotably, Biden's granddaughter Maisy opted for similar footwear ― Air Jordan 1 Mid Sisterhoods.\n\nPATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images Vice President Kamala Harris walks with her family, including her niece's husband Nikolas Ajagu, during Wednesday's brief inaugural parade.\n\nMark Makela via Getty Images Harris hugs her great-niece Amara before walking the parade route with her family. Ajagu's shoes are visible on the left.\n\nArtsy Flair From Ella Emhoff\n\nAjagu wasn't the only Harris family member to make waves with style watchers. The vice president's stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, was another fan favorite, thanks to her Miu Miu coat with embellished shoulders and a large embroidered white collar.\n\nThe 21-year-old daughter of second gentleman Doug Emhoff wore a Batsheva dress underneath and topped the look with a black mask and a Loeffler Randall headband to hold back her center-parted curls. One Twitter user referred to Emhoff as the first daughter of Bushwick ― a Brooklyn neighborhood and a fitting label for the artist and design student who attends Parsons School of Design in New York City.\n\nRob Carr via Getty Images Ella Emhoff stands next to her brother, Cole, during the inauguration ceremony. Their father, Doug Emhoff, is to the left.\n\nLady Gaga's Hunger Games-esque Outfit\n\nTo perform the national anthem, statement outfit queen Lady Gaga wore a custom Schiaparelli haute couture ensemble designed by Daniel Roseberry. The look included a voluminous red silk faille skirt and fitted navy jacket with a gilded brooch.\n\nThe pop star topped the getup with a crown braid woven with a black ribbon.\n\nPool via Getty Images Lady Gaga picks up her skirt after singing the national anthem during the inauguration.\n\nMichelle Obama's Everything\n\nThe former first lady and eternal fashion icon did not disappoint with her inauguration outfit.\n\nBlack American designer Sergio Hudson was behind the plum-colored ensemble, which included a turtleneck, coat, wide-legged trousers and a striking gold buckle to cinch the waist. Washington-based hairstylist Yene Damtew finished the look with perfectly bouncy curls. As many Twitter users summed up, we're still not over it.\n\nJONATHAN ERNST via Getty Images Barack and Michelle Obama arrive at the inauguration ceremony.\n\nJ. Lo's Hair\n\nJennifer Lopez took the stage during Wednesday's ceremony to perform This Land Is Your Land and America the Beautiful in an all-white outfit by Chanel and major bling. But the buzziest part of the look was the pop icon's voluminous ponytail.\n\nHairstylist Christ Appleton detailed how he created J. Lo's shiny, luscious look ― with her hair perfectly slicked back into billowing waves.\n\nThe vibe was inspired by '90s supermodel, classic and timeless, he told Vogue. I call it the 'J-Lo Barbie' look, sleek at the front and glam at the back.\n\nPool via Getty Images Jennifer Lopez performs a medley of This Land Is Your Land and America the Beautiful (with a quick nod to her song, Let's Get Loud).\n\nKamala Harris In Purple\n\nThe new vice president chose to wear Black designers on Inauguration Day, notably sporting a purple dress and coat outfit by Christopher John Rogers, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Harris accessorized with a flag pin and her signature pearl necklace ― a nod to her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\nThe choice of purple may have been a tribute to the late Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.), the first Black woman to run for president. As a mix of red and blue, purple can also symbolize unity, which former first lady Hillary Clinton opted for with her purple outfit. I want to just send a bit of a symbolic message that we need to come together, the former secretary of state said.\n\nANDREW HARNIK via Getty Images Harris and Emhoff are pictured as she is sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nAshley Biden's Tux\n\nFirst daughter Ashley Biden wore a navy coat during the day, but it was her nighttime outfit that really turned heads. For the Celebrating America TV broadcast ushering in the new administration, she changed into a stylish black tux with black heels and a sleek ponytail.\n\nListen, Ashley Biden, I'm gonna need to borrow that tux... at least one person tweeted.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images First daughter Ashley Biden and her family look on during the Celebrating America program at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nThe Most On-Brand Bernie Sanders\n\nBernie Sanders was peak Bernie Sanders on Inauguration Day in the same Burton jacket he wore in his viral I Am Once Again Asking campaign video. Naturally, the image of the Vermont senator sitting cross-legged ― and socially distanced ― in Washington's cold became the meme of the day (as did speculation about what was inside the mysterious envelope he brought to the festivities).\n\nSanders paired his taupe parka with a standard blue surgical mask and eye-catching mittens ― a gift from Vermont teacher Jen Ellis, who made them from repurposed wool sweaters and recycled plastic bottles.\n\nIn Vermont, we know something about the cold, and we're not so concerned about good fashion, Sanders told CBS' Gayle King on Wednesday when asked about his attire. We want to keep warm. And that's what I did.\n\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sits in the bleachers on Capitol Hill before Wednesday's ceremony.\n\nJill Biden's Day And Night Looks\n\nFor her Inauguration Day look, the new first lady wore a beautiful blue tweed coat with velvet cuffs, an embellished dress and matching face mask. Her outfit was the creation of young American designer Alexandra O'Neill, founder of the brand Markarian.\n\nThe color blue was chosen for the pieces to signify trust, confidence, and stability, Markarian said in a statement. The look was carefully crafted by a small team in the heart of New York City's Garment Center and hand-finished by O'Neill in her West Village studio.\n\nFor her evening look, Biden wore a white dress, coat and gloves by Uruguay-born, New York-based designer Gabriela Hearst.\n\nPATRICK SEMANSKY via Getty Images Jill and Joe Biden arrive at the inauguration.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images The couple watches the night's fireworks show on the National Mall from the Truman Balcony at the White House.\n\nBaby Cuteness From Baby Biden\n\nJoe Biden's youngest grandchild, Beau, brought the cuteness to the inaugural celebration. Born in late March, Beau is the son of Hunter Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen, and is named for the president's other son who died in 2015.\n\nThe little guy wore a festive plaid jacket and held a silver rattle. Twitter users went wild over his precious baby bonnet, which appears to be from Feltman Brothers. At night, baby Beau showed off an adorable little vest.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Hunter Biden holds his son, Beau, at the inauguration.\n\nThe Biden Granddaughters In Monochrome\n\nMonochrome was definitely the look for inauguration day, and Biden's granddaughters Naomi, Natalie, Finnegan, and Maisy were prime examples.\n\nThe oldest, 27-year-old Naomi, wore white, 22-year-old Finnegan opted for camel, and Maisy, 20, went with black (the three are Hunter's children from his first marriage). Their 16-year-old cousin Natalie (Beau's daughter) popped in a pink coat by Lafayette 148 New York, plus coordinating scarf and gloves.\n\nAll of the girls topped their looks with perfectly paired face masks.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images Naomi (left) and Finnegan Biden arrive at the inauguration. Cousin Natalie Biden walks in front of them.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nThe pop star wore a dramatic white outfit from Thom Browne as she sang her hit song Firework in front of the Lincoln Memorial as part of Wednesday night's inauguration concert.\n\nPerry's outfit featured a floor-length skirt, corset and cashmere coat with regal cape vibes. Satin-covered blue and red buttons accented the sleeves and skirt for a patriotic flair.
Best in Show: Promising Young Woman\n\nFocus Features\n\nIf a more electric movie opens in the first half of 2020, it will be a miracle. The bracing, audacious Promising Young Woman is the sort of thing Hollywood should be making all the time, a scorched-earth treatise with massive entertainment value that twists and turns from one shock to the next. Even more astounding, it's a directorial debut. Emerald Fennell served as the showrunner on Season 2 of Killing Eve and has acted in Call the Midwife and The Crown, but this film plays like the work of someone with half a dozen features under her belt. Leaving the theater, I felt giddy.\n\n\n\nThe subject matter sounds tough, and at times it is. The promising young woman in question is Cassie Thomas (Carey Mulligan), a fashionable 29-year-old café server still living with her parents (Jennifer Coolidge and Clancy Brown). For complex reasons, Cassie has turned an elaborate rape-revenge scheme into her cherished pastime. Pretending to be sloshed, she lets sleazy guys take her home, knowing they will violate the boundaries of consent. Before they can go too far, she unclothes her sobriety and launches mind games that expose them for the degenerates they are. But that's only the beginning of Cassie's story. What follows is best left unspoiled. In drips and drops, Fennell reveals Cassie's history and expands her world, including a charming new love interest (Bo Burnham) who tests her aversion to romance.\n\n\n\nGiven that synopsis, you might be surprised to hear that Promising Young Woman is as hilarious as it is furious. Cassie sports a pastel manicure that matches the film's poppy color scheme, both offering a telling wink at the audience: Nothing is as it seems. The longer Woman lasts, the more it subverts where you think it's headed.\n\n\n\nFennell, who also wrote the script, isn't satisfied with concrete notions of heroism and villainy. Some of her bolder choices will be polarizing, but that's what makes this film a treat. It's unpredictable and cleverly cast (look out for a parade of crush-worthy actors like Adam Brody, Max Greenfield and Sam Richardson), with a soundtrack that peaks with Paris Hilton's Stars Are Blind and a piercing instrumental cover of Britney Spears' Toxic. I can't wait to see it again, and again, and again.\n\n\n\nPromising Young Woman opens in theaters April 17.
Khloe Kardashian can't catch a break.\n\nThe pregnant reality TV has always had her critics ― she is a Kardashian after all ― but ever since announcing that she's expecting her first child with NBA player Tristan Thompson, the internet has been unrelenting.\n\nThe Good American designer and sisters Kim and Kourtney are currently traveling in Japan for a girls trip before she's set to deliver sometime in March. The mom-to-be has been posting photos from the trip of herself cradling her baby bump, which for some reason ignited a backlash.\n\nPeople are very opinionated about my bump, she wrote on Twitter. I choose to cradle my bump because it's mine. I've waited for this very short moment for years. I have only months to enjoy this phase in my life, so I will touch my bump and love my bump as often as I choose.\n\nPeople are very opinionated about my bump.

I have only months to enjoy this phase in my life, so I will touch my bump and love my bump as often as I choose. Mommy loves you baby! ❤️ — Khloé (@khloekardashian) February 28, 2018\n\nSome also took issue with Kardashian traveling in the first place, especially to such a far-away locale, considering she's planning on giving birth in Cleveland, Ohio, where Thompson is based most of the year.\n\nShe went onto assure her followers that she took every precaution, writing, I'm allowed to travel according to my dr. Of course before our flight I took all the precautions and got my body checked from my dr and I'm completely healthy.\n\nI wouldn't put my baby at risk any way, she added.\n\nI'm allowed to travel according to my dr.

But otherwise, the American Pregnancy Association says it is generally safe to travel throughout a pregnancy.\n\nKardashian has long struggled to get pregnant as Kim, Kourtney and now sister Kylie have welcomed new additions to the KarJenner family.\n\nThe family's reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians documented her troubles conceiving with ex-husband Lamar Odom. After undergoing fertility treatments, Kardashian seemingly gave up at a certain point, saying she was fake trying to get pregnant as her marriage began to crumble.\n\nA post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Feb 28, 2018 at 2:06pm PST\n\nA post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Feb 21, 2018 at 8:38am PST\n\nA post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Feb 4, 2018 at 3:20pm PST\n\nSo after all that hardship and heartbreak, if Khloe wants to soak up every last moment of her pregnancy, even while traveling in her third trimester, why don't we just let her.
GeorgePeters via Getty Images Therapists offer tips on how to manage the strong emotions that bubble up when you see people disregard public health guidance.\n\nIt's been one year since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Explore HuffPost's Bent Not Broken project to learn how the coronavirus has disrupted our mental health, and how to manage our well-being moving forward.\n\nWhen you haven't seen your family, hung out with friends or gone on vacation in the name of pandemic safety, watching other people do the things you so desperately miss can be maddening. You might say it makes you pangry, a made-up word for pandemic angry that describes what many of us are feeling right now.\n\nCOVID-19 has now killed more than 400,000 Americans and sickened millions more, while putting tremendous strain on our health care workers. Yet many families continue to gather indoors for maskless get-togethers. Celebrities and influencers are still taking group trips to far-away destinations.\n\nIf seeing other people defy public health recommendations while you've been sitting at home makes your blood boil, first know that your strong feelings are justified and normal.\n\nThose who are engaging in risky behavior are sending the message that COVID isn't really their problem, that they don't see a reason to modify their behavior to mitigate risk, said Atlanta clinical psychologist Zainab Delawalla. This is infuriating to people who have been making sacrifices for almost a year, and doing so not just to protect themselves, but also to protect others around them.\n\nWhen you've been holding up your end of the bargain, it is enraging to see that others are not doing the same, Delawalla added.\n\nBelow, experts offer some advice on how to cope with the panger you might be feeling.\n\n1. You think their behavior is risky, but they may not see it that way.\n\nPeople's individual definitions of what COVID-19 safety looks like vary widely. You think eating inside at restaurant is too risky right now (and infectious disease experts may agree with you), but your friends may believe it's totally fine. They figure restaurants wouldn't be open if they weren't safe, right? As journalist Amanda Mull of The Atlantic pointed out, there are many people who are trying to do everything right, but run afoul of science without realizing it because of confusing policies and tangled messages from government leaders.\n\nOften, safety protocols, of all things, are what's misleading them, Mull wrote. In the country's new devastating wave of infections, a perilous gap exists between the realities of transmission and the rules implemented to prevent it.\n\nIn other words, some people participating in riskier activities may be unaware that their actions could be dangerous, said Los Angeles marriage and family therapist Abigail Makepeace.\n\nThey may wholeheartedly believe that the people they are with are healthy or that they are largely safe while traveling for leisure, Makepeace said.\n\n2. Consider the less obvious reasons they may be making these selfish choices.\n\nAs difficult as it may be, try to exercise some compassion toward people who may be engaging in activities that you deem self-centered. It may help soften some of your anger.\n\nYou don't know what others might be struggling with in their personal lives or how the pandemic has impacted them. For some, socializing in person may be a much-needed coping mechanism necessary for a different form of survival, Makepeace said.\n\nWhen you've been holding up your end of the bargain, it is enraging to see that others are not doing the same. - Zainab Delawalla, clinical psychologist\n\nThey may have lost their job or relationship or may be struggling with less visible challenges, such as challenges in their mental health, Makepeace said. Their gathering and traveling may not equate to a lack of suffering. In fact, it may be reflective of how much they have been suffering.\n\n3. Know that anger isn't inherently bad — it's a normal, healthy human emotion.\n\nWhen you consider the chaos, uncertainty and instability of the last year, your frustrations with other people (and the state of the world) are completely understandable.\n\nAnger can often be closely linked to the fear people commonly experience when feeling helpless or out of control, said Lee Land, a psychologist in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\nMany of us — women, in particular — are taught that anger is something that needs to be suppressed. But ignoring these feelings can actually intensify them. Instead, remind yourself it's OK to feel what you're feeling, as long as you're not bottling it up or lashing out at others.\n\nThere's an important distinction between developing comfort with anger on the one hand and, on the other hand, acting out aggressively or violently, Land said. Ironically, it is often the case that being more aware of and comfortable with our angry feelings can actually reduce the chances that it ends up leaking out in impulsive, hurtful ways.\n\n4. Channel your anger toward something productive.\n\nFor example, instead of being angry at the shopper who is not wearing a mask while inside the store, write to the corporation or to your local city council members demanding that mask mandates be more strictly enforced, Delawalla said. Anger is a very motivating emotion — use it to effect the change you want to see.\n\nIf your goal is to get an individual to change their ways, shaming them is unlikely to be effective. It often leads to defensiveness, which can make people double-down on their behavior to 'prove' that their actions are justified, Delawalla added.\n\nTaking a few steps back or walking away from the maskless person is an option if you want to avoid confrontation. But if you feel compelled to speak up, you could say something like: I have a son at home with a compromised immune system — would you mind putting your mask on?\n\nIf you're calm and consistent and empathetic, you will have a much better result than if you go in with guns blazing, Susan Driscoll, president of the Crisis Prevention Institute, told Fast Company.\n\n5. Talk to loved ones about their questionable behavior.\n\nHave the conversation when you're not in an agitated state, lead with your feelings rather than citing statistics and try to withhold judgment. (We have expert-backed tips on how to broach the subject, if you need them.)\n\nEven if you're not able to change this person's mind, you might feel better if you voice your frustrations.\n\nIdeally in any healthy relationship, people can feel safe enough to talk directly about anger openly to increase the chances their emotional needs will be understood and met by others, Land said. Developing this type of healthy assertiveness can be healing not only in close relationships, but can also provide the energy and motivation necessary for healthy forms of advocacy and social change.\n\n6. Take a break from social media.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that what you see on Instagram doesn't always tell the whole story. Maybe that vacation pic your college friend posted isn't recent, but a throwback from 2019. Perhaps your co-worker's photos with her parents weren't from a holiday visit — they've actually been living together during the pandemic.\n\nBut if the images on your feed are still making you pangry, then consider muting certain people or limiting the amount of time you spend on these sites.\n\nI recommend signing off and redirecting your attention to a fulfilling or relaxing pursuit, Makepeace said.\n\n7. Lean into self-care.\n\nWhen we're stressed out, it doesn't take much to set us off. Making time for activities that relax you — like taking a walk, cuddling with your dog or doing a puzzle — will help you build up tolerance for the aggravating behavior of others.\n\nThe times call for self-care more than ever, said Los Angeles marriage and family therapist Patrick Tully, who works with the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe times call for self-care more than ever. - Patrick Tully, marriage and family therapist\n\nEven doing basic tasks, like straightening up your apartment, can improve your emotional state.\n\nDoing the laundry, for example, might make us feel a bit of reprieve from the unsettled feeling of our exterior world, Tully added. And it's worth doing for those moments of happiness and certainty we gain from them.\n\n8. Talk to a mental health professional.\n\nIf your anger is overwhelming or you're having trouble controlling it, consider making a virtual appointment with a therapist.\n\nAs an impartial observer, we can listen and be present for someone in a way that a friend may not be able to right now, Tully said.\n\nCounseling can be expensive, but more affordable options do exist. You can try online platforms such as BetterHelp or Talkspace, or ask if your therapist offers sliding scale payment options to reduce costs.\n\nA HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus
Roque Planas contributed reporting.\n\nThe message popped up on Katya Brock's phone just after 10 a.m. one morning in September: Do the right thing and kill yourself already.\n\n\n\nShe was alarmed, but no more so than she had been by all the other messages: I have better things to do than speak to a whore; Nobody loves you; Narcissistic whore. Her ex-husband, Larry Rendall Brock Jr., had been sending them like clockwork for three years. A court had ordered the couple to communicate through a specialized portal while their contentious divorce was finalized. Larry often used it for threats.\n\n\n\nThe stuff that he writes to me is brutal. You grow thick skin and try to filter it, but it's hard, said Katya, who shares a 6-year-old son with Larry. Katya said her ex-husband views women as disposable and has abused her throughout their four years of marriage and additional three years of separation.\n\n\n\nLarry, a 53-year-old Air Force veteran, is one of the hundreds of insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 and is now facing federal charges. He sported a combat helmet, a bulletproof vest and carried zip-tie handcuffs. His threats to Katya also went beyond those messages ― HuffPost uncovered numerous 911 calls from their home for domestic disputes, including one in 2016 in which Larry was described as making a terroristic threat of family/household, according to a police summary of the call.\n\n\n\nLarry's history of abusive behavior is part of an alarmingly common trend among the rioters who have been arrested so far for their roles in the insurrection. After reviewing police reports and court filings, a HuffPost investigation found that at least nine insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol have a history of violence against women ― ranging from domestic abuse accusations to prison time for sexual battery and criminal confinement.\n\nIllustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost; Photos: Getty Images Larry Rendall Brock Jr. wears a combat helmet and vest after entering the Senate chamber on Jan. 6 during the Capitol riot in Washington, D.C.\n\nExperts have linked extremism to violent misogyny in recent years, especially in the wake of mass shootings in which the perpetrators had a history of violence against women. These violent behaviors exist on a spectrum ― and, of course, not all abusive men turn into killers ― but violence against women often begets more violence, sometimes deadly. Three people died as a direct result of the violence at the Capitol, and more than 140 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Two U.S. Capitol Police officers have died by suicide in the aftermath.\n\nWe still, in this day and age, treat violence against women as a personal or family issue, as opposed to a troubling indicator of someone who could become more violent, said Bridget Todd, communications director at feminist organization UltraViolet.\n\nThe details in many of the cases are shocking and disturbing. Guy Reffitt, a 48-year-old from Wylie, Texas, was arrested and charged with unlawful entry for rioting at the Capitol. Reffitt, described by federal prosecutors as a member of two far-right militia organizations, the Three Percenters and the Texas Freedom Force, wore a combat helmet and other tactical gear during the insurrection.\n\nIn 2018, police responded to a domestic disturbance at Reffitt's home during which he and his wife were physically fighting. Reffitt and his wife, Nicole Reffitt, were both drunk, their children were present and he had a gun, according to the police report. At one point, Reffitt pushed his wife onto a bed and started choking her until she almost lost consciousness, the report states.\n\nReffitt admitted to police that he put his wife into a chokehold and pulled her to the ground. When the cop asked how long he had choked his wife, Reffitt responded that he had trouble remembering but he said not long because he loves her, according to the police report.\n\nNicole Reffitt confirmed to HuffPost that the physical altercation did happen, although she couldn't recall specific details. Guy has a very high respect for women. He has two daughters. He's a gentleman when it comes to opening doors. We're from the South so, you know, he wouldn't walk through a door before a lady, she said.\n\nThe FBI also charged Reffitt with obstruction of justice for threatening to kill his family if they turned him in to law enforcement for his participation in the Capitol riot. If you turn me in, you're a traitor and you know what happens to traitors. … Traitors get shot, Reffitt said, according to the FBI complaint. Reffitt's 18-year-old son alerted the FBI to his dad's presence at the Capitol.\n\nWe still, in this day and age, treat violence against women as a personal or family issue, as opposed to a troubling indicator of someone who could become more violent. Bridget Todd, UltraViolet\n\nLike Reffitt, Mathew Capsel, of Marseilles, Illinois, continued threatening and illegal actions toward women even after he was arrested in Washington on Jan. 6. Two days later, Capsel violated a protection order — one of multiple violations in the past year — that was filed by a romantic partner after a report of violence (Capsel's partner declined to speak with HuffPost). Capsel was also arrested for battery, mob action and robbery in 2012 when he was involved in an incident in which he allegedly hit a woman 3-4 times in the head, according to a police report. He does not appear to have faced criminal charges following his arrest in that case.\n\nThe rap sheets of other rioters are littered with similar charges. A California civil court in 2018 issued a restraining order against Jacob Lewis, another Capitol rioter, to prevent domestic violence, according to court records. The 37-year-old Lewis is better known as the California gym owner who defied COVID-19 safety regulations.\n\nSamuel Pinho Camargo, 26, was arrested for battery in 2016 after he intentionally caused bodily harm to his sister, according to a police report. The report states that Camargo broke a door off its hinges and attacked his sister. Both the sister and a witness told police that Camargo has a history of anger issues and a history of him hitting them and leaving bruises.\n\nDominic Pezzola, a former Marine, had a shotgun removed from his home after police were called there in 2005 over a domestic dispute. The police report notes that Pezzola had a protection order filed against him at the time. Pezzola, who smashed a Capitol building window with a police riot shield during the insurrection, is a member of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys, which is known for its emphasis on traditional masculinity.\n\nAndrew Ryan Bennett, who was seen entering the Capitol chanting break it down! and wearing a Proud Boys hat, has a long rap sheet that includes many incidences of violence against women. In 2003, Bennett was arrested after he broke down a glass door at a tattoo parlor and attacked a woman. He later served 18 months in prison for second-degree criminal assault.\n\nPolice responded to another incident in 2003 in which Bennett's mother said her son was out of control trying to fight and had been drinking and was becoming more and more aggressive to her and others, according to a police report.\n\nIn 2009, police responded to an incident of family violence in which Bennett assaulted his sister and almost poured bleach on his 2-year-old nephew. He was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, malicious destruction of property and reckless endangerment. In response to HuffPost's request for Bennett's records, one record was withheld because it pertained to a child abuse case.\n\nA woman who grew up with Bennett described him to HuffPost as reckless with a history of being aggressive. She said he and his girlfriend often got into domestic disputes, including one in 2006 where domestic violence charges were filed and a protective order was put in place.\n\nI don't think he sees women as his equals, said the childhood friend, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for her safety.\n\nHollywood Police Department/Wylie Police Department/Lasalle County Sheriff's Office Screenshots of past police reports showing accusations and charges of violence against women. I asked Guy how long he held her and he had trouble remembering but he said not long because he loves her, one report reads, referring to Guy Reffitt.\n\nAnother Capitol rioter, Edward Hemenway of Winchester, Virginia, was released from prison in 2013 after serving five years on rape, sexual battery and criminal confinement charges. According to court records, Hemenway lured his estranged wife to a hotel in 2004 where he handcuffed her and duct-taped her mouth shut.\n\nThe woman, whom HuffPost will not name because she's a sexual assault survivor, said Hemenway raped her and then told her that he was going to commit suicide and that he was going to make [her] watch him do it, the police report states. Hemenway attempted to drink rat poison, but his estranged wife talked him out of it, according to the police report.\n\nHemenway was also charged with battery and bodily injury, a criminal misdemeanor, in 2002. It is unclear if the victim in this incident was also his estranged wife or someone else.\n\nAfter rushing into the Capitol building, Hemenway said that a Capitol Police officer greeted him with a handshake, telling him, It's your house now, according to an FBI complaint.\n\nDonovan Ray Crowl, another former Marine and a member of extremist organization the Oath Keepers who is facing felony charges for illegally entering the Capitol, was arrested in 2005 on first-degree misdemeanor domestic violence charges in Champaign County, Ohio, according to a public records search in the Nexis database. Those charges were dropped, however. HuffPost was not able to locate records documenting that incident through any of the law enforcement agencies or the courthouse in that jurisdiction. Defendants routinely move to seal criminal cases that don't result in conviction.\n\nHuffPost reached out to all nine men for comment except Crowl, for whom we were unable to find contact information. Hemenway declined to comment for this story via his attorney. Lewis responded to HuffPost's request for comment: Kick rocks.\n\nLarry Brock's divorce attorney, Mark Lister, told HuffPost that Katya Brock's allegations against Larry are unfounded, adding: I don't have any evidence presented to me by anyone yet that he's abused her.\n\nI'm not saying Larry's not an aggressive hothead at times, he's an old Air Force fighter pilot. That's sort of the character of those people, Lister said, adding that Brock can be verbally caustic. He has a tendency to let his mouth run away from him. But it's not different than any other political group, say a Trump supporter or a [Black Lives Matter] advocate. They let their mouths run away from them and say stuff they shouldn't say. They say stuff that's just not true. ... But free speech, right?\n\nMany people rightly see Jan. 6 as a tipping point when Trump's anti-democratic tendencies and conspiracy-mongering finally provoked a genuine disaster. But it was also the crescendo of his yearslong embrace of misogyny and toxic behavior toward women. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to rape, by more than 20 women. He filled his Cabinet and senior staff with accused domestic abusers. A month before the 2016 presidential election, he was caught on leaked audio bragging about grabbing women by the pussy.\n\nTrump validated these men and how they view women by saying what he said on the bus with Billy Bush and by ignoring everything that happened afterwards. He validated their version of toxic masculinity, said Dr. Miranda Christou, a senior fellow focusing on gender and extremism at the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right.\n\nMisogyny — and the toxic version of masculinity that Trump represents — is the glue that brought the insurrectionists together, Christou said.\n\nWhen the institution of the military infiltrates social life and that sense of masculinity and what makes you a man depends on that ― depends on the gun on the side of your hip ― that becomes a problem for women. Dr. Miranda Christou, Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right\n\nMany of the men who stormed the Capitol, including three of the nine identified by HuffPost in this article, are veterans who sported military-style gear such as helmets and tactical goggles during the riot. This is no surprise to Christou, who said sometimes a militarized persona can have dire consequences for women.\n\n\n\nYou have forms of masculinity that depend on militarized expressions: the uniforms, the guns, the paraphernalia, the whole idea of the military structure and discipline, she said. When the institution of the military infiltrates social life and that sense of masculinity and what makes you a man depends on that ― depends on the gun on the side of your hip ― that becomes a problem for women.\n\n\n\nLarry Brock exemplified it all. After he was arrested on Jan. 10 for storming the Capitol, Katya Brock filed for a protective order against him because she said she's fearful for her and her son's safety. If he was capable of doing something like this ― going to D.C. and rioting ― I don't know who that person is anymore, she said.\n\n\n\nPolice records document Katya's allegations of violence at the hands of her ex-husband. Law enforcement responded to multiple domestic disputes at the couple's home, including one 911 call from Katya in 2016 where Larry was drinking and had multiple guns in the house, according to police records. The report states Larry locked Katya out of the house during the argument, while their 20-month-old son was inside.\n\nKatya said her ex-husband often demeaned her for being Russian. She said he also often disparaged gay people and people with mental illnesses and disabilities, especially people with Down syndrome. Larry calls it a disease, Katya said of Larry's attitude toward gay people. Larry says, verbatim, 'We need to have a societal cleanse and put all of these defective people on the train.' You know, like Hitler did with all of the Jews? That was his favorite phrase.\n\n\n\nThe Air Force veteran was fired from his job at CAE, a flight simulation company, in 2017 for telling colleagues that [he] had not killed anyone for a while and regarding potentially shooting members of a particular religion and/or race, his former manager wrote in a termination letter.\n\n\n\nMisogyny and white supremacy are mutually reinforcing ideologies because they're all based on that idea of the great replacement, said Christou, the senior fellow at the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right. The great replacement is the academic theory that men, specifically white men, feel they are being replaced by immigrants, people of color and women.\n\n\n\nKatya, who is currently finalizing her divorce from Larry, said she hopes her story can help other women who are in her situation. I've endured a lot, but if women like me read this maybe it will show them they're not alone.
JGI/Tom Grill via Getty Images A host of new marital issues can crop up when you have kids.\n\nBringing your baby home is a magical bonding time for most couples. But life with a newborn is also incredibly stressful, full of little hiccups you may have never anticipated during pregnancy.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing concerns new parents face right after the baby is born? Below, marriage therapists around the country share the top six issues brought up in their offices.\n\nMy partner doesn't show up the way I need them to.\n\nNew parents balance it all and then some: ever-changing sleeping and eating schedules, doctor's appointments, running errands with a fussy baby. It's exhausting, mostly thankless work, and it can drive you up the wall if your partner isn't helping.\n\nDon't let your expectations on baby-related responsibilities go unspoken: If things aren't equitable and you're shouldering the bulk of the parenting, household and emotional labor at home, speak up, said Dori Gatter, a psychotherapist in West Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nSit down with your partner for a heart-to-heart without blame, criticism or negativity, she said. Try to see them as innocent.\n\nTo broach the conversation, Talk about your own childhoods, what roles your parents had in childrearing and how you want to do things similarly or differently from what they did, Gatter said.\n\nThen, talk about what you expect ― not demand ― of your partner and figure out a compromise.\n\nI'm exhausted. Why am I on diaper duty most nights?\n\nQuality sleep is a thing of the past with a newborn. When your baby is teeny-tiny, count yourself lucky if you get more than two or three hours of shut-eye.\n\nIf your partner is sleeping like a baby and not helping out at night, there's bound to be some resentment, said Laurel Steinberg, a psychotherapist in New York City. If a mom is breastfeeding, the feeding may be left entirely up to her at first, but her partner should pick up the slack in other ways (rocking the baby to sleep, for instance, or diaper duty). And if she decides to incorporate pumping into her routine, her partner should step up and do some bottle feeding.\n\nThe solution for this issue has to be practical — if one parent has to get up early to go to the office, perhaps he or she should be the one to get up on the weekends, she said. If both partners have to get up early to go to work, they could alternate nights.\n\nHero Images via Getty Images Nighttime responsibilities need to be evenly divided, therapist Laurel Steinberg said.\n\nWe hardly ever have sex.\n\nSex is undoubtedly going to be different post-baby, with each of you experiencing highs and lows in sexual desire. Fatigue, stress, a lack of time or your baby's sleeping habits might get in the way of sex, or there may be physical impediments, such as vaginal bleeding or pain from breastfeeding.\n\nYou may even begin thinking about sex with your partner differently in the wake of these changes or just not feel sexy, said Aaron Anderson, a couples therapist in Denver.\n\nIf this happens, don't get unnerved, he said. A lot of times it just takes a few times of doing the deed before you forget about the body changes and other things making sex more complicated.\n\nTalk about your sexual desires and changing feelings during this postpartum period. Eventually, sex will get good again, Anderson said.\n\nI thought we were on the same page when it came to parenting styles. I was wrong.\n\nYou may have had conversations about big-ticket parenting issues prior to baby: You weren't going to co-sleep, you were firmly team breastfeeding. That's all well and good, but once your little one arrives, you might feel differently. A baby can complicate even the best-laid plans, Gatter said.\n\nTo arrive at a compromise, she tells couples to practice mirroring, a therapeutic technique meant to facilitate deep listening.\n\nEssentially, one person talks first and the other mirrors or reflects back exactly what they heard until the person is done sharing, she said. Then, they switch. This way you both are heard and understood.\n\nBe careful not to make the other person feel bad or wrong for their beliefs, she said. Typically, once we hear the backstory of why someone feels or thinks the way they do, we have more compassion and understanding.\n\n10'000 Hours via Getty Images Your thoughts on parenting may change once the baby arrives, psychotherapist Dori Gatter said.\n\nWe disagree on who gets to visit our baby at home.\n\nVisitors can be a huge point of contention for new parents, especially during cold and flu season. Your wife's coworker's offer to drop off homemade lasagna is sweet and well-intentioned, but babies have fragile immune systems; you may be wary of anyone who could potentially carry a virus or illness.\n\nTo avoid stressful arguments about guests, make sure your pediatrician has OK'd visits and set a protocol for visitors: What will guests have to do when they arrive (shoes off, use hand sanitizer)? How long can they stay?\n\nIt's totally understandable for parents to be worried about germs or want quiet, private time to bond with their new addition, Steinberg said.\n\nI don't get any attention from my partner.\n\nOvernight, you went from a twosome to a trio that includes a demanding little human. You liked all the attention, romance and affection you had before, and now you might feel a little neglected by your partner (not to mention feeling drained emotionally by your newborn). That's entirely normal, said Anderson.\n\nThe solution is to pencil in truly quality time with each other, he said. (And no, Netflix and chill isn't going to cut it, no matter how addictive those new episodes of Black Mirror may be.)\n\nThe way you can address it is to capitalize on time when the baby is asleep to connect with each other ― and of course, to use babysitters. A lot of babysitters, Anderson said. Turn off the TV and actually do some connecting – the same goes when you get a babysitter: Get out of the house and enjoy some baby-free time.
Being an R. Kelly hater in early 2000s Chicago was a mighty lonely experience, but the release of a video that featured him engaged in sexual acts with two teenage girls was all the proof I needed to let him go ― though his marriage to Aaliyah in 1995 and the stories I heard about him approaching my friends when we were only in middle school should have done the trick.\n\nFor two decades, I have been begging people to stop playing this man's music. Stop purchasing tickets to his shows. Stop acting like he isn't to blame for every single relationship he's had with an underage girl.\n\nDespite mountains of reporting — not nearly enough, mind you — and evidence, people found ways to disregard allegations as rumors, and cited his 2008 acquittal on child pornography charges as a reason to leave the matter be. The same community that knows how unfair and inadequate the criminal justice system can be will lean on it when someone they love has been legally exonerated.\n\nBut now, finally, it feels like there is a sea change happening.\n\nJon Palmer / MediaPunch/MediaPunch/IPx R. Kelly attends the Z-100 New York Jingle Ball on Dec. 13, 2013, in Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nSince the first episode of dream hampton's docuseries Surviving R. Kelly aired, I have been inundated with calls, texts, emails and direct messages from friends, colleagues, former classmates and complete strangers. They thank me for appearing in the film and for constantly speaking out about Kelly and his predations. I've heard confessions from other survivors of sexual abuse who've never shared their stories with anyone, and heard vows to stop supporting a once-beloved artist.\n\nMy mother was even approached at a restaurant in the neighborhood where I grew up by a woman who remarked that she remembered seeing us together when I was a child. Then, the woman told my mother that she, too, had suffered at the singer's hands, when she was just 17. Most significantly, the state of Georgia has reportedly reopened its investigation into Kelly's actions.\n\nYet, there are still folks out there who seem to believe that those of us who participated in the project are acting on a desire to destroy the image of a successful Black man for insignificant or unfair reasons, or, perhaps, for no reason at all. Others feel that dedicating six hours of television to his sick offstage behavior represents the disparity in how Black and white male suspects are treated.\n\nI've heard confessions from other survivors of sexual abuse who've never shared their stories with anyone, and heard vows to stop supporting a once-beloved artist.\n\nOne particularly infuriating video shows a Black man weeping at what he describes as the documentary's insinuation that one Black man is the No. 1 pedophile on the planet. I didn't realize there were power rankings for sexual predators, but I suppose it's not surprising that someone who primarily harms Black victims would chart low on the list.\n\nThose responses are a slap in the face to the Black women and girls who have already endured the indignity of Kelly's continued success. Who have already been told, implicitly and explicitly, over and over, that our suffering and our success is less important than that of our male counterparts.\n\nBlack women have been told that the misogyny of rappers must go unchecked. That the largely Black and male artists who dominate the genre must be allowed to tell their truths without restriction. We've long understood that the violent, racist nature of law enforcement means that we cannot seek police aid when we are harmed by one of our own men without risking the possibility that he will be harmed by a responding officer. We know that those same officers are unlikely to believe us or show us the sort of empathy befitting a victim. We've also been taught to believe that fast Black teen girls are to blame when adult men engage them for sex that they cannot legally consent to have.\n\nAP Photo/Kevork Djansezian An Aaliyah fan writes a message on a Sunset Boulevard billboard of the singer on Aug. 27, 2001, in West Hollywood, California.\n\nAnd so, there are still those who seem to feel that Step in the Name of Love means more than the humanity of both a famed singer like Aaliyah and the formerly nameless and faceless R. Kelly victims who have risked so much to participate in this series.\n\nBut letting Black men escape accountability isn't some sort of retribution for our ancestors who were murdered over false accusations, or for our peers who languish behind bars for crimes that they did not commit. Those of us who really care about justice should focus on creating a world where the race of an abuser will not protect him from punishment, nor ensure that he will be unduly punished.\n\nWe cannot undo the darkness of our past or our present by protecting Black men who abuse Black women under the auspices of racial solidarity. Furthermore, attempts to let men like Kelly off the hook because of their race implies that Black men are either inherently predisposed to sexual violence or that Black girls and women are inherently incapable of being be victimized.\n\nWe cannot undo the darkness of our past or our present by protecting Black men who abuse Black women under the auspices of 'racial solidarity.'\n\nMy desire for R. Kelly to lose his livelihood, social capital and freedom isn't about revenge or some sort of vendetta. Nor is it brand building or an attempt to further my career. I have a responsibility to address the unchecked abuse that Black women and girls face too often at the hands of men. I have an obligation to build a world in which those same girls and women aren't tasked with protecting those same men out of a sense of racial loyalty.\n\nI'm just a writer and commentator. I didn't launch #MuteRKelly or set the world ablaze with #MeToo. I didn't speak out about abuse by a former friend or family member, nor am I one of the brave survivors who endured harm at the hands of the singer. As such, I don't think I deserve any credit or props. I'm just a Black woman, a Chicago native and a mother doing what I'd want anyone to do if they had the opportunity: standing up for Black girls and for all survivors. Being an R. Kelly hater isn't so lonely these days, and it's about damn time.\n\nJamilah Lemieux is a writer, cultural critic and communications strategist from Chicago. She lives in Brooklyn.
Marriage may be an important commitment, but that doesn't mean it has to be taken seriously all the time. In fact, if you take a step back, you might just find that some of the day-to-day annoyances of married life are actually pretty funny.

My passport ruined my life, said Amin, a dual citizen from Pakistan who grew up in New York City. She was forcibly married at 13 in Pakistan and applied for papers for her 26-year-old husband to come to the country.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of requests by men to bring in child and adolescent brides to live in the United States were approved over the past decade, according to government data obtained by The Associated Press. In one case, a 49-year-old man applied for admission for a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThe approvals are legal: The Immigration and Nationality Act does not set minimum age requirements. And in weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives.\n\nBut the data raises questions about whether the immigration system may be enabling forced marriage and about how U.S. laws may be compounding the problem despite efforts to limit child and forced marriage. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the United States, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.\n\nThere were more than 5,000 cases of adults petitioning on behalf of minors and nearly 3,000 examples of minors seeking to bring in older spouses or fiances, according to the data requested by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2017 and compiled into a report.\n\nSome victims of forced marriage say the lure of a U.S. passport combined with lax U.S. marriage laws are partly fueling the petitions.\n\nMy passport ruined my life, said Naila Amin, a dual citizen from Pakistan who grew up in New York City.\n\nShe was forcibly married at 13 in Pakistan and applied for papers for her 26-year-old husband to come to the country.\n\nPeople die to come to America, she said. I was a passport to him. They all wanted him here, and that was the way to do it.\n\nAmin, now 29, said she was betrothed to her first cousin Tariq when she was just 8 and he was 21. The petition was eventually terminated after she ran away. She said the ordeal cost her a childhood. She was in and out of foster care and group homes, and it took a while to get her life on track.\n\nI was a child. I want to know: Why weren't any red flags raised? Whoever was processing this application, they don't look at it? They don't think? Amin asked.\n\nThere is a two-step process for obtaining U.S. immigration visas and green cards. Petitions are first considered by USCIS. If granted, they must be approved by the State Department. Overall, there were 3.5 million petitions received from budget years 2007 through 2017.\n\nOver that period, there were 5,556 approvals for those seeking to bring minor spouses or fiancees, and 2,926 approvals by minors seeking to bring in older spouses, according to the data. Additionally, there were 204 for minors by minors. Petitions can be filed by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\n\nIt indicates a problem. It indicates a loophole that we need to close, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told the AP.\n\nIn nearly all the cases, the girls were the younger person in the relationship. In 149 instances, the adult was older than 40, and in 28 cases the adult was over 50, the committee found. Among the examples: In 2011, immigration officials approved a 14-year-old's petition for a 48-year-old spouse in Jamaica. A petition from a 71-year-old man was approved in 2013 for his 17-year-old wife in Guatemala.\n\nThere are no nationwide statistics on child marriage, but data from a few states suggests it is far from rare. State laws generally set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, yet every state allows exceptions. Most states let 16- and 17-year-olds marry if they have parental consent, and several states — including New York, Virginia and Maryland — allow children under 16 to marry with court permission.\n\nAP Photo/Anna Gronewold In this image taken from video, Fraidy Reiss, center, founder and executive director of Unchained at Last, demonstrates in chains at the State Capitol in Albany, N.Y., on Feb. 14, 2017.\n\nFraidy Reiss, who campaigns against coerced marriage as head of a group called Unchained at Last, researched data from her home state of New Jersey. She determined that nearly 4,000 minors, mostly girls, were married in the state from 1995 to 2012, including 178 who were under 15.\n\nThis is a problem both domestically and in terms of immigration, she said.\n\nReiss — who says she was forced into an abusive marriage by her Orthodox Jewish family when she was 19 — said that often cases of child marriage via parental consent involve coercion, with a girl forced to marry against her will.\n\nThey are subjected to a lifetime of domestic servitude and rape, she said. And the government is not only complicit; they're stamping this and saying: Go ahead.\n\nThe data was requested in 2017 by Johnson and then-Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee's top Democrat. Johnson said it took a year to get the information, showing there needs to be a better system to track and vet the petitions.\n\nOur immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.\n\nUSCIS didn't know how many of the approvals were granted by the State Department, but overall only about 2.6 percent of spousal or fiancee claims are rejected.\n\nSeparately, the data show some 4,749 minor spouses or fiancees received green cards to live in the U.S. over that same 10-year period.\n\nThe head of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna, said in a letter to the committee that their request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages. The agency noticed some issues in how the data was collected and has resolved them. Officials also created a flagging system that requires verification of the birthdate whenever a minor is detected.\n\nThe country where most requests came from was Mexico, followed by Pakistan, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and Yemen. Middle Eastern nationals had the highest percentage of overall approved petitions.\n\nNeed help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
They also at one point claimed the assailants were rogue killers. The kingdom eventually said the killing was likely premeditated. The evolving explanations sparked speculation of a cover-up.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially accepted the Saudi denials but later said the killing was carried out poorly, and the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\n\nNonetheless, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Mohammed, as well as with Saudi King Salman, in January and said he expected that the kingdom would hold the responsible parties accountable.\n\nWe spoke about the accountability and the expectations that we have, Pompeo told reporters after visiting Riyadh. The Saudis are friends, and when friends have conversations, you tell them what your expectations are.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new intelligence.
The actress left Indra for Chris Pratt after the two co-starred in the movie Take Me Home Tonight. Pratt and Faris, who have one son together, split in 2017 after eight years of marriage.\n\nWe tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward, a statement on Pratt's Facebook said of the split. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\n\nPrior to their breakup, Pratt and Faris dealt with rumors that he was hooking up with his Passengers co-star Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nFaris said that the rumors were totally hurtful and that while she knew they weren't true, she couldn't block them out, either. She also hinted before the split that Pratt's demanding work schedule made it difficult for the two to spend time together.
Valentine's Day approaches. It is a Leap Year. Are you ready to propose to the man of your life? Is commitment the next step in your partnership? Do you have friends who have fallen madly in love, and then later fallen dramatically out again, two weeks, two months or two years later?\n\nIt takes more than romance to make a good marriage.\n\nHere are 3 keys to consider.\n\n1. Prize your Perfect Partner\n\nIn the heights of romance, your loved one can do no wrong. They are without fault. As time goes on, the habits that you found charming when you first met become irritating. His spontaneity, or her need to be well organized, start to drive you crazy.\n\nIn my experience of creating wedding ceremonies, often one partner has a different set of habits from the other. It seems opposites attract. These differences may be cause for conflict down the road - until you have learned to be accepting and tolerant.\n\nThere are no prizes for finding the negative in your very human loved one. The stresses of life can make you both more aware of your weaknesses.\n\nYour partner is perfect because this is the one who will most invite you to grow your love, patience and sense of humour.\n\n\n\nThe remedy is to Prize your Partner - and regularly. Last thing at night, share with each other the 3 things you have most appreciated in yourself and your loved one during the day. Once a week, share acknowledgments for what you partner has done, and appreciation for the positive qualities you notice in him or her. Keep looking for the good, and overlooking the limitations.\n\n2. Listen\n\nYou have two ears and one mouth. This reminds you to listen twice as much as you speak. Listening takes time. It also demonstrates your love for your loved one. We each of us have a need to express ourselves, and be heard.\n\nEffective listening happens when you each feel safe to be open. Being overly critical towards yourself or your loved one creates static in the channel of clear communication. Pressures from your work or family challenges can make you feel separate from the one you love most. Good communication builds trust, the vital foundation for a happy marriage.\n\nThe remedy is to forgive yourself first, then forgive your partner. Restore the harmony, balance and joy between the two of you with love. Remember that at all times, you are both doing the best you know at the time. When you know better, you do better.\n\n3. Grow your love\n\nNothing in life stays static and the same. Tying the knot is just the beginning of lifelong love, which can deepen and expand over time. You can use the stress and challenges that show up to make your love stronger.\n\n\n\nThe remedy is to hold the intention for your love and devotion to get better over the years. Let the issues that arise become opportunities for you to grow in wisdom and love. The vows you make on your wedding day speak to the intention you have for the future. What actions will you each take when life gets difficult?\n\nDuring the ten years I have been designing and performing wedding ceremonies, I have found that increasingly, couples I meet now are emotionally more mature. There is greater awareness, understanding and knowledge for sustaining and nourishing a loving relationship.\n\nLove is a friendship set to music.\n\nJoseph Campbell\n\nWhat do you know to do to turn your romance into a happy marriage? What have you learnt from your family and friends? Please feel free to leave a comment below and share your wisdom or contact me.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) had trouble hiring a presidential campaign manager because of her reputation for mistreating her staff.\n\nSince launching her presidential campaign, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has faced questions about her mistreatment of her staff, as reported by HuffPost and other outlets. Former aides said she berated them, physically threw objects at them, made them do her personal chores, undermined their advancement to other jobs and created an anxiety-ridden workplace that led to high staff turnover and trouble hiring new talent.\n\nThe political world has largely received these stories as sexist criticism, dismaying and infuriating former aides who experienced Klobuchar's fury firsthand. From tweets by prominent Democratic strategists Hilary Rosen and Patti Solis Doyle:\n\nI am bothered by hit pieces on @amyklobuchar suggesting that she is tough on staff. I've never worked for an easy boss whom I respected. Amy is a smart, hardworking and dedcated leader. I am not troubled by former staffers who aren't. — Hilary Rosen (@hilaryr) February 6, 2019\n\nSeveral staffers HuffPost spoke to forcefully rejected such criticism.\n\nNone of what we are saying has anything to do with Amy being 'likable' or 'emotional' or whatever other nonsense people throw out at women, said a former female staffer. It's that she is a terrible manager and abusive to her staff. I can't emphasize enough that there is a big difference between being demanding and being abusive.\n\nOn Friday, The New York Times also published a new report with additional details on Klobuchar's conduct, including her tendency to blame her aides for all of her problems, such as stymied political ambitions and the state of her marriage.\n\nKlobuchar has responded to the reports by saying she is tough, not abusive. On Rachel Maddow's MSNBC show, and in similar comments at a CNN town hall, she said, I'm going to take the high expectations and bring them out to the country because if we want to really get these things done, some of these things should happen.\n\nWhile some writers and media outlets have expressed concern at Klobuchar's treatment of her staff, plenty of political operatives and journalists have jumped to her defense. The arguments have largely broken down into three categories:\n\nThe staffers clearly don't know how to deal with a tough work environment. She is also getting criticism, albeit anonymously, as a tough boss who mistreated her staff. She has had some of the highest staff turnover on Capitol Hill, but the stories would have more credibility if the critics lent their names. Perhaps the Senator is simply less tolerant of millennial demands, wrote The Wall Street Journal editorial board in one such example.\n\nUltimately, the stories don't matter because regular voters won't care and she's still well-positioned to take on President Donald Trump. A Washington Post analysis asked whether it mattered that Klobuchar was a mean boss, and whether it would factor into her success as president: Is how a person treats their staff a reflection of how they'll perform in their job?\n\nKlobuchar is a victim of sexism. In Politico, Jennifer Palmieri, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton, wrote that there was hidden sexism in the media reports about Klobuchar. I, like others, doubt that a male candidate with similar staff complaints would have seen them become the lead narrative of his presidential announcement, she said, adding, We still hold women in American politics to higher standards than men, which puts added pressure on female bosses.\n\nMany Klobuchar staffers who spoke to HuffPost requested anonymity to discuss their experiences because many of them still work in politics and fear retribution for speaking out against a powerful, popular senator.\n\nParticularly frustrating for some of these staffers have been the charges of sexism. Many of the aides who spoke with HuffPost are women, who consider themselves feminists and have worked for other strong female politicians.\n\nOne former staffer called the Palmieri op-ed offensive as fuck.\n\nIt's not that there's not merit to the argument that other men have been abusive and gotten away with it, she said. It doesn't make it OK for anybody. We don't say, we haven't held men accountable in the past for this on Capitol Hill, so why start now?\n\nIndeed, the Klobuchar coverage has set off a discussion on whether a male presidential candidate would be getting the same media attention. While there's no doubt that for years, working for a male politician with a temper was considered something of a badge of honor, that conception has been shifting. Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.), for example, was shamed in the press for misusing and mistreating his staff last year. There are plenty of other cases as well.\n\nWhat if, instead of approaching this story as a matter of political intrigue, we treated this story as it should be treated ― as a labor story, a story of a shitty boss and workers who deserve better? Libby Watson, Splinter\n\nWe have been evolving in how we think about sexual harassment in the workplace, and we've been evolving in how we think about bullying in school, and we should be evolving in how we think about bullying the workplace too, said another former Klobuchar staffer. It's not right and it's not good for women to excuse bullying and cruelty because the person who's doing it is a woman. That's going to set women back.\n\nAdvocates for women in politics have long been focused on dismantling the barriers that kept men in power and shut women out. And while the 2020 Democratic primary is the first time in history when a significant portion of the candidates running are women, many of those barriers still exist. Women still face more questions about their fitness for office in ways that men don't.\n\nBut with women in power, there are going to be good bosses. And there are going to be bad ones. And criticizing a female politician doesn't mean that it's a sexist attack. Feminism is, of course, ultimately about more than getting women into elected office.\n\nThe only way to excuse the Klobuchar allegations is to conflate cruelty with feminism, wrote Jezebel writer Ashley Reese. It's the reductive Bad Ass #GirlBoss model of empowerment that celebrates virtually anything women do — because a woman did it. It's about getting ahead, not other women.\n\nKlobuchar faced allegations of mistreating her staff as far back as 2006, when she was the Hennepin County attorney in Minneapolis ― undercutting the Wall Street Journal's view that the upset aides are just a bunch of snowflake millennials.\n\nI'm hearing people saying, 'They just didn't know how to work in a high-pressure environment,' or 'they couldn't take the high stakes or the tough boss or the tough feedback.' It's incredibly insulting. It's gaslighting, said one of the former Klobuchar staffers. It's the kind of thing people tell people who have been abused. It's not abuse, you just didn't live up to the standards, and that's your fault.\n\nBecause Klobuchar is running for president, much of the discussion about her treatment of staff has centered around what effect it will have on her chances of winning. Klobuchar is known for a Minnesota Nice image, and plenty of people have dismissed the stories about her staff treatment as ultimately inconsequential. If people like her policies and think she can beat Trump, they'll still go for her.\n\nBut there are other considerations aside from political ones. Capitol Hill has long been known as a grueling place to work, with low wages, no unionization and little accountability for members.\n\nWhat if, instead of approaching this story as a matter of political intrigue, we treated this story as it should be treated ― as a labor story, a story of a shitty boss and workers who deserve better? wrote journalist Libby Watson in Splinter. In the American workplace, the boss has outsized power and workers have increasingly less. This is far more pressing in low-wage jobs, but it is also true in Congress, where staffers are underpaid and overworked and the boss is a member of the ruling elite. It says something important about Klobuchar's understanding of labor rights ― and her politics ― if she abuses the power she has over her staff to demand they complete her menial personal errands, or screams at staffers for tiny errors.\n\nMolly Redden contributed reporting.\n\nCorrection: This piece originally listed Garrett as being a congressman from New Jersey. He represents Virginia.
What a difference 50 years makes.\n\nIn 1967, Kentucky couple Harold Holland and Lillian Barnes split up after a 12-year marriage and five children.\n\nHolland takes the blame for the breakup of the marriage.\n\nIt was 100 percent my fault, he told the Lexington Herald-Leader, saying he spent too much time working to build his flooring business and not enough with his wife and family.\n\nHolland, 83, married another woman in 1975 and she died in 2015. Barnes, 78, married twice but outlived both men; the second died in 2015.\n\nBecause they had kids together, the couple stayed in touch and saw each other at graduations, birthdays and weddings.\n\nI wouldn't call it close friends, but we got along, Holland told The Washington Post. For the kids' sake, more than anything else.\n\nBut the romance managed to heat up again last summer after Barnes attended a family reunion that Holland hosted.\n\nOne thing led to another, and we had dinner together, Holland said. We got a little more friendlier when we were alone.\n\nJoshua Holland/Inside Edition Harold Holland and Lillian Barnes are getting married again, about 50 years after they got divorced.\n\nAfter three months, Holland decided to pop the same question he asked in 1955.\n\nI just asked her if she'd like to do it over. She said, yes she would, he told Today.com. We tolerated each other and talked all those years, but I guess deep down there was always that first love. It was always there.\n\nThe couple's kids are planning the wedding, which will be held April 14 at an area church with grandson Joshua Holland, a New Orleans-based pastor, performing the ceremony.\n\nJoshua Holland told Inside Edition that his grandfather asked his advice before popping the question because he was worried about upsetting the extended family.\n\nGrandpa, I'd just go for it. Why wait? You haven't got that much time, to be honest, the pastor responded. Y'all just need to go for it, to enjoy this life, until the Lord calls you home.\n\nNow as the wedding day approaches, Harold Holland feels confident he won't make the same mistakes he did when he was younger.\n\nWe'll go do whatever we want to, whenever we want to do it. I'll take her wherever she wants to go, he told the Herald-Leader.
I was watching the hit show This Is Us last week and one of the characters described when his marriage ended. He said he woke up every morning and made her coffee for years. Then one day he woke up and didn't feel like making her coffee, so he didn't. And she never noticed.\n\nAt some point we all stop noticing the little things. That the dishes are done or the fresh bread is bought. That the laundry is folded or the kids are ready for bed. That the homework is finished or the car's washer fluid is full.\n\nBut it's the little things that are the big things after all. Those little things are sending a message that someone cares. That someone is trying to make a difference. That someone wants to lighten the load of another.\n\nLebanese-American poet and writer Kahlil Gibran once said, In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.\n\nAnd Humphry Davy, the chemist who helped discover chlorine and iodine, once said, Life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little things, in which smiles and kindness and small obligations given habitually, are what preserve the heart and secure comfort.\n\nAs we celebrate love this week on Valentine's Day, let's remember how the little things can refresh hearts, refuel connections and secure comfort. Because all anyone ever wants in life is a soft place to fall surrounded by those who make them feel like they matter.
This essay is part of a three-part interview series with sexual abuse survivors Drew Dixon and Asante McGee, and co-founder of the #MuteRKelly movement Oronike Odeleye.\n\nSince #MeToo went viral in 2017, it has transformed our culture for the better. The movement, created by activist Tarana Burke in 2006, has helped survivors and allies push back against rape culture and rally to hold abusers accountable, ousting media moguls, comedy icons, world-renowned chefs and politicians. Invoking the legacies of Harriet Jacobs, Rosa Parks, Recy Taylor and Anita Hill, Black women survivors have carved out spaces to raise awareness, disrupt sexual violence in the Black community and, most importantly, heal. However, the movement hasn't quite had the same impact in the music industry, specifically in hip-hop and R&B.\n\nIn this piece, writer Kellee Terrell spoke to Asante McGee, one of the women who appeared in the Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly. McGee talks about her accusations of emotional abuse by R. Kelly during their relationship, the scrutiny she faced for coming forward to the media, and why Black survivors need to be treated as human beings who deserve support, not just as a means to boost page views and ratings.\n\nI didn't want to be labeled as 'one of R. Kelly's girls,' but I knew I had to warn other women and, quite honestly, the world, and open up about how he groomed, abused and tried to control me.\n\nWhen I went on the record with journalist Jim DeRogatis, it wasn't an easy decision. The Savages — parents to Joycelyn Savage, another woman in R&B singer R. Kelly's sex cult — had reached out and told me to call the trusted journalist. I did, and while I told him my story, it was off the record. But soon after, I knew what I was going to have to do: I was going to have to put my name and face to my story.\n\nI was definitely worried. I didn't want to be labeled as one of R. Kelly's girls, but I knew I had to warn other women and, quite honestly, the world, and open up about how he groomed, abused and tried to control me. Asante, do it, that voice in my head urged me — and I did and don't regret it.\n\nBut when that BuzzFeed article came out, I wasn't prepared for what came after it. People were DM'ing me with threats, calling me a liar. Blogs were laughing at me, saying I was too old to let R. Kelly abuse me or how I should have known better. Yes, I'd heard all of the stories about him in the past, but I didn't believe them because, like most fans, I didn't want to. I thought that since he was acquitted, the rumors couldn't have been true. I never imagined this is what would happen to me.\n\nI was also a woman in love, who had left a yearslong abusive marriage and swore I would never get into another relationship like that again. So there I was, not seeing the red flags, believing that he loved me and would protect me. But when the red flags got too hard to ignore — he was telling me what to wear, making other women have sex with one another, I had to ask him when we could eat or use the bathroom — I was terrified. After years of dating and three weeks of living with him, I packed up my things and left.\n\nNo, I can't change the past, but I hoped that I could change the future by stopping the next girl from being a victim. I wanted to show other survivors they are not alone. But it was me that needed help because after coming forward, I fell into a deep depression and nearly had a mental breakdown.\n\nThen came Lifetime's Surviving R. Kelly.\n\nWhile I'm grateful to people like filmmaker dream hampton and others who believed us and cared for us, I didn't always feel supported by the network and the higher-ups. An article is one thing, but a TV series that broke the internet is something completely different, and we were just not prepared.\n\nWhen the show debuted in January 2019, we kept begging them to provide us with on-site therapists to help us through it, but were told that they didn't have the resources for that. Instead, they could get us counselors to talk to us over the phone. But I needed someone right there, in my face, to talk out my feelings. That night, I remember being numb, crying on the floor. I couldn't even watch the second episode the next day.\n\nAs survivors, we deserved better. Here we are, telling our stories, sharing our pain, while they profit from it, win awards, with no regard for our mental health.\n\nIt's a shame.\n\nThankfully, I am doing better.\n\nOver the past few years, I have learned many lessons, including never do a press conference without a lawyer present. I have published a few books, I am dating again (it's still scary to trust), and I even started an organization, G.A.S. The Fuel Behind The Fire, that helps both women and men survivors. I still have some trolls but, overall, I'm lucky.
Even supermodels have to deal with jerks.\n\nIn a new interview with People magazine, Ashley Graham ― arguably the most well-known plus-size supermodel in the world ― said she relates to stories of body shaming from her younger fans because she's experienced it herself with former boyfriends.\n\nNothing's actually surprised me. I've lived exactly what they're living. I've lived the torment of the names. I've lived the torment of boyfriends breaking up with me because they were afraid I was going to be too fat later in life, the 29-year-old model said at the Urban Arts Partnership 25th anniversary benefit.\n\nIt's the same cycle, it doesn't matter what generation we are in, she continued. Every kid is going to go through the same thing.\n\nThough Graham said she still has her days of self-doubt (I wake up sometimes and I think 'I'm the fattest woman alive,' she admitted), a simple, totally steal-worthy morning affirmation helps her get past it.\n\nIt's really about how you handle it when you wake up, she told People. I look in the mirror and I have my affirmations. And mine are simple. [I say] 'You are bold. You are brilliant and you are beautiful.' And then if my lower pooch is really puffing out that day, I say 'Lower pooch you are cute'. And we have a moment. And if the hips are really popping I say 'I love you too hips.'\n\nThat kind of self-love makes a huge difference ― but it doesn't hurt to have a partner who totally adores you, too. For Graham, that's her husband Justin Ervin, who was her friend before they started dating. The Vogue covergirl has been open about the couple's decision to wait until marriage to have sex.\n\nThere was already this sexual tension, this roaringness, she told Entertainment Tonight last year. We had already established such a friendship that we had the two combine. Which, in my mind, just made magic, because now not only am I sleeping with someone that I trust and I love, but I know that he wants me. He affirms me all the time and lets me know how sexy and beautiful I am.\n\nHusband & Wife A post shared by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@theashleygraham) on Mar 9, 2017 at 8:38am PST
Little girl swimming in the pool\n\nDo you think marriage has to become boring after a while? That's a myth. You can add excitement to your relationship -- by branching out from your same old same old, familiar, predictable actions.\n\nGranted, we like routines. It's nice to know we can count on our spouse being there when we go to bed and wake up. But this doesn't mean that after realizing he's (or she's) the one that the fun has to end.\n\nIt means to notice when it's time to add excitement to your marriage. When an activity you used to enjoy on your own or as a couple no longer lights you up, it's time to try something new--on your own or together.\n\nIf you enjoy your job, hobby, or other activity, you'll sparkle. Your aliveness will be contagious; it will spice things up for both of you. So take a break from a routine. Do something different, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.\n\nSnorkeling Adventure\n\nMy husband and I were vacationing in Maui with our son, then a toddler, which kept one of us on constant duty. While I took a snorkeling cruise, my husband watched our son. I love snorkeling in warm water, exploring the pristine habitat of fish. It had been years since I'd had the opportunity to do this.\n\nThis time, as I usually did when snorkeling, I kept swimming, searching for fish. I seemed to be working very hard for the reward of finding an occasional fish that would rapidly move out of sight.\n\nSoon a current was jolting me toward hazardous sharp coral reef. When I resisted, it pulled me closer. After what seemed like an eternity of struggling, I noticed scores of fish beneath and around me, tiny black and gold striped ones and larger gray news, all swaying gently, so peacefully, like a metronome, slowly moving back and forth, toward the shore, toward the open sea, but just a foot or so in each direction.\n\nGoing with the Flow\n\nI stopped fighting, became part of the swirling melody, as the fish and I and the sea rocked back and forth for a while. Boundaries disappeared; we were one. As I lazily allowed the ocean to hold me, face down, relaxed and continuing to breathing through the snorkel, one group of fish after another came to me. Striped, bright colored, and speckled fish, and, long, thin iridescent blue ones.\n\n\n\nSoon I drifted into deeper water. As began to float out to look for more fish, something made me look back. There they were, almost touching me -- the most striking fish yet, in a rainbow of colors and sizes.\n\nI sensed they were telling me: Let go. Stop trying so hard,\n\nI experienced a keen insight. I wanted to remember it, let it guide me. This is what I realized: I don't have to drive myself so hard to get what I want. I should trust that I will get what I need without knocking myself out. Blessings are in store for me; I just need to allow myself to be present to receive them.\n\n\n\nHelicopter over Maui\n\nAs our time in Maui neared to an end, my husband said he wanted to do something exciting. He suggested that we splurge on a helicopter tour of the island. So up we went, with mufflers on our ears to mute the sound. We viewed the huge Haleakala volcano from above. The pilot bluffed us into thinking we'd crash into a cliff he headed straight for.\n\nAs we held our breaths, at what seemed like the last minute, he took us high enough to clear it for a narrow escape. Okay, he knew what he was doing; his job was to manufacture thrills for tourists. That's fine. He gave us an unforgettable, albeit hair raising, experience.\n\nYour Zest Filled Adventure Can Be Anywhere\n\nYou don't need to go to a far-way place for an adventure on your own or together. It might be trying new sport, arranging a picnic, acting in a play, taking a class, going somewhere new, flying a kite, or any one of a countless possibilities for whatever out of the ordinary experience you're game to try.\n\nBy holding a short, weekly marriage meeting, a gentle, loosely structured conversation with your spouse, as described step by step in Marriage Meetings for Lasting Love, you'll remember to keep arranging for for out of the ordinary activities and adventures to do on your own and as a couple.
There will be adversity in leaving or being left in a marriage, but I believe that a woman who thrives in a post-divorce world charts her own path. She let's that path reveal itself to her and rises up to the journey fearlessly. She connects loves herself in all of her imperfection and surrounds herself with savvy people.\n\nThis time in her life is about taking her from simply surviving.....to thriving. She is capable and deserving of an amazing life. She is capable of seeing the light of day and never feeling held down by something that is out of her control.\n\nPost-divorce is a time of redefining her Big Life Mission. Positive, lasting change occurs when we make a choice to love ourselves, embrace the imperfectness of our human form and go forth fearlessly anyway.\n\nStep one\n\nGround zero\n\nThe restart button\n\nWhatever you want to call it ALWAYS starts with her.\n\nWomen are famous for martyring themselves and being the sacrificial lamb to everyone else's needs before their own. And when they have to start over, when a marriage fails....that mindset of lamb mourns the loss of that title.\n\nIt's an identity crisis!\n\nWife, mom, care giver -- what does she do now? Who the hell IS she?\n\nIn starting over from a place of not being overwhelmed by this massive change---her soul identity is the only title she needs concern herself with.\n\nThat is her soul's purpose, her calling, her Big Life Mission.\n\nDive deep into that place and the answers always come. If you are there...... post-divorce.... needing clarity as to what your Big Life Mission is....or simply stuck in a place that keeps you going back to the shouldas like it's a blankie.....now is a very important time to reflect.\n\nPart of living a free and fearless life is writing your own happy ending. The story of you, as told by you---and only you can determine how the story goes and the energy that flows into it.\n\nSo what does that energy say?\n\nDo you sabotage your own progress or do you cast fear aside for a better beginning? Do you live for you, today and every day---no apologies no mask no looking back?\n\nNow is a time to let go of your wife title. Realize that the label is not who you are at your core. It's the loss of an identity not the death of your soul. You are so much more than that. You are a person with hopes, desires and dreams, right? I realize that some of that ambition may have been set aside during your marriage.\n\nI have been there and I didn't think I would say I don't one day either.\n\nStarting over can be a frustrating and dark place. Firstly, you need to set the intention to take care of YOU first. This helps you to go a little easier on yourself and nourish your soul while you lick your wounds.\n\nThen think about what lights you up and how you can use that as a catalyst in your post-divorce world. What are you passionate about? Those passions or long forgot hobbies could be a new business idea or a way to make amazing friends. You could turn it into a blog or better yet, your battle cry.\n\nLastly, be a goal digger. Write it out and own how it feels to be capable and deserving of attaining all that you desire. If any doubt surfaces when putting it on paper, stop and write three to five reasons why your doubt is untrue. Keep in mind the energy you are putting into these words. Think bigger than you have ever thought before and infuse that piece of paper with the audacity to picture an outcome beyond anything you have ever imagined. Be daring and willing to challenge you. Be fearless and free!
Scholastic publishers evidently thought United States school children needed a new picture book to help them celebrate George Washington's birthday. Unfortunately the book also seems to celebrate slavery in the United States and has now been recalled. The book is narrated by an enslaved African young girl named Delia. Images show happy slaves baking George Washington a birthday cake. One panel announces that Hercules, a slave, takes great pride in baking the president's cake. But this year there is one problem -- they are out of sugar. But evidently that was not the only problem in the new nation.\n\nAccording to the book's author, the story was intended to shed light on the complex and varied nature of enslaved existence including enslaved people who had a better quality of life than others and 'close' relationships with those who enslaved them.\n\nActually George Washington's relationship to slavery was not that complex and illustrates have deeply imbedded the slave system was in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Mount Vernon website, Washington became a slaveholder at the age of eleven when his father died. By the time George Washington died in 1799, the enslaved population on his Mount Vernon planation included 318 people, 123 who were owned by Washington himself and the rest who were part of the estate of his wife's children from a previous marriage. Instead of freeing the people he claimed to own in his will, Washington transferred ownership to his wife. Some of these people were freed in 1801.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, George Washington refused to enlist enslaved Africans who wanted to secure their freedom by joining the Revolutionary army and at the end of the war he sent a letter to British commanders demanding that they return formerly enslaved Africans who were freed when they escaped to the British lines. Washington objected to British plans to evacuate formerly enslaved Africans as a violation of the provisional peace agreement and sought to find and reacquire people he claimed as his own property.\n\nSlavery was illegal in Philadelphia while it was the national capital in the 1790s. Enslaved Africans brought to Pennsylvania would officially be free after six months in the state. To evade the law, Washington rotated enslaved Africans back to his Virginia planation before that would have to be emancipated. Apparently Hercules so enjoyed being enslaved by George Washington that he later escaped to freedom. When Hercules escaped bondage in 1797 Washington wrote a letter to his personal secretary Tobias Lear where he demanded Lear assist in Hercules' capture. After discussing new carpets, furniture, pots, and pans, Washington requested that Lear desire Mr. Kitt to make all the enquiry he can after Hercules, and send him round in the Vessel if he can be discovered & apprehended.\n\nMartha Washington's personal servant also escaped while the family was in Philadelphia. According to a runaway slave ad posted in the Pennsylvania Gazette, Absconded from the household of the President of the United states, Oney Judge, a light mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy black hair, she is of middle stature, slender, and delicately formed, about 20 years of age . . . it is probable she will attempt to pass for a free woman . . . Ten dollars will be paid to any person who will bring her home, if taken in the city, or on board any vessel in the harbor; - and a reasonable additional sum if apprehended at, and brought from a greater distance . . . \n\nUpon learning that Judge had escaped to New Hampshire, Washington wrote officials there demanding her return because it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness. Judge was interviewed by abolitionists in 1845 while living in New Hampshire. She explained, Whilst they were packing up to go to Virginia, I was packing to go, I didn't know where; for I knew that if I went back to Virginia, I should never get my liberty.\n\nThese stories about George Washington and slavery would have been a more important history lesson for students.
For BRIDES, by Sherry Amatenstein, LCSW.\n\nBruno Gaget\n\nProposal are always emotional, and when you add in the beach, a beautiful life commitment, and well-thought-out situations, it doesn't get much better than that. Here, nine brides are getting real about how they proposed to their girlfriends. Diamond rings, sunsets and parental blessings — enjoy the romantic stories below!\n\nI did it the old-fashioned way, asking the parents of my darling Alicia for her hand in marriage. The actual proposing took place in the midst of a party. Most of the people in attendance, even dad, cried with happiness. —Luci\n\nWe'd been living together for 10 years and already felt married. As soon as Prop 8 was struck down by the Supreme Court I turned to Jane and said, 'Will you make me the happiest woman in the world and become my wife?' She said yes and we made it legal the next day. —Ann\n\nSee More: The 50 Most Beautiful Wedding Cakes Ever\n\nEva was and is a traditionalist so I bought a diamond ring. Since she's a light sleeper I slipped it on her finger in the middle of the night. When we woke up, I asked her to marry me, she saw the ring and, well, we got right down to celebrating! —Lynn\n\nWhile walking on the beach at Big Sur at sunset I got down on one knee and popped the question. The only thing that threatened to mar the magic moment was we were standing really close to the surf and the ring nearly got swept into the ocean by the high tide. —Tami\n\nI'm a singer who plays at local clubs and Jill is usually front and center when I perform. So I wrote a special song proposal and sang it in front of a SRO crowd made up mostly of friends and family who were in on the secret. —Paula\n\nIt was April in Paris and I popped the question atop the Arc de Triomphe with the Champs Elysees at our feet. I tried to time it so that Beth said 'yes' right before the Eiffel Tower started sparkling with gorgeous evening lights. —Jody\n\nWhen we became domestic partners Lisa and I exchanged rings, and when we were legally able to marry we used the same rings engraved with our wedding date! —Gaby\n\nSee More: The Biggest Fall Wedding Dress Trends from Bridal Fashion Week\n\nPart of our celebration over the Supreme Court ruling was discussing who wanted to be the proposer and who wanted to be the recipient of said proposal. Happily I wanted to ask and Em wanted to be asked. I just didn't tell Em when the proposal was coming, and popped the question a month later on the anniversary of when we met. —Jill\n\nIt was so thrilling to be able to have our love publicly sanctioned so I proposed at Yankee stadium — arranging beforehand for the stadium's jumbo size screen to declare my love in front of thousands. Everyone cheered, even the ball players. The Yankees lost that night but who cared? I'd won what mattered. —Ellen\n\nSherry Amatenstein, LCSW is a New York City-based marriage therapist and author.\n\nMore From BRIDES:
Khloe Kardashian is talking about expanding her family with Tristan Thompson.\n\nIn a preview clip from the upcoming season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the Good American founder sits down with Thompson — her on-again-off-again boyfriend and the father of her daughter, True — to discuss having another child.\n\nKardashian tells the NBA star that every time she posts a video of True, her sister Kim messages her to say, She can't play by herself her whole life.\n\nIn my head, when I was going to have kids, I never ever imagined having an only child, the 36-year-old says, adding that during COVID-19 quarantine, True had no friends.\n\nLooks like the Kardashian fam might be getting a little bigger…KoKo is ready for baby #2! 👶 🍼 See more when #KUWTK returns for the final season March 18th on @eentertainment! pic.twitter.com/e2wWU80yrQ — Kardashians on E! (@KUWTK) February 4, 2021\n\nShe then declares that she feels it's now time to have another kid, which Thompson enthusiastically agrees with, saying he's all for it.\n\nThe star of the reality show stresses that she's unclear how long it could take for her to conceive again, but she already started the process a couple months ago when I froze my eggs.\n\nWe have to like line it up with your schedule. So, I can make embryos with my frozen eggs, she told Thompson.\n\nKardashian has been vocal in the past about her struggles with fertility, sharing with fans that she and ex-husband Lamar Odom had repeatedly tried for children during their marriage.\n\nIn 2017, Kardashian even visited fertility specialist Andy Huang during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. He told her that there were fewer follicles than I anticipate for a normal 32-year-old.\n\nThis is definitely not at all how I thought this appointment was going to go, Kardashian said at the time. What if I can't get pregnant?\n\nLess than a year later, though, Kardashian happily gave birth to daughter True, who will celebrate her third birthday in April.
JGI/Jamie Grill via Getty Images I love the dress. Your fiancé? Not so much.\n\nFriends don't let friends marry total jerks. But what if speaking up about the engagement ends up costing you the friendship?\n\nOutside of being that person who shouts I object! mid-ceremony, it's hard to know how to handle the situation. Is it ever OK to voice your reservations earlier on ― or is that bound to lead to a best friend breakup?\n\nWe've got answers for you. Below, friendship and etiquette experts share their best advice on broaching the subject before the Big Day.\n\n1. Remember: Your friend is marrying this person, not you.\n\nYou may find your friend's fiancé's habit of mansplaning insufferable. She might chalk it up to him being opinionated, one of the the qualities that initially drew her to him.\n\nThe reality is, you're not going to have to put up with this guy till death do you part (or until the divorce) ― your friend is. Keep that firmly in mind before speaking up, said Irene S. Levine, a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and the author of Best Friends Forever: Surviving a Breakup with Your Best Friend.\n\nWhat may not look good to you, as an outsider, might be very gratifying to your friend. Their needs and values may not be the same as yours, she said. Allow for the possibility that you've misjudged the partner. Give yourself and your friend the gift of time; try to get to know him better.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that you need to say something if the relationship is a threat to your friend's health or well-being for any reason.\n\n2. Try to have the conversation as early as possible.\n\nTiming is everything here. If you really feel compelled to voice your concerns, do so before any serious wedding planning is underway, etiquette expert Amber Harrison told HuffPost.\n\nAn already difficult situation becomes nearly impossible once a venue has been booked, invitations mailed and a dress bought and altered, she said. Even better? If your friend is getting serious with someone you feel isn't a good match and you think a proposal is imminent, have this conversation before the engagement.\n\n3. If your friend hints at having reservations, use that as a jumping off point for a conversation.\n\nIdeally, your friend has voiced some concerns over the state of the relationship on their own. In that case, follow their lead and say you've noticed they've been stressed, said Anne Chertoff, a wedding trend expert at WeddingWire.\n\nMaybe they'll tell you they're having second thoughts, Chertoff said. But it's important to ask an open-ended question to get them talking. If a friend is voicing their own concerns, indirectly or directly, it's your job to let them know you're there for them.\n\n4. Don't come at them with a laundry list of reasons they shouldn't get married.\n\nIf you do move forward with the conversation, have a very short list of reasons why their fiancé is wrong for them, Harrison said.\n\nI'd say have one to three points, the more specific the better, she said. Your concerns won't be heard if you unload a laundry list of complaints about their partner. Stay on topic and remember that the things you say can't be unsaid.\n\n5. Don't bash the other person during the conversation.\n\nChoose your words carefully. Harshly criticizing the relationship or your friend's partner is going to put your friend on the defensive, Chertoff said.\n\nAgain, the best approach to take is saying you've noticed their behavior has changed and want to know if everything's OK or if something is bothering them, she said. Make it clear that you are there to listen and be supportive.\n\n6. Accept that your friendship may take a hit.\n\nIf your friend knows that you think their soon-to-be-spouse isn't up to par, they may distance themselves from you, especially once they're married, Harrison said.\n\nUnfortunately, this conversation goes wrong more often than it goes right, and the friendship almost always suffers, she said. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is to love and support your friend unconditionally, especially if you believe they have a hard road ahead. They are going to need you!\n\n7. Above all else, listen to your friend.\n\nGive your friend some credit: There's a high chance they've already considered and worked through the issues you plan to bring up. In the end, this should be a two-way conversation, not a chance for you to lecture your friend on their faulty decision-making.
Key leaders within the United Methodist Church have announced an agreement outlining how America's third-largest religious denomination will split over the issue of LGBTQ inclusion.\n\nThe UMC's traditionalist wing, which has steadfastly refused to ordain or preside over the marriages of LGBTQ parishioners, will split off and form a new denomination, according to a proposal published on Friday. According to the proposal, the conservatives would leave with $25 million and their local church properties.\n\nThe planned schism would allow the remaining churches to reconvene at a later date and potentially remove controversial language from the church's rulebook that claims the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching. LGBTQ Methodists and their allies have long argued that this language is harmful.\n\nPat Greenhouse /Boston Globe via Getty Images Stoles intended for those with a calling to the ordained ministry at Old West Church in Boston on March 24, 2019. The congregation is part of the Reconciling Ministries Network, which means it has pledged to be LGBTQ-affirming.\n\nThe agreement was reached by a 16-member group composed of representatives from different factions of the UMC, including the conservative Wesley Covenant Association and the LGBTQ-affirming Reconciling Ministries Network. Bishops from the U.S., Africa, Europe and the Philippines participated. Kenneth Feinberg, a mediation lawyer who helped oversee victims' compensation funds after 9/11, was brought in as an outsider to help the leaders reach a deal.\n\nThe proposal, officially called the Protocol of Reconciliation & Grace Through Separation, still needs to be approved by delegates to the UMC's General Conference, which is scheduled to take place in Minneapolis in May.\n\nThe Wesley Covenant Association has already taken steps to form the new denomination, including drafting a book of doctrines. WCA president Rev. Keith Boyette, who participated in the mediation, said that conservatives in the UMC have long felt the church's theological divisions were irreparable.\n\nI believe this is a fair and equitable solution that puts decades of conflict behind us and gives us a hopeful future, Boyette told UMNews.\n\nThe agreement leaves open the possibility of multiple additional Methodist denominations forming.\n\nPat Greenhouse / Boston Globe via Getty Images United Methodist Church minister Rev. Jordan Harris (right) and his partner Nathaniel Devarie are married at the Old West Church in Boston on Oct. 12, 2019.\n\nThe UMC has about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the U.S., where the denomination has its own universities, a publishing house and other ministries. American Methodists also hold a wide spectrum of political views: Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren identifies as Methodist, as does former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nOther mainline Protestant movements in the U.S. ― the Anglican and Presbyterian traditions, for example ― have experienced schisms over the ordination and marriage of LGBTQ members, as well as over the ordination of women.\n\nAfter years of grappling with the possibility of a schism over the welcoming of queer Christians, the UMC's General Conference voted last year to affirm existing church doctrine prohibiting same-sex marriage and the ordination of queer clergy and to impose harsher penalties on clergy who break the rules. Queer Methodists and their allies were deeply disappointed by the vote and immediately began seeking a new way forward.\n\nPortland Press Herald via Getty Images Rev. Sara Ewing-Merrill (center) leads Sunday service at HopeGateWay church in Portland, Maine, on March 3, 2019. HopeGateWay is part of the Reconciling Ministries Network.\n\nThe harsher restrictions on clergy went into effect on Jan. 1, but Friday's agreement states that complaints against clergy members would be temporarily suspended until after the traditionalists leave the UMC.\n\nJ.J. Warren, a lifelong Methodist who is queer, delivered a passionate speech at last year's conference about his desire to become a UMC pastor. If the new protocol is adopted by the next General Conference, it would clear the way for him to become ordained.\n\nWarren told HuffPost that he was hoping the global church could remain united, but if that goal is unobtainable, this protocol is the next best thing.\n\nThe protocol has the potential to unshackle the church from our decades of infighting and allow us to seek justice for queer people, people of color, and to correct our neocolonial US-centric governance structure, Warren wrote in an email.\n\nGay babies will be born in whatever church(es) we create—including the 'traditional' branches, he added. The work of full inclusion, like continuing to dismantle white supremacy, will last for decades, but this Protocol would allow the broader UMC to come to terms with, repent, and reform toward justice.
Many little girls often daydream of walking down the aisle on the most joyous day of their life -- their wedding day. Heart racing, a nervous smile plastered across her glowing face, never once thinking that the man she's walking towards is hiding a secret that he's too afraid to share.\n\nMany young men envision meeting their soulmate, sharing their life with the person of their dreams, having a family, and living the life that's expected of them - married to a beautiful woman and being a supportive husband and father. Yet some men are torn apart inside by the secret they keep that leads to heart-wrenching guilt, shame, and fear of failing everyone they know.\n\nRegardless of the scenario, whether it's a man or a woman hiding their secret, at some point, the pain of pretending to be someone they're not becomes greater than the transparent truth of living and being who they're meant to be.\n\nIn that moment, all the years of love, parenting, and life-building are diminished to a rubble of memories. Tortured wails of How could you do this to me? by an unsuspecting spouse are just the tip of the betrayal iceberg that sinks the life once known by all concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, many couples in a mixed orientation marriage bravely join forces, standing tall in love, vowing to get support for overcoming the wicked temptation of same-sex attraction. Prayer, therapy, retreats, hard work, and tear-stained conversations litter the landscape of a marriage in defense mode, all in the name of make it work, just make it work! However, even the most resolute attempts to stay afloat in the life ring of Until death do us part, find many couples surrendering to the truth that fixing the same-sex attraction, or fixing it enough, as Matt, the husband you're about to meet, said in his TEDx talk, isn't going to happen. To quell the truth of a spouse embittered in their own internal tug of war with who they are vs. who the rest of the world expects them to be is practically a death sentence in and of itself.\n\nWhile both in-the-know spouses may give a mixed orientation marriage a fair shake, many are faced with the harsh reality, that denying the truth of the same-sex attraction only leads to deeper levels of guilt, shame, anxiety, depression, and more often than not ugly embittered relationships that lead to divorce. Matt and Luanne Nightingale are trying to walk the road less traveled, one of gratitude and hope, for unraveling their 25-year relationship.\n\nGranted, it's a common, and a completely acceptable, rationale human emotion to want to lash out, be angry, and desire the betrayer, pay, pay, pay for the lies they've laden into a 23-year marriage, that never really was the storybook version of the storybook marriage they thought they were living. However, by changing perspectives a little and dramatic shifts of thought, one begins to see the beauty of diversity, if one chooses to do so.\n\nEven though the wounds are still freshly cut, and like many heterosexual spouses Luanne is getting the raw end of the deal (a justifiable feeling that most heterosexual spouses feel) by having her little-girl dreams of happily ever after shattered, the question remains, Why me, why now, why to begin with? As understanding, compassionate, and loving as she can be, it doesn't take away the gut-wrenching blow to the heart, self-esteem, and trust that Luanne built in her marriage to the man that she loved.\n\nWhen faced with the harsh truth, Luanne and Matt faced eerily similar circumstances and questions that thousands of other same-sex couples caught in this mixed-orientation marriage turmoil have faced. Heart-wrenching questions like, Do we try to make this work? or How do we undo the damage, un-tell the lies? and the ever so popular, What does the future hold for either of us, our kids, our family? Yet, they found a path.\n\nThrough open, honest, transparent communication, Matt and Luanne have chosen to accept the truth of Matt's same-sex attraction - him a little more easily, her a little more painfully. Leaning into their relationship built on love, respect, support and brutal honesty, they're now, in their own words, Trying to do this well. That being, creating an environment for themselves and their children where the family thrives rather than survives as their marriage unravels - she as a single, pained and saddened heterosexual mother; he as a single, excited yet sorrowful, gay father.\n\nWhile brutal honesty and truth often slice deep into the jugular of life, transparency for being known for who you are is a blessing that eradicates guilt, shame, and self-loathing, opening one's self, and hopefully others to the light of living truth for truth's sake. In the light of Matt's truth, his real truth, he and Luanne are building a new foundation that embraces the reality that who you are is who you are, even though at times it hurts and brings up anger and confusion. However, both Matt and Luanne have found that any attempt to fight your truth only compounds the darkness, hurt, and pain -- which in turn, eventually, manifests as a person living a pretend life and having pretend relationships.\n\nOn Saturday, November 6, 2016 Matt and Luanne bravely, both in their own unique way, took the stage at TEDx Sonoma County to share their story, their journey, and their truth -- a truth that demonstrates with respect, support, honesty, and a deep dive into forgiveness and understanding that both of them are trying to navigate the waters of unraveling a marriage of deception and lies, with dignity and love.\n\nSelecting gratitude and hope as their guideposts, Matt and Luanne's TEDx talk demonstrates their ability to find common ground in what could easily be a chaotic war of love gone wrong. Yes. This is their path of choice, but it does beg the question, What's possible when gratitude and hope are chosen over bitterness and you-done-me wrong thoughts?
Astarot via Getty Images\n\nYou've made a new friend at work, and the two of you are basically inseparable. You swing by each other's desks, grab lunch together and text back and forth after hours. Maybe you've even felt a flirtatious spark, but you've kept things completely platonic.\n\nSure, your friendship seems harmless enough. Unfortunately, your partner may not see things the same way. Affairs of the heart aren't always physical, and it's possible you're crossing the line into emotional infidelity.\n\nHere, marriage therapists explain the warning signs that you might be slipping out of a friendship and into something more.\n\n1. You're spending time together outside of work.\n\nIt may seem like a friendly work happy hour, but spending time with a coworker outside of the office can blur the lines of your friendship.\n\nMost people have emotional affairs with someone they work with or spend a lot of time with, said Alicia H. Clark, a therapist in Washington, D.C. It just so happens that this person turns out to be a really good friend. But a friend can turn into something more when your spouse isn't your number one anymore.\n\n2. You can't wait until the next time you see each other.\n\nHow do you feel when you think about seeing that person again? If you can't contain your excitement, that may be a major red flag.\n\nYou literally count down the hours or days, said Caroline Madden, a marriage therapist in Burbank, California. When you text or Facebook [message] that person, you check a million times to see if they replied.\n\n3. You're having fantasies about that person.\n\nIf you're beginning to daydream about that other person, or even see them in your dreams at night, your subconscious may be trying to tell you something.\n\nThe biggest warning sign is when you start having intimate fantasies about that person, Clark told The Huffington Post. That to me is the number one. In my view, you're already kind of hooked. When you have your first dream about that person, that is usually a very powerful sign.\n\n4. When something important happens, you think of telling your special friend before your partner.\n\nDid you get a promotion? Maybe you won your office fantasy football league, or beat your personal record at the gym. Who do you want to tell first ― your friend, or your spouse?\n\nWhen you start telling that person things you wouldn't tell your spouse, or you think about telling that person when something good happens, that's not great a sign, Clark said. That's an indication of closeness and that you're both very important people to each other.\n\n5. You are hiding the relationship from your partner.\n\nA very basic litmus test for determining whether you've crossed the line is asking yourself if you would tell your partner about your interactions with that friend.\n\nIf you are hiding texts, calls, meetings, conversations, online activity, even your browsing history from your partner, then there's something more about your relationship with that other person, or you'd be open, said Debra Campbell, a psychologist and couples therapist. This is emotional infidelity.\n\n6. You tell that person things only your spouse knows, or worse ― things your spouse doesn't know.\n\nBe wary of divulging too much personal information about yourself or your relationship to this new friend. Ranting about your partner to the other person can create an opening for emotional infidelity.\n\nYou start opening up to your friend about problems in your marriage, Madden said. On the surface this seems okay. You are just trying to get the other gender's point of view, in an effort to help your marriage. But it signals 'I might be married, but I'm not happily married.' Your marriage is vulnerable. You also then give your special friend a list of things that bug you about your spouse so that they can provide you sympathy, but also now know perfectly how to give you what you are missing.\n\n7. If you're wondering if you're having an emotional affair, you've probably already crossed the line.\n\nMadden summed it up this way: Why are you reading this article unless you are already wondering if you are having an emotional affair?\n\nIf you do recognize some of the aforementioned red flags in your recent behavior, there are concrete steps you can take to get yourself back on track in your relationship.\n\nYou're not a bad person for having feelings for another person, Madden said. You can't help your feelings, you can control your behavior. [But] once you recognize you have the 'feels' for someone else, you should stop all one-on-one meetings, lunches, Twitter direct messages, etc. Don't worry about how that person feels. Worry about how your spouse would feel about you cheating.\n\nFor Clark, the solution is simple: go back to your original relationship, roll up your sleeves and get to work.
Mixmike via Getty Images These immature, inconsiderate behaviors could be red flags.\n\nIn any relationship, we all have moments in which we act in selfish ways. But when self-centered, immature or inconsiderate behavior becomes the norm for you, then there's an issue.\n\nTake a break from thinking about yourself for a second and ponder this: Do you ever ask what your partner wants to do over the weekend? Or do you just call all the shots without any regard for their wishes? When you two disagree on something, do you actually listen to what your partner has to say or do you steamroll the conversation?\n\nIf this sounds familiar, there's a good chance you haven't realized that you've been unfair to your partner. Below, experts share the signs that indicate you're probably the selfish one in your relationship.\n\n1. You expect your partner to listen to you vent but you don't offer the same in return.\n\nOne of the best reasons to be in an intimate relationship is that we have someone to tell our troubles to, who will take our side when the world feels harsh. That feeling of being understood and accepted is what intimacy is about. If you become immediately bored, or act like your partner is a drag when he or she starts to tell you about their bad day, it's like slamming an emotional door in their face. Even if your partner doesn't protest, it's still a recipe for loneliness in a relationship. ― Amy Begel, marriage and family therapist\n\n2. You give your partner the silent treatment instead of tackling difficult conversations in a mature way.\n\nIt is self-centered to not make an attempt to communicate when you are hurt or angry at your partner. Tough conversations often come up in a romantic relationship. You put your partner through a lot of distress when you refuse to talk. ― Marni Feuerman, marriage and family therapist\n\n3. You insist that your perspective is the correct one — on everything.\n\nThis is a definite red flag indicating a strong degree of selfishness. If you find yourself always giving weight to only your own point of view, you are setting your relationship up to fail. What you are really saying to your partner is that you are really only in this relationship to get your own needs meet, with little or no consideration for the needs of your partner. If that's the case, you really aren't a partner at all. ― Gary Brown, marriage and family therapist\n\n4. You routinely accuse your partner of being the selfish one in the relationship.\n\nWe can hardly tolerate qualities in others that we don't like about ourselves. Often what we mean when we accuse partners of being selfish is that they're not meeting our selfish preferences. ― Steven Stosny, psychologist\n\n5. You get pissy when your partner makes plans that don't involve you.\n\nThere is no reason to be joined at the hip. It is healthy to have your own interests and balance 'me' time with 'we' time. If you are always making your partner feel guilty for being an individual separate from you, then this is very selfish. ― Feuerman\n\n6. You're overly critical of your partner's friends and family.\n\nOccasionally I see couples where one partner refuses to hang out with the other partner's friends, or belittles them, looks down on them or is otherwise unpleasant toward these friends. This creates a troubling imbalance in the relationship, where one person becomes the arbiter of who's 'in' and who's 'out.' It also implies a sense of superiority on the part of the partner who pronounces him/herself as the judge of high-quality friends. ― Begel\n\n7. You're oblivious to your partner's needs.\n\nI always know there is a quality of deadness in a couple who comes for therapy where one partner isn't at all worried about pleasing the other person. In a healthy relationship, we're supposed to be aware of what pleases our partner and, at least part of the time, try to accommodate their desires. It's of course always a question of balance: We don't live to please our partner, but we're not indifferent to our partner's needs, wishes, desires. It goes a long way in a relationship when we know our partner is paying attention to what we need, even if it doesn't always work out. ― Begel\n\n8. When you don't get your way, you threaten to end the relationship — even if you don't mean it.
Tom Williams via Getty Images Chad Readler defended some of President Donald Trump's most egregious legal attacks on LGBTQ rights, Muslims, voting rights and health care protections. Now, at 46, he's on the federal bench with a lifetime appointment.\n\nWASHINGTON ― The Senate voted on Wednesday to confirm Chad Readler to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, despite strong opposition from Democrats over his leading role in the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act's protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nThe Senate voted 52-47 to make Readler, 46, a lifetime federal judge. Every member of the chamber's Democratic caucus opposed him with the exception of Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who did not vote. Every Republican but one, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, voted for him.\n\nBut most of the criticisms by Democrats centered on Readler's role as a top attorney and policy advisor for the Justice Department when it declined to defend key provisions of the Affordable Care Act in response to a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general. Readler made the legal argument that protections for pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional. The next day, Trump nominated him to be a federal judge.\n\nCan you imagine the lack of compassion it takes to argue that 130 million Americans, with cancers, respiratory ailments, all the way down to asthma, don't deserve the guarantee of affordable health care? asked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). It's going to be remembered, this vote, for a long time. A long, long time.\n\nCollins, who is up for re-election in 2020, said Readler's attack on Obamacare is why she opposed his confirmation.\n\nRather than defend the law and its protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions ― such as asthma, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease ― Mr. Readler's brief (in the lawsuit) argued that they should be invalidated, she said in a Tuesday statement announcing her opposition to his appointment.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are drastically reshaping the nation's federal courts by filling them up with right-wing ideological judges.\n\nReadler is one of three circuit court nominees who were slated for Senate confirmation votes this week who have commonalities beyond being Trump's picks. They are young, they are right-wing ideologues and they are members of the conservative Federalist Society, which has been driving Trump's judicial selection process by funneling anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ prospective nominees to the White House.\n\nThe Senate voted Tuesday to confirm to the 4th Circuit Allison Jones Rushing, 36, who worked for the anti-LGBTQ group Alliance Defending Freedom and has argued that there were moral and practical reasons for banning same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Senate will vote Thursday to confirm Eric Murphy, 39, to join Readler on the 6th Circuit. Murphy, the state solicitor of Ohio, fought to make it easier to disenfranchise voters. He also filed briefs to the Supreme Court arguing against marriage equality in the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide and against reproductive rights.\n\nThis week's votes are part of a broader effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to dramatically reshape the nation's federal courts while Trump is in the White House. He has made confirmations of conservative judges his top priority.\n\nWith Readler's confirmation, Trump has now gotten 33 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices confirmed. The number of confirmed circuit judges is more than any other president has achieved by this point in his first term, and represents one out of every six seats on those courts.
You weren't particularly sick today. Just a slight cold. You could have gone to school and been just fine. But your sniffles were enough of an excuse to call you out sick from your pre-k class.\n\nI'm sure I could have used the time while you were at school to finish work for our home business or complete the endless chores around the house. I'm sure I could have been very productive.\n\nBut I kept you home today so that I could hold you.\n\nEvery day there's the constant stream of motion that runs our lives. Most days I struggle just to keep my head above water. There's always something that needs to be cleaned, put away, bought, or fixed. There's always a child to shuttle somewhere. I often long for those few hours when I'm alone even though most of that time is spent doing things for others.\n\nBut I kept you home today to talk to you.\n\nThere are many days when I'm irritated with you. There are days when I want to hide in the closet and cry. There are days when your whining drives me completely mad.\n\nBut I kept you home today just to watch you and drink in your angelic face.\n\nThere are so many moments in life that pass us by while we mumble and grumble about not having enough time. And then there are times like today when I feel like you're slipping away too quickly.\n\nScrew school today. I want you here with me. It's just one day. An unexpected but chosen day of having you near, hearing your sweet voice speak to me, and feeling you snuggle up next to me.\n\nYour distinctive smell, your messy hair, and your impish smile are all that I want today.\n\nSoon enough your school days will be longer and our time apart will stretch out farther. In a few years even when you're home, you'll be distracted by friends, homework, or your own interests. And so it will begin. Your flight into the world with your own wings.\n\nSo today I just want to be with you.\n\nI want to freeze time and listen to you play with your ponies, singing songs, and dancing around like some sort of magical sprite. I want to forever be sipping ginger ale together under a blanket (because you get to drink that when you're sick!)\n\nTomorrow you'll go back to school and once again we'll go back to the daily shuffle and routine that is our lives.\n\nBut for today, I'm keeping you home with me.\n\nMore from Michelle: What My Husband Taught Me About Domestic Violence
HuffPost Her Stories is a new series highlighting HuffPost's coverage of women's lives from across our 15 global editions. Sign up for the weekly newsletter here.\n\nDear reader,\n\nThe new year kicked off in India with a major development in the fight over women's access to a famous Hindu temple. Protesters have blocked women of menstruating age from entering Sabarimala since September, when the Supreme Court ruled that all women had a right to enter the sacred space. This week, though, two women managed to slip into the temple in the middle of the night, setting off celebrations and protests.\n\nThe whole country, and especially the state of Kerala, where Sabarimala is located, was taken aback by the news, HuffPost India's Sharanya Hrishikesh said. The temple's priest conducted a 'purification ritual' after the women's entry on Wednesday, there was a violent strike called by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday, and on Friday, even as protests are going on, news broke of a third woman entering the temple to offer prayers — a Sri Lankan national.\n\nHuffPost India reported on the role a Facebook page played in connecting the law professor and grocery store manager currently riling up the country. It also reported on the fascinating about-face most of the original Supreme Court petitioners have made since first pushing for women's access to the temple. Of the five women who originally advocated for equal access, just one still stands by her original views.\n\nThere is still a long way to go — the issue has exposed deep divides within Kerala, and there are many women who have internalized biases and claim they are ready to wait until they reach menopause to visit the temple, Sharanya said. The taboo around menstruation and temple visits will require a lot of work to be undone. But this is a spectacular start to the year in terms of gender equality.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nFor more on Sabarimala, follow @HuffPostIndia, @piyasreedg and @SharanyaHK.\n\nLOLOSTOCK VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe U.K. Foreign Office has been billing women for the cost of their rescue from forced marriages overseas, The Times newspaper reported this week. The office's Forced Marriage Unit, which assists with rescues of British nationals duped or coerced into marriages abroad, has been withholding the passports of survivors who can't pay for their own rescue, the report said. A survivor of forced marriage responded to the news in a blog post for HuffPost U.K. that sheds light on the way some families manipulate their daughters into marrying strange men thousands of miles from home. It's a fascinating read that does credit the Foreign Office for investigating nearly 1,200 forced marriage cases last year. But it also makes clear how the policy uncovered by the Times puts vulnerable women in an even more vulnerable position. These are not victims who had a choice, they didn't go to their local travel agent and book two weeks in the sun, overspending their resources on a jolly and expecting the good old British taxpayer to foot the bill, Jasvinder Sanghera writes. They are victims of crime at the hands of the very people who should have loved and protected them.\n\nReuters\n\nIn case you missed it…
Kate Hudson got candid about her decadeslong estrangement from her birth father Bill Hudson during an appearance on Sunday Today with Willie Geist over the weekend.\n\nI think that estrangement is unfortunately quite common and I think it's important for people to talk about that, the Almost Famous actor told Geist.\n\nYou sometimes need a little bit of talk ― and humor ― to move us into places where we can heal some of the wounds that have affected us, she added.\n\nHudson and her brother, actor Oliver Hudson, were born to Bill Hudson and Goldie Hawn during the couple's marriage, which lasted from 1976 to 1982. After they separated, Kate and Oliver were raised by Hawn and her longtime love, actor Kurt Russell.\n\nThough Hudson said she had a great family, she said the estrangement from her dad is a 41-year-old issue that deeply affects her and her brother.\n\nI have a great family, I have a beautiful mother. I have a stepfather who stepped in and played a huge, huge part in sharing what it is to have a dependable father figure in our life, she said. But it doesn't take away from the fact that we didn't know our dad. And people sometimes just need to hear that they're not alone in that.\n\nHudson and her brother recently opened up about their shared struggles during an episode of the podcast they host together, aptly titled Sibling Revelry. The Music star told her brother she'd been thinking a lot about their father and connecting with their other siblings\n\nI've been thinking about our sisters that we don't spend any time with and our brother — brothers. We've got four siblings we don't spend any time with, she said. I just had this moment of like, it would be nice to connect a little bit, especially with my sisters.\n\nEspecially because [on the podcast] we've been talking so much about sibling relationships and distraught relationships or good relationships, Kate added as her brother laughed.\n\nAnd we're sitting here like, 'We have the best family, we're so great,' and yet we don't ever acknowledge the fact that we have four other siblings. Four! she continued. So I've been thinking a lot about the Hudsons, and thinking that it's important that we reach out to all of our siblings and maybe connect with them a little bit.\n\nVince Bucci via Getty Images Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn, and Kate and Oliver Hudson attend the film premiere of the romantic comedy Raising Helen on May 26, 2004 in Hollywood, California.\n\nOliver spoke about reconnecting with his father after posting a Father's Day Happy abandonment day picture years ago on social media slamming his dad.\n\nThe post made headlines and drew a strong response from Bill Hudson, who called it a a malicious, vicious, premeditated attack and declared Kate and Oliver dead to me now.\n\nBut the Rules of Engagement star said he didn't regret the post (which is still up), because it helped him start speaking with his father again.\n\nAt the end of the day it was a good thing. We're communicating now, Oliver said on Watch What Happens Live in 2015. I had an amazing three-hour conversation with him. We're texting and we're trying to see each other. We might be mending something.
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two gay men have launched separate legal bids to overturn Hong Kong's ban on same-sex marriage, the first time the law has been challenged in court.\n\nThe two men, an activist and a student, argue that the ban on same-sex marriage violates their right to equality under the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution.\n\nThey are asking the government to review and amend the law on marriage, currently defined as between a man and a woman, to the union of two persons, according to their lawyer Hectar Pun.\n\nThe Hong Kong High Court gave permission for the cases to proceed during a preliminary hearing on Thursday. The court will hear a separate case regarding civil union first.\n\nHong Kong has seen a number of lawsuits in recent years over the rights of gay couples, but this is the first legal challenge seeking to legalize same-sex union.\n\nRights group Amnesty International said Hong Kong's refusal to recognize same- sex relationships led to stigma and fueled discrimination and other human rights abuses.\n\nIt is regrettable that further judicial cases need to be brought to force the government to end the discrimination same-sex couples face in all walks of life, its researcher Doriane Lau told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Hong Kong.\n\nSame-sex couples cannot apply for public housing or enjoy their partner's pension benefits, Lau said.\n\nHomosexuality has been decriminalized since 1991 in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The city has an annual pride parade and lively gay scene.\n\nHowever, it does not recognize same-sex marriage. Campaigners say gay and transgender people face widespread discrimination and often come under family pressure to marry and have children.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said in September it would recognize overseas same- sex partnerships when granting dependent visas, after a British lesbian who was denied a spousal visa took it to court and won.\n\nInternational banks and law firms operating in the Asian financial hub have been keen to see visa rules for people in same-sex relationships eased to help attract global talent. Thailand could become the first Asian country to legally recognize same-sex couples under a bill that would allow civil partnerships.\n\nVietnam allows same-sex weddings, but no legal recognition or protection of such unions.\n\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Claire Cozens.

Illustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost; Photos: Handouts\n\nIn India, hair and femininity are inextricable. The trendsetting industries of film and television, firmly in the grip of conservatism, haven't shown much interest in broadening our understanding of femininity ― on or off screen, no A-list actors sport hair that isn't well past their shoulders, and an artfully waved lob is considered radical. Popular fashion designers like Sabyasachi, who premised their careers on challenging conventions of femininity, are now associated with deeply traditional iconography that features women in long, demure hairstyles.\n\nQuick to co-opt this idiom, the makeup and fashion influencer communities mimic these looks with relish. The country's biggest national pageant has been panned for selecting candidates with bizarrely identikit hair.\n\nMiss India contestants. They all have the same hair, and the SAME SKIN COLOUR, and I'm going to hazard a guess that their heights and vital stats will also be similar. So much for India being a 'diverse' country. pic.twitter.com/L4yXG0WvRu — labellagorda (@labellagorda) May 27, 2019\n\nIn ads and in movies, short-haired women are either mouthy tomboys, athletes or staunch careerists. They are almost never mothers or love interests. Short hair is for feminists and intellectuals ― a shrill, frumpy archetype devoid of softness and disinclined to pander.\n\nThe renunciation of hair is acceptable only when sanctioned by religion or custom, not when it is a political statement or an act of self-love. Class and caste readings of hair throw up depressingly predictable themes. For example, when Priyanka Gandhi, scion to the first family of India's oldest political party, cut her hair, she became the subject of fawning press that likened her look to her grandmother's, the first female prime minister of India.\n\nHair diversity is a problem, too. Big banner movies and commercials almost never feature curly haired leads. Curls do not feature in hair product ads and do not get the kind of care they need at most salons, because stylists consider kinky hair difficult. Curly brides seldom wear their natural hair and go pin-straight on their big day; mainstream bridal fashions simply don't factor in curls. All of this underscores a cultural obsession with straight, proper hair. Shockingly, the country has only just begun to wake up to hair diversity.\n\nWe talked to eight Indian women about their fraught experiences with their hair.\n\nPriyanshi Jariwala, Surat, Gujarat (Western India)\n\nCourtesy of Priyanshi Jariwala\n\nJariwala owns a sustainable fashion line that champions a hardy hand-spun fabric with ties to India's freedom movement. Growing up, she struggled with her curls. I wanted to straighten them all the time only to be accepted. I remember a morning from my fourth grade when my teacher asked me if I'd combed my hair enough. She suggested I do it multiple times to get rid of the 'shabby look.'\n\nJariwala has strong feelings about her community's grooming expectations of women, considered attractive only if they are tall, fair, slim and have long hair, even if the man has none on his head. She's glad for a dear friend who was so fed up she cut her hair short to avoid marriage proposals. Women with short hair don't qualify for Daughter-In-Law of the Year, she said.\n\nJariwala believes that women in visual professions, such as modeling, can sometimes pay for asserting their individuality. I know fashion models who lost work because they decided to chop their hair. I think this bias is deeply rooted in the idea that long hair hides the 'less attractive' features, like chubby cheeks and an undefined jawline.\n\nWhen it comes to her own profession, she plays it safe. I work in a creative field where people are more accepting of your choices and appreciate nonconventional haircuts/colors, but I find myself at a crossroads when it comes to a conference or business summit. I do not remember ever leaving my curls open in a meeting. They are either tied in a bun or styled. Then, colored hair signals sexual adventurism and could get women into trouble. Women with crazy hair colors are [believed] to be asking for it, just how they're asking for it when they wear short skirts or tops with deep necklines, she told HuffPost.\n\nDespite comparisons to Maggi noodles, she's found peace with her hair. I think my hair is a representation of my wild and carefree side. People tell me that my hair makes me come across as a warm, approachable individual.\n\nRachana Iyer, Mumbai, Maharashtra (Western India)\n\nShambhavi Asuri\n\nTamil by origin, Iyer is a mental health advocate and heads corporate social responsibility for a private bank. Fair skin and long hair are prized in her community and Iyer wrestled with her wavy curls, first growing them to waist length, then chopping them off to make a political statement.\n\nI felt compelled to challenge the notion that I could look my best only in long hair, Iyer told HuffPost. I went from blunt to pixie and finally a beautiful red faux hawk! I absolutely loved the feeling of buzzing my hair and almost got quite addicted to it. Most people were shocked and upset that I would even take such a drastic step. This made me want to keep cutting my hair. I wanted people to realize how narrow their view of beauty is. People link femininity to having long hair and assume things about you based on its length. Although I do identify as bisexual, most people saw my short hair and called me names like 'butch' or 'tomboy.' They assumed that my sexuality and hair were somehow linked.\n\nIyer doesn't care. She has attended weddings in traditional saris sporting buzzed hair, a vision undoubtedly jarring to her conservative community.\n\nPeople assume you are a 'junkie' or a 'punk' when they see you with a buzz cut. I think coloring longer hair does not evoke the sort of response that coloring shorter hair does. I remember walking into a very popular bank and the lady at the counter openly mocked me to her colleagues and treated me poorly because of my hair. It got so bad that I had to escalate this to the manager. Society, especially women, can be really quick to judge you based on your hair. People also tend to slander a woman's character, and although very subtle, I have personally experienced people thinking I am 'very open,' 'forward thinking.' They have taken the liberty to flirt even when I was clearly not interested.\n\nIyer believes that workplaces aren't hair-inclusive. A lot of companies have a policy about the types of colors allowed on women's hair. Advertising agencies and the entertainment industry are a bit more relaxed, but there are still clear assumptions made based on the length of your hair. Medium or long hair that is straight, not frizzy and not colored, is considered the most professional. Most Indian corporations definitely consider buzz cuts unprofessional. It is assumed that you will not take your work seriously if your hair is fun!\n\nTheyie Keditsu, Kohima, Nagaland (Northeastern India)\n\nKeditsu teaches at a government college and advocates for the revival of traditional indigenous textiles and local artisanship. Nagas (from the northeastern part of India) in general hold long, black and thick hair as the gold standard of feminine beauty. This beauty standard is both a result of racial prevalence and patriarchal notions of femininity, she told HuffPost.\n\nKeditsu's hair journey straddles the personal and the political. I started shaving parts of my hair as a teenager, she said. And then completely when I was 27. And then in parts from 2017 onwards. My parents disliked my latest experiments so much that they even prayed for me! For them, my mohawk was unbecoming of a mother and a responsible working woman. For some others, it clashed with their idea of Naga beauty and femininity. My husband loved it, as did most of my friends. The most recent experiments with my hair were simply a personal quest to explore what being beautiful meant to me. I'd reached a point of self-acceptance ― realizing that hair and other accoutrements of beauty were at once superfluous and vital to one's personhood. With my mohawk, I wanted to challenge ideas of what a mother should look like, and what made a woman my age beautiful. In a very deliberate way, I chose to sport these hairstyles because they expand the idea of what it means to be feminine.\n\nKeditsu would like young women to see hair as a means not an end, not as an extension of oneself or one's sense of worth but as a tool to express one's politics or worth.\n\nNiharika Chugh Vali, Nagpur, Maharashtra (Central India)\n\nCourtesy of Niharika Chugh Vali\n\nBusiness owner Chugh Vali runs a children's play area that encourages experiential learning. Her parents are Punjabi and Parsi, two cultures that value conformity in appearance, so she has only just now leaned into her big, curly hair.\n\nI have worked before as a television news anchor and my hair was always a concern for everyone. It was gelled and tied back most times and when it was left open, it took twice as much time as anyone else to straighten it. The option of enhancing my natural hair or going curly did not exist, she told HuffPost. Like all curly-haired people, I've been advised by stylists and well-wishers to 'do something about it,' to get my hair smoothed or straightened or treated with keratin, as if the sight of my natural hair could hurt someone's eyes, she said.\n\nShame around hair was learned in early childhood. The volume was unmanageable, so it was cut in a short bob. Once I did decide to grow it out, I made sure it was tied back real tight and pinned well so nobody ever had to see what it really looked like, she said.\n\nToday, Chugh Vali credits the Curly Girl Method and Indian actors like Kangana Ranaut and Taapsee Pannu for throwing out notions around curly hair being an inferior hair type. It is also finally leading to a conversation about curly hair, and how its care is so different from the default straight-hair regimen we all follow blindly. Mother to a 7-year-year old, she loves that animated children's heroines like Merida (Brave) and Moana have curly hair.\n\nDaminee Benny Basu, Los Angeles/Kolkata, West Bengal (Eastern India)\n\nBasu is an actor and acting coach and comes from a family of theater veterans. Steeped in the politics of performance and the performance of politics, she's clear-eyed about concepts like beauty.\n\nI grew up in the Bengali community. Bengali culture has so many references to feminine beauty ideals in literature, song and poetry. Like 'Lokkhi-meye,' good girl, referring to Lokkhi, the goddess Lakshmi. It's the typical understanding of girls being pretty ― cascading hair, dark hair like clouds, skin tone like Lakshmi, well behaved, Basu explained to HuffPost. These have been the ultimate paradigms for Bengali girls ― big eyes, beautiful nose, golden complexion.\n\nShe points out that hair has always been weaponized to various ends since the beginning of time. And that even though shearing your mane off feels radical and original, it really isn't. I've seen my friends rebel, do so much with their hair ― turn it into a canvas, turn it into a war zone of self expression the moment they go through a revelation or heartbreak. Aren't these learned behaviors, things we have seen, heard, been around? ... Using hair to protest is rooted in ideas of sexualization and desexualization. It's a power struggle. And it will happen for as long as both genders fight over equality.\n\nBasu has been witness to the friction hair can cause in families. I've seen friends who wanted to get a particular cut or color their hair. But they couldn't, because they were afraid of what their mother-in-law would think. They'd have to discuss it with their husbands, take their permission. I remember asking a friend if her husband would ever think twice before getting a haircut, coloring his hair or joining the gym. Recently one of my closest friends got a really short haircut. She was excited about it, but her brother got pretty upset even though he has absolutely nothing to do with her lifestyle.\n\nPerhaps this is what drew her to Janis Joplin, even as a child. She was my hair icon. I loved her hair because it was big and free. I've never seen a Janis image where she's done something fancy with her hair. It looks free and happy.\n\nNaina Redhu, Gurgaon, Haryana (Northern India)\n\nI don't do salons, said Redhu, a photographer and visual artist who likes cutting her hair herself. The last time I went I asked for a men's hairstylist and told them to shave my head with a trimmer. I said they'd better charge men's prices! I don't think I've seen a lot of 35-year-old women with buzz cuts in India. With mine, I was trying to say that age is just a number.\n\nHer first buzz cut was inspired by a male model she saw on Pinterest. People think you're aggressive if you have short hair ― butch, unfeminine. Which works for me, because they leave me alone, she told HuffPost. She acknowledges that things would be harder if she lived in a smaller town. Surprisingly, she's faced little resistance to her choices in her parents' villages. (Known simultaneously for its gritty, incredible sportswomen and its chauvinistic khaps, an extrajudicial, community-based system of moral policing that punishes women cruelly for their transgressions, Redhu's home state of Haryana is a living dichotomy.) Mostly, people have just been curious, she said. I don't think they've judged me. I think when I was in college it was a little more on the nose because they'd harass you and say things like, 'Oh, are you trying to be a boy?'\n\nShe's gone bald in the past and received unwelcome attention for it. I've had young girls ask me if someone had died. (Tonsuring is a common mourning practice among Hindu men and boys). People have messaged on Instagram or asked me, 'What if it doesn't grow back?!' And it always came from women. I blame things like Bollywood and television and not being guided better as children, she said.\n\nNatasha Noel, Mumbai, Maharashtra (Western India)\n\nCourtesy of Natasha Noel\n\nNoel is a yoga teacher and body positivity activist. In her Malayali culture (Noel's family has origins in the southern state of Kerala), long hair is considered beautiful. So when she first shortened her hair to shoulder length in high school, her father didn't speak to her for a week. She attributes his anger to patriarchal conditioning. I went bald eight months ago and that was pretty wild. Didn't care about the consequences because on this journey of self-love and acceptance, I realized that I was using my hair as protection. I would untie it to take a picture because I believed I looked more 'beautiful' like that. And I didn't want a crutch, so I just did it, she told HuffPost. Some friends said they didn't want to look at me. I said great, thank you, next.\n\nShe hates that shorter cuts signal that it's open season on a woman's sexuality. That she looks like a boy. That her femininity is in her hair and that that's what makes her a woman. This is bullshit. A woman is whoever she wants to be.\n\nToday, Noel feels liberated after consciously refusing to feed her hair anxieties. Once I relaxed my obsession with my hair, I realized that beauty is on the inside. When I think of what I can do with my body and how I have inspired so many people and changed their lives, l realize my worth.\n\nGhazal Qadri, Baltimore/Jammu & Kashmir (Northern India)\n\nQadri, an illustrator from Kashmir, was considered a tomboy for rejecting girly pursuits. When the girls were busy wearing makeup, I played with trash or drew on my notepad. It was my mom who cared about my hair.\n\nWhen she was little, her mother had her hair cut in a short bob for convenience. Baby Ghazal would tie a black cloth to the back of her head and pretend it was a ponytail. Today, to her mother's frustration, Qadri has decided she wants it short all the time. As it is, her faith endorses modesty in attire ― women are expected to cover their hair and not keep it short. She's received unpleasantness from relatives on occasion. When I leave my hair half-open they consider it indecent, she said. But it doesn't matter much to me what others think of me or my hairstyle. I trust my parents' wisdom and guidance on what's proper.
Until I became widowed two months ago, I thought death was a finality. After it happened, I would have the time and space to mourn. I've since learned that death is actually followed by a long web of subscriptions, billing services and other minutia ― along with a series of arguments with customer service professionals reading from scripts.\n\nUnraveling my husband's life has been a complicated problem, primarily for one reason: His passwords were not in his important papers file.\n\nAs a result, my access to his personal accounts is limited, and depending on the company with which I'm dealing, the malarky of what passes for customer service is off the charts.\n\nTake for example his cell phone carrier, a global company with 40,000 employees, none of whom apparently work on weekends. They won't stop billing me for his phone service because I can't get into his account to cancel it. I don't know his password.\n\nAnd I can't override the password with his account's security question ― the first name of his first childhood friend. Vic was 81 when he died ― I feel safe suspecting that he probably wouldn't have remembered this name either.\n\nRecently, a customer service rep offered me this option: Drive to a company store to authenticate my husband's account, bring his driver's license, Social Security number, death certificate and our marriage license. For real. Oh, and then call him back because I clearly must have plenty of time on my hands. Mind you, they are still billing my credit card while giving me the run-around.\n\nDeath certificates are the key to the universe.\n\nThe root of dealing with all post-death matters is having a copy of a certified death certificate. You can do nothing without one. The best advice anyone gave me was to order multiple copies because everyone, including the gas company, wants one.\n\nGetting a death certificate, at least in Los Angeles, is best accomplished by rising before dawn, taking a day off work and going in person with plenty of quarters for the parking meter. And don't forget to bring your own pen; things are a little tight at our government offices these days.\n\nOnce armed with copies of my husband's death certificate, I set out to move all his accounts into my name and square away the mountain of paperwork that comes with the end of life. And while it's certainly been a journey of discovery ― we've been spending how much on premium cable so he could watch Cubs games from Los Angeles? ― it has pitted me against more than one instance of corporate absurdity.\n\nCustomer service is a contradiction of terms.\n\nTake for example the bank that wouldn't switch our account notifications to my email from his. We have banked with them for decades and all our accounts are jointly held with survivor rights. Even worse, the bank has his cell phone number on file ― yes, the one I hope to get rid of.\n\nThe cable company, usually the boogeyman of the utility companies we deal with, turned out to be not-so-bad. I just had to threaten to not pay them if they didn't switch the name on the account. Ditto for the propane company.\n\nCredit cards are generally pretty happy to remove names. The mail-order pharmacy, not so much, especially when automatic refills are involved. Eventually, every automatic refill will outlive its subscriber and medications aren't returnable. Who wins in this scenario?\n\nCar insurance, his driver's license, his Social Security and Medicare, his magazine subscriptions and his airline miles ― flash that death certificate and you are good to go.\n\nBut the ability to cancel his cell phone service? That one remains elusive.\n\nWidowhood is not for the weak. One minute, you're fine and the next you're a raving lunatic. You curse your dead spouse when you have a flat tire, when you just don't have the energy to drive your kid to the school bus stop and no one else is around to help. It can feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders and you just want one thing ― just one ― to be easy. Like, you know, canceling a cell phone plan.
How can couples avoid the pitfalls that prevent the success of a second marriage? The key ingredients to a successful remarriage are selecting a partner who is a good match for you and both partners willingness to work through the inevitable hard times of marriage. With courage and persistence, you can defy the statistics that say your second marriage is doomed to fail and enjoy long-lasting love.\n\nIt's normal to feel disillusioned about marriage if you've endured a divorce and gone through emotional pain and perhaps some financial loss. Then there's the available census data telling us that second marriages have a 65% divorce rate compared to 50% for first time marriages.\n\nBut in spite of these facts, you might decide that you're up for the challenge that comes with a second marriage. However, it's key to pause and examine what went wrong in your first marriage – and create a vision for a successful second one.\n\nJanette put it like this I've learned that marriage is a work in progress and that you get out of it what you put in. I feel very connected with my husband and we're working hard at keeping that connection.\n\nJanette and Todd have been remarried for seventeen years and each have two children (now grown) from their first marriages. It wasn't always easy to blend their four children and they dealt with rivalries between their children. Todd's daughter never really warmed up to Janette and rarely visits them.\n\nTruth be told, working as a team and creating a second marriage built on a foundation of tolerance, respect, and dedication to each other are essential to a lifetime of love. Todd says We are a team and work together for the happiness of the entire family. We have mutual respect for each other and we know that we will be there for each other through all of the ups and downs.\n\nCreate a New Vision for Your Remarriage\n\nCreating a positive vision for remarriage is an important first step to making your second marriage a success. Everyone has baggage that can cause them to sabotage a new relationship if they haven't healed and worked through the issues that contributed to the demise of their first marriage.\n\nAdd to that baggage from your first marriage is the realization that there are often a lot more players in a second marriage, such as kids from former spouses, stepkids and sometimes even new kids from this union.\n\nTaking your time to decide the kind of marriage that would work for you can be a silver lining to divorce because you'll be more likely to go into your second marriage with realistic expectations. And the fact of the matter is that you can create a happy second marriage if you give yourself permission to be vulnerable and take risks.\n\n10 reasons second marriages are better:\n\nYou have a clearer vision about what you want from a relationship. Divorce has taught you what relationship dynamic promotes your best self. A second marriage is an opportunity to approach commitment with your eyes wide open.\n\nYou are making a decision based on strength and choice rather than fear of being alone. For instance, you may have felt a nagging doubt about tying the knot with your ex-spouse, but proceeded anyway due to feelings of obligation or fear of being alone.\n\nYou've learned to take responsibility for your part in the conflict or dispute. One person's ability to do this can change the dynamic of the relationship. Drs. Julie and John Gottman write: one person's response will literally change the brain waves of the other person. Apologize to your partner when appropriate. This will validate their feelings and promote forgiveness and allow you both to move on. Love is not enough. Saying you're sorry can heal a wound even when you didn't hurt your partner's feelings intentionally. Resentment builds over time if couples aren't able to talk about hurt feelings that arise from unresolved grievances.\n\nYou are smarter about love. Since you've learned from the past, you're less likely to repeat it. And you've learned to separate the past from the present and have begun to live in the present. Therapy and/or keeping a journal can help you achieve these objectives.\n\nYou can allow yourself to take risks and be vulnerable with your partner. Healthy relationships don't come without risk – so you freely extend to trust to your partner by expressing your thoughts, feelings, and wishes. Since you no longer have to walk on eggshells, you feel more relaxed on a daily basis.\n\nYou've learned the value of having realistic expectations about a spouse. Your partner is not going to change. In other words, you can't change a cat into a dog. Love just isn't enough to significantly alter a person's basic nature and upbringing. For instance, if you fall in love with someone who is reserved and you need outward signs of affection to feel secure, you'll feel chronically dissatisfied. Most likely, these differences will probably erode loving feelings over time and diminish positive interactions in your relationship.\n\nRather than trying to fix' your partner, you focus on improving your own life. Many individuals focus on changing their partner and avoid dealing with their own issues. Rather than investing your energy into fixing your partner, you've made a commitment to improve some of your undesirable traits – since we're all flawed in some way.\n\nYou've learned to communicate honestly about key issues in your relationship. Sweeping things under the rug usually doesn't reap good results. In your second marriage, you make sure to be forthcoming about your concerns and express thoughts, feelings, and wishes in a respectful way. Challenging your beliefs and self-defeating thoughts help you to let go of hurt feelings. When we listen to our partner's side of the story and process it briefly with them, we no longer need to hold onto hurt feelings.\n\nYou practice forgiveness on a daily basis. As a result, you apologize to your partner when appropriate and accept his or her apologies. This validates their feelings and promotes good will. Forgiveness is not the same as condoning the hurt done to you but it will allow you to move on.\n\nYou're confident about your choice in a partner and your desire for a life partner comes from a place of strength rather than neediness. You've discovered that marriage will never be your sole source of happiness so you pursue your dreams to the best of your ability. However, you're dedicated to your partner and have an optimistic long-term view of your marriage.\n\nThe best way to beat the odds and see your remarriage succeed is to risk being vulnerable with your partner and create a positive vision for your second marriage. Determination, respect, acceptance, and tolerance will greatly improve your chances of success in a second marriage.

Scarlett Johansson's recent comments on relationships aren't getting lost in translation.\n\nIn a new interview with Playboy posted Tuesday, the actress opens up about marriage, explaining that she doesn't think it's natural to be a monogamous person.\n\nI might be skewered for that, but I think it's work. It's a lot of work. And the fact that it is such work for so many people — for everyone — the fact of that proves that it is not a natural thing, she added. It's something I have a lot of respect for and have participated in, but I think it definitely goes against some instinct to look beyond.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Scarlett Johansson and Romain Dauriac at the opening of the Yummy Pop gourmet popcorn shop in the Marais district of Paris on October 22, 2016.\n\nWhile the interview appears to have been conducted before reports of Johansson's split from her second husband, Romain Dauriac ― with whom she has a 2-year-old daughter ― the Ghost in the Shell actress was asked to comment on marriages that don't work out.\n\nI think marriage initially involves a lot of people who have nothing to do with your relationship, because it's a legally binding contract, and that has a weight to it, she answered. Being married is different than not being married, and anybody who tells you that it's the same is lying.\n\nJohansson, who finalized her divorce from actor Ryan Reynolds in 2011, called marriage a beautiful responsibility, but it's a responsibility.\n\nHead to Playboy for the complete interview.
All criticism in a relationship is painful. Complaints that include specific request for change, can make a relationship better. Criticism does not. Inevitably criticism makes the relationship worse. We all know this. Yet, many of us, myself included, are guilty of being critical of our partners.\n\nSo during the holiday I asked myself, what makes a partner chronically critical?\n\nThe first is an emotionally unavailable partner. When Kris continues to ignore Susan's complaint about him leaving his shoes and socks in the living room, she is likely to start escalating the issue by criticizing him in hopes to get a reaction. She may start calling him a slob and irresponsible instead of kindly reminding him to put his shoes in the closet. The shift from complaints to criticism is understandable, but unhelpful since the criticism makes Kris less responsive.\n\nThe only way out of this critical cycle is for both of them to change. And changing yourself when you desperately want someone else to change feels like an impossible task. It takes courage to compassionately communicate our needs or to turn towards a partner who talks about your flaws.\n\nThe Inner Critic of Love\n\nThe other source of relationship tension is inside you. It is the self-doubt that has developed over a lifetime of compounding experiences of betrayal, abuse, and neglect.\n\nAll of us have stories about not being good enough and narratives about the parts of ourselves that love ones labeled inadequate or a burden. As we are experiencing these heartbreaking moments time and time again, we can't help but believe them to be truths. Instead of a person's opinion of you, it becomes a fact. And once that happens, the true torture begins. We begin to criticize ourselves.\n\nIt's incredibly difficult for me to enjoy my own accomplishments. Before I started therapy, a setback in my business didn't mean I made a human mistake that I could learn from, it meant I was worthless. Deep down, that's how I felt. And when my business was succeeding, I hid my success because I felt no one could give two shits.\n\nThe voice inside beat me up telling me that I am not good enough. It has taken years of work to be kind to myself. To stop searching for approval that I wouldn't allow myself to enjoy or receive when it was offered.\n\nWhat happened when I got into a relationship?\n\nSince my mind was focused on only seeing what was wrong with me, what is missing, and not appreciate what is there, it became impossible for me to rejoice in the delight of love my partner gave me.\n\nThere was a soul crushing pressure to measure up leading me to buy gifts and smoother my partner in affection, instead of relaxing and enjoying the amount I had. Since I feared being inadequate for her love, I behaved in ways that overwhelmed her and pushed her away. Making my deepest fear a reality.\n\nAttracting Self-Punishment\n\nI also ended up attracting partners who saw my gifts of emotional availability as turds. I was called needy and hopelessly romantic. Granted I was. In part due to my beliefs about myself and in part due to these beliefs attracting women who didn't treasure my gifts.\n\nIn a way, dating emotionally unavailable women was a form of self-punishment. Reinforcing my lifelong pattern that my sacred gifts of affection and capacity for closeness that are essential parts of myself are somehow flawed and shameful. [3. Ken Page calls this attractions of deprivation. Check out chapter 4 or subscribe to my newsletter to get my view of this next month.]\n\nOr maybe for you, you struggle to appreciate your partner's wonderful qualities, including their kindness, dedication to the family, and the deep emotional support your partner offers you when you go through a tough time, and instead focus on their flaws. Maybe that they are sensitive, kind of awkward at social events and not as clean around the house as you'd like.\n\nAccording to Dr. Gottman, 85% of relationships [2. Dr. Gottman makes this claim on page 283 in The Seven Principles that Make Marriage Work.] go wrong because partners find themselves unworthy. If you believe yourself not to be good enough, you will always anticipate for what is not there in yourself and your partner. And whether you want to see it or not, any person you fall in love with will be lacking desirable qualities. After all, they are human.\n\nThe difference between the masters of relationships and the disasters is the master's focus on what they have, while the disasters focus on what is missing in their partner and overlook the good enough qualities that are there. The disasters take the qualities in their partner and themselves for granted.\n\nAcceptance\n\nIf you notice your self-critic above, the best thing you can do for your relationships and yourself is to work on accepting yourself as you are, flaws and all. Looking back at the years of work I have done on myself, I am grateful that I have been forgiving of my mistakes and imperfections. It has made an immense difference as a healthy relationship teacher and lover.\n\nThe antidote to criticism in our relationships and it's deadly brother, contempt is a fuller acceptance of oneself and expressions of thanksgiving and compliments. To start, I wanted to invite you to take the Thanksgiving Challenge\n\nThe Thanksgiving Challenge\n\nStep 1:\n\nFor seven days, mindfully notice your tendency to criticize. When those moments happen, focus your attention to notice what you have and what others contribute to your life. Search for the small things you can admire and appreciate in yourself and your partner. Maybe this is noticing:\n\nYour partner taking out the trash\n\nListening to you with their full attention\n\nGiving you a kiss randomly\n\nOr\n\nYour ability to turn towards your partner during conflict\n\nYour ability to ask open-ended questions that allow you to see different parts of your partner\n\nYour ability to help out more when your partner is stressed\n\nStep 2:\n\nFor the entire week, offer your partner at least one genuine compliment each day. The compliments I give include the event I noticed and a characteristic I love about my partner. It goes something like this, I love how you smiled at the little boy in the stroller at the grocery store. You're such a compassionate and kind person. As you are doing this, notice how it impacts your relationship, your partner and yourself. Don't be phony and make things up. Notice the positive qualities of your partner. Rejoice in them. They are there!\n\nAs you take on this thanksgiving challenge, you'll receive an amazing gift. You will be less critical of yourself. You will begin to be kind to yourself and over time will relish in your own accomplishments and the beauty of the relational gifts you offer the loved ones of your life.\n\nThe more you can embrace the spirit of thanksgiving and the profound presence of praise and admiration, the more fulfilling your relationship will be.\n\nThis article was originally published at Healthy Relationships with Kyle Benson.
Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson resurfaced on Fox Business on Tuesday to slam calls for universal health care.\n\nInstead of medicine, he said, people just need more Jesus:\n\nGood news from the right-- you don't even need healthcare because you get eternal healthcare from God in the afterlife and it's free. pic.twitter.com/CjPCse7Ggw — Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) February 5, 2019\n\nRobertson took exception to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) backing a Medicare for all plan to create a single-payer system for health care.\n\nKamala, I already have health care. It's given to me by God. Eternal health care, he said.\n\nHost Neil Cavuto wondered about more earthly health concerns.\n\nBut people get sick on Earth in human form, he said.\n\nRobertson replied:\n\nThe temporary reprieve is not worth it. I'm telling her, I have eternal health care and it's free. Doctors can give you a little temporary reprieve, but they cannot save you from physical death. The doctors who treat you, they die, too.\n\nBut you're not dismissing that we need, people need health care, right? Cavuto asked.\n\nI didn't have health care for 50 years, Robertson said.\n\nRobertson is 72; he did not address the other 22 years.\n\nRobertson has a history of making homophobic comments based on religion; in 2016, he slammed same-sex marriage as evil, wicked and sinful.
The Dixie Chicks took the long way around to releasing new music, but they're finally back.\n\nAfter an extended 14-year break, the legendary country pop trio has returned with their new single Gaslighter, released on Wednesday ahead of the eighth studio album of the same name due May 1.\n\nCo-written and produced with Jack Antonoff, Gaslighter shows that Natalie Maines, Emily Robison and Martie Maguire have no plans on making nice anytime soon. The aptly titled empowerment anthem is a classic Dixie Chicks revenge tale, as the song takes aim at a man whose lies chip away at the foundation of a marriage.\n\nGaslighter, I'm your mirror / Standing right here until you can see how / You broke me / Yeah, I'm broken, Maines sings about a nasty divorce in her signature searing vocals. You're still sorry and there's still no apology.\n\nIn the accompanying video directed by Seanne Farmer, the Chicks suit up in military outfits as they ready for battle against a good-for-nothing-guy.\n\nThe song was inspired by the end of the Maines' own relationship to Heroes actor Adrian Pasdar in 2017. The former couple, who share two sons, split after 17 years of marriage and were locked in a prolonged legal battle over spousal support.\n\nLast year, Pasdar reportedly requested that the court allow him access to all of Maines' unreleased music, claiming the contents of the songs could violate a confidentiality clause in their prenuptial agreement. The two finally settled the divorce last year.\n\nWhen I started getting a divorce, I had a lot to say. That sparked me being ready [for new music], Maines said in an interview with the Spiritualgasm podcast last year. Songwriting is really hard for me, and I think for many years, I didn't want to analyze my life or my relationship. I was just in it and dedicated and devoted, and if I had started writing songs about it, that might not have been good. I don't want to say I was in a 'survival mode,' it wasn't like that, but I was just not ready to open up like that.\n\nAnd then when my relationship fell apart, so I had a lot to say, she added. Our last album was the most personal and autobiographical we'd ever been. And then this one is 10 times that.\n\nSince the release of their Grammy-winning 2006 album Taking the Long Way, both of Maines' bandmates, Robison and Maguire, also got divorced from their respective spouses. The former has since remarried.\n\nOnce blacklisted from country radio for Maines' anti-Iraq War stance, the Dixie Chicks returned to the charts in 2019, assisting Taylor Swift with background vocals on her solemn Lover track, Soon You'll Get Better, about her mother's ongoing cancer battle.
There are fundamental truths most 5-year-olds understand about the world: The sky is blue. The grass is green. Your family consists of you, possibly siblings and your parents. But that truth is altered if your parents split up.\n\nI was in kindergarten when my parents got divorced. They worked hard to make my reality as normal as possible, but even at a young age I knew something was different about my family compared to my friends' families.\n\nLindsay Holmes With my parents on my first birthday.\n\nI wouldn't change anything about our situation. My mom was my best friend growing up and is to this day; my dad got remarried and he and I gained an amazing family who we can't picture our world without. The divorce didn't give me a terrible life. What it did give me was invaluable insight ― especially when it comes to relationships.\n\nThe following is what people should know about loving a child of divorce, culled from my personal experience and expert advice:\n\nWe worry about commitment.\n\nPeople whose parents split up might fret more about their serious relationship dissolving ― perhaps seemingly out of nowhere. That's because our view of commitment may be altered by the divorce, according to Jane Greer, a New York-based marriage and sex therapist.\n\nBe aware that their feelings about commitment and getting married may have been impacted by the divorce, Greer told The Huffington Post. It might have made them reluctant to take the next step ... They may feel that it won't work out.\n\nWe crave relationship validation.\n\nKids of divorce may feel a greater need to know where they stand with their partner. The best way to do that? Open communication.\n\nThey will do better when they have clarity about where things are going in the relationship, Greer said. Feeling secure allows for more openness and more personal sharing.\n\nAnd require patience ― particularly around holidays.\n\nTwo Christmases and two birthdays may seem like a sweet deal, but they also require a lot of coordination. We worry about this the first time we bring our significant other home because it can get a little hectic and we don't want it to scare them away. But trust us, the reward of spending time with so many people (and the food and presents, of course) is worth it in the end.\n\nFights will sometimes scare us.\n\nKids who've grown up around fighting parents may not be the best at handling conflict. More specifically, we may be a bit averse to it because we fear we might be abandoned altogether.\n\nChildren of divorce can sometimes be more sensitive during arguments as they may have witnessed their parents arguing in front of them, Jacqueline Newman, a New York-based family law specialist, told HuffPost. They may take more extreme positions and think that a small tiff could be the end ― simply because as children the fights they did see led to the ending of the relationship.\n\nBut we know it's okay to call it quits if the relationship isn't working out.\n\nSome of us may have come to understand in time why our parents decided to separate and know that it was ultimately the best decision for everyone involved. We may carry this lesson into our own relationships. We know divorce ― eventually ― isn't the end of the world.\n\nOur family dynamics will likely be more complicated than yours.\n\nSome kids of divorce may be closer to one parent than another. This could depend on factors like the terms of divorce, who became the main caregiver and even how other siblings interacted with each parent, Newman said.\n\nI recommend that when dating someone who has this type of family connection that you try to understand it rather than be annoyed by it, she said.\n\nWe're resilient.\n\nIf our parents divorced when we were younger, we had to bounce back from a heavy situation earlier than most people our age.\n\nI think that children of divorce are often more resilient than children who grow up in intact families, because they have to be, Newman said. Depending on how the parents handle the situation, many children grow up way faster than they should and have to handle adult emotions in a way that they do not understand.\n\nWe love hard.\n\nKids of divorce treat relationships with the gravity they deserve. We not only want love to be successful ― we'll do everything we can to make it happen. That includes not settling, staying open and working through our own issues to make sure we're approaching our unions in the healthiest possible way.
Johner Images via Getty Images Expert-backed tips for anyone with a broken heart.\n\nWhen you're in the thick of a breakup, friends, family, co-workers and, hell, even your favorite Trader Joe's cashier will try to offer you advice — some solicited, some very much unsolicited.\n\nAnd while these people hopefully have your best interests at heart, their advice can sometimes be a bit misguided. That's why we asked relationship experts to share the kernels of wisdom they wish more people received when relationships come to an end. Here's what we learned:\n\n1. It's OK to be the one who's hurting more\n\nPeople experience and process emotions differently, so there's no way to gauge how your ex is actually holding up post-split ― no matter how many seemingly carefree photos he or she posts on Instagram. Quit playing the comparison game and embrace however it is you're feeling, even if it's pretty crappy, said marriage and family therapist Spencer Northey.\n\nYou don't 'win' the breakup by being the one who experienced less caring, less attachment and less vulnerability, she said. It's OK to lean into the loss of someone who was important to you. Recognizing the value of what you lost in the breakup will help clarify what you want when you are ready to date and be in a relationship again.\n\n2. Don't be fooled into thinking binge-eating and drinking, shopping sprees or a string of hookups will pull you out of a funk\n\nHey, there's nothing wrong with treating yourself to a heaping portion of mac and cheese, binge-watching Friends and throwing back a few glasses of sauvignon blanc post-split. We all crave comfort and a distraction during tough times. But eating, drinking, shopping or dating in excess ― and doing so to avoid dealing with unwanted emotions ― isn't going to solve your problems; it's just putting off getting a handle on them.\n\nAs a culture, we are taught to ignore or mask unpleasant emotions by indulging in activities that help us temporarily escape, said Laura Heck, a couples therapist and co-host of the podcast Marriage Therapy Radio. Your feelings are intended to be felt, so feel them. Lean into the sadness.\n\n3. Revisit an old hobby or try something new that you've always wanted to do.\n\nPost-breakup, you'll probably find yourself with some extra time on your hands. Use it to your advantage: Volunteer with an organization you're passionate about, revisit a hobby that might have fallen by the wayside during the relationship or try something new entirely.\n\nConnect to something that's important to you — a hobby you haven't enjoyed in a while, getting back to your fitness routine or listen to that audiobook you've been wanting to read, therapist Juan Olmedo said. When a relationship ends, it's helpful and healing to reconnect with your most important connection — your relationship to yourself.\n\n4. Lean on your support system\n\nGetting through a breakup may be a personal journey, but that doesn't mean you have to go at it alone. Open up to friends, family members and a therapist (if you have one) about what you're going through.\n\nBelieve that your friends and family want to be there for you, Olmedo said. It can help to get your thoughts out of your head so you're not stuck in a loop, and you can get feedback from someone you trust that what you're feeling is valid. If you're feeling stuck, give working with a counselor or therapist a try for an objective ear. Do what you need to remind yourself you're a good person who deserves a good relationship.\n\n5. Stop following your ex on social media and communicating via text or email, at least for now\n\nAccepting that a relationship is over isn't easy, especially when you're being bombarded with constant reminders of your ex, like text messages, Insta stories, Snapchats and Facebook posts. If you don't want to block the person, consider other options such as muting him on Instagram or unfollowing her posts on Facebook. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nSmartphones and social media make it easier than ever to track your ex and reach out in moments of weakness, psychotherapist Elisabeth J. LaMotte said. Impulsive communication does not reflect your best version of yourself and increases the likelihood of spontaneous hookups with your ex that can compromise whatever positive memories and feelings remain between the two of you.\n\n6. Resist the urge to look at the relationship through rose-colored glasses\n\nSimply put: No partner or relationship is perfect. No matter how much you loved your ex, try to be honest about his or her flaws instead of romanticizing them.\n\nAs painful as a breakup feels, it can be liberating to admit the reasons you are better off without your ex, LaMotte said. Even if you thought they were the One, there were surely some obstacles and flaws in your relationship, and it frees up emotional energy to admit these shortcomings.\n\n7. Take responsibility for your part in why things ended\n\nAcknowledging your shortcomings and character defects is an important step toward emotional maturity. Being able to admit your mistakes requires self-reflection and humility, qualities that will serve you well in your future relationships. (One important exception: people ending a relationship with a physically or emotionally abusive partner.)\n\nIt is also liberating to acknowledge your role in the relationship's demise, LaMotte said. Even if your ex is 90 percent to blame, owning your part in the process is a way to make sure you learn from the relationship and position yourself for a healthier romantic future.\n\n8. Give yourself enough time and space before you have the closure talk\n\nGetting closure after a relationship ends can be healing and help you move forward. Though you may be tempted to have this post-mortem conversation right away, don't rush into it. Both you and your ex could benefit from some time to breathe and reflect.\n\nUnless there is a safety issue, it is often helpful and healing to have a final closure talk once the dust has settled from the breakup, Northey said. This is a sort of relationship exit interview where you can ask some burning questions and get some feedback that may be helpful for moving on in future relationships.
This article originally appeared on Outsports\n\nBears and bears. Tight ends and tight ends. Double entendres abound in sports, with terms and situations that can be viewed through a homoerotic lens. Cartoonist Dylan Edwards explores these issues in a book of cartoons called The Outfield.\n\nFor eight years, The Outfield ran as a series on Outsports and was consistently among our most popular pages. One of my all-time favorites — Is Barry Zito gay? — was published in 2002 and I said at the time that I thought the cartoon perfectly captured the stereotypes gays and straights have about sexual orientation.\n\nDylan Edwards\n\nEdwards has compiled his Outsports cartoons, along with some others, in The Outfield, which is available for purchase. Edwards, who identifies as a queer trans guy, explains the idea behind the cartoon series.\n\nI would often riff on the homoerotic subtext that's already present in sports, or otherwise look for a queer point of view by injecting drag, bear culture, leather culture, etc. Various team rivalries also came up a lot, often in a relationship context (mixed Red Sox/Yankees marriages, for example). There are a few current (for the time) events comics around gay marriage and various sports stars either coming out or saying something homophobic and I'd comment on it.\n\nIf there's a unifying theme, it's about poking holes in the myth that queer men don't or shouldn't like sports, while at the same time subverting some of the hypermasculine framing of a lot of sports culture.\n\nI always found his cartoons fresh and funny and I think LGBT sports fans would agree.\n\nDylan Edwards\n\nDylan Edwards\n\nDylan Edwards\n\nDylan Edwards can be reached via his website.\n\nFor more from Outsports, check out these stories:
Rush Limbaugh, a talk radio pioneer who saturated America's airwaves with cruel bigotries, lies and conspiracy theories for over three decades, amassing a loyal audience of millions and transforming the Republican Party in the process, has died, his wife revealed at the beginning of his show on Wednesday. He was 70 years old.\n\nLimbaugh announced in February 2020 that he had been diagnosed with advanced stage 4 lung cancer.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom during the 2020 State of the Union, calling Limbaugh the greatest fighter and winner you will ever meet.\n\nPerhaps no moment better encapsulated Limbaugh's legacy, nor demonstrated the immense influence he came to wield in Washington.\n\nThe medal was a just reward: Trump's ascension to the presidency couldn't have happened without Limbaugh's brand of right-wing media.\n\nThe modern Republican Party often functioned with Limbaugh as a fulcrum. President Barack Obama's former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, once called Limbaugh the voice and intellectual force of the Republican Party. Limbaugh would at times massage the failures of the party and its leaders, dismissing obvious policy or political failures as simply part of liberal conspiracies.\n\nBut he also helped set the agenda. When a Republican politician promoting racist and sexist policies could only use a dog whistle, Limbaugh provided a bull horn — he was, for example, an early progenitor of the racist birther conspiracy theory about Obama that Trump would later use to fuel his political career.\n\nFor decades, Limbaugh was associated with the far-right fringes of the Republican Party. In 1995, only days after Timothy McVeigh bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City, President Bill Clinton issued a blistering attack at a speech in Minneapolis in which he said the nation's airwaves ... spread hate, they leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable. … It is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech and behavior.\n\nLimbaugh vehemently protested the characterization, assuming that it was about him — which in all likelihood it was. Make no mistake about it: Liberals intend to use this tragedy for their own political gain, he said on the radio afterward.\n\nPeople did take up Clinton's charge to speak against Limbaugh's style of reckless speech and behavior, but without much success. While remaining a controversial figure and at times suffering advertising boycotts and derision from the mainstream media, in less than 25 years, rather than be condemned by another American president, Limbaugh was given a medal.\n\nDecades Of Hate\n\nA full accounting of Limbaugh's lies and exaggerations; his racism and his misogyny; his homophobia and his Islamophobia; and his sheer cruelty could fill books — and have — but even a cursory overview of his lowlights makes his prejudice clear.\n\nIn 2003, he was forced to resign from ESPN after stating that Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb was only receiving praise because the media was very desirous that a Black quarterback do well. In 2004, Limbaugh said the NBA should be renamed the T.B.A. —the Thug Basketball Association. He then added: Stop calling them teams. Call 'em gangs. He similarly whined that watching the NFL was like watching a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons.\n\nOnce, after arguing with a Black man who called into his show, he told the caller to take that bone out of your nose and call me back. Another time, Limbaugh asked his audience, Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson? while discussing the Black civil rights activist and politician. Limbaugh once ludicrously asserted that if any race of people should not have guilt about slavery, it's Caucasians. He invited a guest on air who sang Barack, the Magic Negro to the tune of Puff, the Magic Dragon. In 2016, he read an essay on air that had been penned by a well-known white supremacist.\n\nLimbaugh's radio career was also one long exercise in misogyny, perhaps best summed up by his thesis that feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society.\n\nIn one of his most infamous episodes, he called Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke a slut and a prostitute in 2012 after she testified in Congress about the importance of women having access to birth control.\n\nmark peterson via Getty Images Rush Limbaugh smoking a cigar while taping his radio show.\n\nNearly every marginalized group or minority bore the brunt of Limbaugh's bigotry. Once, while speaking about the genocide of America's indigenous peoples, Limbaugh said, Holocaust 90 million Indians? Only 4 million left? They all have casinos, what's to complain about?\n\nLimbaugh frequently mirrored white nationalist talking points when discussing Latino immigrants, whom he described as lazy and dependent on the government. He called migrants at America's southern border an invasion.\n\nAn opponent of marriage equality — which he suggested was perverted and depraved — Limbaugh argued in 2016 that legalizing gay marriage would lead to bestiality. What happens if you love your dog? he said. He once referred to transgender people as being mentally ill.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and '90s, Limbaugh also frequently denigrated those who were HIV positive, saying the best way to stop the spread of the virus was to not ask another man to bend over and make love at the exit point. He spoke out against federal funding to fight the virus too, calling it the only federally protected virus.\n\nHis Father's Son\n\nLimbaugh's journey to becoming one of America's foremost bigots began in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, where he was born to a prominent local political family on Jan. 12, 1951. His father, a lawyer and Republican activist, would sternly lecture about politics in the home and rant against communism. Limbaugh later called his father the smartest man I ever met.\n\nAt age 14, Limbaugh says his parents bought him a Remco Carevelle radio set, which enabled him to broadcast on AM channels within a few hundred square feet of his house. In high school, Limbaugh worked as a DJ at KGMO, a local radio station co-owned by his father.\n\nEven when I was a little boy, I dreamed of being on the radio, Limbaugh told biographer Ze'ev Chafetts. In the mornings getting ready for school I'd hear the guy on the radio, and he just sounded free and happy, like he was having a wonderful time. That's what I wanted, too.\n\nLimbaugh enrolled at Southeast Missouri State University but dropped out after a year to pursue a career in radio. Throughout the 1970s, he worked at different radio stations in Missouri and Pennsylvania but was often fired after clashing with management. He eventually landed a steady on-air gig in Sacramento, California, before getting hired to host his own show at WABC in New York, which remained his flagship station throughout much of his career.\n\nAs his fame rose, Limbaugh liked to explain his success by claiming he had talent on loan from God, but it was a Reagan-era Federal Communications Commission policy shift that allowed Limbaugh to reach national infamy and create the mold for modern right-wing media stardom. In 1987, the FCC abolished the decades-old Fairness Doctrine which mandated that TV and radio broadcasters present both sides of controversial issues. This meant that stations were no longer required to feature opposing views, and instead radio hosts like Limbaugh could spend hours spouting off right-wing fallacies without challenge.\n\nDecades before online extremists and pro-Trump trolls used memes and ironic detachment to make their far-right beliefs seem less repugnant, Limbaugh's employed the same strategy. He popularized cartoonish terms such as Commie-Libs and Feminazi, while also claiming that abortion represented a modern day Holocaust. He used mocking voices and affectations as he belittled women's rights, Black activists and the gay community. His persona as an absurd blowhard gave audiences an excuse to brush off Limbaugh's mainstreaming of far-right views as part of an act — just Rush being Rush, or El Rushbo, as he was often called.\n\nBecoming A National Star\n\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine allowed for Limbaugh's brand of unhinged right-wing rhetoric and shock jock persona to become a media phenomenon. By 1990, his nationally syndicated show aired on 300 stations ― a number that more than doubled over the next four years.\n\n\n\nLimbaugh's rise turned him into a ubiquitous cultural figure in the 1990s. Limbaugh's voice echoed for hours a day on syndicated radio stations around the country; he appeared on magazine covers and in newspaper profiles. His success made him into a curiosity for the mainstream media, but little of the coverage properly grappled with what Limbaugh was doing to radicalize his listeners.\n\nAs his radio audience grew, Limbaugh got his own half-hour television show on Fox in 1992 and created a prototype for prime time opinion shows hosted by right wing pundits like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. The show's executive producer was Limbaugh's longtime friend Roger Ailes, who would go on to launch Fox News in 1996 and run it for two decades until he was fired for widespread sexual harassment.\n\nLimbaugh's political influence made him beloved among Republican Party elites. When the GOP won the House for the first time in 40 years in 1994, Republicans called him the majority maker. At then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich's victory party, they sold Rush Limbaugh for President! T-shirts.\n\nBut Limbaugh never fully tied his fate to any one politician, always staying focused on his own success above all else. I don't define my success by who wins elections, because politicians are going to come and go, and I'm going to be around as long as I choose to be, Limbaugh told Time Magazine in 2008.\n\nLike any successful right wing media star, Limbaugh had a financial angle behind his vitriol and an appetite to center himself in controversies. He turned his infamy into extreme wealth: In 2008, he signed an eight-year deal for his show worth around $400 million. He bought a private jet and a fleet of luxury cars to usher him from place to place.\n\nI wanted to be the reason people listened, Limbaugh told The New York Times in 1990. That's how you pad your pocket.\n\nWhile he claimed to represent the views of the average American, Limbaugh lived for years as a caricature of an East Coast elite in his luxury condo overlooking Central Park in New York City. He sold the property in 2010 for $11.5 million, moving primarily to a sprawling mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, where he lived until his death.\n\nMeanwhile, Limbaugh used his platform to condemn policies designed to actually help working class Americans. He fervently opposed the expansion of public health care and said an Obama-era health insurance program for low-income children ought to die. He condemned taxes against the ultra-rich, such as himself, and fled New York after the proposal of increased taxes on millionaires.\n\nIn 2006, Limbaugh — despite once saying that all drug addicts should be convicted and sent up the river — struck a plea deal with prosecutors in Florida after being charged with prescription fraud. Limbaugh, who admitted to being an oxycodone addict, was accused of doctor shopping, the act of deliberately deceiving physicians in order to receive multiple prescriptions. Although Limbaugh had previously told his listeners that too many whites are getting away with drug use and should all be sent to prison, Limbaugh avoided time behind bars himself, paying a $30,000 fine and agreeing to stay clean.\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters Rush Limbaugh shortly after being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by First Lady Melania Trump during President Donald Trump's State of the Union address in 2020.\n\nThe President's Ear\n\nLimbaugh was still the most popular radio host in America by the time of the 2016 election. Although initially supportive of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the Republican primary, he became a staunch supporter of the eventual nominee, Donald Trump. Limbaugh could be counted on to support the president during some of the most disgraceful episodes of Trump's sole term in the White House.\n\nIn 2017 white supremacists, emboldened by Trump's presidency, gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, for the Unite The Right rally, the largest such gathering in a generation. A neo-Nazi rammed his car into counter-protesters at the rally, killing one person. Trump initially refused to condemn the white supremacists, and Limbaugh swiftly came to the president's defense, blaming anti-racist activists for the violence.\n\nIt was part of a pattern for Limbaugh, who repeatedly tried to downplay white supremacists during Trump's four years in the White House, a period of rising far-right terror across the globe. After an avowed white supremacist massacred 51 Muslims inside two New Zealand mosques in 2019, Limbaugh speculated on air that the shooter may in fact be a leftist who shot Muslims to smear those on the right.\n\nA day after a mob of Trump supporters — among them white supremacists and militia members — stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, ransacking the seat of American democracy, Limbaugh falsely told his listeners no looting had occurred and that the protesters only took selfies.\n\nLimbaugh then endorsed the political violence, saying he disagreed with those who say that any violence or aggression at all is unacceptable, before invoking America's Founding Fathers. I am glad Sam Adams, Thomas Paine, the actual Tea Party guys, the men at Lexington and Concord didn't feel that way, he said.\n\nIt's no surprise that Limbaugh sought to downplay the historic insurrection, which Trump incited. Limbaugh was a close confidant of the president, and he and Trump often went golfing together in Florida. The president sometimes called into Limbaugh's radio show, and Limbaugh claimed they spoke on the phone weekly.\n\nTheir relationship culminated with Trump awarding Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom during the State of the Union address in February 2020. In his speech, Trump heralded Limbaugh as a special man who has inspired millions of Americans through his decades of tireless devotion to our country. Limbaugh had announced the day before that he had lung cancer.\n\nThe next month, when the coronavirus pandemic began sweeping across the U.S., Limbaugh promoted conspiracy theories about the virus and its death toll. Despite that, Vice President Mike Pence, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, appeared on his show multiple times during this period.\n\nLimbaugh spent his final months on air downplaying the historic pandemic and spreading dangerous medical misinformation, including calling coronavirus the common cold and telling listeners we have to remember that people die every day in America.\n\nOn the day Limbaugh died, the coronavirus had killed more than 488,000 Americans.
Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) fiercely rebuked Rep. Glenn Grothman on the House floor Wednesday after the Wisconsin Republican declared that Black Lives Matter is a group that doesn't like the old-fashioned family.\n\nHow dare you, how dare you say that Black Lives Matter, Black people do not understand old-fashioned families despite some of the issues, some of the things that you have put forward that I've heard out of your mouth in the Oversight Committee, in your own district, said Plaskett, who played a prominent role as an impeachment manager in Donald Trump's Senate trial.\n\nWe have been able to keep our families alive for over 400 years, and the assault on our families to not have Black lives or not even have Black families, she continued.\n\nHow dare you say that we are not interested in families in the Black community. That is outrageous. That should be stricken down.\n\nShe said that she had planned to speak about her support for the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, which she noted would provide aid to all Americans.\n\nWe know that this is going to provide relief to not only Black lives, Black Americans, but all Americans, that we are interested in children and in their welfare, she said.\n\n#BlackLivesMatter and I had to let my Colleague from Wisconsin know that in so many words today. #HowDareYou #VIStrong pic.twitter.com/aKNVZoLGqJ — Rep. Stacey Plaskett (@StaceyPlaskett) March 10, 2021\n\nGrothman, during debate on the COVID-19 stimulus bill, had argued that a provision in it that would expand the earned income tax credit for single people was penalizing marriage.\n\nI bring it up because I know the strength that Black Lives Matter had in this last election, he said in a floor speech. I know it's a group that doesn't like the old-fashioned family — [I am] disturbed that we have another program here in which we're increasing the marriage penalty.\n\nHe also argued against a provision in the bill that would offer loan forgiveness to Black farmers, calling it incredibly divisive.\n\nGrothman was panned online for his comments, including by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), who thanked Plaskett for her rebuke, noting, Systemic racism is real. Even on the floor of Congress.\n\nThe House passed the bill 220-211. It now goes to President Joe Biden, who is expected to sign it by the end of the week.
Alexandra Bowman for HuffPost\n\nBent Not Broken is a look back on the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has disrupted our mental health, plus advice on how to manage our well-being moving forward.\n\nOver the last year, many people have been feeling more alone than ever before. To slow the spread of COVID-19, we've stayed home and avoided spending time with loved ones, which has led to more loneliness.\n\nWhile feeling lonely is a normal part of the human experience ― and some of us prefer much more solitude than others ― dealing with intense or chronic periods of loneliness can contribute to a bigger mental health issue.\n\nLoneliness does not only occur in the state of being alone but may also be a feeling that people have even when they are in social settings. Loneliness is more about lack of connection than lack of people, said Lin Sternlicht, a therapist and co-founder of Family Addiction Specialist based in New York City. We all have an innate need and desire to connect with others, and when that goes unmet, we can feel alone.\n\nSternlicht added that extroverts are more susceptible than introverts to the negative effects of loneliness because they are at greater risk of low moods when they are alone.\n\nWhat's the difference between healthy solitude and chronic loneliness?\n\nWe've all had those moments of wanting to be alone to recharge, reflect or simply do something just for us. When we briefly shut out the world and create a bubble for ourselves, that can be a form of self-care. But at what point does it become unhealthy?\n\nYasmine Saad, a licensed clinical psychologist and CEO of Madison Park Psychological Services in New York City, said that when we go from healthy solitude or alone time to chronic loneliness, we enter a negative space in our head.\n\nThis typically happens when we start focusing on our feeling of disconnection from others or loss of relationships. Saad said some people may not be consciously aware of this shift, but their bodies and minds will still show the negative effects of being alone.\n\nFeelings of loneliness can only happen when our lens is focused on what is missing. That lens further disconnects us from life and others. Our life becomes heavy and our body and mind will show symptoms reflecting that heaviness, she said.\n\nFeelings of loneliness can only happen when our lens is focused on what is missing. That lens further disconnects us from life and others. - Yasmine Saad\n\nRed flags that your loneliness could lead to a bigger issue.\n\nThe isolation of the last year has hit us all, so much so that we may not even notice the toll it's taken on our mental health. Here are a few indicators that loneliness is becoming a larger problem:\n\n1. You're feeling lonely around others.\n\nSternlicht said that if you struggle with feeling lonely even though you're around other people or in relationships, then those feelings might be pointing to a bigger underlying mental health issue or lack of connection.\n\nLook within and ask yourself what might be contributing to these feelings, she said. A lack of connection with others might mean that you need to expose yourself to other individuals who you have more in common with, who you find more interesting, or who align more with your morals, values and personality.\n\n2. You're feeling tired more frequently.\n\nKruti Quazi, clinical director of virtual group therapy app Sesh, said people dealing with chronic loneliness may feel fatigued more than usual.\n\nIf they are experiencing chronic loneliness, trying to engage and be social with others can leave them feeling completely exhausted, she said. When feeling constantly drained, this may lead to sleep problems, a weakened immune system, poor diet, and so much more, affecting their emotional, mental and physical well-being.\n\n3. You struggle to connect in ways that once came easily.\n\nIf you feel incapable of connecting to others on a deeper level ― something that once wasn't so difficult ― this may be a sign of a bigger problem, Quazi said.\n\nThis can also be true if the connections you are making feel very surface-level and not fulfilling, Quazi added. This disconnection may feel as though it is never-ending. She said you may feel misunderstood as well.\n\n4. You've started exhibiting symptoms of depression.\n\nAccording to Susan Harrington, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Louisiana, extended loneliness often goes hand in hand with depression and, when it is part of a bigger issue, it has some common presentations.\n\nKeep an eye out for signs such as a sense of numbness, continued isolation, negative thinking, and/or an unexplainable change in sleeping and eating habits, Harrington said. Other less-thought-of signs are irritability, guilt, talking or moving slower, and/or restlessness.\n\n5. You've picked up negative coping habits.\n\nWhen we're experiencing something we don't know how to manage or make go away, we may find ourselves leaning into unhealthy habits to cope. Sternlicht said she often sees loneliness manifest itself in behaviors such as overeating, smoking, drug misuse or excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nThese behaviors serve as a coping mechanism for individuals who feel alone to numb their emotions and connect with a substance rather than with another individual, she said. Research has shown that feelings of loneliness may be a key factor in one developing an addiction. If you are turning to drugs, alcohol, binge eating or other unhealthy and potentially addictive behaviors to cope with loneliness, this may be a sign of a bigger problem.\n\nThese coping mechanisms can also lead to increased isolation, thereby turning into a vicious cycle of loneliness and self-sabotage, Sternlicht said.\n\n6. You're dealing with suicidal ideation.\n\nAccording to Mary Joye, a licensed mental health counselor and certified trauma professional in Florida, chronic loneliness can lead to a lack of purpose. She said some people may begin to ask, Why am I here? or think, I don't want to be a burden to anyone.\n\nThis last statement is very important to pay attention to as people often say it when they feel suicidal, she said.\n\nIf your thinking starts to turn in that direction, please reach out to a mental health professional or a mental health support line. They can help.\n\nSmall ways to reduce your feelings of loneliness right now.\n\nSeeking help from a mental health professional or support space is one of the best and most urgent ways to address what's going on. But there are a few other things you can do to decrease feelings of isolation.\n\n1. Practice direct communication.\n\nJudy Ho, a triple-board-certified clinical and forensic neuropsychologist and professor at Pepperdine University, said sometimes we find it hard to voice our needs to the people in our lives.\n\nBut making that effort to practice direct communication can go a long way, she said, since humans are a social species and we all need one another to survive and thrive.\n\nCommunicate your needs directly to those who are in your inner circle, and do the same in return. Ask them what they need or want most, and try to help them with attaining that if you can, she said. Research shows that even when we feel sad and down, helping others can help boost our mood and increase meaningfulness in our lives, and also make us feel better about ourselves.\n\n2. Curb your social media consumption if it's making you feel worse.\n\nMichelle English, a licensed clinical social worker and executive clinical manager at San Diego-based Healthy Life Recovery, noted that loneliness is an epidemic, and yet we are the most socially connected we've ever been.\n\nWith social media and all of our hyper-connectivity, it's inevitable that people will feel like they're not good enough, that they don't have enough, that they're not doing enough, she said. How can we not feel this way when we're constantly being exposed to what everyone else is doing or, more accurately, carefully choosing to showcase? This type of constant comparison can actually fuel feelings of loneliness and isolation, which is why it can be important to step away and take a break from time to time to recalibrate.\n\n3. Finally, keep in mind that you are not alone.\n\nWhen we're struggling, it's easy to convince ourselves that our situation is unique and the people around us wouldn't understand. But that usually isn't the case.\n\nIf we are constantly thinking that others may not relate to our personality or our situation, we begin to excessively focus our mind deeply within ourselves and feel even more isolated, Quazi said. However, when we recognize that there are actually other people who are feeling equally isolated, it becomes much easier to try changing our focus from ourselves to others and reaching out to those who may benefit from your support.
Warning: Major spoilers ahead.\n\nBefore Emerald Fennell started writing Promising Young Woman, she made a playlist. It included playful pop confections (Britney Spears' Toxic, Charli XCX's Boys), dance anthems (It's Raining Men) and Broadway standards (Something Wonderful from The King and I). But one track was more important than all the others: Paris Hilton's Stars Are Blind. By the time Fennell finished the script, Hilton's 2006 debut single had made its way into a pivotal scene, with 30-year-old protagonist Cassie Thomas relinquishing her austerity as she and her sweet new beau, Ryan, lip-sync the song in a convenience store.\n\nFennell sent Carey Mulligan the playlist, alongside a mood board full of bright colors, while courting her for the lead role. She also gave it to the movie's production designer, Michael Perry, who had worked on the TV show Sweet Valley High, one of Fennell's key influences, and would be responsible for the film's aesthetics. Most vitally, she dispatched music supervisor Susan Jacobs to secure the rights to Hilton's ditty before shooting began. Other songs could be replaced during the editing if needed, but again: This one was more important than all the others.\n\nFor me, it was just, 'What song, if somebody knew every word to, would you fall more in love with them?' What's the song that you'd be like, 'Ugh, you know every lyric to that? OK, you're marriage material,' Fennell told me during a recent Zoom conversation. I think in another movie, it might've been like, 'You know that indie deep cut of that band that only existed in the '70s?' Who cares about that? Who cares about the Velvet Underground? I want to know who knows every line of 'Stars Are Blind.'\n\nFocus Features Carey Mulligan and Bo Burnham in Promising Young Woman.\n\nThe scene arrives about an hour into Promising Young Woman, at which point the film's biting premise has reached a fever pitch. Cassie, once a medical student with rosy prospects, has formed a pastime — an addiction, Fennell calls it — out of feigning drunkenness at bars and outfoxing the many guys who try to take advantage of her. She exacts this mission as a way to avenge the death of her longtime best friend, Nina, who was driven to suicide after being raped by a clean-cut classmate named Al Monroe (Chris Lowell). But when Ryan (Bo Burnham) reenters her life years after they attended school together, Cassie decides that maybe not all of humanity is charmless. During their first trip to the drugstore as a couple, Stars Are Blind plays over the loudspeaker. Cassie is amazed that Ryan knows the lyrics, and she reluctantly joins him, dancing through the aisles as he grabs cans of Spam and Hormel chili.\n\nThe store is bathed in the neon pink glow of a large pharmacy sign — the shiniest pink in a movie full of them. It's a sequence straight out of a rom-com, interspersed with a montage of Ryan and Cassie enjoying their honeymoon phase. The aim, Perry said, was to show what Cassie was like before Nina's death ignited her quest for retribution. It also offers a snapshot of what Cassie's future might be if she can finally let go of her depressive spell, which even Nina's mother (Molly Shannon) has encouraged her to do. I wanted it to be, as much as possible, a Paris Hilton video, Perry said.\n\nBut, like with everything in Promising Young Woman, the scene comes with a slight wink. The pharmacy sign was an existing prop used in Murder, She Wrote that Perry's team found at Universal Television's facilities. Fittingly, the classic series about a savvy amateur detective was another of Fennell's inspirations; early on, she had sent Perry an Instagram account dedicated to sets from the long-running show, wanting Cassie to share Jessica Fletcher's self-determination. (The theme song from The Night of the Hunter, the 1955 thriller about a charismatic serial killer, is another Easter egg that calls back to the suspense canon.)\n\nFocus Features Chris Lowell in Promising Young Woman.\n\nShe's learned to subvert her femininity and her prettiness and her blondness to effectively hide and mislead — like lots of addicts do, actually, Fennell said. And so she's just learned the tricks to keep things functioning on the surface, to stop people from asking too many questions. For me, if she's fluffy and pink and welcoming but she's boiling with this terrible rage, then I think it was important that the film itself reflected that, that it felt just as inviting as her and just as misleading as she is.\n\nTo establish that paradox, Perry emphasized light blues and soft pinks in every scene — friendly hues that counter the predatory behavior Cassie routinely encounters. But he planted a flash of red everywhere she goes. The café where she works, for example, has a blue sign, blue shelves, blue curtains and ruby-red mugs. As the movie progresses, those reds become more pronounced, as though Cassie is inching closer and closer to bloodshed.\n\nWhen her romantic contentment is punctured by the news that Ryan witnessed Nina's rape and did nothing to stop it, red suddenly overwhelms the pastels we've grown accustomed to. Distraught, Cassie sets out to enact her ultimate revenge at Al's bachelor party, wearing red pumps and a red-trimmed nurse's outfit and camouflaging herself in a decadent multicolored wig. A piercing instrumental cover of Toxic scores her march toward the party house, again treating pop music subversively.\n\nDaniel Curet, who oversaw the hair department, said that he and Fennell decided to use extensions for Cassie's everyday appearance. Her final disguise needed to be a striking contrast. We looked at several costume wigs, and the rainbow stripes was the one that we kept going back to and asking, 'Do we dare?' Curet said. In retrospect, it was a perfect choice given all the candy colors used in the set design at the coffee shop and in Cassie's bedroom. Funny enough, it was Carey's idea to cut it at that particular length, and I went through at least 10 razor blades until I finally used utility scissors to cut all that synthetic hair into the choppy bob, which gave it a homespun vibe.\n\nFocus Features Mulligan in Promising Young Woman.\n\nAt Al's wedding, after he has suffocated Cassie and burned her body, the aisle is covered in a river of crimson flowers, with a vibrant red ribbon draped across the archway behind the bride and groom. That's to reinforce her death, Perry explained.\n\nThis was Fennell's vision from the moment she sat down to write the movie. She wanted color, as well as songs like Stars Are Blind and Boys, to create a cohesive irony. Cassie, in Fennell's eyes, is a spiritual descendent of the murderous weather girl Nicole Kidman portrays in the delicious 1995 satire To Die For. And the movie as a whole takes cues from The Virgin Suicides, which coats its gloom in a dreamy guise. A lot of nasty things happen in beautiful places, Fennell said. This is a movie about appearances being deceptive. In that sense, Promising Young Woman parallels the HBO series I May Destroy You, which also depicts the aftermath of sexual assault, using surrealism and bold fashion to capture its heroine's mindset.\n\nSusan Jacobs, the music supervisor, felt at home with Woman because it reminded her of working on Little Miss Sunshine. When she first read the Sunshine script, she thought it seemed quite dark, until learning that the filmmakers wanted yellow to be the central color, thereby sharpening its whimsical undertone. Jacobs estimated that the rights to Stars Are Blind totaled almost half of her music budget, but the high cost pays off. It's the centerpiece of a movie that starts dark, turns bright and then careens back toward darkness.\n\nThe first thing we talked about was Paris Hilton, and then all of a sudden you get the tone, Jacobs said of Fennell. Some [filmmakers] want independent cred, and they're hanging out with the Bon Ivers or whatever. It's always the same thing: 'I want something really edgy. Where's Tom Waits?' And so to have a conversation with someone that's like, 'I want to talk about Paris Hilton. I want to talk about pop music' — that's interesting.\n\nPromising Young Woman is now available on VOD platforms like iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube and Vudu.
Editor's Note: Chris Wayne, who died suddenly on Jan. 14, was a dear friend of HuffPost ― and of mine. I got to know Chris when we hired his company, Peak XV, to produce HuffPost's two Listen to America tours in 2017 and 2018, during which we crisscrossed the country to listen to everyday Americans tell us their most urgent concerns for their families and the country. Chris not only ensured these projects ran flawlessly; he all but literally held my hand when I needed it most. He showed me how to keep a cool head even in times of crisis, how to ask for help (which I am definitely not good at), and how to be a reasonable and thoughtful leader on the road. He was open and sensitive and empathetic, and I trusted him completely. I was crushed by the news of his death ― I had so many plans for us this year and next. But I am grateful he left us this story about his recovery and his 30-year sober anniversary so that HuffPost readers can get a sense of who Chris was, in his own voice. He was a wonderful person, and his impact will be felt at HuffPost for a very long time. —Hillary Frey, Executive Editor, HuffPost\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Chris Wayne\n\nI will never forget that moment, 30 years ago today, when at age 22, I was awakened from a drunken stupor by a bright light shining in my face. The glare came from the flashlight of a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy. I had passed out behind the wheel of a running car in a bad part of town, a neighborhood notorious for drug activity. Terrified, I pleaded with the arresting officer not to send me to jail.\n\nIn a moment of grace that I will never forget, the officer told me, This might be the best thing that ever happens to you. At the time, there was no way I could understand just how profound that observation would be. Its implied advice ended up changing the course of my life forever.\n\nAn hour later I was in the drunk tank of the Sacramento County jail. I sat in that cell listening to a fellow detainee, who was high on PCP, rant incessantly and incoherently. I suddenly saw clearly where I was headed. For the first time, I could see that I was physically, emotionally and spiritually dying. I knew deep in my heart this was my moment. I had to change.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as I was released, I reached out to my parents and asked for help. Through them, I was able to immediately seek treatment for my addiction and embark on a new path.\n\nSeven years later, that path led me to the White House. First, I had a junior position on the public liaison staff, and later, I was appointed a special assistant to President Bill Clinton, traveling the globe with the president aboard Air Force One. But it wasn't always a smooth journey.\n\nPresident Clinton and his closest aides were committed to diversity ― in personnel and in thinking ― but not everyone was similarly committed. In 1996, as the re-election campaign was underway, I was being considered for a key slot on the advance staff. But one communications adviser reacted very negatively when my hometown newspaper called about doing a profile on me and how I had overcome adversity to become a trusted member of the president's team. In fact, that adviser went so far as to try to block my hiring, saying, Why are we hiring drunks at the campaign?\n\nEven at that level and in that context and time, the stigma was alive and well. And while we've made incredible strides toward combating the shame that's associated with addiction, it still persists within almost every facet of our society.\n\nAfter I left the White House, I ventured into the private sector and eventually started my own successful business. And, most importantly, I have four beautiful children and a happy marriage.\n\nAlong the way, I have learned that just because I stopped drinking and using drugs, it doesn't mean I don't still have a lot of work to do on issues that affect my behavior. I am prone to depression and anger, issues deeply rooted in a childhood trauma, but I now can work on these issues in constructive ways.\n\nLost within the narrative of the current addiction crisis are stories like mine: people who have risen from a seemingly hopeless state to live productive lives full of purpose. Recovery is possible, and the necessary support systems needed to sustain recovery should be available, on demand, in every city and town across the U.S.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Chris Wayne rides a unicorn at IX Art Park in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Sept. 26, 2017, as part of HuffPost's Listen to America tour.\n\nFor the better part of my journey, I remained mostly silent. Maybe because even after decades of personal recovery, I still felt the societal shame that leaves so many too terrified to ask for help. Or maybe I succumbed to the belief that people like me are expected to stay silent, hiding our authentic selves in some dark place.\n\nFor me, those days are over. Thirty years after that glaring flashlight and my night in the drunk tank, I am finally comfortable recovering out loud, with pride and purpose, hoping others will join me and the estimated 23 million-plus Americans who proudly identify as in recovery from addiction.\n\nJust as I have evolved, so too have public awareness and public policies regarding alcoholism and drug addiction. I wish we knew then what we know now. In 1989, the year I entered lasting recovery, our country was deep within the grip of the War on Drugs.\n\nWhatever its merits and motivations, that effort not only failed but may well have been counterproductive. The argument went that if we eliminated or severely curtailed the supply of drugs flowing into our country, addiction would cease to exist. The citizenry bought into it in a classic example of false assumptions resulting in wrong outcomes.\n\nFighting a war on drugs by focusing exclusively on supply is an inherently flawed concept. Today, in the debate over a wall along our southern border, we hear nothing about a real threat to our national security ― the humanitarian crisis that exists on our street corners, in our classrooms, boardrooms and, for many of us, right in our homes. Where are the billions of dollars for this crisis, a true national emergency that is claiming over 72,000 lives via drug overdose per year, destroying families, and leaving too many children without their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters?\n\nTo end this crisis, we need to focus on recovery. We must set aside the countless prejudices in our health care and judicial systems and within so many of our social networks. This may sound grand, or naïve, or intellectually squishy, but tackling addiction effectively will require a truly comprehensive approach, the objective of which will be to allow and encourage every person in this country now suffering from addiction to begin their own journey to wellness.\n\nIf there's anything I've learned in my decades of political work, it's that without lived experience at the decision-making table, even well-meaning policymakers often don't do what is required. Today we're seeing billions of dollars going not only toward opioid-specific treatment protocols and increased public safety measures but toward a revival of the same old scare tactics from Nancy Reagan's failed Just Say No campaign.\n\nMy lived experience has convinced me that addicted persons need access to more than just treatment. While treatment is a good start, sustained recovery can only be achieved by ensuring that people are set up for success afterward. Would we treat cancer patients with chemotherapy for just 30 days and then send them on their way hoping for the best? Of course not. Cancer patients receive a multiyear continuum of care, driving toward the best possible outcome. The same should be true with addiction — or as the medical professionals call it these days, substance use disorder.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Brad Cowgill, who also worked on the Listen to America tour, and Chris Wayne go on a fly-fishing trip down the Yellowstone River near Livingston, Montana, on Oct. 15, 2017.\n\nThis new year, I'm pledging to wear my recovery on my sleeve. I want people not only to know that recovery is possible — I want to show them what it looks like. I'm a taxpayer, a voter, a business owner, a father and a husband. I'm going to offer my experience to help our decision-makers find a way out of this crisis. And I urge those who can to do the same.\n\nThere is hope. We do get better. And we can end this crisis.\n\nChris Wayne died Monday night, Jan. 14, 2019, on the very eve of his 30th anniversary of sobriety, which he hoped to celebrate with the publication of this article. Wayne was a former special assistant to the president under President Bill Clinton and most recently served as CEO of Peak XV Global Events Agency and executive producer of RecoveryFest.
Together Alone The Epidemic of\n\nGay Loneliness By Michael Hobbes\n\nI I used to get so excited when the meth was all gone. This is my friend Jeremy. When you have it, he says, you have to keep using it. When it's gone, it's like, 'Oh good, I can go back to my life now.' I would stay up all weekend and go to these sex parties and then feel like shit until Wednesday. About two years ago I switched to cocaine because I could work the next day. Jeremy is telling me this from a hospital bed, six stories above Seattle. He won't tell me the exact circumstances of the overdose, only that a stranger called an ambulance and he woke up here. Jeremy is not the friend I was expecting to have this conversation with. Until a few weeks ago, I had no idea he used anything heavier than martinis. He is trim, intelligent, gluten-free, the kind of guy who wears a work shirt no matter what day of the week it is. The first time we met, three years ago, he asked me if I knew a good place to do CrossFit. Today, when I ask him how the hospital's been so far, the first thing he says is that there's no Wi-Fi, he's way behind on work emails. The drugs were a combination of boredom and loneliness, he says. I used to come home from work exhausted on a Friday night and it's like, 'Now what?' So I would dial out to get some meth delivered and check the Internet to see if there were any parties happening. It was either that or watch a movie by myself. Jeremy is not my only gay friend who's struggling. There's Malcolm, who barely leaves the house except for work because his anxiety is so bad. There's Jared, whose depression and body dysmorphia have steadily shrunk his social life down to me, the gym and Internet hookups. And there was Christian, the second guy I ever kissed, who killed himself at 32, two weeks after his boyfriend broke up with him. Christian went to a party store, rented a helium tank, started inhaling it, then texted his ex and told him to come over, to make sure he'd find the body. For years I've noticed the divergence between my straight friends and my gay friends. While one half of my social circle has disappeared into relationships, kids and suburbs, the other has struggled through isolation and anxiety, hard drugs and risky sex. None of this fits the narrative I have been told, the one I have told myself. Like me, Jeremy did not grow up bullied by his peers or rejected by his family. He can't remember ever being called a faggot. He was raised in a West Coast suburb by a lesbian mom. She came out to me when I was 12, he says. And told me two sentences later that she knew I was gay. I barely knew at that point. This is a picture of me and my family when I was 9. My parents still claim that they had no idea I was gay. They're sweet. Jeremy and I are 34. In our lifetime, the gay community has made more progress on legal and social acceptance than any other demographic group in history. As recently as my own adolescence, gay marriage was a distant aspiration, something newspapers still put in scare quotes. Now, it's been enshrined in law by the Supreme Court. Public support for gay marriage has climbed from 27 percent in 1996 to 61 percent in 2016. In pop culture, we've gone from Cruising to Queer Eye to Moonlight. Gay characters these days are so commonplace they're even allowed to have flaws. Still, even as we celebrate the scale and speed of this change, the rates of depression, loneliness and substance abuse in the gay community remain stuck in the same place they've been for decades. Gay people are now, depending on the study, between 2 and 10 times more likely than straight people to take their own lives. We're twice as likely to have a major depressive episode. And just like the last epidemic we lived through, the trauma appears to be concentrated among men. In a survey of gay men who recently arrived in New York City, three-quarters suffered from anxiety or depression, abused drugs or alcohol or were having risky sex—or some combination of the three. Despite all the talk of our chosen families, gay men have fewer close friends than straight people or gay women. In a survey of care-providers at HIV clinics, one respondent told researchers: It's not a question of them not knowing how to save their lives. It's a question of them knowing if their lives are worth saving. I'm not going to pretend to be objective about any of this. I'm a perpetually single gay guy who was raised in a bright blue city by PFLAG parents. I've never known anyone who died of AIDS, I've never experienced direct discrimination and I came out of the closet into a world where marriage, a picket fence and a golden retriever were not just feasible, but expected. I've also been in and out of therapy more times than I've downloaded and deleted Grindr. Marriage equality and the changes in legal status were an improvement for some gay men, says Christopher Stults, a researcher at New York University who studies the differences in mental health between gay and straight men. But for a lot of other people, it was a letdown. Like, we have this legal status, and yet there's still something unfulfilled. This feeling of emptiness, it turns out, is not just an American phenomenon. In the Netherlands, where gay marriage has been legal since 2001, gay men remain three times more likely to suffer from a mood disorder than straight men, and 10 times more likely to engage in suicidal self-harm. In Sweden, which has had civil unions since 1995 and full marriage since 2009, men married to men have triple the suicide rate of men married to women. All of these unbearable statistics lead to the same conclusion: It is still dangerously alienating to go through life as a man attracted to other men. The good news, though, is that epidemiologists and social scientists are closer than ever to understanding all the reasons why.\n\nWhether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. T Travis Salway, a researcher with the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, has spent the last five years trying to figure out why gay men keep killing themselves. The defining feature of gay men used to be the loneliness of the closet, he says. But now you've got millions of gay men who have come out of the closet and they still feel the same isolation. We're having lunch at a hole-in-the-wall noodle bar. It's November, and he arrives wearing jeans, galoshes and a wedding ring. Gay-married, huh? I say. Monogamous even, he says. I think they're gonna give us the key to the city. Salway grew up in Celina, Ohio, a rusting factory town of maybe 10,000 people, the kind of place, he says, where marriage competed with college for the 21-year-olds. He got bullied for being gay before he even knew he was. I was effeminate and I was in choir, he says. That was enough. So he got careful. He had a girlfriend through most of high school, and tried to avoid boys—both romantically and platonically—until he could get out of there. By the late 2000s, he was a social worker and epidemiologist and, like me, was struck by the growing distance between his straight and gay friends. He started to wonder if the story he had always heard about gay men and mental health was incomplete. When the disparity first came to light in the '50s and '60s, doctors thought it was a symptom of homosexuality itself, just one of many manifestations of what was, at the time, known as sexual inversion. As the gay rights movement gained steam, though, homosexuality disappeared from the DSM and the explanation shifted to trauma. Gay men were being kicked out of their own families, their love lives were illegal. Of course they had alarming rates of suicide and depression. That was the idea I had, too, Salway says, that gay suicide was a product of a bygone era, or it was concentrated among adolescents who didn't see any other way out. And then he looked at the data. The problem wasn't just suicide, it wasn't just afflicting teenagers and it wasn't just happening in areas stained by homophobia. He found that gay men everywhere, at every age, have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, incontinence, erectile dysfunction,⁠ allergies and asthma—you name it, we got it. In Canada, Salway eventually discovered, more gay men were dying from suicide than from AIDS, and had been for years. (This might be the case in the U.S. too, he says, but no one has bothered to study it.) We see gay men who have never been sexually or physically assaulted with similar post-traumatic stress symptoms to people who have been in combat situations or who have been raped, says Alex Keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the Fenway Institute's Center for Population Research in LGBT Health. Gay men are, as Keuroghlian puts it, primed to expect rejection. We're constantly scanning social situations for ways we may not fit into them. We struggle to assert ourselves. We replay our social failures on a loop. The weirdest thing about these symptoms, though, is that most of us don't see them as symptoms at all. Since he looked into the data, Salway has started interviewing gay men who attempted suicide and survived. When you ask them why they tried to kill themselves, he says, most of them don't mention anything at all about being gay. Instead, he says, they tell him they're having relationship problems, career problems, money problems. They don't feel like their sexuality is the most salient aspect of their lives. And yet, they're an order of magnitude more likely to kill themselves. The term researchers use to explain this phenomenon is minority stress. In its most direct form, it's pretty simple: Being a member of a marginalized group requires extra effort. When you're the only woman at a business meeting, or the only black guy in your college dorm, you have to think on a level that members of the majority don't. If you stand up to your boss, or fail to, are you playing into stereotypes of women in the workplace? If you don't ace a test, will people think it's because of your race? Even if you don't experience overt stigma, considering these possibilities takes its toll over time. For gay people, the effect is magnified by the fact that our minority status is hidden. Not only do we have to do all this extra work and answer all these internal questions when we're 12, but we also have to do it without being able to talk to our friends or parents about it.

SIGN UP John Pachankis, a stress researcher at Yale, says the real damage gets done in the five or so years between realizing your sexuality and starting to tell other people. Even relatively small stressors in this period have an outsized effect—not because they're directly traumatic, but because we start to expect them. No one has to call you queer for you to adjust your behavior to avoid being called that, Salway says. James, now a mostly-out 20-year-old, tells me that in seventh grade, when he was a closeted 12-year-old, a female classmate asked him what he thought about another girl. Well, she looks like a man, he said, without thinking, so yeah, maybe I would have sex with her. Immediately, he says, he panicked. I was like, did anyone catch that? Did they tell anyone else I said it that way? This is how I spent my adolescence, too: being careful, slipping up, stressing out, overcompensating. Once, at a water park, one of my middle-school friends caught me staring at him as we waited for a slide. Dude, did you just check me out? he said. I managed to deflect—something like Sorry, you're not my type—then I spent weeks afterward worried about what he was thinking about me. But he never brought it up. All the bullying took place in my head. The trauma for gay men is the prolonged nature of it, says William Elder, a sexual trauma researcher and psychologist. If you experience one traumatic event, you have the kind of PTSD that can be resolved in four to six months of therapy. But if you experience years and years of small stressors—little things where you think, Was that because of my sexuality?—that can be even worse. On TV I was seeing all these traditional families, James says. At the same time, I was watching a ton of gay porn. ... So I thought those were my two options. Or, as Elder puts it, being in the closet is like someone having someone punch you lightly on the arm, over and over. At first, it's annoying. After a while, it's infuriating. Eventually, it's all you can think about. And then the stress of dealing with it every day begins to build up in your body. Growing up gay, it seems, is bad for you in many of the same ways as growing up in extreme poverty. A 2015 study found that gay people produce less cortisol, the hormone that regulates stress. Their systems were so activated, so constantly, in adolescence that they ended up sluggish as grownups, says Katie McLaughlin, one of the study's co-authors. In 2014, researchers compared straight and gay teenagers on cardiovascular risk. They found that the gay kids didn't have a greater number of stressful life events (i.e. straight people have problems, too), but the ones they did experience inflicted more harm on their nervous systems. Annesa Flentje, a stress researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, specializes in the effect of minority stress on gene expression. All those little punches combine with our adaptations to them, she says, and become automatic ways of thinking that never get challenged or turned off, even 30 years later. Whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. We don't have the tools to process stress as kids, and we don't recognize it as trauma as adults, says John, a former consultant who quit his job two years ago to make pottery and lead adventure tours in the Adirondacks. Our gut reaction is to deal with things now the way we did as children. Even Salway, who has devoted his career to understanding minority stress, says that there are days when he feels uncomfortable walking around Vancouver with his partner. No one's ever attacked them, but they've had a few assholes yell slurs at them in public. That doesn't have to happen very many times before you start expecting it, before your heart starts beating a little faster when you see a car approaching. But minority stress doesn't fully explain why gay men have such a wide array of health problems. Because while the first round of damage happens before we come out of the closet, the second, and maybe more severe, comes afterward.\n\nYou go from your mom's house to a gay club where a lot of people are on drugs and it's like, this is my community? It's like\n\nthe fucking jungle. N No one ever told Adam not to act effeminate. But he, like me, like most of us, learned it somehow. I never worried about my family being homophobic, he says. I used to do this thing where I would wrap a blanket around myself like a dress and dance around in the backyard. My parents thought it was cute, so they took a video and showed it to my grandparents. When they all watched the tape, I hid behind the couch because I was so ashamed. I must have been six or seven. By the time he got to high school, Adam had learned to manage his mannerisms so well that no one suspected him of being gay. But still, he says, I couldn't trust anyone because I had this thing I was holding. I had to operate in the world as a lone agent. He came out at 16, then graduated, then moved to San Francisco and started working in HIV prevention. But the feeling of distance from other people didn't go away. So he treated it, he says, with lots and lots of sex. It's our most accessible resource in the gay community. You convince yourself that if you're having sex with someone, you're having an intimate moment. That ended up being a crutch. He worked long hours. He would come home exhausted, smoke a little weed, pour a glass of red wine, then start scanning the hookup apps for someone to invite over. Sometimes it would be two or three guys in a row. As soon as I closed the door on the last guy, I'd think, That didn't hit the spot, then I'd find another one. It went on like this for years. Last Thanksgiving, he was back home to visit his parents and felt a compulsive need to have sex because he was so stressed out. When he finally found a guy nearby who was willing to hook up, he ran to his parents' room and started rifling through their drawers to see if they had any Viagra. So that was the rock-bottom moment? I ask. That was the third or fourth, yeah, he says. Adam's now in a 12-step program for sex addiction. It's been six weeks since he's had sex. Before this, the longest he had ever gone was three or four days. There are people who have lots of sex because it's fun, and that's fine. But I kept trying to wring it out like a rag to get something out of it that wasn't in there—social support, or companionship. It was a way of not dealing with my own life. And I kept denying it was a problem because I had always told myself, 'I've come out, I moved to San Francisco, I'm done, I did what I had to do as a gay person.' For decades, this is what psychologists thought, too: that the key stages in identity formation for gay men all led up to coming out, that once we were finally comfortable with ourselves, we could begin building a life within a community of people who'd gone through the same thing. But over the last 10 years, what researchers have discovered is that the struggle to fit in only grows more intense. A study published in 2015 found that rates of anxiety and depression were higher in men who had recently come out than in men who were still closeted. It's like you emerge from the closet expecting to be this butterfly and the gay community just slaps the idealism out of you, Adam says. When he first started coming out, he says, I went to West Hollywood because I thought that's where my people were. But it was really horrifying. It's made by gay adults, and it's not welcoming for gay kids. You go from your mom's house to a gay club where a lot of people are on drugs and it's like, this is my community? It's like the fucking jungle. I came out when I was 17, and I didn't see a place for myself in the gay scene, says Paul, a software developer. I wanted to fall in love like I saw straight people do in movies. But I just felt like a piece of meat. It got so bad that I used to go to the grocery store that was 40 minutes away instead of the one that was 10 minutes away just because I was so afraid to walk down the gay street. The word I hear from Paul, from everyone, is re-traumatized. You grow up with this loneliness, accumulating all this baggage, and then you arrive in the Castro or Chelsea or Boystown thinking you'll finally be accepted for who you are. And then you realize that everyone else here has baggage, too. All of a sudden it's not your gayness that gets you rejected. It's your weight, or your income, or your race. The bullied kids of our youth, Paul says, grew up and became bullies themselves. Gay men in particular are just not very nice to each other, says John, the adventure tour guide. In pop culture, drag queens are known for their takedowns and it's all ha ha ha. But that meanness is almost pathological. All of us were deeply confused or lying to ourselves for a good chunk of our adolescence. But it's not comfortable for us to show that to other people. So we show other people what the world shows us, which is nastiness. Every gay man I know carries around a mental portfolio of all the shitty things other gay men have said and done to him. I arrived to a date once and the guy immediately stood up, said I was shorter than I looked in my pictures and left. Alex, a fitness instructor in Seattle, was told by a guy on his swim team, I'll ignore your face if you fuck me without a condom. Martin, a Brit living in Portland, has gained maybe 10 pounds since he moved there and got a Grindr message—on Christmas Day—that said: You used to be so sexy. It's a shame you messed it up. For other minority groups, living in a community with people like them is linked to lower rates of anxiety and depression. It helps to be close to people who instinctively understand you. But for us, the effect is the opposite. Several studies have found that living in gay neighborhoods predicts higher rates of risky sex and meth use and less time spent on other community activities like volunteering or playing sports. A 2009 study suggested that gay men who were more linked to the gay community were less satisfied with their own romantic relationships. Gay and bisexual men talk about the gay community as a significant source of stress in their lives, Pachankis says. The fundamental reason for this, he says, is that in-group discrimination does more harm to your psyche than getting rejected by members of the majority. It's easy to ignore, roll your eyes and put a middle finger up to straight people who don't like you because, whatever, you don't need their approval anyway. Rejection from other gay people, though, feels like losing your only way of making friends and finding love. Being pushed away from your own people hurts more because you need them more. We're not kidding.\n\nYou should subscribe. SIGN UP The researchers I spoke to explained that gay guys inflict this kind of damage on each other for two main reasons. The first, and the one I heard most frequently, is that gay men are shitty to each other because, basically, we're men. The challenges of masculinity get magnified in a community of men, Pachankis says. Masculinity is precarious. It has to be constantly enacted or defended or collected. We see this in studies: You can threaten masculinity among men and then look at the dumb things they do. They show more aggressive posturing, they start taking financial risks, they want to punch things. This helps explain the pervasive stigma against feminine guys in the gay community. According to Dane Whicker, a clinical psychologist and researcher at Duke, most gay men report that they want to date someone masculine, and that they wished they acted more masculine themselves. Maybe that's because, historically, masculine men have been more able to blend into straight society. Or maybe it's internalized homophobia: Feminine gay men are still stereotyped as bottoms, the receptive partner in anal sex. A two-year longitudinal study found that the longer gay men were out of the closet, the more likely they were to become versatile or tops. Researchers say this kind of training, deliberately trying to appear more masculine and taking on a different sex role, is just one of the ways gay men pressure each other to attain sexual capital, the equivalent of going to the gym or plucking our eyebrows. The only reason I started working out was so I would seem like a feasible top, Martin says. When he first came out, he was convinced that he was too skinny, too effeminate, that bottoms would think he was one of them. So I started faking all this hyper-masculine behavior. My boyfriend noticed recently that I still lower my voice an octave whenever I order drinks. That's a remnant of my first few years out of the closet, when I thought I had to speak in this Christian Bale Batman voice to get dates. Grant, a 21-year-old who grew up on Long Island and now lives in Hell's Kitchen, says he used to be self-conscious about the way he stood—hands on hips, one leg slightly cocked like a Rockette. So, his sophomore year, he started watching his male teachers for their default positions, deliberately standing with his feet wide, his arms at his sides. These masculinity norms exert a toll on everyone, even their perpetrators. Feminine gay men are at higher risk of suicide, loneliness and mental illness. Masculine gay men, for their part, are more anxious, have more risky sex and use drugs and tobacco with greater frequency. One study investigating why living in the gay community increases depression found that the effect only showed up in masculine gay guys. The second reason the gay community acts as a unique stressor on its members is not about why we reject each other, but how. In the last 10 years, traditional gay spaces—bars, nightclubs, bathhouses—have begun to disappear, and have been replaced by social media. At least 70 percent of gay men now use hookup apps like Grindr and Scruff to meet each other. In 2000, around 20 percent of gay couples met online. By 2010, that was up to 70 percent. Meanwhile, the share of gay couples who met through friends dropped from 30 percent to 12 percent. Usually when you hear about the shocking primacy of hookup apps in gay life—Grindr, the most popular, says its average user spends 90 minutes per day on it—it's in some panicked media story about murderers or homophobes trawling them for victims, or about the troubling chemsex scenes that have sprung up in London and New York. And yes, those are problems. But the real effect of the apps is quieter, less remarked-upon and, in a way, more profound: For many of us, they have become the primary way we interact with other gay people. It's so much easier to meet someone for a hookup on Grindr than it is to go to a bar by yourself, Adam says. Especially if you've just moved to a new city, it's so easy to let the dating apps become your social life. It's harder to look for social situations where you might have to make more of an effort. I have moments when I want to feel desired and so I get on Grindr, Paul says. I upload a shirtless picture and I start getting these messages telling me I'm hot. It feels good in the moment, but nothing ever comes of it, and those messages stop coming after a few days. It feels like I'm scratching an itch, but it's scabies. It's just going to spread. The worst thing about the apps, though, and why they're relevant to the health disparity between gay and straight men, is not just that we use them a lot. It is that they are almost perfectly designed to underline our negative beliefs about ourselves. In interviews that Elder, the post-traumatic stress researcher, conducted with gay men in 2015, he found that 90 percent said they wanted a partner who was tall, young, white, muscular and masculine. For the vast majority of us who barely meet one of those criteria, much less all five, the hookup apps merely provide an efficient way to feel ugly. Paul says he's electrified waiting for rejection as soon as he opens them. John, the former consultant, is 27, 6-foot-1 and has a six-pack you can see through his wool sweater. And even he says most of his messages don't get replies, that he spends probably 10 hours talking to people on the app for every one hour he spends meeting for coffee or a hookup. It's worse for gay men of color. Vincent, who runs counseling sessions with black and Latino men through the San Francisco Department of Public Health, says the apps give racial minorities two forms of feedback: Rejected (Sorry, I'm not into black guys) and fetishized (Hi, I'm really into black guys.) Paihan, a Taiwanese immigrant in Seattle, shows me his Grindr inbox. It is, like mine, mostly hellos he has sent out to no reply. One of the few messages he received just says, Asiiiaaaan. None of this is new, of course. Walt Odets, a psychologist who's been writing about social isolation since the 1980s, says that gay men used to be troubled by the bathhouses in the same way they are troubled by Grindr now. The difference he sees in his younger patients is that if someone rejected you at a bathhouse, you could still have a conversation afterwards. Maybe you end up with a friend out of it, or at least something that becomes a positive social experience. On the apps, you just get ignored if someone doesn't perceive you as a sexual or romantic conquest. The gay men I interviewed talked about the dating apps the same way straight people talk about Comcast: It sucks, but what are you gonna do? You have to use the apps in smaller cities, says Michael Moore, a psychologist at Yale. They serve the purpose of a gay bar. But the downside is that they put all this prejudice out there. What the apps reinforce, or perhaps simply accelerate, is the adult version of what Pachankis calls the Best Little Boy in the World Hypothesis. As kids, growing up in the closet makes us more likely to concentrate our self-worth into whatever the outside world wants us to be—good at sports, good at school, whatever. As adults, the social norms in our own community pressure us to concentrate our self-worth even further—into our looks, our masculinity, our sexual performance. But then, even if we manage to compete there, even if we attain whatever masc-dom-top ideal we're looking for, all we've really done is condition ourselves to be devastated when we inevitably lose it. We often live our lives through the eyes of others, says Alan Downs, a psychologist and the author of The Velvet Rage, a book about gay men's struggle with shame and social validation. We want to have man after man, more muscles, more status, whatever brings us fleeting validation. Then we wake up at 40, exhausted, and we wonder, Is that all there is? And then the depression comes.
After years on reality TV, Whitney Port has found a new outlet through which she can share her life: commenting on the highs and lows of motherhood.\n\nShe and her husband, producer Tim Rosenman, post videos on YouTube about their lives as parents. Port, in particular, offers an honest look at motherhood in a series called I Love My Baby, But... Considering her candid commentary ― It feels like someone's, like, slicing my nipples with glass, she says about breastfeeding in a video posted in August ― it's no surprise that relatable is a word that frequently crops up in the comments section.\n\nThe fashion designer and former star of The Hills participated in a panel on Wednesday that was hosted by baby product brand Water Wipes and featured the parenting site Motherly.\n\nWhen [Water Wipes] reached out wanting to partner, I was so excited because I could actually speak organically about it, she told HuffPost while wearing a necklace that spelled out the name of her baby, Sonny, who is almost 6 months old.\n\nOrganically sums up a lot of the way Port shares her views on parenting.\n\nBill Davila On Wednesday, TV personality and fashion designer Whitney Port attended an event hosted by Water Wipes.\n\nPort sat down with HuffPost at the event to chat more about motherhood, her departure from reality TV and her current favorite children's books.\n\nWhat are your go-to parenting hacks?\n\nSince you can't keep a blanket in the bed, I dress Sonny in a long-sleeved onesie underneath his pajamas. I know that sounds really simple, but I don't think it's something that maybe a lot of parents do.\n\nAnother thing I use is coconut oil on the baby's skin. I do a little rubdown after every bath and give him a little baby massage. And coconut oil is something that doesn't cost a lot of money; you can get it in the grocery store.\n\nWhy did you decide to be so open about motherhood in your videos and social media posts?\n\nHonestly, I owe it all to my husband. After I was on reality TV, after that whole phase of my life was over, I really didn't want to do anything reality TV-related ever again. My husband is a producer and he works in development, and when I was in my first trimester I was really sick, really unhappy, and not that thrilled about my situation. And he said, Whitney, I know this may not be something you want to do, but we have the camera. Why don't we start filming what you're going through? Because I feel like if you're going through this, you're not the first person. There has to be so many other people going through this.\n\nSo he started filming me, and you can see in the first episode I'm in bed with crusty yogurt around my mouth, totally disheveled. And we put it out there and the response was crazy.\n\nWhat's it like working with your husband on this parenting content?\n\nIt's hard. In terms of our romantic relationship and as partners in life, it's amazing. How we are different complements each other. When it comes to working, it's a little bit challenging. We obviously did not get into a marriage to then also work with each other, but because he knows how to operate a camera and edit as a producer, it was very natural that he fell into the role for this.\n\nHe wants to get things done right away. He's not a procrastinator. He has a very strong work ethic. I'm a procrastinator. I can get really lazy. It's not something a lot of people would think, but I constantly put things off. I wait until the last minute to do everything and because of that, we clash sometimes.\n\nIt seems like overall you make a good team when working together.\n\nWe do, we get over that. It's not that big of a deal, but yes, it works. Also for him to be on the other side of the camera, it gets the most raw, real version of me. If there was just a producer talking to me on the other end, you wouldn't get the same answers. It's nice that I can really feel comfortable being brutally honest because it's only him in the room.\n\nBill Davila At the event, Port offered a sweet explanation about what it means to be a parent.\n\nIf you had to sum up motherhood in one word, what would it be?\n\nI don't want to be cheesy, and it's so hard to do it in one word. It's obviously challenging, but very fulfilling at the same time. It's intense. In every way, it's extreme.\n\nWhat's your go-to children's book at the moment?\n\nI just got this book when I was in Florida called My Grandma Lives in Florida, and it is the cutest book. It has such great illustrations, and it's a really good poem. And then I just got this other book called I Am Peace, which is all about being mindful. It's a really important message, I think, to teach children.\n\nWhat's been the most surprising thing about motherhood?\n\nProbably the breastfeeding. Before I had the baby, everyone was like, Are you going to breastfeed? And I was like, Yeah, if the milk comes in. I had no idea how challenging it was going to be. I seriously thought the milk comes in, you put the baby on the boob, and it just sucks and you feed the baby. I thought it was as simple as that. I didn't realize pumping was a situation, I didn't realize the pain you would go through, I didn't realize the time commitment, I had no idea it was going to be as challenging as it was.\n\nWhat topics can your fans expect to see in your upcoming videos?\n\nWe definitely want to grow with Sonny, and I feel like there's always going to be a plethora of content because there's always a new stage. I feel like there's going to be so much in terms of Sonny's growth, but I do want to expand the channel into doing other things. This past weekend we did a day in the life video, and I think people want to see just what a typical day looks like.
Just one month after setting a wedding date, Princess Beatrice and her fiancé, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, are having to rethink their plans.\n\nBuckingham Palace released a statement on Wednesday regarding changes to the upcoming royal wedding in light of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Mr Mapelli Mozzi are very much looking forward to getting married but are equally aware of the need to avoid undertaking any unnecessary risks in the current circumstances, a palace spokesperson said.\n\nThey are particularly conscious of government advice in relation to both the wellbeing of older family members and large gatherings of people, the statement said.\n\nTherefore, the planned reception in the Buckingham Palace Gardens will not take place, the statement continued. It has not yet been determined whether the nuptials themselves will be delayed, as the couple will carefully consider government advice before deciding whether a private marriage might take place amongst a small group of family and friends.\n\nThis is reportedly the third time that Beatrice and Mapelli Mozzi will have to change their wedding plans. An anonymous source told People magazine in February that the dates were changed following media scrutiny of Prince Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe date was changed two times to adjust [around Andrew's scandal], an anonymous source told the outlet at the time. It will be smaller than the original plan.\n\nBut don't worry about the couple's long-term plans. As Princess Eugenie said when her sister announced her engagement, You two are meant to be.\n\nSubscribe to HuffPost's Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond).
(Photo credit: http://www.q2l.org)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne chilly morning last January, twenty-five eighth-graders sat on the floor of a classroom in a brick building in Manhattan's Chelsea district, shouting at each other. They were playing a game called Socratic Smackdown, which calls for group of four students to debate the meaning of a particular text in front of their peers.\n\nWhile they do so, the class keeps score: you get one point for agreeing with someone, one point for disagreeing with them, two points each for agreeing/disagreeing and explaining why, and three points for using references from the text to support your argument. Anyone who cuts someone else off is docked two points.\n\nThe text today was a poem—The Hangman, by Maurice Ogden. A tall, blonde-haired boy in the middle of the room was trying to make the case that the eponymous hangman was clearly supposed to symbolize death. Before he was done making his point, the girl next to him interrupted. You're reading the text wrong, she said. Some of the students snickered. A student pointed out that he'd have to deduct two points because she'd interrupted. She shook her head. I don't care. I can't sit here and listen to him talk about symbolism when he is so obviously wrong. The class cheered.\n\nThis is Quest to Learn, a public secondary school where the teaching curriculum is modeled on game design principles. Students in each class undertake a series of missions through the semester, broken up into smaller quests. (Think of it as one large problem broken up into a series of smaller problems.) Missions and quests are designed by the school's teachers, and are in line with state-set standards. The overall mission of this English class was to write a dystopian story. It was called The Writer Games, after The Hunger Games. The teacher had been known to come to class dressed as Effie Trinket, the escort of the District 12 tributes in the books. Today's quest called for analyzing current dystopian fiction, hence Ogden's poem.\n\nSign up for more essays, interviews and excerpts from Thought Matters.\n\nThoughtMatters is a partnership between Macmillan Publishers and Huffington Post\n\nIn another classroom down the hall, a sixth-grade class was playing games on government-issued MacBooks. The teacher, a young woman with shiny black hair in a peach-colored power suit, said this semester's mission was to pick a real Supreme Court case and have the class argue both sides, with three of their peers serving as judges. Students have the whole semester to prepare their case, while the judges are tasked with reading up on the issue to ensure a fair and balanced decision. Last year's class had the same mission; the case they picked was Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark 2015 case in support of marriage equality. We nearly had a riot with that one, the teacher confessed. The kids who were assigned to argue against it were incensed. They didn't understand how anyone could oppose a basic human right.\n\nClasses at Quest to Learn also have unconventional names: Sports for the Mind stands in for media arts, and The Way Things Work is the rough equivalent of mathematics. In this semester's Sports for the Mind, the students must save New York from a fictional apocalypse by designing a role-playing game. Quests involve discussing infrastructure and the different roles city officials play to keep a city safe during emergencies. (Hurricane Sandy provided ample real-world examples.) A floor below, kids in a fourth-grade were designing their own superheroes on a complex-looking graphics program. My superhero is a girl, a young boy with curly blonde hair said, stepping aside so we could see his screen. Because there aren't enough girls kicking butt.\n\nA partnership between learning design studio Institute of Play and the Department of Education in New York City, Quest to Learn opened in 2009 with funding from The MacArthur Foundation. There's a lottery each year to get in. There are some 650 students, spread across middle school and high school. Class sizes are big, with around 30 kids per class. The school shares building space with six other 'experimental' schools; one is visual arts-focused, another is tech-focused.\n\nHigh school students at Quest are given harder missions, and they 'level-up' faster than middle-schoolers. The gaming terminology also extends to grades—there's no A, B, or C grades at Quest. Instead, it's Novice, Apprentice, Senior, and Master. The idea is that this holds more meaning for the students, motivating them in a way that random letters can't. Teachers employ real-world examples whenever possible. One art and design mission involved energy-efficient food trucks. In ninth grade biology, students spend the year as workers in a fictional biotech company, where their job is to clone dinosaurs and create stable ecosystems. As in many games, there's also a 'boss level' mission. It usually takes place before the end of a semester, and involves teams of about 15 students undertaking a weeklong challenge. Last semester it was a recycled fashion show; before that, to create a functioning Rube Goldberg machine.\n\nQuest to Learn students participate in the same standardized tests as the rest of the country; according to the Institute of Play, which commissioned a study from Florida State University into how well Quest students ranked among their peers, in the first 20 months, students at Quest showed significant gains in systems thinking skills.\n\nMany people hear about Quest to Learn and think that students sit around playing video games all day. That's only partly true: digital game playing makes up around 20 percent of the curriculum. It's usually games with an educational bent, like MineCraft, or Dr. Smallz, where students take on the role of designers, scientists, doctors, and detectives to explore cellular biology and the human body. Ninth graders play Storyweavers, a collaborative role-playing game.\n\nThe appeal of the Quest to Learn curriculum is similar to that of a well-designed game: it requires participation and interaction, and there's immediate feedback. Challenge is a constant, and learning is achieved as much through failure as through success. Ross Flatt, a former assistant principal at Quest to Learn and one of its founding teachers, said the kids who thrive at Quest are often the ones who don't mind making mistakes. Imagination and play are important, but the real key is collaboration and a desire to be challenged in a way that sometimes isn't possible in other school environments. (The school has an advisory program for new students, to help them—and their parents—understand how the school operates. It consists of sample missions and quests.) Teachers too, need to be onboard. We look for teachers who are okay with letting go of absolute control, Flatt said. Who can command respect while allowing the students to explore things beyond what's written down. And who don't mind going on tangents.\n\nFlatt receives hundreds of requests every week from teachers and schools around the country who want to implement Quest to Learn's teaching model. Recently, a Chicago school asked for Quest's entire curriculum, and tried to integrate it into their existing one. It didn't work out. The teachers were not given sufficient training, and students were often confused. This is a concept that requires everyone to not just be onboard and willing, but to actually understand why things are done in this way, Flatt said.\n\nIn recent years, forward-thinking educators like Flatt have helped build significant interest in the educational benefits of playing and designing video games. There is now increasing acceptance that the process of game making—the structuring of a world with constrained rules--enhances thinking and problem solving.\n\n\n\nThis is an edited excerpt from Power Play, a book by Asi Burak and Laura Parker.

PeopleImages via Getty Images Organizing and getting rid of clutter can improve your mental health and your marriage.\n\nTidy house, happy spouse? It may sound like a silly little saying, but it could hold a surprising amount of truth.\n\nOne example of how a disorganized home can take a toll on a couple's relationship pops up in the first episode of the Netflix series Tidying Up With Marie Kondo. Married couple Rachel and Kevin Friend say that, in addition to money, keeping the house clean is the biggest source of contention in their relationship. As parents of two young kids, laundry, dishes and clutter quickly pile up around them. Because they're frustrated and overwhelmed by the disorganization, they nitpick at each other and don't always give the best of themselves to their children.\n\nKondo takes the couple through her KonMari method, described in her best-selling book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, which involves sorting through your belongings based on category (rather than room by room), only holding onto items that spark joy and donating or discarding the rest.\n\nAfterward, Rachel and Kevin comment on how much calmer things feel for them now that they've de-cluttered. They've established a designated place for their belongings and a system for keeping it that way. They are kinder and more patient with one another and the kids.\n\nIt's been nice because now we know how to do everything and we're not coming down on each other, Rachel told Kveller.com. Now, when there's something to put away, instead of, 'I'm going to wait for him to do it,' or 'I'm going to wait for her,' it's like, 'I'm just going to put this away because it makes me feel better.'\n\nCan keeping a tidy home ― whether using the KonMari method or some other system that works for you ― really have a profound, lasting effect on your relationship? We asked a KonMari consultant and two therapists to discuss.\n\nUnderstandably, keeping a tidy house is a struggle for many couples.\n\nThese days, couples can run themselves ragged trying to juggle everything: demanding jobs, children (if they have them), relationships with friends and family, their relationship with each other, grocery shopping, meal prep, laundry, staying on top of bills, all while trying to care for their own mental and physical health. So they prioritize and tackle only what absolutely has to get done on any given day. The rest — including tidying up — can wait.\n\nKeeping an organized home seems very daunting, and for people with a lot on their plates, it can easily fall between the cracks, psychologist Samantha Rodman told HuffPost. Since keeping the house clean isn't 'urgent,' it gets shelved in favor of more time-sensitive issues, like getting to work on time.\n\nIn some relationships, both partners agree they want to get organized, but they just can't seem to find the time or energy to make it happen. Other couples have a different predicament: one partner is a neat freak overwhelmed by a messy living space, while other is unfazed by — or even enjoys — the clutter.\n\nI recall one couple where the wife, a writer, felt like she couldn't concentrate on her work unless the kitchen was clean and the laundry folded, while her husband said he worked best when his desk was a disaster and the garage was 'in process,' psychologist Ryan Howes said. This conflict in styles and needs certainly contributes to interpersonal distress.\n\nBut the clutter can really mess with you and your relationship.\n\nTidying up may seem low-priority when compared to completing a big work project on deadline or taking a sick kid to the doctor. But the cumulative effect of a cluttered living space can actually be detrimental to your mental and physical health, making you feel stressed, overwhelmed, anxious and guilty.\n\nThat stress and anxiety can affect the way you treat your partner, making you less patient and understanding and more prone to snippiness, nitpicking and passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nLooking at excessive clutter can make you feel defeated, said KonMari consultant Caitlin Roberts. You don't know where to begin so you don't begin at all. It feels like the work around the house is never done and never will be.\n\nA messy home can make us feel overwhelmed, helpless and anxious, she said. Often times I find couples have different ideas of where an item 'belongs' within the home. Frustration arises when an item cannot be located and tensions build within the partnership. The results are cluttered counter tops, stuffed drawers and repeated purchasing of the same 'lost' items.\n\nTidying up can benefit your relationship on a number of levels.\n\nWith the KonMari method, it's not about dedicating a weekend every month to sorting through all the clutter and then slowly letting it accumulate again. It's about finding a home for each item and creating a system that you're actually able to maintain. The initial task may be daunting, especially if you have a lot of stuff, but the payoff can be big.\n\nOnce a home is organized and easy to maintain, a huge amount of pressure is relieved from everyday life and, by association, the relationship itself, Roberts said. A decluttered space clears the way, both mentally and physically, for the couple to spend more quality time together. Furthermore, the decluttering process at home opens the door for the couple be more conscientious in many other aspects of their life.\n\nAnd isn't that what we all want? To free up more space and time to just enjoy each other and the life you built together?\n\nWhen both partners in a relationship are on board with this philosophy, it certainly allows for more time and money to spend on shared experiences and quality time to talk, dream and relate to one another, Howes said. If you have four shirts to clean instead of two dozen, that means more time to spend with your partner.\n\nIn the show, Kondo also recommends turning the tidying rituals themselves into an opportunity to reconnect. You can catch up on your day while you put away the dishes or get the kids involved in folding laundry.\n\nHow to keep it up\n\nThe beginning of a new year is a time many people make an effort to organize or de-clutter ― but how can you keep it going, instead of falling back into your old, messy ways?

Back in the day, getting married meant that once some mules, hay and gold changed hands, you left your family for the first time and were off to start a whole new life. Today, most modern American couples live in sin long before they make it official. This left us wondering: How much does getting married these days really change a relationship? Here, seven legally wed folks — from two months in to six years deep — share their experiences.\n\nZELLE DUDA/UNSPLASH\n\nFor us, we're way more content with just hanging out together doing nothing than we were pre-marriage. Less FOMO, you could say. (Otherwise everything is pretty much the same.) - Katherine, married two months\n\nAt first things didn't feel any different, as we had already lived together and had been dating for nine years before we got married. But a few months in is when I noticed a bit of a change. It seems obvious, but we simply hold more responsibility toward one another now. We're both fairly independent people, so making all these major decisions together, like merging bank accounts and logistically talking about where we want to live in the next three to five years, has opened the doors to what true communication and compromise means (not like the old days of talking in hypotheticals or deciding what Ben & Jerry's flavor to eat that night). Compromise has been the biggest, hardest and most rewarding difference. - Angela, married six months\n\nA lot of my girlfriends asked me how things had changed after getting married, but TBH I felt like the only thing that really changed was that all the time we used to spend talking about wedding planning we now spend talking about other relationship milestones like moving, buying a place, etc. Otherwise it's the exact same (except with way nicer kitchenware). - Alexia, married one and a half years\n\nFor me, getting married really didn't change our relationship—we were already living together, and I think moving in was the bigger OMG moment in our lives. Still, I do feel like we operate as more of a team since getting married. No more empty threats while fighting, for example. - Rachel, married two years\n\nI didn't feel any different as a woman who was dating to becoming a woman who was engaged and then to a woman who is now married. My husband feels the same way. But, we did feel a much broader effect on our relationship. There's an awareness that, moving forward as we go through life, we're in this together as a team, no matter the circumstance. It's not a change we felt overnight or in our daily interactions, but an overall feeling. - Rachel (a different one), married two and a half years\n\nI'm currently married, and I was married once before this. When I married my first wife, it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship, to the point where the act of getting married seemed to make it clear we weren't right for each other. When I got married for the second time, it definitely felt more like the ideal progression of our relationship. We became stronger as a couple as a result. - Chris, married five years\n\nThe biggest change for us was that, for better or worse, once we got married we decided to divide and conquer and make sure each family task was handled by the more adept person. Like, I'm really good with bills and budgeting and he's not, so that's my domain, and he doesn't have to worry about it. And he's a terrific cook... meaning I haven't really looked at an oven in five years. I handle our social calendar. He handles anything to do with the car. The plus side is that most things get done quickly and efficiently, with minimal fighting. The down side is that I have no idea how to pump gas anymore. - Jillian, married 5 years
The firing of a Tennessee pastor by the United Methodist Church after leaders discovered she performed a lesbian wedding has spotlighted divisions within America's third-largest religious denomination over its stance on homosexuality.\n\nAnna Golladay was licensed by the UMC's Holston Conference to serve at the St. Marks and St. Elmo churches in Chattanooga, two congregations predominantly composed of queer Christians and their allies. A local district committee on ministry voted to rescind Golladay's license on Feb. 26, after an anonymous source shared a photo of the pastor from the same-sex wedding.\n\nCongregants were deeply upset when they heard the news, according to Rev. Gary Ihfe, lead pastor of both churches.\n\nWords were shouted, tears were shed, hugs were given, and prayers were said, Ihfe wrote in a March 5 Facebook post. I am so sorry for the pain that is being felt by many of our families who feel as though they have come under attack.\n\nGolladay said her congregations have been irreparably harmed by the decision.\n\nThe pain doled out by The United Methodist Church must stop, she wrote in a blog post. The continued minimization of our queer friends is not acceptable and should boil up in us a level of outrage that we can no longer control.\n\nThe UMC, which has more than 7 million members in the U.S., forbids its pastors to officiate same-sex weddings. The UMC's Book of Discipline, which details its laws and doctrines, states that the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.\n\nDisagreements about that approach toward homosexuality have caused deep ruptures within the denomination. Some factions of the American church are in favor of allowing same-sex marriages and accepting gay clergy members, but many UMC leaders from Africa and Asia oppose those moves.\n\nSt. Marks and St. Elmo are part of the Reconciling Ministries Network, a U.S.-based organization that works for the inclusion of LGBTQ people in the UMC.\n\nUMC bishops are currently reviewing suggestions on how to keep the church united despite its disagreements over sexuality. The bishops will present their final recommendation to the denomination's top decision-making body, the General Conference, in February 2019.\n\nJan Lawrence, the network's executive director, criticized the firing of Golladay while the church is still debating its approach toward homosexuality.\n\nThis action was unnecessary, and deprived two churches of a beloved pastor without any input from the congregations, Lawrence said in a statement. Actions taken against clergy and licensed local pastors during this period, while the Council of Bishops is working on their recommendation to the church, serve only to cause harm.\n\nIn her blog post, Golladay said that she began serving at St. Marks in 2016 and at St. Elmo's in 2017. Golladay was appointed to these churches as a licensed local pastor, which means she was technically not ordained in the UMC. Instead, she was permitted to preach, conduct worship and perform other duties of a pastor at those specific congregations.\n\nGolladay said that the two women whose wedding she performed are members of one of her churches. One of them has been part of it for many years, giving her whole self to ensure the success of the community, Golladay said.\n\nRev. Randy Martin, superintendent for the UMC's Scenic South District, confirmed to HuffPost that he was sent a photo from the wedding and a copy of the women's marriage license.\n\nMartin turned the issue over to the local district committee on ministry, a church body tasked with reviewing the certification of licensed pastors.\n\nAnna made the decision to violate her oath to abide by the Discipline, Martin told HuffPost in an email. The District Committee on Ministry upheld their responsibility to hold clergy accountable by revoking her credentials.
Christine Diane Tiegen, better known to most of us as Chrissy Teigen, is a model, cookbook author, TV host and one of the funniest people on Twitter.\n\nShe's been married to John Legend, whose real name is actually John Roger Stephens, since 2013. After their wedding in Italy, Teigen ― for one reason or another ― kept her last name and didn't become Chrissy Legend.\n\nRecently, a Twitter user posted a question asking why women didn't take their husband's last names after marriage. Teigen hilariously responded and broke it down in just eight words.\n\nMy husband didn't even take his last name? the 32-year-old said, referring to the fact that even John goes by a stage name (which was originally his nickname at the University of Pennsylvania).\n\nTwitter\n\nThat settles that.\n\nTeigen and Legend have a daughter together, named Luna, and she has John's real last name: Luna Simone Stephens. The two are expecting another child together, a baby boy, who will presumably also have the last name Stephens.\n\nThough they've got the last name picked out, the two were still deciding on a name for their new addition just a few months ago.\n\nWe love going the music route [for names], Teigen told People in January, before she publicly confirmed she was having a boy. John loves looking at who he grew up with or people he grew up listening to. And maybe we'll have a little baby Todd Smith, I don't know. Maybe we'll have a little Simone.\n\nIt's hard. We're like, 'Ella Fitzgerald, that's such a pretty name!' We go back and forth on everything but this isn't our only baby so we're going to divide up the names, she added.
Jay-Z and his mother Gloria Carter will be honored at the GLAAD Media Awards this year following Carter bravely coming out in her son's critically acclaimed track Smile, GLAAD announced last week.\n\nThe Special Recognition category for the awards, which recognize fair, accurate and inclusive representations of LGBTQ individuals over the past year, is typically quite varied.\n\nAlong with Jay-Z, the animated short In a Heartbeat will be honored this year. Last year, honorees included Her Story, a short form dramedy series about two trans women in LA, We've Been Around, a series of short films highlighting trans figures throughout history, and Sin ir más lejos, a song by Gema Corredera about queer love.\n\nThe song from Jay-Z's Grammy-nominated album 4:44 was the first time the rapper and his mom openly discussed her lesbian identity. In centering LGBTQ representation, Smile stands apart from a genre with an embedded history of homophobia.\n\nFollowing a sample from Stevie Wonder's Love's in Need of Love Today, Jay-Z raps the lines, Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian and Cried tears of joy when you fell in love / Don't matter to me if it's a him or her.\n\nToward the end of the track, Carter recites a poem about her experience. She writes: No harm for them, no harm for me / But life is short, and it's time to be free / Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed.\n\nIn September 2017, Carter also spoke about the song and coming out to her son in an interview with the D'USSE Friday podcast. For her, the conversation was a long time coming.\n\nI just finally started telling Jay who I was, she said. 'Besides your mother, this is the person that I am. This is the life that I live.' So my son started actually tearing. He's like, 'That had to be a horrible life, ma.' I was like, my life was never horrible.\n\nI was never ashamed of me, she added.\n\nSmile isn't the first time Jay-Z has spoken out about LGBTQ issues. In 2012, he expressed his support of same-sex marriage during an interview with CNN.\n\nWhat people do in their own homes is their business and you can choose to love whoever you love, he said. That's their business. [It] is no different than discriminating against blacks. It's discrimination plain and simple.\n\nThe song, and much of 4:44, was presented as an exploration of truth. In other tracks, Jay explores his relationship with toxic masculinity and opens up about his infamous affair. The album currently leads the Grammy pack with 8 nominations, including one for album of the year.\n\nThe 29th Annual GLAAD Media Awards will take place April 12 in Los Angeles and again on May 5 in New York.
Maybe it was the chicken by the sea — but apparently it wasn't the Lacheys who sent Jessica Simpson a gift.\n\nNick and Vanessa Lachey were having a totally normal Today Q&A on Monday when things took a turn for the weird when host Hoda Kotb brought up Nick Lachey's ex-wife, Simpson.\n\nLast week, Kotb interviewed Simpson when the I Wanna Love You Forever singer dropped by the studio to promote her upcoming memoir, Open Book. During the chat, Simpson spoke about her marriage to Nick Lachey, the subject of the MTV reality series Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica that ran from 2003-2005. The couple divorced in 2006.\n\nSimpson told Kotb that in the book she writes about her experiences of being abused as a child and developing issues with alcoholism as an adult.\n\nKotb, in turn, asked Nick Lachey about Simpson's abuse and alcohol revelations. Kotb also causally mentioned to the Lacheys that Simpson told her that she and Nick Lachey were on good terms, and that he and Vanessa Lachey had even sent her something beautiful after one of her kid's births.\n\nI honestly haven't read the book, so I don't know what she said or what she revealed, Nick Lachey said in response to Kotb's question. [We were together] a long time ago and we've all moved on —\n\nI feel bad, I'm sorry, Vanessa Lachey suddenly said, cutting off Nick Lachey. You said somebody sent her [something?]\n\nThen, Vanessa Lachey, clearly flustered by Simpson's claim that they had sent her a gift, continued to express her confusion by stammering, We — I …'cause now it's like, did we? It wasn't us, but thank you to whoever sent it from us!\n\nScreen shot via Today/YouTube\n\nAs Kotb tried to clarify what Simpson had told to her, the Lacheys were still clearly baffled.\n\nI don't know her address, Vanessa Lachey finally said. But thank you whoever sent it from us!\n\nWell, at least that moment wasn't as awkward as this famous clip from Newlyweds:
by Jillian Kramer, BRIDES\n\n\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of CNP Montrose\n\nIt's time to add a few things to your pre-wedding to-do list. Because, according to our experts, the months before you get married should be more about discovering your true desires and setting yourself up for success rather than picking out a color palette. Here are eight things you must do before the big day.\n\n1. Figure out what you want from life.\n\n\n\nChristine Arylo, motivational speaker and author of Choosing Me Before We, warns that it can be difficult to choose the right mate before we've had the chance to clearly define what we want our own lives to look like. The truth is, she says, it's easy to fall in love but much harder to find a partner who supports you. When you know what you want from your own life, however, you are much more likely to choose someone you love and who is a good match to help you create that life.\n\n2. Get on the same page with your significant other.\n\n\n\nEverything from how to handle your finances to whether you want children, and what kind of lifestyle you crave -- now is the time to talk it out and get on the same page with your significant other, says Janet Ong Zimmerman, relationship coach and creator of Love for Successful Women. These areas are fundamental, she says, and when both people are on the same page, this increases the probability for a long and happy marriage When couples assume things will work out without having these conversations, life and marriage become more challenging.\n\n3. Create a strong social circle.\n\n\n\nYou may not realize it, but your female friends have a strong impact on the success of your relationship, says Arylo. If you go into a marriage without a strong, supportive tribe of sisters, you'll set yourself up to over-rely on your spouse and look to him or her to be everything to you, she warns. No one person can be everything. A strong circle of friends will keep you connected to yourself, out of isolation, and out of the potential to lose yourself in your marriage.\n\n4. Set yourself up for financial success.\n\n\n\nIt's not uncommon to come into a marriage carrying debt. But, says Zimmerman, the more debt you can eliminate and the more money you can save before your marriage, the better off you will be. Why? Not only will it reduce the potential for financial fights, but also, if something were to happen to your spouse or if your marriage doesn't last, it's always in your best interest to be able to take care of yourself, says Zimmerman.\n\n5. Travel to another country.\n\n\n\nSays Arylo, There is something about world travel that is different from flying to another part of your own country. It expands your horizons, heightens your independence, and instills within you a confidence and a sense of the world being a much bigger place than just what you know. With those emotions and experiences under our belt, she says, you will also a sense of infinite possibility. That means if you hit a rocky patch in your marriage or you find yourselves stuck in a rut, you have the tools and perspective within you to realize there are way more opportunities in the world, Arylo explains. It gives you freedom.\n\n6. Learn how to be okay with uncertainty.\n\n\n\nDo you believe that once you tie the knot everything will fall into place? If so, it may be time to realign your thinking. Marriage is the start of a different journey, one that requires being content with the uncertainty that comes from a disagreement, from not knowing what's going to happen, and from dynamics that can change as months and years go by, says Zimmerman. Being OK with uncertainty will help every woman experience more ease, embrace change, and allow things to unfold naturally.\n\n7. Ask yourself why you want to be married.\n\n\n\nAnd be honest with your answer, Arylo cautions. There is a lot of social pressure to get married, she points out. And if you are getting married to achieve the next milestone or to lock in the guy or girl, it's a reason that is full of future misery. If it's about anyone other than you and the person you are going to marry creating a life you both love together, it is potentially a mistake that could cost you a lot.\n\n8. Know who you really are.\n\n\n\nSays Zimmerman, You must know yourself at the core of who you are. This means honoring your values, what's most important to you, and your boundaries. Keeping a strong sense of what makes you you, says Zimmerman, will make sure you stay true to who you are, maintaining your self-confidence and self-worth. And when you're confident and know your worth, the energy you radiate is extremely appealing and irresistible to your partner.

A GOP lawmaker wants to fund President Donald Trump's border wall by squeezing money out of every Arizonan who patronizes pornographic websites.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Gail Griffin, R-Hereford, recently introduced House Bill 2444, which would require electronics manufacturers to preinstall porn-blocking software on all electronic devices bought or sold in the state, the Arizona Mirror reported.\n\nTo deactivate the blocking software, a person would have to prove they are at least 18 years old and pay a one-time fee of $20 to the Arizona Commerce Authority. Manufacturers or retailers could also charge a fee for disabling it, according to the bill. Anyone who deactivates the blocker themselves would face a misdemeanor charge.\n\nThe money collected by the state, according to the proposal, would form a number of grants, which would, among other things, help sex abuse victims and fund the president's proposed border wall.\n\nPete Marovich via Getty Images The government Tuesday is in its 32nd day of a partial shutdown, as President Donald Trump and Democratic lawmakers continue to butt heads over his demand for funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe bill defines pornographic content as patently offensive material that lacks literary, artistic, political or scientific value. It references the banning of revenge porn websites and addresses specific anatomical areas that cannot be visible in images:\n\nLess than completely and opaquely covered human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola [and] human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, whether covered or uncovered.\n\nMike Stabile, a spokesman for the Free Speech Coalition, told the Arizona Mirror the proposal amounts to a tax on media content and would violate the First Amendment.\n\nIt's pretty clearly unconstitutional, said Stabile, whose organization advocates for the adult entertainment industry.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Arizona Senator Gail Griffin (R-Hereford) is reportedly the only sponsor of the newly proposed bill.\n\nSimilar bills have been proposed, including one last year by GOP Virginia state Rep. Dave LaRock, who wanted Virginians to pay a $20 fee to unblock content on adult websites. The bill stalled on the Senate floor.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Mirror, the bill appears to be linked to a man named Chris Sevier. Last year, Sevier was reportedly issued a cease and desist by child safety activist Elizabeth Smart, who apparently did not approve of him using her name on a similar bill introduced in Rhode Island.\n\nSevier first made headlines in 2013, when he accused Apple of being responsible for his porn addiction. He was in the news again in 2017, when he sued Utah for refusing to recognize his marriage to his laptop. The lawsuit was thrown out last year.\n\nHe's been doing this all across the country, Stabile told the Arizona Mirror, adding he's a bit of a jokester.\n\nSend David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.
Actress Geena Davis and husband Reza Jarrahy are divorcing after more than 16 years of marriage, Entertainment Tonight reported.\n\nJarrahy filed the papers on Tuesday, citing irreconcilable differences and requesting joint legal and physical custody of their teenaged daughter and twin sons, the site noted from court documents. He also asked for spousal support.\n\nAccording to People, the filing featured the names Rob Doe vs. Veronica Doe.\n\nThe two separated in mid-November.\n\nThe Thelma & Louise star and Jarrahy, a plastic surgeon, tied the knot on Sept. 1, 2001. It was Davis' fourth marriage.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress was previously hitched to director Renny Harlin, actor Jeff Goldblum, and restaurateur Richard Emmolo.\n\nHuffPost did not immediately hear back from a Davis rep.
The ongoing policy debate regarding the federal government's role in the housing marketplace often pits taxpayers against homeowners, as if their goals are separate and somehow incompatible.\n\nAlthough the national rate of homeownership has dropped to a 48-year low of 63 percent, the fact still remains that the taxpayer on one side of the debate, is also the homeowner on the other side almost two-thirds of the time. As a result, the oft-repeated argument, the taxpayers are on the hook for the homeowners' mortgages, is at best misstated.\n\nWhen one considers that the homeowner demographic and the taxpayer are in fact one and the same, the question of policy solutions becomes far more practical and productive than the unending politically-tinged wrestling match we're used to hearing in Washington.\n\nConsider the concept of credit risk transfer.\n\nFar more understandable than the name alone might lead one to believe, credit risk transfer allows the taxpayer to share the burden of large-scale mortgage repayment risk with the private sector that is incentivized to bear this risk. It also allows the homeowner continued access to 30-year mortgages at competitive, yet affordable fixed rates. And the fact that the homeowner and taxpayer are often one in the same makes this more than just a housing finance term or policy initiative. It's common sense, plain and simple.\n\nUnder the current mortgage finance operating model, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (commonly referred to as the Government Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs) acquire mortgages from lenders and then package and sell them to investors. The homeowners to whom the mortgages are granted have an ongoing obligation to repay the principal and interest costs of these loans. In the event that a homeowner fails to pay their mortgage, the GSEs are obligated to pay at least some of the difference to the investors. The risk described here is called credit risk and the GSEs have a great deal of it. Reasonable estimates on their $4.5 trillion book of mortgages is that they carry about $200 billion of real risk outlays at any given time - even more if the economy turns sour and mortgage defaults spike.\n\nIf GSEs can't cover the payments, the U.S. Treasury provides a backstop made up of your taxpayer funds. Today that backstop exists in the form of the GSEs under the 89th consecutive month of government conservatorship.\n\nThe U.S. taxpayer bears the ultimate burden and threat of having to (repeatedly) bail out the GSEs. The FHFA - the GSEs' assigned federal regulator agency - has been working to find private sector companies willing to assume this roughly $200 billion of credit risk. As one could probably guess, this is no simple or easy task.\n\nIn recent years the GSEs have started to spread significant portions of this risk through mind-numbingly complicated transactions involving complex securities, contracts and debt offerings. In late 2015, the GSEs committed to another year of this program.\n\nBut there is a more simple and easy solution. It's called Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance.\n\nIn Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance the GSEs transfer primary credit risk on the loans it guarantees through the use of expanded credit enhancement on a loan-by-loan basis provided by private mortgage insurers. In essence, if a homeowner stops paying their mortgage, the private mortgage insurance covers losses to investors after the home is sold - generally in a foreclosure or short sale. The most frequently discussed Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance proposal would insure up to 50 percent of the loan. This is more than enough to make investors whole in even the toughest of economic downturns.\n\nThe insurance provided by Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance could be executed cheaper than the GSEs' current fee structure for the same protections. Of course, in order for this form of credit risk transfer to be effective in reducing costs to homeowners, a commensurate reduction of GSE fees must reflect the greatly reduced risk of loss borne by the GSEs.\n\nA recently completed study by the Milliman group researched this exact issue. Their findings conclude that Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance reduced borrower costs by an average of $8 per month. That adds up to $2,300 over the life of an average homebuyer's loan.\n\nThis perfect marriage of homeowner savings and taxpayer protection is precisely why a number of groups including America's Homeowner Alliance support this method of Credit Risk Transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems the regulator wants to give the GSEs the ability to experiment with other kinds of Credit Risk Transfers. These alternatives might benefit the GSEs in the short term - but almost certainly not the homeowner.\n\nWhile the GSEs are under the control of the government, we're making a plea to the regulator to use Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance (the proven method of Credit Risk Transfer), to protect the taxpayer and benefit the homeowner as well. Almost two thirds of taxpayers are homeowners. Why should they be OK with the government experimenting with their tax dollars to benefit the government controlled GSEs? How about benefiting the taxpayer homeowner instead?
HAMILTON (Reuters) - A Bermudian lawyer has filed a legal motion with the island's Supreme Court to undo a new law banning same-sex marriage, according to a court document seen on Monday.\n\nOn Feb. 7, Bermuda's Governor John Rankin in the wealthy British overseas island of 60,000 people approved the Domestic Partnership Act (DPA), which was a rare reversal of a trend among Western countries of legalizing same-sex marriage. The government says domestic partnerships may be formed under the law that will offer equal rights as marriage.\n\nMark Pettingill, the lawyer challenging the act, is representing Roderick Ferguson, a Bermudian who lives in the United States. Ferguson is not currently trying to wed, but wants to be able to avail himself of gay marriage rights in the future, Pettingill said.\n\nMy client has the right to the constitutional protection of the law and that has been infringed as a result of the DPA, Pettingill said on Monday. He seeks to render the DPA void for contradicting Bermuda's constitution, which guarantees freedom from discrimination.\n\nThe motion was filed on Feb. 16 against the Attorney General, whose lawyers serve as legal advisers to the government.\n\nA government spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the motion.\n\nPettingill, a former attorney general, won Bermuda's marriage equality case in May 2017 in the Supreme Court, only to see it reversed nine months later.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality was celebrated by the Atlantic island's small gay community, but also outraged many, leading to protests outside parliament.\n\nBermuda was first settled in 1609 and is the oldest British colony, having rejected independence in a 1995 referendum.\n\nRights groups and some British MPs have criticized the bill, saying the United Kingdom should have blocked the legislation.
Hailey Baldwin is a newlywed, which she acknowledges is a scary thing to be at her age (she turned 22 in late November).\n\nIt's definitely scary to be this young and be married, Baldwin ― who recently changed her name to Hailey Bieber ― said in an interview with Kendall Jenner. It's a scary thing.\n\nThe two chatted about their love lives and Baldwin's recent marriage to Justin Bieber ― who she called the person that I've literally been in love with for so many years ― on Jenner's Beats1 radio show, ZAZA World Radio, for a Valentine's Day special.\n\nThe newlywed said that because she had never previously had a serious relationship, it contributed to the scary factor for her (she and Bieber, 24, dated briefly a few years back, broke up then reunited as a couple last year).\n\n″[I was] somebody who was never really in any serious relationships. Going from there to that, to married... I've always been so independent, she said.\n\nBG015/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber out and about in Los Angeles last October.\n\nSo for me, trying to cohabitate with someone and learn how to like, do life with another person, that directly has just been interesting. It's so different, she added. I went from being a baby, not having a lot of experience, to being married.\n\nThe Biebers got married in a private courthouse ceremony in September.\n\nPrior to tying the knot, the two revealed to Vogue that they didn't engage in pre-marital sex. Bieber said he had a legitimate problem with sex.\n\nSometimes people have sex because they don't feel good enough. Because they lack self-worth, the singer said in an interview with the magazine that features the couple on the cover of its March issue. Women do that, and guys do that.\n\nDiscussing his celibacy, he said, I wanted to rededicate myself to God in that way because I really felt it was better for the condition of my soul. And I believe that God blessed me with Hailey as a result. There are perks. You get rewarded for good behavior.
irinamunteanu via Getty Images\n\nSex therapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson works with couples who have been stuck in sexless marriages for months, years or even decades.\n\nHer recommendation for those who have found themselves in the middle of a serious dry spell? Get help from a professional sooner rather than later.\n\nOnce a couple stops having sex, or more importantly, stops valuing sex as an important part of relationship maintenance, it is a fast and slippery slope into sexual oblivion, Resnick Anderson, who is also an associate professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine, told HuffPost.\n\nBroaching the subject with your partner can be intimidating, especially if you haven't been feeling particularly connected, sexually or otherwise. A sex therapist can help you find ways to discuss these things openly so you can repair your relationship ― and in the process, your sex life.\n\nIt's so helpful to have someone there to guide you through these sensitive discussions and give you concrete strategies for getting your sex life back on track, sex therapist Vanessa Marin, the creator of Finishing School, an online orgasm course for women, told HuffPost. Once you've gotten to a dark place in your relationship, it's hard to work your way out of it on your own. Being able to ask for help is a huge sign of strength.\n\nWe asked sex therapists to share their advice for couples who may have found themselves in a sexual rut. Some words of wisdom from our sexperts below:\n\n1. If you've picked up on the lack of sex, your partner has, too.\n\nIf you are aware of a decline in frequency or satisfaction but you aren't sure if it is on your partner's radar — trust me, it is! If you are keeping track, chances are your partner is keeping track, too. Although you may feel alone in it, your partner is likely experiencing a parallel process (even if they are on the other side of the equation). In fact, the lower-interest partner is often more aware of how long it has been than the higher-interest partner, because they are the one with the 'identified problem.'\n\n2. The longer it's been since you had sex, the harder it is to get back in the groove.\n\nThe longer you go without sex, the more you feel you aren't interested in sex. It works the other way around as well. Sex is the best aphrodisiac. The more sex you have, the more sex you want. Having sex can jump-start your engine, allowing your body to begin reproducing more sexual hormones that can remind you that you like sex, enjoy making love, and want to do it more often.\n\n3. The sooner you bring it up with your partner, the better.\n\nI work with couples every day who said they were not sure how to bring it up, or if they did bring it up, it led to conflict so they eventually stopped bringing it up. Couples collude in silence. They decide it is easier to have no sex at all than to deal with the hurt feelings and unpredictable emotions, such as guilt or anger. Intervening before the problem takes on a life of its own is key. One way to bring it up is to say that you value both your and your partner's sexual health and overall well-being. Remember that having sex on a regular basis has many emotional and physical benefits!\n\nCouples collude in silence. They decide it is easier to have no sex at all than to deal with the hurt feelings and unpredictable emotions, such as guilt or anger.\n\n4. Stop making excuses and start making an effort.\n\nWe make excuses with everything from eating better to working out, and I hear it daily with sexual goals. When you experience low desire, your excuse may be you don't feel sexy, you're tired, or you are 'just not in the mood.' These are excuses that hold you back from experiencing anything at all. Start small and go big. Desire doesn't start at an accelerated pace. It may have in the past, but what we do know about desire is that it is more responsive than spontaneous. Take a small step toward being more sexual each and every day. Set a daily intention dedicated to your sexual health like, 'Today I am going to feel positive in my body and find one way in which to give my body pleasure.'\n\n― Shannon Chavez, psychologist and sex therapist\n\n5. When you do start having sex again, it might be weird at first.\n\nUnderstand that the first few times you have sex again, it might feel awkward. That's normal. It gets better.\n\n― Stephen Snyder, sex therapist and author of Love Worth Making: How to Have Ridiculously Great Sex in a Long-Term Relationship\n\n6. You can always ease back in with a good, old-fashioned makeout session.\n\nWhen couples are sexless, it is almost always the case that they are touch-less and kiss-less as well. What I like about kissing is that it activates the same pleasure centers in the brain as sexual activity. In fact, it is one of the most important sensual activities for intimacy and closeness. Kissing can be highly arousing and our mouths are underrated sex organs.\n\n― Shannon Chavez\n\n7. Plan an erotic date night where sex is optional.\n\nOne way to end or reverse a sexless marriage is to make a plan and create an erotic date. It can be a daunting task and you may feel anxious that things will feel awkward, uncomfortable and the night may not live up to your expectations. That's OK. In fact, you may not want to have intercourse at all. The first date you might just touch, or lay naked in bed together. Reconnecting sexually doesn't have to feel threatening. Take it one step at a time and enjoy the process.\n\n― Tammy Nelson\n\n8. It's true what they say: Variety really is the spice of life.\n\nMost couples struggle with not wanting a certain type of sex, but are willing to engage erotically with a partner in other ways. Sex is like food. If we had the same meal repeatedly, we would start to lose our motivation and craving for that food. We need to create variety in our sex lives so that sex can become exciting and rewarding. One of the main reasons couples are sexless is because sex has become routine, boring and predictable. We need excitement, playfulness and mystery to activate our desire.\n\nI suggest that partners create three to five different erotic menus and share them with one another. Talking about sex can often kick-start desire and make you feel more connected to your partner. Agree to take turns initiating an item once a week. Give yourself permission to start slow and build up to feeling more comfortable being sexual again. Check in with each other at the end of the week and share what you enjoyed most about the erotic adventure.\n\n― Shannon Chavez\n\n9. Try practicing mindfulness before you hit the sheets.\n\nBefore you go to have sex, take a moment or two in bed naked together to just do nothing together. Pay attention to your physical and emotional state, your breathing, the points of contact between your body and the bed. See if you can just exist in the moment without having to do anything in particular. That state of being in the moment without judgment is what's commonly called 'mindfulness.' A little mindfulness before getting sexual together can make it seem a lot more natural and less stressful.
Tense, even combative mother-daughter relationships aren't unusual when the daughter is an adolescent. Most of these relationships improve, however, when the daughter has reached her twenties.\n\nBut not always. In The Beauty Queen of Leenane, one of Martin McDonagh's earliest plays--perhaps the first, but that's uncertain--he introduces a terrifying mother-daughter pairing (the toughest in theater annals?). Now the participants' high-voltage family fracas is on scandalizing display in an immaculate revival at BAM.\n\nMag Folan (Marie Mullen) rarely rises from her rocking-chair in the squalid Connemara, County Galway home that Francis O'Connor recreates these 20 or so years on from the original Druid production, directed then and now by Garry Hynes. (The print of a beatific Virgin Mary over the door is the only colorful feature. Otherwise, it's all grey walls, aging refrigerator, heater and battered table and old radio.)\n\nComplaining about her bad leg--the chronic bone on bone pain--Mag has no need to do for herself. She has forty-ish daughter Maureen (Aisling O'Sullivan) to do for her. Not uncomplainingly, though. Mag buckles under with hatred lodged in her dominated heart.\n\nAs the daughter nominated by siblings to be the carer for an infirm (or seemingly infirm) parent, Maureen is a sad figure common to many families, and she understandably resents it--all the while only fleetingly recognizing that she's allowed herself to take on the role for unexamined psychological reasons.\n\nMag's underlying motivation is her fear that she will be abandoned. To counter that, she's undermined whenever possible Maureen's hope for a life of her own. Prominently, she either lies about or destroys anything that might separate Maureen from her. She's also not averse when provoked to recalling a previous breakdown Maureen suffered.\n\nLate in McDonagh's taut and chilling two-act play, Mag's loathsome tactics include burning a marriage proposal contained in a letter from Pato Dooley (Marty Rea), who's taken a heart-warming fancy to Maureen and she, at long last, to him. The doomed letter has been delivered by Ray Dooley (Aaron Monaghan), Pato's somewhat dim-witted younger brother, a lad who frequently drops in on the Folans and does enjoy the Kimberley biscuits Maureen stocks simply because Mag dislikes them.\n\nIt's Ray who mentions the unpleasant odor in the Folan home, which Maureen and the audience know results from Mag's pouring her urine in the kitchen sink rather than venturing to the unseen bathroom. (Or it is an outhouse? Could be, given this squalor.) McDonagh has her witnessed indulging this habit relatively early in his script. Mag denies the action, of course.\n\nThe relatively minor activity in Mag's string of abuses remains only one of the many accumulating taunts she aims Maureen's way--taunts that Maureen doesn't shy away from meeting and raising. Eventually, the mounting mother-daughter battle, particularly the disappeared letter, leads to a radical development that won't be described here.\n\nThat eventuality probably doesn't catch too many audience members off guard. It's something that doesn't attain the reassuring end the perpetrator hopes, and it has everything to do with McDonagh's immense playwriting skills.\n\nFor those who don't know, The Beauty Queen of Leenane is the first of McDonagh's Leenane Trilogy. (The others are The Lonesome West and A Skull in Connemara.) These plays along with the Aran Island Trilogy (The Lieutenant of inishmore, The Cripple of Inishmaan and the still-unproduced The Banshees of Inisheer) were all written in the early 1990s, mostly in McDonagh's extremely fertile 1994.\n\nInstantly, McDonagh demonstrated that he possessed a unique vision. Born in London of Irish parents who, like many before them, moved to England in search of work, he visited Ireland in summers. So though he had experience of his parents' homeland, he was also brought up with the English attitudes towards the myth of Ireland. Undoubtedly, that accounts for the hint of spoofery that permeates the playwright's vision of Ireland.\n\nDirector Hynes, the first to take a chance on McDonagh, refers to it as mythic and distant.\n\nThereby comes the dark humor, not to say the hilarity, common to the plays as well as the recurring macabre atmosphere. Laughing heartily while gazing in shock is hardly an unusual response to McDonagh's works. His unmistakable hallmarks are spread like margarine on bread throughout The Beauty Queen of Leenane, which, by the way, McDonagh wrote in three weeks when he was 25.\n\nA particular talent McDonagh has is lodging in his plots implications of what's to come so that spectators sense the untenable pickles in which his characters will find themselves immersed. He's diabolical at the kinds of things that have ticket buyers silently screaming Don't go that, don't go there at the endangered figures. The skill is a good part of his torturing fun.\n\n(Incidentally, by the mid-'90s, McDonagh announced he would no longer write for the stage and turned to movies, like the brilliant In Bruges. He has since resumed with the not-top-drawer A Behanding in Spokane and the scintillating-for-myriad-reasons Hangman, which has yet to be produced stateside. Apparently, there is even a newer play ready to go.)\n\nReturning to, and perhaps even enhancing her achievement, now that she's taken it up again, Hynes, the first woman to in a Tony for direction, does so with a remarkable cast.\n\nAs Pato, Rea has a masculine sincerity about him. He's especially effective sitting in a square of light at the act-two beginning reciting the crucial letter he sends brother Ray to put directly into Maureen's hands. Monaghan's Ray starts many of his lines with a high, breaking voice that then settles in a moderate range. It's only one contributing factor to his Kimberley-loving, easily-gulled-by-Mag performance.\n\nAsMaureen, tall, fit, wired O'Sullivan is an upright battering ram. Alternately giving mother Mag as good (as bad?) as she gets at times and tied in metaphorical knots at other times, she has a toolbox full of hard looks to aim at her tormenter. It's a gallant show, maybe no more gallant than in her final undone moments.\n\nThen there's Mullen's Mag. The irony here for longtime Beauty Queen of Leenane fans is that Mullen appeared as Maureen in the original production. Now she's turned into her mother (as so many women eventually do, while men turn into their fathers) in the most impressive way. Ceaselessly needling O'Sullivan's Maureen, she's savage. Maybe the cruelest of her traits, though, are the pleased grins she lets slip (out of Maureen's view) when she thinks she's one-upped her unfortunate daughter.\n\nFor many theater-basted patrons, getting to see Mullen in this switch will be a wonderful gift, as is, unquestionably, the new production.
daoleduc via Getty Images Asian boy hand inserting a fifty dollars bank note into white piggy bank against wooden grey background\n\nI'm not the first person to say it -- it's expensive out there. During these challenging financial times we live in, when a coffee on the run can cost you anywhere from $2.00 to $7.00, how do we as parents, ever expect to be able to the cut the financial umbilical cord with our kids?\n\nAs the mother of three young women, all in their 20s -- this stage has not proven easy to tackle. Our 27-year-old has recently moved back in to help her save for her upcoming wedding, while she pursues different job opportunities. Our middle daughter, who is 26, and works as an assistant stylist in LA, resides in our second home there -- free from paying rent (although she pays for her other expenses). The youngest, who is 20, is in her third year university and living off campus with roommates. We're helping out while she's in school by covering her rent, and her tuition. She covers her day-to-day necessities with money she's saved from summer internships.\n\nAs you can see, we're currently on the hook for a lot with our girls, and I know I'm not the only parent who feels this way. Younger kids these days no longer just have part time jobs. The emphasis is on a competitive sport or two, music lessons, after-school tutoring -- all to assist them with their GPAs so they can get into that Ivy League School, or college of choice. While these are all important skills, and assets for them to have, what good is it for them to have academic intelligence, but not financial intelligence? The short answer: it's no good.\n\nIf you're like me and you want to be able to cut the financial umbilical cord with your kids, start when they're young. Help them procure a part time job -- even if it's just one shift a week at first. Have them open their own bank account, and teach them how to balance their account.\n\nBack in the day -- I sort of abhor using this phrase, because it makes me feel old and sound like my mother, which I always swore I wouldn't do when I grew up and became a parent -- I was 12 I started my first job. I was hired to be the pizza girl at a restaurant in the mall food court. My wage was $2.10 per hour.\n\nI felt a wonderful feeling of independence. I could buy what I wanted with my hard-earned money: jeans my single mother could not afford for me, lunch with friends, or I could take myself to the movies, something I loved to do.\n\nIt's not like our daughters aren't trying to make their own way, it's just that most jobs for young people leaving post-secondary school, are unpaid internships. I'm not kidding you when I tell you, it is a bit bleak as a parent to visualize the day when our girls will be wholly, financially independent of us.\n\nSo how can we help our kids find financial stability while we cut the cord? Show them how to budget. Show them how to save for items on their must have lists, and how to save long-term for a rainy day. What I will say is this; if you do the work now, if you teach them to have respect for your money, and their money as they earn it, you're much less likely to end up with a 30-something year old kid living in your basement, while you continue to foot the bill for them.\n\nGiving them the tools they need to not only understand money, but also develop a healthy relationship with it, is your best bet to getting that financial umbilical cord cut -- sooner than later. Do your part in getting them on their way to financial independence; they will thank you, and your marriage will thank you too! Less money spent on your adult children is more money to spend on romantic holidays, and couple time or you time -- and how can that be bad?\n\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook\n\nAlso on HuffPost:
The Overall Draw\n\nLB: A bit of both? I also watched all nine of the released episodes, and I must say, like Netflix did with The Circle, those cliffhanger endings kept me wanting more. Duh! I had to see these couples meet in person! I also had to know how Diamond and Carlton's volatile fight about his bisexuality would end. That said, I definitely found myself tuning out the segments on couples I didn't really care about ― Giannina and Damian, Amber and Barnett ― and absorbing scenes with the pairings who spoke more to the conceit of the show ― Lauren and Cameron, Jessica and Mark. And I also root for Kelly and Kenny because their relationship is very sweet.\n\nI found myself extremely annoyed by the petty fighting (Why don't you seduce me!) and enthralled by the deep discussions on how family dynamics might affect their relationships (My dad is very vocal about keeping the Black family structure strong). So, I'm a responsible TV viewer. Right, Emma?\n\nEG: Yes! I affirm you! Love Is Blind is gripping because it's so voyeuristic. It taps into the thing that all good dating shows tap into: a base desire for love and partnership, and the wish that those things could be somewhat simple and formulaic. Love Is Blind posits that the problem is just that we're so disconnected from each other, so the solution must be putting people who really, really want love into a very heightened situation where they have only conversation and no outside, screen-based distractions. But, as anyone who has dated knows, love and attraction are messy and complicated, and even if you date seriously and blissfully for a month, and even if you make it to a legal commitment, there are no guarantees.\n\nLB: That touches on an important draw for me, which was that all of these people dated each other! We see another layer of that messy, complicated side with Jessica, who fell for Barnett in the pods, was turned down and went with her second choice, Mark. (She claims he was always her first choice, but we see your agenda, Jessica.) The whole polyamory thing is compelling in that sense. We, as viewers, see Jessica grappling with her feelings for Mark while also contemplating a relationship with Barnett after she sees him in the flesh. Barnett, however, knew Jessica wasn't his person long before he proposed to Amber.\n\nThe fact that these people have to continue to interact as friends after the pods is noteworthy, and I wanted more? The manic, drunken interactions between Jessica and Barnett are peak scared-of-commitment dating life.\n\nEG: So, basically what we're saying is that Love Is Blind is a tonal, pacing, messaging mess, and yet it also has some deeply compelling — if sort of sad — moments. And we haven't even gotten to the weddings yet! Sigh.
In news that will surely spark a Debra Messing Twitter spree, Nicole Kidman has broken her silence on playing Lucille Ball in the upcoming Aaron Sorkin film.\n\nEver since the Big Little Lies star was cast as the comedy icon in Amazon's Being the Ricardos alongside Javier Bardem, who will portray Ball's first husband and I Love Lucy co-star Desi Arnaz, some fans believe whoever chose Kidman for the role has some 'splaining to do.\n\nMessing, who essentially campaigned to replace her in the project, has led the charge, questioning Kidman's comedic abilities and why she was chosen for the role.\n\nSpeaking with Variety in an interview published on Wednesday, Kidman gave some insight into her seemingly relatively relaxed process of inhabiting the pop culture legend.\n\nI was like, 'Yeah, I would love to give it a go,' Kidman told the outlet about being approached for the part. With Aaron's words and his direction and Javier … that's kind of a wonderful prospect to, you know. But yikes, off we go. Give it a go. Try my best ― see if I can do it.\n\nFor research, Kidman said she's been screening episodes of I Love Lucy, as the film will reportedly take place over one week behind the scenes of the classic sitcom as the couple face a crisis that could end their careers and another that could end their marriage.\n\nI love Lucille, having looked now and delved into her, she added. She's an amazing woman. I'm very excited for people to see what Aaron found out about her and the way he's interpreted Desi and Lucy and the way that it's so rich. I didn't know any of this.\n\nWhile the naysayers likely won't ever be satisfied with Kidman's casting, she's got one major player in her corner: Lucie Arnaz, the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.\n\nIn a short video posted on her Facebook page earlier this month, Arnaz, who once endorsed Messing for the role, addressed the casting controversy and defended Kidman.\n\nUrging viewers to trust the creative process behind Being the Ricardos, she explained that ultimately the film isn't about who can do the best impersonation of her parents.\n\nNo one has to impersonate Lucy Ricardo nor do the Vitameatavegamin routine, or the chocolate factory routine or any of the silly things, she said. It's the story of Lucille Ball, my actual mother, not Lucy Ricardo, and her husband, Desi Arnaz, my dad, not Ricky Ricardo.\n\nVery little of the show is actually 'I Love Lucy'-type stuff, Arnaz continued. I don't think you will be disappointed with that, however. ... It is a two-hour feature film about these two people and some of the remarkable things they lived through.
It would understandably be a rough couple weeks to be Lady Gaga's ex, since watching your former girlfriend win an Oscar, Grammy, BAFTA and more is a special type of pain we wouldn't wish upon even our worst enemies.\n\nThat's why fans were more than ready to believe that the A Star Is Born actress' ex-fiancé, Taylor Kinney, might be salty about her recent success, especially after Gaga earned rave reviews for her Oscars performance with co-star and definitely not boyfriend Bradley Cooper.\n\nEarlier this week, the Chicago Fire star shocked fans of the former couple when he liked a comment shading Gaga that read Stoked you got away from Gaga. #Hollyweird.\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Taylor Kinney and Lady Gaga arrive at the 2016 Vanity Fair Oscars after-party.\n\nNaturally, Gaga's fans went in on Kinney on social media for seemingly trashing the pop star after her big win.\n\nI guess people's true colors show when they are bitter about their ex winning prestigious awards, one follower wrote on Instagram. Too bad she wasted 5 years with you.\n\nAnother addition to the 'men ain't shit' biography, a different commenter added.\n\nBut apparently the actor wasn't harboring any ill will for the singer, later explaining he liked the tweet by accident in the comments of a recent Instagram photo.\n\nSorry for [the] 'like,' he wrote after fans flooded his Instagram comments. It was an accident. I'm only proud and happy for Stef.\n\nKinney and Gaga were together for five years, with the Vampire Diaries alum popping the question on Valentine's Day 2015. They amicably split a year later as Gaga was preparing to star in Cooper's hit romance film.\n\nEarlier this month, the Joanne artist broke off her most recent engagement to talent agent Christian Carino, whom she's been dating since 2017.\n\nInstagram\n\nKinney wasn't the only famous ex to circle Gaga's orbit this week.\n\nBradley Cooper's ex-wife Jennifer Esposito ― the pair split in 2007 after four months of marriage ― recently sparked backlash for commenting ha to a joke actor David Spade made on Instagram about the A Star Is Born actors being more than just friends.\n\nEsposito later took to Instagram to defend herself after fans she labeled as psychotic accused her of insulting the duo on Instagram.\n\nI didn't watch the Oscars; I don't know what went on, I don't care what went on, she said in a video posted on Wednesday. I commented on something that I thought was funny … And to find that people are making judgment calls about me or them or the people that the comment was about is really psychotic.\n\nGaga, meanwhile, remains thoroughly unbothered on her Oscar victory lap, stopping by Jimmy Kimmel Live! to assure the talk show host that her relationship with Cooper is strictly platonic.\n\nYes, people saw love, and guess what, that's what we wanted you to see, she said. This is a love song, 'Shallow.' The movie 'A Star is Born' is a love story.
Everyone's favorite married couple Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard got to their #RelationshipGoals status by putting in effort and being honest about when they needed some outside help.\n\nWe have a very healthy marriage and we got there by doing therapy when we needed it, and constantly doing fierce moral inventories, Bell told People at the premiere of CHiPS Monday. We both take responsibility when we are wrong, and I think it is easy to work with him because I married him, because I enjoy spending time with him and I trust him. That is exactly what I want in someone that I work with.\n\nBell and Shepard married back in 2013 and have two kids together.\n\n(Story continues after the photo.)\n\nGregg DeGuire via Getty Images\n\nThere are many reasons couples choose to go to therapy, ranging from discussing issues to better understanding what a healthy relationship looks like.\n\nBell has said that counseling has been essential to her marriage.\n\nYou do better in the gym with a trainer; you don't figure out how to cook without reading a recipe, she told Good Housekeeping in 2015. Therapy is not something to be embarrassed about.
The actress and Goop guru told The Sunday Times that her fiance, writer-director Brad Falchuk, is taking her places that she's never gone.\n\nNow, for the first time, I feel I'm in an adult relationship that is sometimes uncomfortable, because he sort of demands a certain level of intimacy and communication that I haven't been held to before, she told couples counselor Esther Perel in an interview. What came up in the first couple of years of our relationship was how incapable I was in this realm, how I feared intimacy and communication.\n\nThe Oscar winner, of course, was famously involved with Pitt and Affleck before her 10-years-plus marriage to Coldplay frontman Martin, which resulted in two children and a conscious uncoupling. She announced her engagement to Falchuk in January, more than three years after they met when Paltrow did a guest arc on Glee.\n\nDiscussing no man in particular, Paltrow told the therapist: In the past, I've been in relationships with men who had intimacy issues, so I could be, like, 'I'm fine, I'm ready to do this,' and let myself think he's the one with the problem. In a way, some of the relationships were designed to keep me out of intimacy.\n\nShe continued: I had two typical types of relationships: one where I was constantly chasing and trying to win someone over, and one where I was put off by the person's capacity for the relationship ― and those relationships were very short-lived.\n\nCheck out the full interview at The Sunday Times.\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer via Getty Images I've been in relationships with men who had intimacy issues, Gwyneth Paltrow says.

I really believe in activism and I want to do bigger things, she said in CR Fashion Book. I'm hoping that this year my generation will get to a point where we will rise up, not in a violent way, but start pushing for more liberalism. This happened with same-sex marriage.

Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images\n\nA big move to a new city. Leaving a relationship that's run its course. Starting a new job in a completely different field.\n\nThese big life decisions come with sky-high stress even in the best of times. Throw living through a pandemic into the decision-making process and the stakes seem even higher.\n\nStill, nearly a year into the pandemic and various degrees of lockdown, most of us are itching for change of some kind. Why is that? For many people, the pandemic has accentuated problems that already existed, therapists say.\n\nIf you were sick of being single in before times, the pandemic might have exacerbated your forever alone-ness. If you've disliked living at home with your parents, even the smallest of studio apartments sounds ultra appealing right now. If you couldn't deal with your company's abysmal work-life boundaries, you might be tempted to take a pay cut at nearly any place else to escape.\n\nBefore you were able to mask your discontent or it was not as bad when you worked outside of the home, saw friends and were having more pleasure in your life doing other things, psychotherapist Jennifer Stone told HuffPost. Compared to now when we have more limited choices and can't spend our time differently.\n\nAlexis Bleich, a clinical co-director at Kip Therapy, said many of her clients are thirsty for change, too. The monotony that marks our days now has acted as a big motivator for shaking things up ― but with that comes worries that taking action might be reckless or unwise.\n\nHowever, more often than not, the issues you might have are pretty much in line with what you were wrestling with pre-pandemic. They're just made much more clear and stark now that we're all stuck at home, alone with our thoughts.\n\nThe fear and frustration of having your life on pause for such a long time can highlight very real concerns, especially for clients who are making decisions that are time sensitive, such as a pregnancy or even going to college, she said.\n\nIn New York City, where both Bleich and Stone have offices, quite a few clients have been mulling big life moves. For instance, with rents so high, many are trading city living for the suburbs and the promise of a backyard. (And obviously, there are plenty of instances where people have no say in the matter; they're let go from their jobs or need to downsize or move back in with their families for financial support.)\n\nWhen clients do have a say but feel uncertain to jump, Stone tells them that even in the best of times, there's no way to foresee how a decision will pan out.\n\nWhat I always tell people is that one needs to carefully examine the decision but also accept that we will never know with 100% certainty that it was the right decision until later on, she said. It's only after that you can see with clarity if it was ultimately the right or wrong decision.\n\nPixelsEffect/Getty Images\n\nLiz Higgins, a therapist in Dallas who primarily works with millennials, said many clients are considering weighty relationship decisions ― whether to stay or go, or whether to take a healthy relationship to the next level.\n\nHer advice to them is pretty simple: If you're feeling an internal sense of peace, reciprocal respect and solid communication flowing with your partner, go for it, regardless of the pandemic. (And on the flip side of the coin, if you can't recognize any of that in your relationship, it may be time to leave.)\n\nJust because this is a trying time doesn't mean it's not the right time to move forward with bigger life decisions, Higgins said. For all the stress inherent in a pandemic, you still have agency and the ability to make smart decisions once you've examined both sides.\n\nI have seen couples navigate deciding to get pregnant, buying a home, proceeding with their wedding celebrations in drastically different ways, and the way they are able to do this in a healthy way is by taking extra care of the health of their relationship, checking in with each other, and maintaining time for transparent, rational conversation about their lives and their expectations, she said.\n\nHere's how to know if you should hold off on making any pandemic-pegged decisions.\n\nWhen might you want to press pause on a decision till after the pandemic is a little more under control?\n\nIf you think you might mistakenly be attributing your feelings about the pandemic to your current life choices, take a beat, said Gina Delucca, a psychologist at Wellspace SF in California. It's been a year of discontent, so don't be surprised if you're feeling well, discontent.\n\nThe feelings you are having in response to the pandemic ― feelings of restlessness, sadness, loneliness or boredom ― are normal reactions to what you're going through, she said. It doesn't necessarily mean that something is wrong with your current life.\n\nBesides that, don't act if you haven't fully examined your rational side and your emotional side, Stone said.\n\nThey need to align to be able to make a sound decision, she said.\n\nAlso hold off if you're feeling any subtle peer pressure.\n\nIf several friends have moved or made big life decisions, you might feel pressured to do the same, but we need to remember what is right for one person may not be the same for another, Stone said.\n\n10'000 Hours/Getty Images\n\nAsk yourself these questions before making a big life decision.\n\nHow do you know if you're making a sound change or acting out of discomfort or uneasiness about pandemic? Ask yourself: Am I moving toward something or away from something? said Dara Bu Elliott, a life and career coach at Wellspace SF.\n\nFor example, it's more sustainable to quit a job to take one that's more aligned with your values and your vision for your life than to quit to escape a sense of restlessness and boredom, she said.\n\nJess Davis, an associate marriage and family therapist at Wellspace SF, shared a short list of questions that also might help determine if your big life change is the right call:\n\nHave you meditated, journaled or spent intentional time in deep reflection of your desired outcome for the change?\n\nDo you have a pattern for impulsive decision-making?\n\nWas this major life change on your radar pre-pandemic? If so, has anything in your environment made it easier or harder to make the change?\n\nDo you have supportive relationships and a self-care practice to help strengthen your well-being during a transition?\n\nIn the end, major life changes are highly personal and circumstantial, Davis said. You're the expert on you, and only you can decide what the best course of action is.
In Hollywood, celebrity relationships come and go, often getting forgotten as new romances emerge. Case in point: Nicole Kidman and Lenny Kravitz not only once dated but were engaged, too.\n\nKidman revealed the news in a recent interview with Net-A-Porter's The Edit. While discussing her new show, Big Little Lies, and her co-stars ― one of whom, Zoë Kravitz, is Lenny's daughter ― Kidman said she already knew the Divergent actress because I was engaged to her father.\n\nIt's all in the family! she added. I love Lenny; he's a great guy.\n\nKidman and Lenny dated in 2003, a couple years after her divorce from Tom Cruise, People reports. Rumors about the former couple's engagement made their way into the celebrity news cycle, as they do, though it was never confirmed.\n\nKidman did, however, admit in a 2007 Vanity Fair interview that she was secretly engaged at one point, though didn't reveal the fiancé's name. The engagement didn't result in marriage, she said, because it just wasn't right. I wasn't ready. We weren't ready.\n\nOf course, Kidman is now married to country star Keith Urban, but it appears she remains on good terms with her former flame. The three of them even posed for some photos at the CMT Awards in 2013.\n\nKevin Mazur via Getty Images Friendly exes.
Less than a few days into President Joe Biden's administration, America's Roman Catholic bishops are already displaying deep disagreements over how to deal with the progressive faith of the country's second Catholic president.\n\nChicago's Cardinal Blase Cupich issued a rare, sharp rebuke on Twitter in response to his brother bishops' Inauguration Day letter to President Joe Biden, a letter that both congratulated and criticized Biden.\n\nThe bishops' inauguration letter ― which blasted Biden's stance on abortion and other culture war issues ― was ill-considered, Cupich insisted.\n\nAside from the fact that there is seemingly no precedent for doing so, the statement, critical of President Biden, came as a surprise to many bishops, who received it just hours before it was released, Cupich wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe statement was crafted without the involvement of the Administrative Committee, a collegial consultation that is normal course for statements that represent and enjoy the considered endorsement of the American bishops. — Cardinal Cupich (@CardinalBCupich) January 20, 2021\n\nThis unusual public airing of grievances was a response to a letter from Los Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Gomez's letter stated that there are some areas where the bishops agree with Biden's politics ― such as the president's longstanding commitment to the Gospel's priority for the poor. At the same time, he emphasized that Biden's policies on abortion rights, contraception, marriage and gender would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity.\n\nFor the nation's bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the 'preeminent priority,' Gomez wrote, quoting a voting guide the bishops' conference put together for American Catholics.\n\nPreeminent does not mean 'only,' Gomez added. We have deep concerns about many threats to human life and dignity in our society. But as Pope Francis teaches, we cannot stay silent when nearly a million unborn lives are being cast aside in our country year after year through abortion.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Cardinal Blase Cupich was appointed Archbishop of Chicago by Pope Francis on Sept. 20, 2014, and tapped to be a cardinal on Oct. 9, 2016.\n\nWhile always upholding longstanding church teaching on abortion, Pope Francis has also cautioned against Roman Catholics becoming obsessed with issues like abortion rights, gay marriage and contraception, urging his flock to focus on serving the poor and oppressed.\n\nCupich, who was tapped by Francis to become archbishop and later a cardinal, said Gomez's statement was crafted without normal vetting procedures.\n\nThe internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and I look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the Gospel, we can build up the unity of the Church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis, Cupich wrote.\n\nCupich's office did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment.\n\nCupich's own statement on Biden's inauguration did not explicitly mention the president's stance on abortion rights. Cupich asked that every life be valued, protected and nurtured as we rebuild a nation once again dedicated to its founding ideals of liberty and justice for all.\n\nCardinal Joseph W. Tobin of Newark, New Jersey, another Francis-appointed cardinal, told Catholic News Service on Thursday that it's difficult to understand how Biden can reconcile his Catholic faith with his stance on abortion rights. Still, Tobin said he doesn't understand people who use very harsh words and want to cut off all communication with the president because of this.\n\nPope Francis's Inauguration Day message to Biden did not reference the president's stance on abortion. Francis urged the president to pursue reconciliation and peace in the United States.\n\nI pray that your decisions will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom, together with unfailing respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those who have no voice, Francis wrote in the letter.\n\nEvan Vucci/ASSOCIATED PRESS President-elect Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, attend Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington before his inauguration Wednesday.\n\nBiden is a lifelong Catholic who has spoken often about how his faith has supported him through periods of suffering. He has grappled with the issue of abortion throughout his political career, walking back his opposition to federal funding for abortion only when he became a front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2019.\n\nAs of this week, Biden's administration is preparing to reverse a Trump administration policy that prohibited U.S. funding for nongovernmental groups that provide or refer patients for abortions.\n\nBiden's liberal stances on culture war issues may place him at odds with Catholic doctrine, but he's not alone. Most American Catholics ignore church teaching on contraception, and a majority say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nSome American bishops have expressed concern that Biden's policy positions will create confusion in the pews about church doctrine. Gomez has said he plans to create a working group to address the matter.\n\nMatt Slocum/Associated Press Joe Biden departs the St. Joseph on the Brandywine Catholic Church on Saturday in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nOver the past few decades, the USCCB's moral vision has narrowed to the point where the bishops treat abortion as though it matters more than any other moral issue, said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a scholar of Catholicism at Manhattan College. She pointed out that the USCCB did not issue letters calling out former President Donald Trump for his racism, disregard for the environment or his alleged sexual misconduct and assaults.\n\nThe USCCB's response to Biden is partly a result of the way white American Catholicism has entered the mainstream, Imperatori-Lee said. She said white Catholics have reached a level of economic success that has aligned them with the Republican Party, which uses sexual morality issues to get people to the polls and ensure the conservative court appointments. But there's no guarantee that pro-life judges will make pro-life decisions, she said ― referring to the fact that a mostly Catholic Supreme Court allowed federal executions to go forward even though Francis has said the death penalty is wrong in all cases.\n\nUltimately, Imperatori-Lee said, she thinks most American Catholics see Biden as a devout Catholic, doing his best for his country and his world, trying to advance the common good in a pluralistic society.\n\nDo the bishops want to join in this work of seeking the common good, or do they want to be a stumbling block to it? she asked.
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, once touted as a progressive rising star who threw her support behind Bernie Sanders in 2016, announced that she's running for the Democratic presidential nomination over the weekend.\n\nMuch of the coverage of Gabbard's announcement has focused on the number of foreign policy actions she's taken that have confounded or enraged members of her own party. She secretly met with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, courted India's right-wing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, voted with the GOP to make it harder for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to come to the U.S., and met with President-elect Donald Trump shortly after the 2016 election amid rumors she was being considered for a job in his administration, which she denied. The news of her presidential run also brought renewed scrutiny to Gabbard's early-career opposition to LGBTQ equality, a position she now says she regrets.\n\nAll this is to say, Gabbard doesn't appear to have a solid constituency anywhere within the national Democratic Party, thus making her bid for the nomination dead on arrival.\n\nStill, it's worth taking a closer look at Gabbard's positions on LGBTQ rights, an issue she claims she has evolved on in quite an extraordinary way. In the 2020 election, every candidate's record on LGBTQ rights will be critical — and that includes both statements in their past and how they're presenting themselves in the media right now.\n\nFor two years, we've lived under a president who has brutally assaulted LGBTQ rights at every opportunity, after having seduced a complacent media into thinking that he'd evolved too and that he was actually more accepting on gay issues, as The New York Times infamously put it. If we've learned anything, it's that we can't trust media narratives on the civil rights views of candidates — narratives often fed to reporters by the candidates themselves.\n\nGabbard was an ardent foe of equality for queer people in her younger years, working for two anti-LGBTQ organizations in the late '90s that were led by her father. Mike Gabbard, a Hawaii legislator who helped drive the fight against marriage equality in the state, headed up the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Stop Promoting Homosexuality, which promoted harmful conversion therapy.\n\nThe younger Gabbard, elected to the Hawaii legislature herself in 2002 at the age of 21, railed against homosexual extremists in 2004, coming out against same-sex civil unions in her state. That same year she opposed anti-bullying legislation meant to protect gay students, arguing that it would teach young people that homosexuality is normal and natural.\n\nYears later, while successfully seeking a U.S. House seat in 2012, Gabbard portrayed herself as having evolved and apologized for very divisive and even disrespectful positions and comments in the past. And this week she issued a statement apologizing further:\n\nFirst, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\n\nGabbard isn't the only Democrat to have evolved since their early years, but few young Democrats held such extreme views so recently.\n\nHer statement this week went on to tout her votes for pro-LGBTQ measures during her six years in Congress, including a sweeping civil rights bill called the Equality Act and a proposed repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. She committed herself to fighting for LGBTQ rights if elected president.\n\nIn 2013, Gabbard credited part of her change on these issues to having served in the military before her election to the U.S. House, saying she had witnessed in Iraq the destructive effect of having governments who act as moral arbiters for their people.\n\nMike Segar / Reuters Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has recently signaled that her transformation on LGBTQ rights doesn't go very deep.\n\nHowever, in a 2016 interview with the publication Ozy, Gabbard suggested that her personal beliefs on homosexuality actually haven't changed:\n\nIt was, she says, the days in the Middle East that taught her the dangers of a theocratic government imposing its will on the people. (She tells me that, no, her personal views haven't changed, but she doesn't figure it's her job to do as the Iraqis did and force her own beliefs on others.)\n\nIt's not exactly comforting as a gay man to know that a politician decided you should be afforded civil rights as a matter of policy while she still personally thinks you're immoral. But even if we could separate these two things and believe that Gabbard would passionately defend LGBTQ rights the way that, say, now-deceased Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia — a Democrat who was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan — became a supporter of civil rights for African-Americans, it's Gabbard's actions right now that are still of great concern.\n\nRecently, she wrote a Hill op-ed that was lauded by right-wing publications. In the piece she attacked those like Democratic Sens. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Kamala Harris of California who sharply questioned Brian Buescher, a religious extremist nominated by Trump to a federal district court vacancy in Nebraska, accusing them of religious bigotry. Although Gabbard did not name either senator in the op-ed, the fingerpointing was clear.\n\nBuescher plainly said during his unsuccessful run for Nebraska attorney general, I do not believe homosexuality should be considered the same way race or ethnicity is considered with regard to anti-discrimination laws which currently apply to race or ethnicity. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Hum­­­­an Rights has come out strongly against Buescher, saying that his track record of partisan activism and deep-seated hostility to LGBTQ equality and reproductive freedom makes him unqualified for the bench and calling him an ideological warrior.\n\nHirono and Harris had asked Buescher if he could rule impartially on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ rights, and they had referred to his membership in the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic fraternal organization that is opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. The questioning touched off a wave of faux outrage on the right claiming anti-Catholic bigotry.\n\nThe senators were, however, doing their jobs, questioning a judicial nominee who has used his religious faith to justify his policy positions. For Gabbard to say this amounts to religious bigotry is to drag out another right-wing trope.\n\nIt also shows us that Gabbard isn't being honest about her transformation and can't be trusted. Though she says she opposes Buescher's nomination herself, Gabbard's attack should give everyone pause about which voters she was signaling to just days before she announced her presidential candidacy.\n\nNo matter that Gabbard's candidacy is likely going nowhere, her op-ed should be a warning sign to voters and those in the media who, as with Trump in 2016, might again buy in to a candidate's claims of evolution while the candidate keeps signaling their actual views.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nMichelangelo Signorile is a HuffPost editor-at-large.

Alexandra Bowman for HuffPost\n\nBent Not Broken is a look back on the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has disrupted our mental health, plus advice on how to manage our well-being moving forward.\n\nOver the last year, many people have been feeling more alone than ever before. To slow the spread of COVID-19, we've stayed home and avoided spending time with loved ones, which has led to more loneliness.\n\nWhile feeling lonely is a normal part of the human experience ― and some of us prefer much more solitude than others ― dealing with intense or chronic periods of loneliness can contribute to a bigger mental health issue.\n\nLoneliness does not only occur in the state of being alone but may also be a feeling that people have even when they are in social settings. Loneliness is more about lack of connection than lack of people, said Lin Sternlicht, a therapist and co-founder of Family Addiction Specialist based in New York City. We all have an innate need and desire to connect with others, and when that goes unmet, we can feel alone.\n\nSternlicht added that extroverts are more susceptible than introverts to the negative effects of loneliness because they are at greater risk of low moods when they are alone.\n\nWhat's the difference between healthy solitude and chronic loneliness?\n\nWe've all had those moments of wanting to be alone to recharge, reflect or simply do something just for us. When we briefly shut out the world and create a bubble for ourselves, that can be a form of self-care. But at what point does it become unhealthy?\n\nYasmine Saad, a licensed clinical psychologist and CEO of Madison Park Psychological Services in New York City, said that when we go from healthy solitude or alone time to chronic loneliness, we enter a negative space in our head.\n\nThis typically happens when we start focusing on our feeling of disconnection from others or loss of relationships. Saad said some people may not be consciously aware of this shift, but their bodies and minds will still show the negative effects of being alone.\n\nFeelings of loneliness can only happen when our lens is focused on what is missing. That lens further disconnects us from life and others. Our life becomes heavy and our body and mind will show symptoms reflecting that heaviness, she said.\n\nFeelings of loneliness can only happen when our lens is focused on what is missing. That lens further disconnects us from life and others. - Yasmine Saad\n\nRed flags that your loneliness could lead to a bigger issue.\n\nThe isolation of the last year has hit us all, so much so that we may not even notice the toll it's taken on our mental health. Here are a few indicators that loneliness is becoming a larger problem:\n\n1. You're feeling lonely around others.\n\nSternlicht said that if you struggle with feeling lonely even though you're around other people or in relationships, then those feelings might be pointing to a bigger underlying mental health issue or lack of connection.\n\nLook within and ask yourself what might be contributing to these feelings, she said. A lack of connection with others might mean that you need to expose yourself to other individuals who you have more in common with, who you find more interesting, or who align more with your morals, values and personality.\n\n2. You're feeling tired more frequently.\n\nKruti Quazi, clinical director of virtual group therapy app Sesh, said people dealing with chronic loneliness may feel fatigued more than usual.\n\nIf they are experiencing chronic loneliness, trying to engage and be social with others can leave them feeling completely exhausted, she said. When feeling constantly drained, this may lead to sleep problems, a weakened immune system, poor diet, and so much more, affecting their emotional, mental and physical well-being.\n\n3. You struggle to connect in ways that once came easily.\n\nIf you feel incapable of connecting to others on a deeper level ― something that once wasn't so difficult ― this may be a sign of a bigger problem, Quazi said.\n\nThis can also be true if the connections you are making feel very surface-level and not fulfilling, Quazi added. This disconnection may feel as though it is never-ending. She said you may feel misunderstood as well.\n\n4. You've started exhibiting symptoms of depression.\n\nAccording to Susan Harrington, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Louisiana, extended loneliness often goes hand in hand with depression and, when it is part of a bigger issue, it has some common presentations.\n\nKeep an eye out for signs such as a sense of numbness, continued isolation, negative thinking, and/or an unexplainable change in sleeping and eating habits, Harrington said. Other less-thought-of signs are irritability, guilt, talking or moving slower, and/or restlessness.\n\n5. You've picked up negative coping habits.\n\nWhen we're experiencing something we don't know how to manage or make go away, we may find ourselves leaning into unhealthy habits to cope. Sternlicht said she often sees loneliness manifest itself in behaviors such as overeating, smoking, drug misuse or excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nThese behaviors serve as a coping mechanism for individuals who feel alone to numb their emotions and connect with a substance rather than with another individual, she said. Research has shown that feelings of loneliness may be a key factor in one developing an addiction. If you are turning to drugs, alcohol, binge eating or other unhealthy and potentially addictive behaviors to cope with loneliness, this may be a sign of a bigger problem.\n\nThese coping mechanisms can also lead to increased isolation, thereby turning into a vicious cycle of loneliness and self-sabotage, Sternlicht said.\n\n6. You're dealing with suicidal ideation.\n\nAccording to Mary Joye, a licensed mental health counselor and certified trauma professional in Florida, chronic loneliness can lead to a lack of purpose. She said some people may begin to ask, Why am I here? or think, I don't want to be a burden to anyone.\n\nThis last statement is very important to pay attention to as people often say it when they feel suicidal, she said.\n\nIf your thinking starts to turn in that direction, please reach out to a mental health professional or a mental health support line. They can help.\n\nSmall ways to reduce your feelings of loneliness right now.\n\nSeeking help from a mental health professional or support space is one of the best and most urgent ways to address what's going on. But there are a few other things you can do to decrease feelings of isolation.\n\n1. Practice direct communication.\n\nJudy Ho, a triple-board-certified clinical and forensic neuropsychologist and professor at Pepperdine University, said sometimes we find it hard to voice our needs to the people in our lives.\n\nBut making that effort to practice direct communication can go a long way, she said, since humans are a social species and we all need one another to survive and thrive.\n\nCommunicate your needs directly to those who are in your inner circle, and do the same in return. Ask them what they need or want most, and try to help them with attaining that if you can, she said. Research shows that even when we feel sad and down, helping others can help boost our mood and increase meaningfulness in our lives, and also make us feel better about ourselves.\n\n2. Curb your social media consumption if it's making you feel worse.\n\nMichelle English, a licensed clinical social worker and executive clinical manager at San Diego-based Healthy Life Recovery, noted that loneliness is an epidemic, and yet we are the most socially connected we've ever been.\n\nWith social media and all of our hyper-connectivity, it's inevitable that people will feel like they're not good enough, that they don't have enough, that they're not doing enough, she said. How can we not feel this way when we're constantly being exposed to what everyone else is doing or, more accurately, carefully choosing to showcase? This type of constant comparison can actually fuel feelings of loneliness and isolation, which is why it can be important to step away and take a break from time to time to recalibrate.\n\n3. Finally, keep in mind that you are not alone.\n\nWhen we're struggling, it's easy to convince ourselves that our situation is unique and the people around us wouldn't understand. But that usually isn't the case.\n\nIf we are constantly thinking that others may not relate to our personality or our situation, we begin to excessively focus our mind deeply within ourselves and feel even more isolated, Quazi said. However, when we recognize that there are actually other people who are feeling equally isolated, it becomes much easier to try changing our focus from ourselves to others and reaching out to those who may benefit from your support.
I found something out at a young age and it always stuck with me. You only get in life what you ask for. As children, we ask for dessert before dinner, if we can stay up an hour later, if we can go to Disney World (again), and so on. So as adults, why do we lack the courage to ask for what we want in life?\n\nI have been fortunate enough to have found great success in my career and in all areas of my life at a young age. So many people now praise me, follow me on instagram @busygirlboston, and become my consulting clients on Busy Girl Daily. They all say: Kristina, you are such an inspiration! How do you do it all? How did you get published? How did you get Arianna Huffington to be the keynote speaker at your Women's Innovation conference? How did you get your product, Moroccan Magic Lip Balm into Whole Foods? Although, my ego gets excited when I hear things like this, I come back to reality when I break down my secret to success. It is very simple and practical knowledge and the key to getting what you want out of life. So again, I remind you that you only get in life what you ask for. How did I get published? I looked up the publishers email address, sent them my story and asked them to publish me! How did I get Arianna Huffington to be the keynote speaker for my conference? I started digging on that fabulous thing we call (the world wide web) and found her information. So what did I do with it? I emailed her and asked her to come speak at my Boston Business Women's conference! Hopefully you start to see the pattern here.\n\nIt isn't because I am special, or better than my peers, it is because I have that same courage that I did when I was a five year old girl asking my Mother for a second serving of ice-cream. I never let that little girl and that courage and curiosity inside me die. This same secret recipe to success also goes for happiness, successful friendships, marriages and building the life of your dreams. I watched my parents 27 year marriage dwindle after a long game of passive aggressiveness. If only they had the courage to actually tell each other what they want, maybe they would still be together today!\n\nSo starting today, I challenge you to take back your power. Find that little girl inside of you. The one who was curious and was courageous enough to ask for what she wanted and bring her back to life. Try it today with something small. Does your boyfriend suggest Chinese food for dinner but you are really craving Italian? Ask him, can we get Italian food tonight and Chinese food later this week? Do you want to be aknowledged or recognized for something that you have accomplished? Well, go tell the world. Shout it from the roof tops! Or email the editor of your local paper, sit back and watch how easy it is to start getting what you ask for. Don't be mistaken though, this isn't about ego or showing off. This is about learning, as women that power isn't handed to us, it is taken. So if you are being overpowered at work and want that one-on-one time with your boss, or to take the lead on the next project, ask for it, stay humble, and kick some ass!\n\nKristina\n\nxo
Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. (Rumi)\n\nWhen it comes to relationships many of us are on the constant search for the one so that we may live happily ever after.\n\n\n\nThe truth is that we are looking at all the wrong places because, believe it or not, the answers are inside each of us. The myth that My happiness is dependent on my partner is just that: a myth. It means that you are giving away your power and living your life by someone else's standards for you.\n\nThe following principles will encourage you to evaluate your expectations, and stimulate you to expand your relationships to heightened levels of enjoyment and increased peace within, by integrating the wisdom into your daily reality.\n\n1. Respect: Without mutual respect a relationship is doomed for failure. Respect each other's ideas and decisions with an undercurrent of love and trust, knowing that you have each other's goodness at heart.\n\n2. Adapt: It is common knowledge that we each grow as our relationship evolves. Don't fight this but embrace each other, giving each other room and keep an open mind and an open heart.\n\n3. Be Courteous: Real happiness has its foundation on the altar of understanding and kind words. Even if you do not agree with your partner, merely displaying calm silence, sincerity and courteous words shows that you care.\n\n4. Listen More: Talking and acting from your own viewpoint most of the time, instead of trying to see the other's side, shows lack of care and understanding. This does not mean that you compromise on your own ideals and inner peace. Agreeing to disagree is a quality that can be cultivated.\n\n5. Stop the Blame Game: When you find yourself in an unpleasant situation it is best to get out of it as graciously as you can. To focus on the issue and blow things out of proportion is fruitless. You can teach people to mend their faults a hundred times better by setting a good example than you can by harsh or self-righteous words.\n\n6. Practice Self-Awareness: It is great practice to reflect once in a while on what you are contributing to your relationship. Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you are being judgmental, hypercritical, unfair, defensive and unkind. Constantly course correct.\n\n7. Admit your mistakes: This is one of the hardest things to do, especially when you know you are wrong. But this simple gesture will bring you peace of mind and increased love and acceptance in your relationship.\n\n8. Celebrate each other: Lift each other up and celebrate the small and large victories together. Sharing is caring. Be happy for each other.\n\n9. Forgive Often: Mark Twain said it best: Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it. Forgiving, by its very act, makes you the bigger person. Sometimes you forgive even though you know your partner is wrong. You forgive the other not for their sake, but for your own. The inner peace you attain as a result makes it all worthwhile.\n\n10. Love to be Loved: If you wish to be loved, start loving the other first. Whatever you want others to be, first be that yourself, then you will find others responding in like manner to you. When each wants to see the other happy, then loving each other comes naturally.\n\n11. Be Careful How You React: The way you react to a situation determines the outcome. If the outcome is not to your liking, then respond differently. Instead of blaming the event or your partner, look honestly at yourself. The answers may surprise you.\n\n12. Communicate: Sometimes we allow anger and resentment to fester. When something is bothering you, it is best to communicate sooner rather than later. In communicating use the word I and not You. By doing so you are not accusing the other, merely stating how you feel. Such as I am disappointed that...; I resent...; I hate it when...; I would love it if... etc.\n\n13. Appreciate Each Other: Make a list of what you appreciate about your partner and your relationship. Read it often. Sometimes it's the little things that we need to be reminded of, that help bring back the reasons and the focus on why we fell in love in the first place. Speak it out and let him know how much he is appreciated.\n\n14. Acknowledge and Let Go of Each Other's Past: We each have skeletons in our closets, instances and events that we are not too proud of, or that have brought us sorrow or shame; relationships that have failed, or people that we would rather not be reminded of. Let it all go. It does not serve your relationship. That was then, and this is now.\n\n15. Exude Peace: To be at peace with one's immediate relations, is the greatest of all happiness next to divine happiness. Unless you are at peace with yourself, you cannot bring peace into your relationship. Meditation, prayer, spiritual practice- each contributes to help us achieve peace in our lives. Pray together and enjoy meals together. The more time you share together, the deeper your love for one another will grow.\n\n16. Share Your Finances: Be willing to share and be truthful and responsible in money matters. Even if one makes more money than the other, each of you has an equal say about joint expenses in the household. You decide to agree on separate or joint accounts from the very get go, so that your mutual decision does not affect your relationship and intimacy in your lives.\n\n17. Be Best Friends First: Life can bring many challenges. One of the most wonderful things about marriage and relationships is that you have each other to share your sorrows and joys with. Keep your friendship strong by going on date nights together, talk and laugh with each other. When you come from a place of true friendship, nothing will faze you because you will always know that you have each other's back, as well as the strength to overcome any adversity that life may bring.\n\n18. Cultivate a Wide, Diverse Circle of Friends: Interacting with your circle of mutual friends, and sharing your time with others together, makes you appreciate your partner even more and can be a source of great joy and fulfillment in your relationship.\n\n© Rani St. Pucchi, 2016
La La Land just swept the Golden Globes. There are a lot of reasons for that which I'll leave to actual movie critics. I did enjoy the movie, but not in the typical I-laughed-I-cried (although I did) sort of way. But more in an I'm-wowed-by-its-life-lessons sort of way. Because some of its offerings were stunningly and straightforwardly profound. Who knew that a film featuring a tap-dancing Ryan Gosling would be a tutorial of wise counsel we'd be wise to follow and pass down to our kids? (Warning: I'm not revealing a lot about the plot, but if you're particularly sensitive to spoilers, maybe don't read on.)\n\n1. Follow your dreams. Even when you're at the end of your self-confidence rope. Even when everyone around you is a naysayer. Even when you're eating leftover toast for dinner every night. Don't quit. Recent studies show that older folks need to push through the discomfort of learning something new to keep their brains strong and viable. And that's an accurate metaphor for a lot of things in life. So, if you really want it -- whatever it is -- you must find a way to propel yourself through the pain, the self-doubt, the criticism, and the nagging voices in your head telling you to just give it up. (Because, really, who do you think you are to want that thing, that job, that promotion, that role?) Sound familiar?\n\nOkay. Sure. Not everyone is going to make it to the Hollywood red carpet. But did you ever watch a movie and think, Wow, this actor isn't even that good -- or that good-looking -- but look at him doing his acting thing and making millions? Yes, you have. Because it's not always the best and brightest who rise to the top. Sometimes it's just the tenacious -- the someone with that extra ounce of gumption -- who happens to catch a casting agent, or boss, or college admissions counselor at just the right moment. And sometimes that someone could be you.\n\n2. Your partner should be your biggest cheerleader. The protagonists in the film --played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling -- are both chasing their dreams. Their dedication to those goals despite crippling fear and anxiety (click to read about how art imitates life in Emma Stone's case) -- is an awesome and honorable thing to behold. They're both industrious self-starters, but they are also each other's most avid fans. When one deviates from his/her stated goals, the other is there saying, Wait. What? That wasn't in your plan. And please don't compromise. I'm here to support you.\n\nIf you don't have a partner who holds you accountable to your dreams, sings your praises, shares your work, or understands your vision...what, exactly, are you doing? Let me be clear: You can be the best dog-walker on the planet and be partnered with someone who hates dogs. And, really, that's fine. What isn't fine is being partnered with someone who doesn't love that you love what you do. What isn't at all fine is being married to someone who negates your goals or squashes your ambitions. Because the person who isn't bursting with pride and enthusiasm for you -- who isn't carrying pompons with your name on them -- isn't someone who truly wants what's best for you.\n\n3. You may not end up with the love of your life. And that's okay. Maybe that person was meant to show up in your life in a specific place or time to teach you something you'll never forget. Once a year or so, I dream of an old boyfriend. The dream is some version of this: I embrace him and say, You know, I really did love you. And, you know what? I did. And he did. And when I wake up, I'm happy for it. Not happy for losing him when I did, but grateful now for the gifts he brought me.\n\nHow many of us mourn the one who got away? We fantasize about what a lifetime would have looked like with that person. Here's the reality: Maybe it would have been pretty frickin' great or perhaps you dodged a bullet. Best case, it would have been like any other functional marriage: a combination of sweet moments, blow-ups, rising and falling passions, quiet rages, and differences of opinion that may never be reconciled.\n\nThere's something to loving and losing that builds our love character and muscle. Certainly, we've been told that formula is better than never having loved at all. But it also demonstrates that we're capable of loving and being loved -- no small emotional feats. To love someone with your whole self -- while allowing yourself to be loved flaws and all -- is heart courage at its finest. Because there are no guarantees. Ever.\n\nI love movies that don't end the way we think (or hope) they should. Because -- spoiler alert! -- not everything in life ends the way we'd like, either. La La Land reminds us that clinging to the illusion of camera-ready endings robs us of the growing pains which guide us toward better or different choices next time. La La Land's teachings are simple: Be true to yourself, chase your dreams, marry the right person, and accept that things don't always go according to script.\n\nBecause, really, how else is life well-lived?
Dealing with that first Valentine's Day post-split, can seem like a daunting task. It may have been a few years, or many years since you have had to face this day alone, and the way our society, and our media builds up this day, only serves to make us feel worse about not having a special someone to spend it with.\n\nGood or bad, after you've had someone to spend this day with for years, it may feel like that is the only option, and may leave you feeling out of sorts, like, perhaps, more a failure than you already did, and make you start to question if you made the right choice to split. These first holidays on your own can be tough, but keep in mind that you did not come to the decision to be on your own lightly, and that it is the day that is making you question yourself, not the ultimate decision. Come tomorrow, things will feel clear again, and you can be reinforced as you listen to all the stories around you of Valentine's gone wrong. So what should you do with yourself on your very own first Valentine's Day in quite some time?\n\nYou can take a page from me and do something for yourself that is positive and working toward a goal you had set for yourself during, or even before your marriage. I always knew I was going to finish school and be a Psychologist, so I spent my first Valentine's Day in 9 hours of class, and did not feel the least bit sad about it. I focused on the fact that I was working hard towards a goal I had made for myself before I even knew who my ex was, and that I was one step closer to achieving it. This particular option also served as a welcome distraction, as it gave me something interesting and demanding to focus on for the whole day. Now, you do not have to go to those extremes, but finding an activity that is rewarding and distracting is not a bad way to pass the time on this holiday.\n\nAnother route you can go is to make plans with your friends to go out or stay in together and do something that you would never do with partners. Be fun, be decadent, and be spontaneous. Enjoy each other's company like you may not have been able to in quite some time. Some of the best memories of mine and many others Valentines were the happy accidents you have with your friends. I can think of one such Valentine's Day when, unknowingly, my best friend at the time and myself, both, separately, decided to go for a drive and clear our heads. We passed each other in our cars, flagged each other down, and decided to go to a nearby Italian restaurant for cappuccino and cake. Completely random, completely spontaneous, and completely one of my favorite Valentine's memories I have to this day. Embrace your friends, embrace the moment, and focus on each other and the memories you are making.
Two Indiana women said a local tax service refused to do their returns because they are a married couple.\n\nBailey and Samantha Brazzel told the Indianapolis Star they visited Carter Tax Service in Russiaville, Indiana, Feb. 12 to have their taxes done. The company previously prepared Bailey Brazzel's taxes for several years. The women wed in July 2018, and this was the first time Bailey Brazzel expected to file a joint tax return.\n\nUnfortunately for the Brazzels, their experience at Carter Tax Service went downhill immediately after they told owner Nancy Fivecoate they were married. At that point, they said, Fivecoate told them she couldn't file their taxes because doing so for a same-sex couple would violate her religious beliefs.\n\nI didn't go in there to talk about my marriage, Bailey Brazzel told NBC affiliate WTHR. I went in to file my taxes, that was it ― that's all I wanted.\n\nI don't need anyone to agree with my lifestyle or things that I do, she added. But if you're going to run a business, you should be able to work with all types of people.\n\nFivecoate did not deny the Brazzels' claims, telling the Star that she identifies as a Christian and I believe marriage is between one man and one woman.\n\nThe LGBT want respect for their beliefs, which I give them. I did not say anything about their lifestyle, she continued. That is their choice. It is not my choice. Where is their respect for my beliefs?\n\nThe incident has made national headlines, partly because of where it happened. In 2015, Indiana was at the center of a media firestorm when then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president, signed the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law.\n\nIndiana's RFRA allows business owners to cite their faith as a defense when sued by a private party, meaning they can legally discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\nThe act was revised in the wake of the controversy so as to not interfere with local ordinances that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexuality or gender identity. Since Russiaville does not have such anti-discrimination laws, Fivecoate can legally deny service to the Brazzels and other same-sex couples.\n\nIn the absence of legal recourse, the Brazzels said, they had no choice but to share their story on social media ― prompting Fivecoate to accuse of them of trying to destroy her business.\n\nBailey Brazzel told WTHR, We don't have an issue with her. We don't think she's a terrible person.\n\nThe couple said in a statement, All we really want is ... to shed light on the fact that there aren't any laws protecting the LGBT community from discrimination.
Picking out a gift for lovestruck newlyweds is hard enough, especially if they've been living together for a while already. Add to that the fact that many couples today might be entering their second or third marriage, and the task of finding a thoughtful and surprising gift they don't already have is practically a monumental feat.
Fourteen years after the character first appeared on screen, Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada is still on our minds.\n\nToday, Priestly's image is used in memes and articles as an example of an impossible-to-please boss. In the film, she's the exacting editor-in-chief of the fictional (but openly based on Vogue) Runway magazine, played to chilling effect by Meryl Streep.\n\n20th Century Fox/Alamy Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is more than a villain, and Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a less-than-great job applicant.\n\nMiranda is the kind of boss who demands your professional excellence to acquire the next unpublished Harry Potter manuscript for her children, in addition to all your personal time, and will not thank you for it, because that's all.\n\nAnne Hathaway co-stars as the prideful yet naive Northwestern University graduate Andy Sachs, who moves to New York be a journalist but settles for an executive assistant role to Priestly when her choices become this or [working at] Auto Universe.\n\n\n\nWhen I watched the movie as a teenager, I rooted for young Andy and her glamorous Chanel boots to get away from her rude, unpleasant and demanding boss. But after rewatching as a working adult, I'm struck to find I have a much more complex understanding of Miranda, and of how many missteps her Runway staff take in their careers. Why is no one reahhhdy? Miranda archly asks her inept staff, as I agree.\n\nMiranda is no villain; she's a businesswoman I understand.\n\nTo be clear, Miranda is not a positive model of how boss-employee relationships should go. Your boss shouldn't expect you to be available at any hour of the day, even if you are their personal assistant.\n\n\n\nThe person whose calls you always take, that's the relationship you're in, says Nate, Andy's aggrieved boyfriend, after she takes Miranda's call in the middle of a fight. With a boss who demands her personal time, it's no wonder that Andy experiences burnout symptoms that are exacerbated by having friends and a lover who don't support her new career choice. (I must note: If you land a fashion job and your boyfriend's response is to look at your face and utter an incredulous, Was it a phone interview? then dump him!)\n\n\n\nBut Miranda is more complicated than the devil she is labeled by the title of the film (and the novel upon which it is based). She experiences age and gender discrimination with executives vying to replace her with a younger, cheaper candidate. Even Andy agrees. After hearing a male colleague call Miranda a sadist over drinks, Andy chimes back that, She's tough, but if Miranda were a man, no one would notice anything about her except for how great she is at her job. When women in real life act out masculine expectations of toughness, they experience backlash.\n\n\n\nTo stay on top, Miranda is hands-on planning each page of Runway, keeps abreast of industry knowledge and offloads her rivals to faraway jobs with a smile. She is definitely mean, and she definitely has a limiting, fat-phobic standard of beauty, but you can't deny her decades-long hustle to stay on top.\n\nThe story is told from Andy's point of view, so we have a limited understanding of what choices Miranda made in this unfair playing field that led her to become Miranda. When I was a younger, I saw her as a villain. But as an adult, I harbor more understanding and sympathy for the self-assured leader who likes being in power and will operate to hold onto it.\n\nMiranda likes power and rewards it. Andy pretends she's above it.\n\nThere is one moment in which we see Miranda with her guard down after her marriage falls apart while her enemies are circling to oust her. Is there anything I can do? Andy asks, awkwardly acknowledging her boss' vulnerability. Your job, Miranda replies firmly. It's one area Miranda is always on top of, and it's a job Andy never fully commits herself to do. Instead, she's always complaining about Miranda to colleagues and failing to own her own professional ambitions.\n\n\n\nTake the Paris trip: Miranda makes a business decision to elevate Andy to top assistant and bring her on a trip to the fashion shows in Paris, because Andy came more prepared to an event. Andy wants to reject this promotion, because Emily, Miranda's original senior assistant, wanted to go to Paris more. Andy only relents when Miranda tells her that if Andy refuses to go, Miranda will see Andy as less dedicated to the job. Which is fair! In Paris, Miranda offers to mentor Andy, because she sees herself in her: Everybody wants to be us, Miranda says, including Andy into her world.\n\nAfter Andy throws her BlackBerry into a Parisian fountain as a rejection and a resignation notice, Miranda still respects Andy enough to give her a positive career reference when asked later. That's better than most people would do for an employee who burnt a bridge!\n\nAndy is the worst job candidate.\n\nAndy is an example of post-college hubris: Her ambitions are not necessarily backed by her experiences. As a job candidate who openly admits she neither reads Runway nor knows the name of its editor-in-chief, Andy is lucky Miranda takes a chance on her.\n\nMaybe that's why I now take extra satisfaction when Stanley Tucci's character, Nigel Kipling, who is Miranda's right hand and art director at Runway, gives Andy a reality check about how she has spent more time complaining about her boss than taking advantage of the rare position she is in to learn how an executive does business.\n\nAfter Andy complains that she is not thanked by Miranda for killing herself trying, Nigel urges her to quit. When Andy pouts that she doesn't want to quit, she just wants some credit, Nigel takes her to task about her ego.\n\nAndy, be serious. You are not trying. You are whining. What is it that you want me to say to you, huh? Do you want me to say, 'Poor you. Miranda's picking on you'... She's just doing her job, Nigel says, and then calls out how little homework Andy has done to prepare. You have no idea how many legends have walked these halls. And what's worse, you don't care. Because this place, where so many people would die to work, you only deign to work. And you want to know why she doesn't kiss you on the forehead and give you a gold star on your homework at the end of the day. Wake up.\n\nNigel and Emily mistake loyalty for promotability.\n\nEmily and Nigel are cautionary tales about what happens when you spend more time helping someone else's career than your own. Emily pushes through influenza and broken bones to work for Miranda and is still replaced with Andy when she fails to prepare her boss for an event.\n\nThe irony of Nigel schooling Andy at the beginning of the film is that he thinks his long and faithful service to Miranda makes him immune from her ruthless self-preservation. When Miranda finally recommends him as a creative partner in a new enterprise, Nigel calls it the first time in 18 years I'm going to be able to call the shots in my own life.\n\nBut promises aren't guarantees, and Miranda ultimately orchestrates the situation so the job goes to one of her rivals. It's a painful lesson in never trusting an offer of employment until you see it in writing.\n\nAndy's final job interview is the film's happy ending. But it shouldn't be.\n\nA pay your dues mindset infects everyone who works at Runway. Under Miranda's leadership, employees operate under the assumption that success depends on who you know. For Emily and Nigel, they think their proximity to Miranda's power will help them even when they should definitely be job-hunting. When the time is right, she'll pay me back, Nigel says after losing the job of his dreams because Miranda helped herself instead. Emily explained this culture on the day of Andy's job interview: If you work a year for her, you can get a job at any magazine you want.
This post was written by my Sodoma Law colleague, attorney and Board Certified Family Law Specialist Patra A. Sinner.\n\nSadly, 2016 seems to have been the year of the celebrity split. There were a number of celebrity match-ups that melted down throughout the year, one more shocking than the next. While some of these may have been expected, others left us reeling from the abrupt endings of our beloved A-list pairings. If we are all being honest, these events are like the proverbial train wreck we just cannot avoid reading about if given the opportunity to peek inside what happened. While satisfying our voyeuristic curiosities about all things celebrity, we can also use these events as a reminder to take stock of our own lives looking to the future for better relationship trends in 2017. Taking stock of the biggest 2016 break-ups ....\n\n\n\nAmber and Johnny: By all accounts, in many jurisdictions this could have been a simple split. The parties have no children together and they were married a relatively short period of time. This would eliminate any concerns regarding custody and child support. It also should have minimized exposure to spousal support and lessened the probability of accumulation of significant assets or debts during the marital period. However, the allegations of misconduct and spousal abuse turned this seemingly simple case into one of social media fodder. While both camps lodged allegations, the rest of the population picked sides on whether the domestic abuse actually happened or was used as leverage. Unfortunately, as family law matters go, many things that happen behind closed doors boils down to a he said/she said version of events, with the Court left deciding who was most credible. Regardless of who is right or wrong, for those on either side of the fence a few pieces of basic advice: (1) make efforts to document events with photographs, audio, maintaining copies of written communications and the like; (2) seek advice of counsel when it is safe to do so; and (3) do not delay seeking intervention from authorities and the Court if you need it.\n\n\n\nMariah and James; Lady Gaga and Taylor; J-Lo and Casper; and Josh and Diane: These folks have something in common - they dated, but did not marry. What could possibly be the problem if they did not actually tie the knot? Some states recognize common law marriage, which means that while you may not have had an actual marriage you may still, in fact, be married. For example, Josh and Diane dated for 10 years before they split. If certain elements are met in States that recognize common-law marriage, parties may be unintentionally considered married, and this may follow you to other States that do not even recognize common law marriage. Common law marriage aside, it's also possible to form financial entanglements with someone with whom you share such history. And following along the financial thread, even for shorter relationships like Mariah and James, it is rumored that Mariah demanded a $50 million dollar inconvenience fee over the split (read: what she wants to make up for wasting her time). The fortunate, and unfortunate, reality of the law is that if there is a deep pocket involved someone can probably find a legitimate legal claim to make that forces the parties into some sort of negotiation rather than deal with the risk of a lawsuit. While such issues are hard to plan for or even imagine if you are simply dating, it is would be prudent to get financial and legal advice before approaching major financial and life decisions such as buying a home, creating investments, or planning a future marriage with a dating partner. While it has historically been considered a measure of one's faith in the relationship as to whether or not to approach these discussions, it should be viewed more from the standpoint of planning and preparation. For example, a pre-nuptial agreement may not be right for everyone, but it is at least worth finding out if it could be right for your situation before making a major decision.\n\n\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt: This is perhaps the coup de grace of all 2016 splits. After 10 years of dating and 6 children between them, they got married in 2014, only to end it all in 2016. They seemed to be writing a new chapter in how you can have a completely organic family not bound by tradition or a rulebook. The untangling of these parties will be one for the record books but likely handled off the record despite initial, and very public, allegations of child abuse. Of note, those stories have been all but silenced recently. They are likely being counseled of the benefits of keeping such matters private if at all possible for the sake of the parties, and particularly the children. These parties will be dealing with what the majority of couple's facing divorce deal with - support, property distribution, and custody of their children. The amount of money and property, and the family dynamics that blossomed in this blended family, will complicate this situation without question. However, the thing to understand is that it is do-able and it is do-able in every situation. Divorce is often the most emotional and devastating event in someone's life and it is important to get the right counsel on all fronts from your attorney to your financial planner and therapist to help guide the process, and provide a voice of reason when emotions run high. While everyone may not have the financial means of these two, there are options for every budget and a good professional can help you figure out the best way to use your resources. There is a way to approach this process to lessen the blow and it requires planning.\n\n\n\nWhile just the mere reference to conscious uncoupling may give your stomach a turn, it was certainly better than the unreasonable demands and allegations of misconduct that plagued these celebrities in 2016. Here's to hoping there's a more balanced approach for anyone facing a separation in 2017
Items belonging to two Idaho children missing since September were found inside a storage unit rented by their mother after they disappeared, an Idaho newspaper reported.\n\nThe items, including bicycles, photos and clothing, were identified as belonging to Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, and his sister, Tylee Ryan, 17, according to a report this week in the East Idaho News.\n\nTheir mother Lori Vallow rented the storage unit in Rexburg in October, the outlet reported.\n\nVallow, who reportedly was obsessed with death and the afterlife, and her new husband, doomsday author Chad Daybell, have been in Hawaii for at least two months, authorities say. They reportedly are not cooperating in the search for the children and have been named by police as persons of interest.\n\nSurveillance video obtained by the local news outlet shows that in the weeks after she rented the unit, Vallow visited it multiple times, sometimes with a man who helped move items into and out of it. The man appears to be her brother, Alex Cox, who mysteriously died in December, the paper reported.\n\nIn January, after Vallow's credit card was declined, the storage company contacted police, East Idaho News reported.\n\nREXBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell have been described as uncooperative with authorities' search for Vallow's two children, Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17.\n\nVallow married Daybell, her fifth husband, in November. That month ― the day after police visited the couple's home to check the welfare of the missing children ― the couple fled.\n\nPolice found them in Hawaii in January ― with no trace of the kids. They have not been charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nAuthorities have repeatedly described the newlyweds as uncooperative. Last week, they missed a court-ordered deadline to physically produce the two kids in Idaho.\n\nA legal expert who spoke with CBS News suggested investigators lack evidence to bring charges. Additionally, a charge of contempt of court for failing to produce the children may not be sufficient to force their return to Idaho.\n\nA lawyer representing Vallow and Daybell did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The Idaho storage company said in a statement on Tuesday that it is cooperating with law enforcement, but didn't elaborate.\n\nREXBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT Some of the missing kids' items were found in a storage unit that had been rented by Lori Vallow. Surveillance video shows her moving items into and out of the unit with a man.\n\nDaybell is a doomsday author who has published several books on the end of the world and the Christian belief in Christ's return to Earth. Vallow's family has described her as being fascinated with the afterlife, to the point where she may have become a danger to herself.\n\nThe couple also has in common perplexing deaths involving other family members.\n\nDaybell's previous wife, Tammy Daybell, was mysteriously found dead in her bed in October, two weeks before Daybell married Vallow. Her body was exhumed for further tests after the children's disappearance, authorities have said.\n\nVallow's estranged fourth husband, Charles Vallow, died in July after being shot by her brother, Alex Cox. Cox died in December after he was found unconscious in an Arizona home.\n\nVallow and both children were present when Charles Vallow was shot, authorities said. Investigators concluded the shooting was self-defense and no charges were filed, according to police documents.\n\nA private investigator since hired by J.J.'s grandparents said Charles Vallow's life had been insured for $1 million and Lori Vallow believed she was the beneficiary, CBS News reported.\n\nVallow's third husband Joseph Ryan, who was Tylee's biological father, reportedly died in 2018 from a heart attack. His body was cremated, according to the Post Register in Idaho Falls.\n\nIn the months before Charles Vallow's death, he had accused Lori in divorce papers of needing psychiatric help. He said she was obsessed with near-death experiences and believed she had lived numerous lives on other planets before her current life.\n\nCharles Vallow also claimed Lori Vallow threatened him with death and financial ruin. He sought a protective order and a mental health evaluation of his wife, The Associated Press reported, citing court records.\n\nLori Vallow's family accused her of briefly abandoning her parental duties and joining a religious cult that changed her in the year before Charles Vallow's death.\n\nCharles did his best to save the marriage, of which she had no interest, said his sister, Kay Vallow Woodcock, in a Facebook post in December.
First lady Jill Biden spoke on the hurdles facing parents in the era of COVID-19, as well as her views on teaching and motherhood in an interview with Parents magazine that was published on Thursday.\n\nMaybe you've made mac 'n' cheese for dinner one too many times, Biden said, addressing working mothers struggling with the stresses of pandemic life. Maybe your temper is shorter than usual. Maybe you're too tired to be the 'fun mom.' It's okay. You're not failing. You're strong. You're resilient. And you're doing your best to carry your family through one of the most difficult times in memory.\n\nBiden, who has taught English composition at Northern Virginia Community College since 2009 and has a doctorate in education, is the first first lady to maintain a paying job while carrying out her White House duties. She stressed that a sea change was needed within the next five years to support parents similarly wearing multiple hats ― often juggling child care, a job and college at the same time.\n\nEqual pay. Affordable, quality child care. Debt-free community college. Paid family leave, Biden listed as key priorities. Both moms and dads are facing the chaotic reality of working from home while toddlers climb all over them. Essential workers have to go to work every day without anywhere to send their kids. We're seeing how badly we need better balance for us all.\n\nBiden added that her teaching career had always been a calling, and provided her the unique opportunity to meet people who face issues often masked by the nebulous nature of politics.\n\nAt the White House, we'd discuss how to get people back on their feet after the recession, how we could help families struggling to pay health-care bills, or how to make college more affordable, she said, reflecting on her time as second lady. Then I would go across town and sit with my students, who were dealing with those issues every day.\n\nThe first lady, who has been married to President Joe Biden for 43 years, also brought up memories of grading papers and studying for her graduate degrees in the bleachers while her daughter Ashley, and her two stepsons ― Beau and Hunter ― played sports.\n\nWhen we got married, Joe knew that I'd always wanted two things — a marriage that was strong, loving, and full of laughter, and a career, Biden said. He didn't love me in spite of my ambitions; he loved me because of them.\n\nRead the full interview here.
When your partner is miserable, it's not uncommon for their misery to start rubbing off on you too.\n\nAs humans, we tend to take on the emotions of the people around us. Researchers refer to this phenomenon of catching someone else's feelings as emotional contagion. It happens because we unconsciously imitate the other person's body language or facial expressions. Then, through a variety of physiological and neurological processes, we actually feel the emotions we mimicked — and then act on them, Wharton School management professor Sigal Barsade wrote for the Harvard Business Review.\n\nSo, for example, seeing someone scowl causes you to scowl. And then because you scowled, you start feeling irritated, too.\n\nWe are naturally attuned to our loved ones which likely enhances this capability even more, Marni Feuerman, a marriage and family therapist in Boca Raton, Florida, told HuffPost.\n\nDeeply empathetic people might be especially prone to feel their partner's emotions as if they are their own. - Aarti Gupta, clinical psychologist\n\nThe close relationship you share with your partner makes you particularly susceptible to catching their emotions. That's why it can be so hard to stay positive when the person you love is moody, stressed out, pessimistic or going through a tough time.\n\nIt usually doesn't 'feel right' to be in an opposite mood of your partner, whom you care for genuinely, said clinical psychologist Aarti Gupta, founder and director of TherapyNest in Palo Alto, California. Deeply empathetic people might be especially prone to feel their partner's emotions as if they are their own.\n\nSo what can you do if you feel like you're being negatively impacted by the person you love? Below, therapists offer some advice.\n\nmikroman6 via Getty Images Getting swept up in your partner's negative emotions and bad moods? Therapists offer advice on how to deal.\n\nFirst, pay attention to how your partner's moods are affecting you.\n\nSelf-awareness is critical in these situations, Feuerman said.\n\nThe next time your significant other snaps at you because they're frustrated with a job they hate, check in with yourself to see how you're feeling. You might notice that your heart rate has increased, your jaw is clenched or you feel tightness in your chest. When you slow down, you can pick up on these cues before they overwhelm you.\n\nYou could pause for a few seconds, acknowledge that you're feeling annoyed and frustrated with your spouse, remind yourself that it's okay and natural to feel that way, and then ask yourself what the most helpful way to move forward might be, clinical psychologist Nick Wignall wrote in a blog post.\n\nWork on untangling your partner's feelings from your own.\n\nA partner's bad mood can feel like a roller coaster of emotions, Gupta said. And it's important to understand what you are actually thinking and feeling as opposed to what you are unconsciously mimicking.\n\nTo counteract this, Gupta recommends focusing on taking good care of yourself so that you're more in touch with how you feel.\n\nFoster healthy habits — eat and sleep well, spend time in nature and prioritize self-care, she said. This time with yourself can help you think more clearly about what you actually think and feel.\n\nKnow that you can support your partner without taking on their negative emotions.\n\nIt's possible to find a middle ground between getting swept up in their feelings and ignoring what they're going through, Gupta said.\n\nAnd with some observation and practice, you can find that place, she added.\n\nIt's also important to distinguish between empathy and compassion. When you empathize with someone's suffering, you feel the same pain they do.\n\nThis can become so intense that it produces empathic distress in [you] and in the long run could lead to burnout and withdrawal, social neuroscientist Tania Singer said in an interview with the Cognitive Neuroscience Society.\n\nWhen you practice compassion, however, you show concern for how the other person is feeling without shouldering their pain. It allows for some healthy emotional distance.\n\nYou are not responsible for their happiness. - George James, marriage and family therapist\n\nSo what might this look like when your partner is in a bad spot?\n\nPerhaps this means validating and offering a positive reframe, or listening to your partner with an open mind while taking deep breaths, Gupta said.\n\nResist the urge to 'fix' whatever problem your partner is dealing with.\n\nDon't try to come up with a solution to your partner's emotional turmoil — you'll both just end up more frustrated.\n\nMost people struggling emotionally don't want someone to fix their pain, they want to feel understood, Wignall wrote. Bake that into your brain because it's one of the most counterintuitive but universally true laws of human psychology I can think of. And once you really believe it and start acting accordingly, everybody starts feeling better.\n\nGive yourself permission to be happy, even if your partner isn't.\n\nYes, you care deeply about your partner's well-being, but ultimately you need to remember that their emotions are outside the scope of your control.\n\nYou are not responsible for their happiness, said Philadelphia marriage and family therapist George James. If you've tried to support your partner, the next thing you can do is things that keep you happy. Reading, exercising, hobbies and friends can sometimes be an example for your partner as well.\n\nJust as negative emotions are contagious, so too are positive ones. By prioritizing your own happiness, you may end up uplifting your partner in the process.\n\nConsider talking to a therapist together.\n\nYour partner may benefit from making a one-on-one appointment with a mental health counselor if their moods have become unmanageable.\n\nBut when their negative outlook has put strain on the relationship, it's necessary to address the situation as a unit too.
Christian textbooks used in thousands of schools around the country teach that President Barack Obama helped spur destructive Black Lives Matter protests, that the Democrats' choice of 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton reflected their focus on identity politics, and that President Donald Trump is the fighter Republicans want, a HuffPost analysis has found.\n\nThe analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of Christian educational materials ― Abeka and BJU Press ― looked at how the books teach the Trump era of politics. We found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative Christian policies. Language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of Christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well.\n\nScholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on Christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of Christian nationalism. Before storming the Capitol, some groups prayed in the name of Jesus and asked for divine protection. They flew Christian and Jesus 2020 flags and pointed to Trump's presidency as the will of God. The linkage between Christian beliefs and the violent attack on Congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with Trump and their support for the rioters.\n\nThese textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said Kathleen Wellman, a Southern Methodist University history professor who is working on a book about the two Christian publishers. I'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture.\n\nRepresentatives from BJU Press and Abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. However, a 2017 HuffPost investigation found that about one-third of Christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called Accelerated Christian Education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. The number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (Voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)\n\nA passage in a history textbook published by Abeka.\n\nBoth Abeka and BJU Press have ties to Christian colleges. Abeka was launched in the 1970s by Arlin and Beka Horton, who also founded Pensacola Christian College, a Florida institution that outlaws dancing and other satanic practices, such as astrology. BJU Press is affiliated with the evangelical Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, which famously lost its tax-exempt status after banning interracial dating in the '80s, a policy it didn't reverse until 2000.\n\nWe unequivocally condemn any rhetoric that promotes illegal or violent behavior, Amy Yohe, managing editor of Abeka Publishing, told HuffPost. One of Abeka's core goals is to teach constructive citizenship through textbooks that accurately represent the facts of history, enabling students to learn from the life lessons it teaches, both positive and negative.\n\nBJU Press did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHowever, scholars who study religion in America say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. Christian nationalists argue that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and has a special covenant with God, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with God. The textbooks parrot these ideas, said Andrew Whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the Association of Religion Data Archives at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\n\nAs we see in these textbooks, they're afraid of outside forces or the U.S. won't be what it should be, said Whitehead. There's always a particular prescription ― they have to be on God's good side. I think that's a big part of it.\n\nPassages from the textbooks reflect an overarching worldview in which America is constantly moving away from a moral center, with Christians on the front lines beating back the forces of immorality.\n\nOne passage in an 11th-grade U.S. history textbook from Abeka states, Although many false philosophies were popular in America before 2000, the new millennium heralded a dramatic acceptance of immoral ideology on a national scale. … Three such philosophies are globalism, environmentalism, and postmodernism.\n\nBelieving religion — particularly Christianity — to be divisive, globalists discourage its influence on public life, it continues.\n\nBy parroting such conservative political views under the guise of Christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. While all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with Trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nObviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said Adam Laats, professor of history and education at New York state's Binghamton University. There's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.\n\nHuffPost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize Nelson Mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive South Africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that Satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. Many of the schools that use these books also ban LGBTQ students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. At one point in an Abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.\n\nI absolutely thought of these textbooks when watching what played out last week, Wellman said. It's the anti-science culture, anti-elite, the identification of Christianity with military culture.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images Trump supporters gather near the east front door of the U.S. Capitol after groups breached the building's security on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWhen discussing protests against the Iraq War and President George W. Bush's low approval rating at the time, the Abeka 11th-grade U.S. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in America was the media, supported by a large number of Hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many Americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.\n\nWhen discussing President Obama, the textbooks accuse him and his administration of stoking racial divisions. Below is a passage from that Abeka history book:\n\nMany Americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that Obama was inaugurated. Unfortunately, Americans' views of race relations declined after Obama came into office. Race riots in places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. President Obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.\n\nThe books do not mention that such protests came in response to the deaths of unarmed Black men, including Michael Brown and Freddie Gray Jr., at the hands of police.\n\nA high-school-level textbook from BJU Press also blames the Black Lives Matter movement for racial discord. It says:\n\nDespite President Obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. Several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. Groups such as Black Lives Matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. Mixed messages from the Obama administration, the Department of Justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.\n\nThe textbook does not mention that those controversial shootings were at the hands of police officers or explain the societal changes Black Lives Matter is trying to achieve with its supposedly divisive rhetoric. The book does not lay out for its teen readers what those mixed messages from the Obama administration were.\n\nOther targets of the textbooks include globalists, environmentalists and multiculturalists.\n\nAccording to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. They encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and God, reads the Abeka American history textbook. However, many conservatives and Christians within America have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn America into a united, moral nation.\n\nThe textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of Trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of Christians who is fighting for their values. One description from the Abeka textbook reads:\n\nContrary to the high hopes that Obama's presidency would bring the country together, Americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. The Democratic Party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. Republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the Democrats. ... The Republican Party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump from New York, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave Republicans the fighter they wanted. As a businessman, Trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the United States and make it great again.' However, many conservatives were wary of Trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by Trump's choice for his running mate — Indiana's conservative governor Mike Pence.\n\nEvangelical Christians were one of Trump's most important voting blocks. Though white evangelicals only represent about 15% of the electorate, they made up about 23% of the vote during the 2020 election, according to the Associated Press. About 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians voted for Trump last year.\n\nA passage from an Abeka high school history book.\n\nImages from the Capitol riot felt more familiar than shocking to 28-year-old Mel Garman, who grew up attending evangelical Christian schools.\n\nThere were the Christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside American flags. The rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of God, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white Christian supremacy. Last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. She felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.\n\nOver the course of my life I can see how what I was taught in Christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on Jan. 6 played into it. That whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said Garman, who is now a social worker. It's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.\n\nSince Jan. 6, popular pro-Trump evangelical leaders have felt driven to judge the rioters' actions, with some offering full-throttle condemnations and others issuing more temperate responses.\n\nThe Secret Service had to escort the vice president of the United States to safety out of the Capitol building. Gunshots were fired. Tear gas was deployed in the Capitol Rotunda. People were killed. ... This was an assault on law. Attacking the Capitol was not patriotism; it was anarchy, said Rev. John Hagee of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio during his Sunday sermon, before going on to rally support for law enforcement, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMiles away in Kentucky, Brian Gibson, pastor and founder of His Church, blamed the riot on antifa agitators, a conspiracy theory for which there is no evidence.\n\nYou don't get 2 million people together without having some radicals in the crowd or some simple people in the crowd that you could lead anywhere, right? he said, also greatly exaggerating the size of the crowd that day.\n\nIn other places, teachers in public schools that don't rely on Christian textbooks are struggling to explain to their students the dynamics that allowed such violence to occur. In Chicago, high school teacher Raven Althimer discussed the harsh realities of the insurrection with her students, who are Black.\n\nThey think of when they had Black Lives Matter over the summer, peacefully protesting, and were tear-gassed. People are literally storming the Capitol and nothing is happening to them, Althimer told HuffPost. One of my students said, 'If 20 of us had done that, we all would have been dead.' I said, 'No, 20 of you wouldn't have even gotten that close.'
By Alexander Jutkowitz\n\nHead to your local drug store this time of year and you'll see armies of smiling teddy bears, a vast array of familiar heart-shaped boxes and overpriced and occasionally clever cards for your sweetheart. Love it or hate it, Valentine's Day is as inescapable as the weather, and it's impossible not to reflect on what it means to truly build a lasting relationship.\n\nTo reference an old adage, a happy marriage is a long conversation which always seems too short. The word conversation is key here. Many of us have experienced a relationship, romantic or otherwise, that felt entirely one-sided, akin to a conversation where the other person endlessly rambles without asking how your day was. Good conversation is never one-sided, and similarly, in the hyper-connected world of today, neither should our marketing efforts.\n\nAdvertising began with static images, including fliers, billboards, and newspaper and magazine ads. Today, it's evolved into a beast with many heads. Print and traditional OOH advertising still exist, and they aren't going away anytime soon. But online, new opportunities for dialogue and tailored messaging are exploding every day.\n\nA recent Medium post by Chris Messina, the developer experience lead at Uber, describes this shift in detail. He says that 2016 will be the year of conversational commerce, with users interacting with brands and services directly using chat, messaging, or natural language applications. In his argument, he cites Business Insider data showing that messaging apps have eclipsed social networks in terms of active monthly users.\n\nMessina envisions a world where audiences interact with brands seamlessly through messaging, whether it's to get information, say, about a flight status, or to order a product. In this way, brand communication will cease to look like an advertisement. It will function instead like customer service, providing true value to users.\n\nSometimes, the conversation will be fun, like the Maker's Mark fake Kentucky Derby contest on Reddit. Maker's Mark asked Redditors to decide and vote on the names of horses that were entered into a fake, digital derby that was featured as part of an ad-page takeover of the frontpage. The winning names, like Beast of Bourbon or Much Horse Very Fast, were irreverent and nailed the tone of a typical Reddit thread, which is why the campaign worked on a platform that is notorious for being hesitant towards corporate intrusion. Maker's Mark came into the conversation speaking the language of their audience they wanted to reach and Redditors felt like equal players in the conversation.\n\nAnother example is Old Spice's GIF-centric promoted post campaign on Imgur, a platform where users submit all kinds of images, including memes and gifs. Sometimes popular users have GIF-Wars, where users post gifs at one another until someone gives up or the community declares one of them the victor.\n\nOld Spice took note of this trend and made their promoted post a showdown between their spokesmen, Terry Crews and Isaiah Mustafa, each of who represent a different scent. As the two battled each other, call and response style, with wacky gifs in the aesthetic styling of Imgur net-art, users voted on what attracted their attention most and a winner was crowned. And, unsurprisingly, the campaign was well received. Digiday went through the top comment under the post and found gems like, the beautiful bastards in your marketing department understand me better than any man or I never thought I would find myself saying this, but this is the kind of shameless ad posting I can get behind. Brands shine when they bring their audience into the dialogue. Ads no longer feel like ads. They feel like an extension of the user experience on a platform.\n\nUsers have told us that they don't want one-sided conversations anymore. There are now close to 200 million users of ad blocking software, according to Business Insider.\n\nAs I said earlier, ads won't disappear anytime soon, but there's definitely a greater demand for brands to show us their value, not just tell us about it.\n\nBrands should begin leveraging principles of conversational commerce in their marketing efforts today, whether it's a beauty brand offering advice on how to take care of your skin or a financial institution distilling 401K investing tips. Through this dialogue, audiences will associate a product not just with a flashy image, but with the real-life utility and value these brands bring to their lives. Today, it's critical for brands to think of marketing as a relationship builder, one where value is proven and not merely hinted at.\n\nThis time of year, we can't forget the pillars of a good relationship: mutual respect, dialogue, trust and loyalty. As marketers, let's respect our audiences. Instead of demanding their attention, let's engage them in conversation with content that's useful and valuable so we can build trust and earn their loyalty.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAlexander Jutkowitz is the CEO of Truffle Pig, Colloquial and Group SJR.
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — After Brigham Young University two weeks ago dropped a section from its strict code of conduct that had prohibited all expressions of homosexual behavior, bisexual music major Caroline McKenzie felt newfound hope that she could stop hiding and be herself. She even went on a date with another woman.\n\nThat optimism was pierced this week when administrators at the university owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints clarified in a letter posted online Wednesday that same-sex romantic behavior was still not allowed on campus. The letter said the recent revision to what is known as the honor code didn't change the moral standards of the church or the faith's opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nMcKenzie said it made her feel whiplash and that her religion was telling her she was dirty for who she is and unwanted by God. She's reassessing whether she wants to finish her studies at BYU even though she loves her professors and the education she's receiving.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Several hundred Brigham Young University students protested Friday to show their displeasure with a letter this week that clarified that same-sex romantic behavior is not allowed on campus.\n\nIt's psychologically damaging, said McKenzie, 23, of Kaysville, Utah. It has been a roller coaster the last couple of weeks. This last Wednesday pretty much destroyed me. It felt like I was drowning again.\n\nShe was one of several hundred people who protested Friday afternoon outside church headquarters in Salt Lake City to cap off a week of fury and heartbreak for LGBTQ students and their straight allies. They sang hymns and chanted have no fear, God loves queers as they held rainbow flags. They held signs that read Love one another, Jesus loves everyone and Bigotry wrapped in prayer is still bigotry.\n\nMcKenzie held a sign that said, My family doesn't want me, now my school? BYU is home. It referenced a lack of support from her family after she came out last summer.\n\nAs they chanted loudly, We're here, we're queer, we're done living in fear, many stared up at windows in the church headquarters.\n\nThe Utah-based religion of 16-million members worldwide has tried in the last decade to create a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ members, while adhering to its doctrinal opposition of gay marriage. The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, teaches that while being gay is not a sin, engaging in same-sex relationships is against God's commandments.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Students who attend BYU in Provo agree to adhere to the code of conduct known as the honor code, and nearly all are members of the Mormon church.\n\nChurch spokesman Doug Andersen said in a statement Friday: The teachings of the church and the policies of our universities are consistent with eternal principles, and seek to encourage and strengthen relationships that lead to eternal covenants made with God. The church and its leaders continue to teach that though there may be disagreement on an issue or policy, we should treat one other with love, respect and kindness.\n\nStudents who attend BYU in Provo, south of Salt Lake City, agree to adhere to the code of conduct known as the honor code, and nearly all are members of the church. Punishments for violations range from discipline to suspension and expulsion. The code bans other things that are common at other colleges, including drinking, beards and piercings.\n\nThe letter posted this week and an accompanying Q&A posted online don't provide details about what same-sex romantic behaviors are and aren't allowed. But it seems to shut the door on the idea that gay and lesbian couples will be allowed to kiss and hold hands on campus like their heterosexual classmates.\n\nSame-sex romantic behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the honor code, wrote Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the church education system.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS We are deserving of love and acceptance, and we are not going away, one student said.\n\nChurch members Joey Pierson and Luke Larsen held hands as they chanted and sang along Friday at the rally. The young couple that identify as gay are still in high school, but came out to support fellow gay Latter-day Saints who attend BYU.\n\nI'm tired of feeling so suppressed and not feeling the love that God wants us to feel, said Pierson, 18. It's time to show what God's love looks like and that his God is unconditional and infinite and reaches everyone, not just straight people and not just celibate gay people.\n\nCaloway Williams, a BYU senior who is gay, called the letter a slap in the face that he interpreted to meant his faith doesn't love or accept LGBTQ people. He called it infuriating to hear top leaders speak of their love for everyone and then see policies that don't match that principle.\n\nI want them to know it's not OK what they have done. These are people's lives they are messing with, said Williams, 24, of Minot, North Dakota. We are deserving of love and acceptance, and we are not going away.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Mormon church teaches that while being gay is not a sin, engaging in same-sex relationships is against God's commandments.
At least one good thing came out of the disastrous 2015 reboot of Fantastic Four.\n\nCast members Jamie Bell and Kata Mara met while on the film and are now engaged, a rep for the actress confirmed to E! on Friday.\n\nBell, 30, and Mara, 33, have been a thing since the fall of 2015, according to People.\n\nAnd although Bell told E! last March that they were not planning a trip down the aisle, things must have changed because Mara posted a photo on Twitter last week where she was sporting a superhero-sized ring.\n\nNo wedding date has been announced.\n\nThis will be the first marriage for Ms. Mara and the second for Bell, who separated from his first wife, Evan Rachel Wood, in May 2014. Bell has a son from that marriage.
Alina Rosanova via Getty Images Being with her felt so lovely, but we agreed we would take some time, to keep it secret to guard it from the outside world.\n\nAfter my divorce, my children and I moved into a place of our own where we relished painting the walls moody dark colors, hanging art we found at the dump, and cobbled together free furniture from anyone willing to give it to us.\n\nThere was a room in the basement that I set up as an office, but it turned out that I didn't need a separate room to work, since I was living alone half the time. When my friend Stace, who was also in the middle of ending a marriage, needed a place to stay, I cleared out the unused desk and borrowed a bed from my parents to turn my office into a guest room. I had stayed at my parents' house on an air mattress for the better part of a year, and understood Stace might need a little time to save up for an apartment of her own while paying off her debts.\n\nWe had been spending a lot of time together anyway. We were going out to dinner on our nights without the kids, attending concerts that started too late for my bedtime, calling each other at 3 a.m. after mediocre dates when the pain of our dissolving lives felt too much to bear alone. When she moved in our friendship became quieter. We cooked dinner, watched television, came to know the names of each other's co-workers and employees. When my son's pet mouse escaped in his room, Stace and I both jammed ourselves into the cramped space below the bed while my children yelled directions from the doorway.\n\nI was dating regularly, if you could call it that. Mostly I was sabotaging every chance at a relationship I could find. I was nostalgic for a time when you could meet someone in a bookstore, in line for a concert, at the grocery store reaching for the same apple. Texting with strangers through dating apps was fun and flirty, but until our knees brushed under the table I couldn't decide how I felt.\n\nThere was a lady at a pie store who I thought might be the one. An anesthesiologist for dogs who I also thought might be the one. Before we met, they all had the possibility of being the one. Sometimes I felt the zing and rush of attraction, but it wasn't mutual. So I worked to be the kind of person who wasn't swayed by feelings. After all, when I was nineteen, I had fallen in love, and swept myself into marriage which ended in ruin. I wanted to be past falling in love as a concept. I needed to tamp down my feelings and think more. I told my therapist I was trying to be a robot. She didn't approve, but I still tried.\n\nAll the while, Stace fixed our windows, bikes, bathroom sink, created a fireplace where there was none, hung shelves, replaced a toilet, a showerhead, a faucet, painted the house, planted three bushes. She giggled every time she caught me taking a picture of her doing these things, which was every time, because I loved watching her work, the way she contorted her lips while she concentrated, the way she looked at me, pleased when she saw me crouched, three feet away, camera in hand.\n\nYou think you're so funny, she said.\n\nShe made me feel taken care of.\n\nOne night before my date with the dog anesthesiologist, I asked Stace to fasten my necklace while we stood together in the bathroom, a task she'd performed dozens of times before. But as her hand brushed against the soft hairs on my neck, I flushed with the intensity of the sensation.\n\nI worked to be the kind of person who wasn't swayed by feelings. After all, when I was 19 I had fallen in love and swept myself into marriage, which ended in ruin. I wanted to be past falling in love as a concept. I needed to tamp down my feelings and think more. I told my therapist I was trying to be a robot. She didn't approve, but I still tried.\n\nI caught her eye in the mirror, and I knew her so well that I could see what she was thinking, that she didn't want me to go, that she wanted me to stay there, with her.\n\nI'm late, I said, grabbing my coat.\n\nAs I drove I found myself pushing away the soft feelings in my belly with a litany of rational thoughts: Dating someone who lives with you is too convenient and easy; dating a friend is cliche; it would get too serious too quickly; my kids didn't need me involved in something serious; it would destroy our friendship.\n\nThat night when I came home Stace and I curled up next to each other on the couch, debriefing my disaster of a date with whiskey and soft pretzels.\n\nDon't date anymore, she said. Date me.\n\nIt's too risky, I said. I need you.\n\nYou'll have me still, she said.\n\nPeople think they want me but they don't, I said.\n\nWe are always together, she insisted. I know you by now.\n\nMy ex knew me for 20 years and I disappointed him, I said.\n\nIt's not the same, she said. We'd be good together.\n\nI didn't want to talk about it. She tried to remind me how we'd promised to always tell each other the truth, but I had been working so hard for the past couple years to stay protected. I wanted to say something mean, something like, Where will you live when we break up? But I knew I was just searching for a way to push her away.\n\nI'm tired, I said instead. I need to go to bed.\n\nStill, the idea churned inside of me. I spent the summer taking care of myself by keeping this secret just for me. I needed something to hold onto and cuddle, and not ask for permission from other people. I needed time to think it through, and enjoy it. I needed privacy, which is something I had never learned to exercise before, never in my whole life. I gave myself permission to lie, and skirt the truth and obfuscate. I gave myself a chance to grow by making a choice that was only about me and what I needed and did not owe anything to anyone else. I didn't even tell Stace, who was the other half of the equation.\n\nInstead of talking about it, we sat together while she applied for her dream job, we finished hanging up a rope swing in the backyard, she made me soup when I was sick, and then the next week I returned the favor, sitting by her feet, watching old episodes of Friday Night Lights.\n\nA couple months later, at the end of a spectacularly difficult week, Stace insisted we take the day off and go for a road trip. She was swamped at work, but she told me I needed a break, and refused to take no for an answer. She packed the car with coffee and fruit and the little bags of popcorn I usually put in the kids' lunches. She drove me to the middle of the state to see the Bridge of Flowers, a garden bridge suspended like magic above a river.\n\nRoses and lisianthus and black-eyed Susans. It was all so beautiful and romantic, and for a moment I let down my guard, and was overwhelmed with joy. Stace was standing in the middle of bridge, in the middle of nowhere, for no other reason than that she knew it would make me happy. It felt so safe.\n\nI took her hand. And blushed with embarrassment.\n\nWe can try, I said. I want to try.\n\nShe picked me up for our first date by ringing the doorbell to our shared house, standing at the door with flowers. There were butterflies in my stomach while I waited on my couch, in our shared living room, for her to ring the bell.\n\nThat date wasn't the first time we touched, but still I was shaking that night when she looked at me and asked if it'd be alright to kiss me.\n\nBeing with her felt so lovely, but we agreed we would take some time, to keep it secret, to guard it from the outside world. It was more my rule than hers, but as someone who processes all of my thoughts out loud, I was the one who had harder a time not telling the people closest to us.\n\nIt's okay, she laughed, unafraid. Talk to your people.\n\nSo I whispered to my sister, my parents, my best friend: Does this seem right? Does this seem real? Do I seem happy?\n\nIs this what you meant by love all those years?\n\nI needed assurance that what I perceived was true.\n\nI felt I had lost the right to trust myself.\n\nBut no one pushed back.\n\nMy sister said, You are so good together.\n\nStill, I was too nervous to tell other people. The love felt ethereal, airy, uncontainable. In that misty bliss, there was both unlimited possibility and dreamy surreality. For months I insisted that we let our relationship be just ours; I didn't want anyone else to take away the everythingness of the feelings I was finally willing to have.\n\nWhen the pandemic struck and we all piled into our houses, it was the perfect excuse not to tell anyone else about us. We could keep it protected. I loved that we were a secret because the way we were protecting it, it felt like the relationship existed on a higher plain than the things I'd created before.\n\nFor months I insisted that we let our relationship be just ours; I didn't want anyone else to take away the everythingness of the feelings I was finally willing to have.\n\nBut secrets get old. And as the pandemic wore into its eighth month, with no end in sight, I no longer took comfort in loving someone to whom the world could not bear witness. Witness creates truth. Or witness creates proof, which creates fact, and people say that's as close as you can get. As real as it all felt, there was a way in which without being witnessed, our relationship suddenly crossed from a sweet secret to not really real.\n\nI wanted to tell people outside of my closest circle about the way she hung my shelves, the way she brought me three bouquets of flowers when one would suffice, the time she rang the doorbell of our own house because she was willing to take a risk for me.\n\nI wanted people to see that I was being brave, and trying again, and that my heart was so very full.\n\nEventually, with no family barbecues or accidental chats in the grocery store lines, we decided we had to call our friends and let them know. It was awkward because what should have been a natural aside needed to be said so very intentionally. It felt like we were calling people to announce big news, which was in fact, just regular life. But one by one we reached out to people, blushing like teenagers. No one was surprised, and the predictability made me sting with embarrassment.\n\nBut also, everyone said, This makes sense. You two make each other so happy.\n\nI was so afraid of destroying my friendship, but I knew I'd never forgive myself if I let my fear get in the way of what could be real happiness. My mom always said the reason she married my dad was he was the first person who loved her for who she was. I never understood that feeling until now. It doesn't feel like a risk, it feels safe. It feels like safety to observe another person, gazing at you all starry-eyed, and know that half the joy you feel comes from them really seeing you, and enjoying you so hard, knowing that there is not one part of them wishing you'd change.\n\nJena Salon's work has appeared in BOMB, The Collagist, Annalemma, Bookforum and on her website, The Ruffle Compact, where she writes about sex, consent, dating and LGBTQ issues.

Without the benefit of face-to-face time together, long-distance couples may find it harder to discern where the relationship stands.\n\nWhen most of your communication happens via text, phone or video chat — and especially if you're living in different time zones — it's not unusual to feel out of sync at times. But is that feeling a temporary blip or a sign that you're just not on the same page anymore?\n\nWe asked couples therapists to share the signs that it might be time to reevaluate your LDR.\n\n1. Talking to your partner feels like a chore rather than something you look forward to.\n\nIt's normal to have a day here and there when you're not in the mood to chat — maybe you're exhausted, swamped with work or have other plans. But if catching up with your partner starts feeling like yet another item on your to-do list instead of a bright spot in your day, then it might indicate the LDR isn't working anymore.\n\nIf you find yourself consistently going to a friend, co-worker or someone else to bounce ideas off of, get support or just chit-chat, and notice communication with your partner dwindling, it may be a sign to rethink how things are going, couples therapist Jenna Peterson of Growing Self Counseling and Coaching in Broomfield, Colorado, told HuffPost.\n\n2. Or your partner isn't available to talk when they say they'll be.\n\nLong-distance pairs have to work extra hard to stay in sync. When you're not seeing each other in person for months at a time, phone calls and video chats are your only opportunities to connect. Occasionally rescheduling is not a big deal; sometimes things pop up. But if bailing on your phone dates turns into a pattern, it's worth bringing up your frustrations with your partner.\n\npraetorianphoto via Getty Images When your once-reliable partner starts ignoring your texts or keeps rescheduling your phone dates, it could be a sign something is amiss.\n\nWhether you live half a world apart or only a few hours away, you should make consistent effort to remain connected on a regular basis, said Los Angeles sex therapist Nazanin Moali, host of the podcast Sexology. If you find yourself sitting by the phone for hours or feeling that you must compete to get your partner's attention, it might be time for you to voice your concern. If your partner does not prioritize the relationship, it might be time for you to move on.\n\n3. Your partner is always keeping tabs on you.\n\nThere's a stark difference between checking in with you periodically to see what you're up to and texting you all the time to ask who you're with and what you're doing. Questions that border on interrogation can be an indicator of jealousy, insecurity or even toxic controlling behavior.\n\nBeing in an LDR requires a lot of trust. There also has to be an understanding that you each have to lead your own separate lives, which includes going out after work for drinks with co-workers and having lunch with a friend, said Los Angeles marriage and family therapist Caroline Madden, author of Fool Me Once: Should I Take Back My Cheating Husband? Any sort of pressure that you should be instantly available any time they call or text you should be a warning sign.\n\n4. Your partner isn't willing to work through problems in the relationship.\n\nConflict is inevitable in any partnership — and long-distance couples aren't immune to the occasional disagreement. But when you try to address these issues with your partner, pay attention to how they respond. Are they committed to talking through them? Or do they routinely brush off your concerns? An unwillingness to address these problems now could indicate they're not in it for the long haul.\n\nBeing in a relationship requires ongoing communication and commitment to problem-solve the areas of vulnerability and conflict, Moali said. However, if you find yourself encountering the same challenges repeatedly and your partner is not taking these concerns seriously, it's possible that your partner is no longer invested in working through these relationship issues.\n\n5. The separation becomes too difficult to bear.\n\nSaying goodbye to your partner and knowing you won't see them again for a while is really hard and can hurt tremendously, Peterson said.\n\nIf you find yourself sitting by the phone for hours or feeling that you must compete to get your partner's attention, it might be time for you to voice your concern. - Nazanin Moali, sex therapist\n\nBut if the longing and sadness is so overwhelming that you're having trouble functioning in other areas of your life, consider whether you can realistically handle this type of arrangement.\n\nIf you find that each time you separate you are missing your partner more and more, so much so that it's impacting your ability to practice self-care or to do what you need to get done in your life, it may be time to rethink if the LDR is right for you, Peterson said.\n\n6. You don't talk about your plans for the future.\n\nOnce you've been together awhile, you should start having conversations about how and when you will shorten the distance — whether that's eventually living together or moving to the same city. If your LDR is a longer-term thing, hopefully you've at least had some discussion about how you'll visit each other more in the meantime.\n\nCouples who are forward-moving plan for the future, Madden said. You have to plan for how you are going to connect physically in a consistent way.\n\nSo if you're not having these conversations, it may be a sign the relationship isn't built to last. Another sign? You two have a plan, but one or both of you keep dragging your feet on executing the necessary steps.\n\nLike not wanting to change your life to either move to them or have them integrate as part of your life, Madden said. You may delay the things you need to do, like looking for a new job.\n\n7. You're constantly tempted by the thought of being with other people.\n\nWhen you're in a monogamous LDR, a wandering eye that you can't seem to control may indicate that you're either not invested in the relationship or that this type of arrangement isn't the right fit for you. (Couples in open LDRs, however, may choose to establish ground rules about what's permissible while they're apart.)\n\nOf course, it's normal for people to be attracted to others, Moali said. But if you find yourself actively seeking opportunities to be around the attractive co-worker or a neighbor, it might show that you are no longer feeling satisfied in your existing relationship.\n\nYou might think your desire to hook up with someone else is solely the result of the physical distance between you; in other words, if your partner were closer, you wouldn't be having these thoughts. But, as Madden pointed out, even couples living under the same roof may go through periods of sexlessness for one reason or another.\n\nDue to pregnancy, young children, work stress or aging parents, one partner might not be available for physical connection, she said. Strong couples work through those challenges without going outside the relationship.
ASSOCIATED PRESS In the affidavit, she recalled a history of emotional abuse, saying her husband became angry as she progressed in her career.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has alleged in court filings that her now-ex-husband abused her while they were still married.\n\nErnst said in divorce documents that Gail Ernst subjected her to emotional and physical abuse during their nearly 26-year marriage, the Des Moines Register reported on Tuesday. This included a physical assault after she confronted him about his alleged affair with their daughter's babysitter, according to Ernst.\n\nGail has been very cruel. This has been an extremely painful journey, Ernst wrote in an October affidavit, according to the Register.\n\nDetails of the divorce documents were first reported Monday by Cityview, a Des Moines alternative newspaper. A judge sealed most of the documents the next day upon request from Joni Ernst's attorney, meaning the Ernsts' affidavits are no longer available to the public.\n\nThe senator announced the divorce in August, and it was finalized Jan. 3. Iowa law says divorce documents are automatically made public when the divorce is finalized, but that parties can request to make some records private.\n\nI am a survivor, and I fully believe that our survivors have the right to keep their stories to themselves if they don't want to share those stories, Joni Ernst told the Register on Wednesday. Unfortunately, I have been forced to share my story.\n\n.@SenJoniErnst responds to the court files related to her divorce that were briefly made public, including her allegation that her ex-husband physically assaulted her. pic.twitter.com/8DqN9eZxzV — Stephen Gruber-Miller (@sgrubermiller) January 23, 2019\n\nErnst filed an affidavit in response to her husband requesting alimony in the divorce. The finalized settlement does not require either side to pay alimony.\n\nIn the affidavit, she recalled a history of emotional abuse, saying her husband became angry as she progressed in her career. He would also refer to his wife as my retirement plan in reference to their 17-year age difference, according to the senator's affidavit.\n\nThe senator said in her affidavit that she turned down the opportunity to be President Donald Trump's running mate because her husband hated any successes I have, The Guardian reported on Tuesday.\n\nShe also detailed more mistreatment, according to reports on the affidavit.\n\nErnst was Montgomery County auditor from 2005 to 2011 after serving as company commander with the Iowa National Guard in Kuwait and Iraq. During her time as auditor, Ernst said in her affidavit that her husband had a special friendship with their daughter's babysitter. Ernst also claimed she had to flee to her mother's house with her daughter after an argument about the alleged affair became physical.\n\nThe next morning, Ernst met with a victim's advocate at the courthouse and received a throat and head examination, according to her affidavit. She said the victim's advocate wanted to take her to the hospital, but that she declined out of embarrassment from the incident, the document said.\n\nErnst wrote that her husband agreed to attend counseling to repair our marriage, but only if she didn't discuss the alleged assault at the sessions.\n\nI stupidly agreed, she wrote in the affidavit.\n\nLast July, Ernst found email exchanges between her husband and a long-time girlfriend, according to her affidavit. She wrote that she began a downward spiral of not sleeping and eating, and I rapidly lost … about 13 percent of my body weight.\n\nIn his response to Ernst's affidavit, Gail Ernst denied having an affair but did not mention the alleged assault. He also accused his wife of having an affair with a soldier during her deployment and of dating other men in Washington, D.C., according to court filings.\n\nShe admitted to the affair, said she was sorry and begged me not to say anything, Gail Ernst wrote in his affidavit.\n\nThe senator was the first woman in Iowa to be elected to Congress. She defeated Democrat Bruce Braley in 2014 and has said she plans to seek a second Senate term in 2020.\n\nErnst has spoken against sexual assault in the military and domestic violence during her time as a senator.\n\nWhat I want to focus on is being the best United States senator I can be, Ernst said Wednesday, acknowledging that a lot of those incidents in my past have influenced the types of policies that I work on.\n\nThis story has been updated with Joni Ernst's response to her divorce documents that were briefly made public.
Months after her relationship became red carpet official, Alexandra Grant is opening up about boyfriend Keanu Reeves.\n\nIn November, the California-based artist inadvertently sparked a media frenzy when she appeared with Reeves at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in Los Angeles.\n\nGrant ― whose work has encompassed painting, sculpture, video and other media ― recalled the brouhaha over her relationship with Reeves, nicknamed the internet's boyfriend, in an interview with British Vogue.\n\nI think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November, and that's fascinating, she said. But the question I've been asking in all of this is: 'What is the opportunity for good?'\n\nThe 46-year-old was a bit more guarded, however, when it came to the subject of marriage.\n\nOver a glass of wine ... I would love to tell you, she told writer Louis Wise. Love at every level is deeply important to my identity. How's that for dodging the question?\n\nI do not believe that isolation is the way, she continued. There is a period of isolation that I do as a painter, but I deeply value the experience of being in relationships.\n\nGrant and Reeves, 55, first collaborated on the actor's 2011 book Ode to Happiness. According to actor and friend Jennifer Tilly, the pair have been quietly dating for several years, though the November gala appeared to be their first red carpet appearance together.\n\nAs it turns out, it was also the first time Reeves had been photographed with a romantic partner in more than three decades. More than anything, the Matrix star was applauded for dating a woman only nine years his junior ― a stark contrast to what's seen as the Hollywood norm.\n\nSimilarly, Grant's gray hair has prompted ample media discourse in recent months. The artist, who went gray in her 20s, tells British Vogue she made a conscious decision to stop dyeing her hair early on.\n\nI am a huge believer in choice ― whatever anyone wants to do to feel confident. We should all have more options as to what beauty is, she said. There are billions of us.
This article is the third in a series called How to Human, interviews with memoirists that explore how we tackle life's alarms, marvels and bombshells. Previously: Ada Calhoun and Marcelo Hernandez Castillo.\n\nIt took Leslie Gray Streeter, a columnist for The Palm Beach Post, almost four decades to find true love. He wasn't what she was expecting ― she is Black and Baptist, and Scott was white and Jewish ― but they were made for each other. Then, only a few years later, while they were in the process of adopting their son, Brooks, Scott unexpectedly died of a heart attack at the age of 44.\n\nSo starts what should be a tragic story about young widowhood, but Black Widow: A Sad-Funny Journey Through Grief for People Who Normally Avoid Books With Words Like Journey in the Title is anything but tragic. It is witty and laugh-out-loud funny but ultimately a love letter to her husband, and a book her son can read when he grows up and wants to know his father better.\n\nHuffPost spoke to Streeter earlier this month via a Google Hangout. She spoke about her memoir and what it was like to write about the days and months after her life changed forever.\n\nLet's talk about humor. Your story is so sad, and yet it's the funniest memoir I've ever read. Could you speak to that?\n\nI'm a feature writer, so I've always written sad stories, but my real gift, I think if I have one, is being funny. When I was writing about what happened, it just flowed. It just filtered who I am and what was happening through humor, because it's how I dealt in real time. There were obviously things that were not funny at all, but when I started to write it just came out that way. I thought, Do I try to be Joan Didion? But I am not Joan Didion. I wish I was, but I'm not.\n\nOne of the reasons I wrote this book is because people still are icky and weird about grief. They expect grief to be poignant, but that has nothing to do with me, or how most people that I know deal with things. When people say, It's a funny book about grief, and they go, Oh, no. It's Bob Hope. It's slapstick, slipping on a banana peel and falling into a casket. It's not that at all. It's just living your life in a way that you usually live it, and sometimes things like eating chips in a graveyard happens, and it's funny. Saying, Can we go to Key West now to go drinking and not go to this funeral? because that's how you feel.\n\nWe all process things differently, and if someone writes about how weird things are and how funny the weirdness is, it gives you permission to acknowledge that in your grieving and your pain and to say, I'm not disrespecting my husband, my mother, my dad or my partner for having some joy, even in the middle of this awful thing.\n\nWhen my grandmother died, we had a shockingly good time at her funeral, not because we were happy, but standing among our other relatives' headstones, well, it felt like a reunion. People were telling funny stories about one dead aunt and another. Anyway, all the laughing led to the rabbi admonishing us, but the reality is I think my grandma would have loved it. More than anything, she adored bringing the family together.\n\nYes. Yes. I think that my husband was not a super-serious person. He could be serious about things that we needed to be serious about. There's no one-size-fits-all memoir or anything. When [a critic] wrote that my memoir wasn't top shelf, I was like, I'm the mid-price vodka of memoirs. I'm happy to be the Tito's Vodka and Courtyard by Marriott memoir. I'm fine with it. It's cool.\n\nI think it means more people will read it.\n\nI hope so. I really hope so. Someone asked me the other day, Who is this for? I was like, People. It's for people. I think it's because I'm writing as a Black person and being honest about that experience, filtering a very common experience like grief through a prism that's not always seen. I think it's me and Tembi Locke, who wrote From Scratch: A Memoir of Love, Sicily, and Finding Home. We're like your Black widows. She's really wonderful and completely different. Have you read the book?\n\nI have not.\n\nShe's wonderful. Completely different book. Hers is very much a grief memoir, a travel log, a food thing and everything. She married a guy who was Italian who died, and they went back to Italy so her daughter could get to know his family and so she could reconnect where they met.\n\nWhat other grief memoirs are there?\n\nThere are not a lot of them out there. But there was The Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion, Sheryl Sandberg's Option B and Rob Sheffield's, who is a friend of mine, Love Is a Mixtape.\n\nAt the time that I was researching my book, before the time these books came out, there were not really any by Black people. I was like, I'm just going to write my story and hope that people connect to it and that people appreciate a story told from a perspective that is maybe close to theirs or that will say, 'It's not like my experience, and I respect it because it's not like mine. I'd like to know more about someone else's experience.'\n\nPhoto illustration by Isabella Carapella\n\nI noticed the beginning of the book is written almost in real time. I felt like I was really present with you, and I wondered how soon after your husband had died did you start writing your thoughts and your feelings?\n\nA month or two. Maybe two months?\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nI literally had to get it off my chest. The day that he died, I was in my kitchen with my friend Scott Eyman, who used to be the books editor at The Palm Beach Post, where I work, and he is a Hollywood historian. He has written many, many books. I used to always say, Oh, I'm going to write this idea. I've got a great idea for fiction, and I would give him the first two chapters.\n\nI'd never do anything with it, and he would say to me, You're going to finish the book that you have to finish.\n\nScott had died maybe eight or 10 hours earlier, and Scott Eyman was in my kitchen. I said, I think this is my book.\n\nHe said, I think it is. I'm sorry to say, but I think it is, too.\n\nI feel like you're a wizard with some of the writing that you do because you approach sensitive subjects in a way that I don't see coming. Case in point, you write about saving yourself for marriage. That's a subject that's personal, and I wondered if you questioned whether or not to include it or other subjects like that within the memoir?\n\nI kind of knew I had to. Like I said before, I figured if I was going to write a memoir, it had to be setting those balls out. I would have to do it, and that was a part of my story.\n\nTo me, like I said in the book, it was a beautiful thing, because it says a lot about Scott's value system. He loved me enough to wait, which I thought was really brave. I knew when I told that story, I had to write that. I thought about, How do I write that? so I just wrote it.\n\nI was like, I will just write in context of my life. It won't be like a big star section like, 'Here I am, a virgin.' It was just, This is part of our story, and I just wrote it like I was telling it to a friend. I went back and said, Does that say what I want it to say? and it did. I was like, OK, that's what I wanted to say about it.\n\nYeah. You don't even use the word virgin, I think.\n\nNope.\n\nI think it's great.\n\nSomeone interviewed me, and in the interview they referred to me as a 39-year-old virgin. I was like, Ow! Oh, yeah, I was. It was what it was. Like I said, I just know that there are people who are going to read that and go, Oh, that's weird! or people are going to read that who are conservative and think I'm not being pious enough about it. It's out there now. Y'all can take whatever. Go ahead.\n\nI kept underlining what you called the grief cake period. You were clearly feeling unhinged in the days and months after your husband died, but you're also objective that you're unhinged. To be able to sit back and write about a period, it's so hard to do it without writing, I felt crazy. I was eating too much. Just speak to that a little bit.\n\nI was trying to be honest about what was happening. I think anyone who's ever had grief or loss, that shock and the panic and the understanding that you don't know what's going on was really important. I think, as a writer and as a columnist, I write about myself a lot. I find myself gauging where I am in situations. During the grief cake period in my life, I certainly was aware. I would say something and go, Oh. I just said that. Wow. I said that thing. I told that person I didn't want to talk to them, and I walked away. I went somewhere else, and I thought I wouldn't normally do that. I thought, Who cares. I'm a widow. I don't care. No one gets to judge me for anything I'm doing. I didn't slap anybody.\n\nI think this is in the book. My sister had said, What do you want me to do?\n\nI said, Make sure I don't cuss anybody out. Then, I said something about someone that annoyed me, and she snapped at me. I said, No, no, no. I don't get to cuss at people, but I can still talk about them behind their back because they made me feel something. I didn't feel good, so I'm talking about that because it made me sad. That's what I'm doing, so you don't get to judge me on that.\n\nI felt like I had the Bridget Jones voice in the back of my head, like the narration, And now she's crazy. I was very conscious of that.\n\nI feel like I really got to know Scott while reading the book. Was that a goal of your memoir?\n\nWe were happy, and we had such good stuff coming up. He'd want me to be appropriately sad, and I am.\n\nIt's why I talked about the fight we had about the $65 Raven shorts, which I wear all the time. It's hilarious. It's stupid because he was a real person. You can't live with somebody for six years and not have a fight with them. You can't not have dumb arguments about stupid crap that mean nothing. I wanted to talk about that, too, so I would say sometimes, Oh, and he was a jerk sometimes.\n\nHe was a human being who breathed air. Of course he was a jerk sometimes. Everybody is. That's what we are. That's what we do. He was 85% the best person in the world. Truly, truly ... Then, he had moments where he had fights with his wife on Black Friday about $65 Raven shorts.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.
Getty Images\n\nBeing a single parent can be isolating in so many ways.\n\nFor starters, we single parents are physically alone with our kid(s) a lot of the time, without a partner to carry some of the burden or even just have an adult conversation with. And on an emotional level, we're constantly seeing two-parent families held up as the ideal situation.\n\nIf I'm not careful, I can end up feeling not just alone, but resentful as hell. But one thing that helps lance my boil of single parent bitterness is seeing people in the public eye going through the same things I am.\n\nToday, on National Single Parent Day, we're repping for solo parenting by collecting some relatable quotes from celebrities who are (or have been) single parents. Of course having a couple of nannies and a load of disposable income can make things a little easier, but some feelings are universal.\n\nHopefully they'll serve as a reminder that even though you're a single parent, you are definitely not alone.\n\n1. Edie Falco: As a single mom, I'm juggling a lot and working long hours. Yes, it costs them a little, but what my children get in return is a mother who is energized and content. It helps us to bring out the best in each other, which is what a family should do.\n\n2. Diane Keaton: The loves of my life are my children and my mother. I don't feel as if I need a man.\n\n3. Sandra Bullock: The only man in my life is my son, and it's probably going to stay this way for a while ...I go to bed wearing a very baggy one-piece cheetah suit, just because it makes my son laugh. My sexy lingerie has been locked in a drawer for a while!\n\n4. Sherri Shepherd: I'm a hustler. I'm a single mom, so whatever I've gotta do—me and Jenny McCarthy have this mantra, 'Momma gotta feed the baby.'\n\nLou Rocco via Getty Images Sherri Shepherd and her son Jeffrey\n\n5. Minnie Driver: It's the greatest love affair of my life, with this baby. I'm a single mom, [but] his dad is amazing and in his life. I don't feel alone. Babies attract love…They attract people who love them.\n\n6. Padma Laskhmi: It's the only way of life I've known. I was raised by a single mom. I was told I couldn't have children, so every day I am kissing the sky with happiness about it.\n\n7. January Jones: People keep saying, 'Oh poor you, being a single mom,' but I don't want to be pitied. I can do anything I want to do. I work, I date, I have friends. I have time for everything I had time for before. I just have an added amazing thing in my life. I have a great family and friends, and I know they'd be there if I needed help, but I feel like I'm doing fine on my own.\n\nBauer-Griffin via Getty Images January Jones and her son Xander\n\n8. Kate Winslet: Single mums do come in for a hard time. Society is incredibly judgmental. I know this. My life has taken me down several different paths I never expected it to take me down. Not in a million years. And I know the true meaning of getting by by the skin of my teeth. I do. It doesn't matter whether you've got money or you haven't, whether you're famous or not. This is the case for all women actually, you have to carry on. You always have to carry on. And you can, because you have to.\n\n9. JK Rowling: I would say to any single parent currently feeling the weight of stereotype or stigmatization that I am prouder of my years as a single mother than of any other part of my life.\n\n10. Regina King: I think it is definitely difficult for any professional being a mother, and a single one at that. It's hard not having a partner to raise your child. It's difficult, but far from impossible and we smile more than we cry.\n\n11. Connie Britton: I do want to say there are so many women out there who are single moms, really not by choice, and doing it and making it work every day. I think it's becoming much more a part of our culture and I hope that it will become more accepted and that those women are going to be more and more appreciated, respected and supported.\n\n12. Denise Richards: The best gift a parent can give children is time ... Single moms need to know it's okay to have a little 'me' time. You'll feel refreshed and you'll be a better mom!\n\n13. Nia Long: Don't feel guilty about being a single mother. Patience is super important as a single mother. You do have to be a little more patient because all of the responsibility is on you…ask for help!\n\n14. Charlize Theron: It's challenging but we manage. I work, but my children are my priority. Nothing's better than the sound of little ones cracking up at something funny; I'm now at my most comfortable waking up with my kids, going to the beach and relaxing over a meal with friends.\n\n15. Taraji P. Henson: Hell, even the President of the United States — four of them, in fact — were raised by single mothers. Nevertheless, mention that you're a single mom, and all-too-many of us still have to cut through a thick, gristly layer of stigma before we're given our proper due.\n\nBennett Raglin via Getty Images Taraji P. Henson and her son Marcel\n\n16. Mary Louise Parker: I wish I could give them everything that was a perfect little family paradigm, but I can't. Honestly, I feel like that doesn't even exist, or at least I try to tell myself that when I am feeling bad about not providing it.\n\n17. Amanda Stanton: I decided instead of being embarrassed of my failed marriage and ashamed of being a single mother, I was going to OWN it. Being the best mother you can be and giving your kids the BEST life possible has nothing to do with your relationship status and you don't have to be happily married to have a 'picture-perfect family.'\n\n18. Solange: I think it's really important for every mother to find their own way.
The most famous moment from The Birdcage is probably the one where Robin Williams gives a bored young hunk a 15-second tutorial in the history of American dance. It's one of the late actor's signature scenes. In an uproarious gush of energy, Williams goes from coolheaded nightclub owner supervising a Sondheim number to erudite showman. He demonstrates Bob Fosse, Martha Graham, Twyla Tharp, Michael Kidd and Madonna, Madonna, Madonna with the zeal of a gay man who knows a thing or five about art.\n\nWhile reading a new biography about the director, Mike Nichols, I was amazed to learn the whole thing was concocted on the fly during the shoot. Equally telling is the fact that Williams, then one of Hollywood's biggest stars, had asked to play the more restrained of the two leads. His hyper-theatrical screen partner would spend the final 35 minutes of the film in drag, and Williams didn't want to retread what he'd recently done in Mrs. Doubtfire. So Nichols offered that role to Nathan Lane, a Broadway luminary. It was for the best. Unlike Williams, Lane is gay and could easily grasp the complexities of this particular code-switching.\n\nThat's what The Birdcage is about, after all ― gender performance, a topic far less commonly discussed when the movie debuted 25 years ago, on March 8, 1996. Adapted by Elaine May from the 1973 French play La Cage aux Folles, it became Hollywood's first blockbuster to revolve around open, well-adjusted LGBTQ protagonists. Nichols' film remained No. 1 at the box office for four consecutive weeks, earning $124 million and ranking as the year's seventh-highest-grossing release. Even with Williams' name on the marquee, no one expected such success, partly because queer visibility was still a struggle. Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell hadn't come out yet, and needle-moving television like Will & Grace, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and The L Word hadn't premiered.\n\nUnited Artists via Getty Images Robin Williams and Nathan Lane in The Birdcage.\n\nToday, The Birdcage holds a knotty place in the queer canon. Its plot, however witty, is dated. A happy couple going back into the closet to impress a bigoted politician (Gene Hackman) whose daughter Barbara (Calista Flockhart) is engaged to their unlikable son Val (Dan Futterman) doesn't pass 2021's progressivism test. Some activists, like the writer Bruce Bawer, who called the movie cruel and heterosexist, didn't even think it passed 1996's test. But it's more thoughtful than Bawer gave it credit for. (GLAAD agreed, praising the film's depth and humanity. Larry Kramer liked it, too.) Last year's holiday comedy Happiest Season, which employed a similar concept, suggests that code-switching is still a reality, no matter how far LGBTQ equality has come.\n\nThe sharp observations in The Birdcage are classic Nichols and May, longtime collaborators who refused to over-emphasize themes the way lesser storytellers might have. Take, for example, Hackman's Kevin Keeley, a Pat Buchanan type who co-founded an archetypal right-wing group called the Coalition for Moral Order. The heartbreak of Armand (Williams) reluctantly agreeing to strip his home decor, send Albert (Lane) away and play straight during Keeley's visit is accentuated by what a ridiculous person Keeley is. Facing a very '90s sex scandal, he behaves like a child: irascible, self-centered and addicted to candy.\n\nEven though there's humor in the scheme to fool Keeley, which also involves 20-year-old Val's estranged birth mother (Christine Baranski) returning to the fold, the movie never exactly roots for it. Nor does it villainize anyone involved, instead trusting that the audience is intelligent enough to stay loyal to Armand and Albert.\n\nUnited Artists via Getty Images Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest and Calista Flockhart in The Birdcage.\n\nYes, I wear foundation, Armand tells Val. Yes, I live with a man. Yes, I'm a middle-aged fag. But I know who I am, Val. It took me 20 years to get here, and I'm not gonna let some idiot senator destroy that. When he eventually relents, it's because he loves his son and knows how relatively unprecedented Val's life has been. Most Americans didn't know any openly gay people at the time, much less understand what it was like to have gay relatives in the era of don't ask, don't tell.\n\nWhen Val's mother gets stuck in traffic and Albert decides to fill the role himself, The Birdcage borrows one of the oldest, most reliable comedy tropes: mistaken identity. Seeing Albert arrive at dinner in a Barbara Bush-style wig surprises us as much as it does Armand and Val. One might deem it Shakespearean. But the farce extends beyond cross-dressing. Lane is caricaturing the sort of prim conservative whose vote Keeley would have courted. Keeley is so enamored with her that he's convinced she's a scorned housewife disgraced by a pretentious husband, not realizing he is describing his own marriage. Aristotle Onassis was just like this, he hisses to his wife (Dianne Wiest, a stealth MVP), referring to Armand.\n\nKeeley's cluelessness gives Albert the upper hand. Ranting about school prayer and gay military service, he doesn't clock that Albert is mocking him to his face. Invoking Alexander the Great's rumored sexuality, Albert exclaims, Talk about gays in the military!\n\nThe dinner-party ruse lets The Birdcage smuggle in some pretty effective ideas about the queer experience. Armand struggling to teach Albert to pass for butch is a gleeful indictment of the idea itself; it makes the grunting mannerisms of heterosexual men look absurd. For any gay man who has deepened his voice or thrust his hands into his pockets so they wouldn't give him away, those absurdities are all too familiar. Plus, Lane is a brilliant comedian capable of embedding both social commentary and interpersonal conflict in his broad physicality.\n\nUnited Artists via Getty Images Nathan Lane in The Birdcage.\n\nIn the end, the tables are flipped on Keeley, rendering Albert the hero. Keeley has to wear drag and slip out of the nightclub in secret to avoid tabloid photographers feasting on his scandal. Lo and behold, while bobbing his glittery shoulders to We Are Family, he finds himself smiling. Losing yourself to decadence, the movie confirms, is not some abhorrence. When Val and Barbara wed during the closing credits, Armand and Albert come as they are: proud, affectionate, prosperous and incredibly gay.\n\nIf The Birdcage were made today, its refusal to let Albert be as peacockish as he pleases wouldn't sit well. Ditto the hilarious Hank Azaria playing a swishy Guatemalan houseboy. But even if its ideas weren't all radical, its cultural footprint was. Queerness had thrived in indie filmmaking thanks to directors like Todd Haynes, Gus Van Sant and Cheryl Dunye, but rarely had it made such a dent in mainstream multiplexes — and almost never with a happy conclusion. The following year, In & Out, starring Kevin Kline, would be a modest box-office hit. Three years later, Will & Grace won the Emmys' top comedy prize. Shortly thereafter, Queer as Folk, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Brokeback Mountain and Transamerica helped the country grasp more of the nuances of queer life. Along the way, marriage equality and anti-discrimination initiatives started to become realities.\n\nIt's hard to say with certainty that one thing wouldn't exist without something else preceding it, but The Birdcage marked a turning point in Hollywood. Armand and Albert showed what's possible when queer narratives don't center trauma or disease, and the actors who portrayed them did so with a convincing interiority that pushed past stereotypes. They're still worth our jazz hands.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article indicated that Robin Williams alone improvised the Madonna scene, as implied in the biography Mike Nichols: A Life. Vincent Paterson, who directed Madonna's Blond Ambition tour and is credited as the Birdcage choreographer, contacted HuffPost to say that it was he who designed the sequence at Williams' request.
In a jaw-dropping tweet President Donald Trump touted coverage by an unidentified Washington Post competitor — though clearly the National Enquirer — of the story behind the breakup of Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos' marriage. But Trump called him Jeff Bozo.\n\nThe dig on Sunday was particularly astonishing because National Enquirer chief executive David Pecker allegedly arranged to pay porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal to catch and kill their stories about their alleged affairs with Trump. The hush money, allegedly directed by Trump and provided through his former personal attorney Michael Cohen, is being investigated as a possible unreported and illegal campaign contribution.\n\nThe Enquirer's parent company, American Media, admitted to federal prosecutors that it had paid McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story with the express intention of boosting Trump's chances to win the presidency. Pecker has been given immunity to cooperate with investigators.\n\nBezos, who owns The Washington Post, and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, announced in a statement Wednesday that they had decided to divorce after 25 years of marriage. The Enquirer later that day published a story online about Bezos' alleged relationship with former Fox TV personality Laura Sanchez and followed up with a longer print version of a piece it touted as a major investigative article.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump seemed almost sensitive about the situation, and told reporters of Bezos and the divorce: I wish him luck. It's gonna be a beauty.\n\nBut his tone was different Sunday as he gloated about the Enquirer's coverage of Bezos. He had nothing to say about the Enquirer's total miss on the Daniels — and McDougal — story.\n\nSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2019\n\nThe irony was not lost on Twitter.\n\nAre you referring to the National Enquirer? I believe their accurate reporting includes a lot of stories about you they didn't print.\n\n\n\nDidn't your friends David Pecker and Dylan Howard recently receive immunity in deal to talk to Law Enforcement about you and your lawyer? pic.twitter.com/yClTsBpiYo — John Grossund (@JGrossund) January 14, 2019\n\nI keep seeing the paper in Stormy Daniels' hands — Jonathan Grant (@Brambleman) January 14, 2019\n\nI'm happy for you and Melania that Stormy Daniels will be attending Michael Cohen's public testimony to Congress. — Bruce Stillwell (@brucestill1) January 14, 2019\n\nBut somehow owning the Publisher of the National Enquirer is ok? — Lori Scarbrough Bone (@BoneScarbrough) January 14, 2019\n\nOnly in your world is the Enquirer a competitor of the Washington Post. #BenedictDonald — Help For Dogs (@FixSheltersNow) January 14, 2019\n\nYes, the National Enquirer is always more accurate than the Washington Post and their roomful of Pulitzers. Hey, isn't your friend from the Enquirer informing on you to The Mueller team. — Chris in Philly (@ciphilly) January 14, 2019\n\nSomeone got into the LSD tonight instead of the placebo. He's tripping like mad and loose on twitter again. — Terri Buchman (@terribuchman) January 14, 2019
Woman sitting on mountainside\n\nMany singles are conflicted about marrying. They yearn for the fulfillment a good marriage brings but are afraid to commit. They fear it won't work out, which given the current high rate of marriage failures, is understandable.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that it takes a leap of faith to marry. The example below shows how one woman resolved her conflict about marrying. Her major challenges were learning to believe in herself and gaining trust that she could succeed.\n\nHow to Gain Faith\n\nFor a long time after her divorce ten years earlier, Katie, a flight attendant in her late thirties, had yearned to marry again but feared another divorce. Her good friends were either divorced or had never married. Cynical about marriage, they reinforced her skepticism.\n\nKatie was in a relationship with Stanley, a divorced pilot. Besides being anti-marriage, he wasn't as emotionally supportive or reliable as she needed in a life partner. She was settling for less than what she truly wanted.\n\nBut something inside Katie said Don't give up. How she gained faith in her ability to succeed in marriage might be instructive for anyone in a similar position.\n\nKatie decided to:\n\n\n\n• Learn what it takes to create a fulfilling marriage.\n\nKatie started attending presentations by marriage and relationship experts. She learned that spouses should go out on a weekly date together, and on mini and longer vacations. She read books advising marriage partners how to talk to each other positively and constructively, including when issues arise.\n\n• Befriend happily married people as advisors and role models.\n\nKate confided in Jackie, a happily married flight attendant in the crew she was then traveling with, about her frustrating search for a man to marry. Jackie told her, It's not like Prince Charming is going to suddenly appear; it's more like you find a good man and help him become your 'prince' by how you relate to him. She said, You can do it.\n\nKatie joined a hiking group that included singles and couples. She became friendly with some of the couples who were models for good marriages.\n\n• Consult with people who help her gain faith, as is explained below.\n\nPsychotherapy\n\nKatie realized that Stanley was one of several noncommittal men she'd been involved with in the past few years. Recognizing her self-defeating pattern, she began seeing a psychotherapist. She felt understood by him. He listened well and she trusted him and the therapy process. In time she ended her relationship with Stanley and began meeting men who were open to marrying. She had been consistently rejecting marriage-minded men.\n\nAfter hearing enough of her complaints about their minor imperfections, her therapist finally said after she expressed annoyance about one such man, There you go again. He was saying that she was finding flimsy excuses to reject men who threatened to be good marriage candidates. She was trying to head them off at the pass. By remaining single she would be safe from experiencing what she most feared: another marriage failure.\n\nReligious/Spiritual Advice\n\nPsychotherapy was helping Katie end her futile dating pattern and allow men who might commit into her life. Yet she continued to be afflicted with self-doubt.\n\nAfter attending an evening lecture by a renowned rebbe [1] , she added her name to a long list of people waiting for a consultation. At one-thirty in the morning, she finally sat facing him in a private room. She confessed her fears about marriage. He spoke quietly and firmly: Marriage will be the best thing for you. It won't be 100 % successful. You can expect 97%.\n\nShe was riveted by this rebbe's words. Perhaps it had something to do with the hoopla surrounding him, but his advice moved her more than it probably would have had it come from a less lofty source.\n\nShe absorbed his calm faith in her ability to have a good marriage. He also had given her a needed dose of reality. He helped quell her false belief that a less than perfect marriage signaled doom. Perfect marriages exist in fairytales and romantic novels, not in real life.\n\nFaith Can Be Contagious\n\nKatie's story shows how faith, and also lack of faith, can be contagious. Katie's trust in her ability to succeed in marriage was strengthened by her interactions with happily married couples and with people who believed she could succeed. Consequently, she became confident enough to end an unsatisfying relationship and enter a fulfilling, lifelong one.\n\nShe's now been happily married for twenty-five years. Her husband is the man about whom, when she complained about a minor fault of his, her therapist had said, There you go again.\n\nKatie says, My marriage is great, but not perfect. It's 97%, she says with a smile.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n1. There are many differences between a rabbi and a Rebbe. One is: A rabbi answers questions, a Rebbe answers people. A rabbi hears what you say with your mouth, a Rebbe hears what you are saying with your soul.
Ann Brenoff A note left for the author by her recently deceased husband.\n\nMy life partner of decades passed away three weeks ago. And what I've discovered in those difficult weeks is how much I didn't know about the man I spent the bulk of my adult life with. No, I haven't discovered that he kept a second family in Ohio or anything along that magnitude. But what I did discover surprised me.\n\n1) He intentionally made turning on a TV in our house harder than it needs to be.\n\nFor real. My husband Vic was the master of the remotes. The black one for on/off. Gray one for volume. Blackish-gray one for channel changing. Or at least that's what I think they do. Throw in a few remotes that used to control a DVR and the little basket that houses them overflows.\n\nOnly he knew which remote did what. In a million years of marriage, he never thought it necessary to label them. Nor did I. But it wasn't until he died that I figured out why: He liked that I needed him ― and I liked it too. When I wanted to watch something on TV, I would have to call him into the room and ask for his help. He'd come in, do it and give me a peck on the cheek or a gentle bop on the head with the remote. It always made me smile.\n\nBeing needed ― and appreciated ― is one of the things that keeps a marriage alive. And since my husband's death, I have learned that we have a universal remote that does it all.\n\n2) His corniness was sweetness just wrapped in different packaging.\n\nTraditionally on the night before my birthday, Vic would wait for me to go to sleep and then scurry around the house stashing little happy birthday notes in strange places for me to discover the next day. He would stick them in my shoes, inside the coffee pot, and even inside the plastic bin we use to store the dogs' food (that one was signed by the dogs.) One year, he taped a note inside my English Muffin that luckily I spotted before it went into the toaster.\n\nSome years, he concocted an elaborate Note Hunt, using riddles as hints to lead me to the next note. He knew my morning routine precisely and taped the first note to the toilet paper.\n\nVic never gave me a birthday gift per se ― and I was fine with that. The thought and effort he put into the annual notes was gift enough.\n\nMarriage is a commitment to not just another person, but also to the idea of hanging in there through thick and thin, good and bad. My husband was a big goofy guy, an imperfect teddy bear with an occasional growl. I got scrawled notes for my birthday instead of little blue Tiffany boxes and I cherish every one of them.\n\n3) He was a better dad than I ever knew.\n\nSure he went to every practice and game for every team sport either of our kids ever played. And yes, he always drove half the team home, stopping for pizzas or In-N-Out burgers or both. And of course he always carried in his trunk spare shin guards and soccer socks in multiple colors with him ― just in case. When a violin was forgotten at home, he drove it to the music class and kept his promise to not tell Mommy. When there was a big test coming up, he was the parent who always stayed up till midnight the night before to quiz the kids.\n\nBut he did something else. To the very end, he was blind to their flaws. He loved us all too much to ever see anything wrong. In his eyes, our children were never at fault and I was the wife he was meant to marry. With love as unconditional as his, our kids are strong and solid people. They have experienced losing their Dad to a terrible illness and have emerged as kind, compassionate human beings. Our daughter is changing her college major to nursing.\n\n4) His disorganization had an upside.\n\nNot a hoarder, exactly, but Vic was definitely a pack-rat. And thank God for that. As a result of his inability to throw anything away, I am now basking in the warmth of memories spurred by what I have found in his clothing pockets. Yesterday I came upon a hotel card from a London trip we took at least 10 years ago. I also found our ticket stubs from visiting the Space Needle in Seattle, mixed in with a few old grocery store receipts and long-expired coupons for Subway. In a box in our foyer closet, I found a car key that went missing last April and the program for our daughter's 8th grade graduation. She is now a college freshman.\n\nAmid the chaos of our daily lives, I would reach the clutter breaking point and stealthily toss things out when I thought he wasn't looking. Now, each item I find feels like a cherished gem. I do wonder though why those loose almonds I found in pants he hasn't worn in years never got moldy.\n\n5) His car trunk could be declared a hazmat site.\n\nMy husband's beat-up old SUV was his man cave. He used it to take the dogs to a muddy park or sandy beach every day. It was also used to transport soccer players with stinky socks and as a storage bin for half-eaten school lunches with the occasional forgotten bag of oranges rolling around until they fully rotted. His trunk was where things went to die.\n\nHow did I not know this about his car trunk? Easy. I chose not to look.

Amanda Edwards via Getty Images Jane Seymour attends an event for the Open Hearts Foundation with daughter Katherine Flynn and two granddaughters on May 6, 2018, in Malibu, California. Seymour established the foundation, which aids other nonprofits.\n\nJane Seymour knows what it's like to parent at many stages of life.\n\nThe actor describes herself as a mother of six ― daughter Katherine, son Sean, twins John and Kristopher, and stepkids Jenni (the daughter of her husband David Flynn) and Kalen (the son of her husband James Keach). Over the years, she's spoken in interviews about parenting topics ranging from in vitro fertilization and childbirth to work/life balance and challenges dealing with attention deficit disorder.\n\nIn honor of her birthday, we've rounded up 13 quotes about parenthood from Seymour.\n\nOn What She Wishes She'd Known Before Having Kids\n\nI think I should have spent some time with teenagers first. The thing that people think is... 'Oh... we're gonna have a baby! And, then it's done and now I'm a parent.' Every child is different, and there's no handbook on it. Each child is unique and special, and the advice I'd give is to hear them — really listen — even if you don't agree.\n\nOn Her Blended Family\n\nAll the older kids helped out with the twins, which was great. We're really close, including my two stepchildren, Jenni Flynn and Kalen Keach. But we don't use the word stepkids. We do not distinguish. I'm very proud of all my children, and I spend a lot of time with them. All the fathers are very close to their children and the kids are very close to all the parents. The exes and everybody gets along. If I co-parent a child, as I did Kalen and Jenni, I'm incredibly close to those mothers and their stepfathers. Jenni's sisters from her mother's following marriage will spend Christmas or New Year's with me. My twins refer to Kalen's two brothers from his mother's then-marriage as their brothers from another mother.\n\nOn Parenting A Child With ADD\n\nThe one with ADD has a fantastic brain — extraordinary ideas and concepts that nobody thinking in the normal way would probably see — and what I would say to people with kids like that is that yes, it's incredibly frustrating. You want your children to be best at this and that and to fit into the box, but not every child is supposed to go to college, be good at math, or whatever. I never went to college, but I got to testify at Congress… so there ya go. You find your own place. Good parenting is helping your child find their strengths versus focusing on what they're not doing as well as someone else.\n\nOn Doing The Best She Can\n\nThe kids know I would choose family over any role and over anything in my life. I don't know if I'm a great mum. I'm the best mum I know how to be. I think it's all about listening to your children, communicating, and caring enough to be involved in their life. I was around for all of my kids. When they were young, anywhere I filmed, I took them with me. When they were younger I had to make compromises, sometimes about not taking roles that may have taken me away from them too much. They know that I love what I do, and they also know we're all about family, so they are all about family.\n\nOn Co-Parenting\n\nI see them all (of the children) all the time, and they are friends with one another, and they joke about the time they spent with me. We've been able to accept what happened, while not forgetting or disregarding the good we had together. Once you love someone, you always love them. You may not be... married or to be in a relationship for a long time, but the relationship you had was valuable, and then it becomes something else, if you're fortunate. You can figure out how to have a different type of relationship.\n\nOn Mother's Day\n\nFor me, Mother's Day is every day. I find it extraordinary that we need one day in which to suddenly go, 'Oh, Mom!' To me, I never forget my mother ... I have the privilege of being a mother of six and a grandmother of four. Being a mother is a very big part of my life.\n\nOn Becoming A Parent\n\nWith your first child, you try to do everything to perfection. At the same time, I was at the height of my career. I had just starred on Broadway in the original Amadeus, which won Tony Awards, and had done East of Eden (for which she won a Best Actress Golden Globe) and I had Somewhere in Time come out all in the same week. Weeks later, I announced I was pregnant. Nobody in those days did theater, television and film, and the last thing on your mind would be having a baby.\n\nOn Her First Birth\n\nI didn't think I was going to get pregnant that easily. We (she and Flynn) had been living together and planned to get married, and I had been taking care of and spending time with Jenny, David's older daughter, so my biological clock was ticking quite loudly. I had Katie (at age 31), and I wanted to have natural childbirth, breathe my way through it, possibly have the baby in a hot tub, have a doula, but my father was an OB/GYN in England, and he said, 'There is no reason to have pain, so get an epidural, and do not have a baby anywhere but in a hospital because even in the most normal of pregnancies, something can happen. And, while you may be willing to take that risk, do you really want to know that your child who might have needed emergency help didn't get it?!' So, I had the baby in the hospital, and it wasn't a perfect birth. I don't think I've ever told anyone what happened here... but she tried to exit from two places at some time. The doctor said he'd never seen anything like that. So, there was a lot of stitching going on. And, the interesting thing is that when Katie was pregnant with Willa, she announced she was gonna have a doula, etc., and I reminded her of the story of what happened with her. I've learned, though, with children that they never listen to you.\n\nOn Her Twins' Namesakes\n\nThe twins are named after Johnny Cash and Christopher Reeve. Christopher knew I was pregnant and loved the boys. Johnny became a really good friend when I did 'Dr Quinn.' He asked me to do a movie of his life, which ended up being 'Walk the Line.'\n\nOn Being A Grandmother\n\nI'm the grandma who likes to steal the kids as they come through the door. I'm the one that likes to say, 'Why don't you have a date night and leave the baby with me?' I've baby-proofed the whole house again; it's like starting all over. Being a grandparent is fantastic because you get to borrow the children for an intense amount of time, and then you get to hand them right back. I loved watching all the kids deal with the pregnancies and now watching them as parents.\n\nOn IVF And Advanced Maternal Age\n\nWe had a couple of times where it didn't work. It was emotionally a major roller coaster. I tell anyone who tries to do it that on paper it looks easy, but in reality, it's very hard. I had pre-eclampsia which often happens when you have a late pregnancy. But, the boys turned out great. They were on heart monitors for the first six months, but one is now on scholarship in Colorado playing baseball, and the other is a rock musician.\n\nOn Her Children's Paths\n\nAll of my kids are different. I've tried to keep them away from what I do for a living but they've all found really different and unique things that are very creative.\n\nOn Balance
This article was originally published on Unwritten.\n\nWho doesn't love weddings, or the reception parties afterwards? I particularly love attending weddings with friends and family but I don't plan on ever being the one at the end of the aisle. You may think this leads to the ever-rising eloping trend but that's not it either. Some people just don't want to get married, with a million reasons behind them, and here are mine: When I was little, my brother and I would tease each other about who was going to get married and have children first. My brother and I would joke about having to keep the family name going, but in reality we both never wanted to do so in the first place. I was never one for life-like child dolls or babysitting. I always, and still today, have preferred rescuing and taking care of animals. Now, all baby-carriage nursery rhymes aside, children aren't the sole reason behind exchanging marriage vows, but in some families, if you're not bearing children after your wedding, what are you doing?\n\nI may have dated before, but I've never thought staying together was a means to a marriage.\n\nI've dated people i felt like i could spend forever with and we wouldn't have needed any rings or traditions to seal that deal had we stayed together.\n\nIf at the end of a partnership, the two (or more) people are unhappy for whatever reason, traumatic or simple, why would they nearly be forced to stay together? Can't they just go their separate ways as mature adults?\n\nI have always felt better about myself, past, present, and future, when I've been single. Between relationships or even now, I've always found life easier to work out and connect with on my own. I'm not saying there aren't successful individuals who have been married before, but I just don't see myself connecting as well to who I am and what I want for myself when I'm connected to someone else.\n\nThere absolutely have been happy marriages without children but I see myself happily growing old, alone, or with a partner I'm not tied to by marriage. Now I understand that sure, maybe I'll meet someone who I'll want to spend my life with, but we won't need a certificate justifying our love for each other. There may be some nice marriage benefits out there, but I'm okay living my life without.
Breaking the Waves, the breathtaking new opera by composer, Missy Mazzoli, and librettist, Royce Vavrek, had its New York premier on January 6, 2017 at NYU's Skirball Center. It had premiered in Philadelphia in September 2016 at Opera Philadelphia, which had co-commissioned the work with Beth Morrison Projects. Based on the Lars von Trier movie of the same name, the story is set in an insular (literally) community on the Isle of Skye off the west coast of Scotland. A young woman, Bess, a member of the tight-knit religious community, marries an outsider, Jan, to the great consternation of her congregation. He works on an offshore oil rig (for us literalists, there are no oil rigs off of Skye - they are all in the North Sea on the other side of Scotland). Bess prays for his early return. He is injured and paralyzed and, from his hospital bed, asks Bess to have sex with other men and to recount her liaisons to him. The reasons for this request are murky (to keep their marriage and his hopes alive?) but her assent seemingly isn't: she feels guilty for praying for his early return, feels she may have caused his accident, wants to do the right thing by her husband and believes she will thereby cure him. That said, Bess does like sex, as we saw when she asked Jan to consummate their marriage in a loo at their wedding reception - envisioning it to be a romantic setting when it was anything but. As she sets forth, hesitantly, on her sexual adventures/redemption, is she fooling herself, or her husband, or is she delusional, or full of faith? She certainly does not enjoy the sex. She is degraded, humiliated and victimized and meets a tragic end. Her husband recovers, presumably redeemed by her sacrifice.
Article after article tells us that moms across America are utterly exhausted. Some have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, others are trying to balance work and supervising kids doing remote learning. Most are doing it with little to no support.\n\nBut men were chipping in when it came to housework and child care tasks ― at least in the first wave of the lockdown, according to a new study.\n\nOur findings based on data from very early in the pandemic show that if fathers are in the home more and work allows them to be flexible, they are more likely to be able to step up to the kinds of demands that families have, said Melissa Milkie, the lead author of the study and a sociology professor at the University of Toronto Mississauga.\n\nMilkie and her team conducted the study last May in the midst of the first wave of coronavirus-related lockdowns. Their research took into account the responses of 1,234 male-female couples across Canada with at least one child. (It's worth noting that Canada offers far more parental support to its citizens.)\n\nBoth men and women reported that dads were stepping up. The biggest gains appeared in organizing and planning children's activities: Before the outbreak, 46% of respondents said this was an equally shared task or that fathers did more than mothers. Afterward, 57% said this was the case.\n\nRespondents reported smaller increases in fathers monitoring kids at school, reading, talking and listening to them, and physical care.\n\nBut somewhere along the line, things changed. As your exhausted working mom friends have probably told you, far too many men seem to have stepped back and let their wives again take on the lion's share of the parenting and household responsibilities.\n\nAccording to a McKinsey poll conducted with LeanIn.Org, since the pandemic began, mothers are more than three times as likely as fathers to shoulder the majority of household and parenting labor. And they're 1.5 times more likely than dads to spend an extra three or more hours on chores and child care. Single mothers, of course, have it even harder.\n\nAs the McKinsey report notes, working women have always endured a second shift at home: The expectation is that they go to work, then take up the housework and child care in the evenings.\n\nNow the supports that made this possible ― including school and child care ― have been upended by the pandemic, the researchers write.\n\nMore men helped around the house early on in lockdown. What happened?\n\nWhat made fathers show up in such a big way during the first lockdown, then step back?\n\nIn the first wave of the lockdown, fathers stepped up some ― showing they will get involved when conditions are just right, Milkie told HuffPost.\n\nBut other structures and inequalities made this not sustainable in terms of more sharing, she explained. Structurally, mothers were more often in precarious, low-paid jobs, and very powerful cultural forces pressure mothers to 'choose' to reduce their work when stressors are overloading a family.\n\nI know fatigue has set in for almost everyone regarding COVID, but for many guys, there's a regular pattern that has nothing to do with COVID. - Kurt Smith, therapist in Roseville, California\n\nMore than 2 million women have left the workforce from the winter of 2019 through this fall, either due to decreased hours at work or to facilitate remote learning at home with their kids.\n\nThat's an incredibly worrisome trend. According to a report by the Century Foundation and the Center for American Progress, even a 5 percent decline in mothers' economic participation would undo the past 25 years of progress.\n\nMilkie admits her optimism about a more balanced domestic division of labor is tempered by these recent trends.\n\nI do think that in cases where mothers reduced their paid work or are no longer employed, parents have likely gone back to specialized, more traditional gender roles, she said. And of course, for single moms, and those with fewer economic resources, the pandemic has hit especially hard ― they are doing an incredible amount of work to manage raising kids in a pandemic.\n\nAs Milkie sees it, after the first wave of the lockdown, government policies, workplaces and structures all failed working mothers.\n\nThey failed in a lack of direct relief to families during the pandemic, including a focus on keeping schools and child care safely open, she said. They failed in the lack of existing infrastructure of quality, year-round care for children. Failed in a lack of paid parental leave for all workers. Failed through the structure of a labor market that disadvantages women, especially those with the fewest resources. And failed in workplaces that promote overwork and inflexibility.\n\nCouples therapists say they see dads stepping back.\n\nMarriage therapists say they've heard plenty of stories about dads who've slowly backed away from household chores and Zoom class supervision duties ― even the ones who were on top of it all at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nOne client is staying home one day a week so his wife can go to her workplace, but he continues to make excuses that he's just not good with kids and often creates more headaches for her when she gets home, so she says the benefit is a wash, said Kurt Smith, a therapist in Roseville, California, who primarily works with men.\n\nLa Bicicleta Vermella via Getty Images Many dads fall back into old gender expectations, one therapist said, like taking care of the outside of the house while expecting their partner to handle the inside.\n\nIt's almost universally acknowledged that even in 2021, tired gender expectations about housework die hard. A Gallup study from last year, before the pandemic hit, showed that even among egalitarian-minded millennial couples, it's gender ― rather than, say, the earning power of individuals ― that shapes the division of household labor.\n\nMany new dads fall back into their fathers' and grandfathers' ideas about the division of labor, Smith said, like taking care of the outside of the house while expecting their partner to handle the inside.\n\nBut in the midst of a global pandemic, men's partners need considerably more from them.\n\nI know fatigue has set in for almost everyone regarding COVID, but for many guys, there's a regular pattern that has nothing to do with COVID, Smith said. It's a pattern of stepping up for a period, falling back into old habits, then stepping up again when the relationship gets too uncomfortable.\n\nSmith said the pre-pandemic complaints he heard about lack of consistency or reliability haven't waned as the coronavirus continues.\n\nSarah Spencer Northey, a marriage therapist in Washington, D.C., said that initially, many of her millennial parent clients did say that dads were stepping up in a big way. The wives were thrilled about it.\n\nMost of my clients, who are around my age, place a strong value on achieving gender equality, so if there is a clear way to achieve that, such as a shake-up like working from home more, they jump on it, she said.\n\nBut Northey said the majority of the couples eventually ran into a big hurdle: In spite of valuing gender equality in all areas of their lives, most struggled to make it happen at home since so few people have received any sort of training or modeling on how to do so.\n\nMost people would understand why someone might freak out over cheating or a pattern of hurtful detachment. We need to lean in to calling out toxic patterns of unequal labor as well. - Sarah Spencer Northey, marriage therapist in Washington, D.C.\n\nWithout seeing it modeled by your own parents, achieving gender parity in housework and emotional labor is pretty much a pipe dream. (Even with that model, though, it's easy to slide into old gender roles; culturally, we put a premium on men's work while undervaluing women's. Plus, paid leave and child care options in the U.S. are abysmal.)\n\nIt's like our parents' generation gave us this nice idea [on household labor], but we didn't get sufficient guidance to put it into action, Northey said. It's kind of like placing a strong value on being able to play an instrument, but then having very limited instruction on how to actually play it and being sent to perform on a concert stage.\n\nHence the backsliding and bumbling we're seeing now, Northey said.\n\nMy hope for the next generation is that they will get to have both: the value and the training, with much better attempts at modeling equality around the house, the therapist said.\n\nJohner Images via Getty Images We need to support demanding equality around the house in the same way we would support demanding anything else super important to a relationship such as trust or affection, one therapist said.\n\nHere's how to ask your partner to once again step up.\n\nReverting to old patterns is a natural and expected part of making a deeper change, but it's certainly not helpful in times like these.\n\nElisabeth LaMotte, therapist and founder of the DC Counseling and Psychotherapy Center, told HuffPost the best way to reengage a slacking partner is to simply remind them of how helpful they were early on in the pandemic ― during the chaotic but we're-all-in-this-together stage of this mess.\n\nIf you're unsure of what to say, LaMotte said to script it out like this:\n\nDo you remember back in the spring when all of this felt so scary and new? I realize that I felt like more of a team back then and the steps that you took around the house made a big difference. I'd like to try to get back to that place together. Do you think that we could work on that? For example, if you could take over the meal planning, clean up after dinner each night and take care of the laundry, it would go a long way to helping me feel like we're in this together.\n\nHowever you broach it, don't feel guilty or assume you're overreacting by asking your co-parent to actually parent.\n\nWe need to support demanding equality around the house in the same way we would support demanding anything else super important to a relationship such as trust or affection, Northey said.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the marriage therapist said it's probably time we make gender inequality a dealbreaker in relationships.\n\nThe inequality needs to be seen as more than just a problem for a partner to endure patiently and compassionately alone, she said. I'm not trying to break up homes with this suggestion, just break the cycle.\n\nIf anything, Northey thinks it will benefit a marriage to talk about this kind of stuff in a direct, unequivocal manner.\n\nI actually have faith that partners will step it up once we take this problem more seriously, she said. We can stop enabling the inequality by taking more seriously how pernicious it can become. Most people would understand why someone might freak out over cheating or a pattern of hurtful detachment. We need to lean in to calling out toxic patterns of unequal labor as well.\n\nMoMo Productions via Getty Images Don't feel guilty or figure you're overreacting by asking your co-parent to actually parent, one marriage therapist said.\n\nWorkplaces need to step up, too, and understand the burdens for working dads and moms.\n\nOf course, a transparent, no-holds-barred conversation with your partner isn't a solve-all here (though it will certainly help). For working parents to have a genuinely healthy work-life balance, employers need to be a little more conscious of what their employees are going through.\n\nJust like working dads, bosses and managers need to let go of their traditionalist gender expectations about who goes to work and who stays home, Northey said. Not every employed dad has a wife at home who can supply free labor.\n\nBut men also have an obligation to speak up to their employers about their need for a better work-life balance ― just as working mothers have done since time immemorial.\n\nHistorically, many women didn't have a choice but to tell their employers they had schedule or time limitations due to family obligations, Northey said. This puts them in vulnerable positions [because they were] being perceived as less dedicated to their careers, but also made them more comfortable and better trained in speaking up about it.\n\nIf working parents are going to get through this pandemic with their sanity intact, it's going to take effort from both employers and working dads.
In 2007, when I was 14, I appeared on Kids by the Dozen, a reality show that aired on The Learning Channel and featured my family and other large families like mine. Our part of the series was shot over nine days that year, just long ― and short ― enough for us to keep up appearances as one big happy family. My father, Chris Jeub, controlled both my education and my occupation. A Gen X middle-class man, he first carved a place in my small world by controlling the uterus of my mother, Wendy, who gave birth to me and my 15 siblings.\n\nI am the third child born in our family ― my mother had my two older sisters as a teenager, and my dad adopted them when my parents married. My two older sisters had already endured the consequences of questioning my family's beliefs. Alicia, who is nine years older than me, committed the unforgivable sin of wanting to date boys. Alissa, who is six years my senior, converted to Islam when she was in her 20s, making her dead to our family. She would later reconcile with my parents after capitulating to my parents' demands and undergoing Christian counseling.\n\nKids by the Dozen led to a staged reconciliation between my parents and Alicia. In the eyes of our tight-knit Christian community, a rebellious child is a great shame and failure on the part of the parent. To address and compensate for the show's strict depiction of their parenting, my parents self-published a book called Love in the House: Filling Your Home With the Greatest Commandment. In it, they highlighted Matthew 22:36-40, in which Jesus says that the greatest commandment is to love God and others. For us kids, this meant we had to give unconditional love to our parents without questioning their beliefs or authority. For our parents, it meant that God wanted them to have more children. I know, that's not what love is at all, but, sadly, I didn't know that for the first 23 years of my life.\n\nThe cult-like beliefs that shaped my upbringing belong to what is known as the Quiverfull Movement. It is based on Psalm 127, which reads, Children are a heritage of the Lord, and fruit of the womb is his reward; happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. The metaphor of a quiver full of arrows defines children as weapons to be used to win the world for Christian conservative values.\n\nMy parents believed that God created the universe in six days about 6,000 years ago, and they refused to have my mother give birth in a hospital or to vaccinate me or my siblings. I was home-schooled from pre-kindergarten through high school, and my curriculum touched briefly on science as a subject that merely magnifies the handiwork of God, while for history I was taught that divine providence had bestowed America to Christ's faithful.\n\nCourtesy of Cynthia Jeub Jeub, age 5, holding baby No. 6, Micah, after a home birth in Kent, Minnesota, in 1997.\n\nI wore a purity ring, which I received from my parents when I was 16 years old and signified I had promised to remain a virgin until marriage so my dad could hand a pure daughter over to my future husband.\n\nDemocrats, I was told, just wanted to kill innocent babies waiting to be born in their mothers' wombs. Once born, children were welcomed as blessings but brought up, above all, to be useful and to honor every whim of their parents. Our home was often filled with chaos ― children scattered everywhere; piles of laundry and toys and dishes deep enough to wade through; one child or another practicing piano or riding through the house on a Big Wheel; my mother yelling and sometimes wielding a heavy cutting board or pizza paddle to dole out spankings. I was put to work early and quickly learned to do everything from bathing five children at a time to waking up in the night to tend to fussy toddlers while I prayed for the strength to handle my Sisyphean workload. My parents convinced me that my work was a duty to God, so it was impossible to view it for what it was: exploitation.\n\nMy dad loved to use the word assets to describe my siblings and me. At home, it meant breaks from work were a reward for good behavior. But when he quit his job as a web designer for Focus on the Family, the right-wing religious organization he worked for, and made his personal ministry into our main source of income, we each became employees ― though we were not always paid, much less paid fairly. I handled editing the speech and debate curriculum we published, provided customer service, oversaw different accounts related to the ministry, and helped manage our camps and conferences ― all for minimum wage ― starting at age 13. He often directly transferred money from my siblings' and my bank accounts without notice, or, when my bank account looked a bit too full, he would talk me into spending my earnings on an upgraded phone or laptop for the ministry.\n\nIt's been 12 years since I was on TV, in my denim dress and exhausted eyes, happily describing for the cameras how I planned to live the rest of my life like this: diapers, baths, dishes, laundry, supervising children. But it's only been four years since I started to see that something was wrong with us. What happened?\n\nAfter being home-schooled all my life, I started attending local college classes at age 19. At first, I believed that my university was something of a mission field, or place to preach about my beliefs. In those first years, I developed a following of Christian young people who admired me for my dedication and passion for my faith. But I also made friends with people who had never existed in my world before: atheists and people who are LGBTQIA+.\n\nI was put to work early and quickly learned to do everything from bathing five children at a time to waking up in the night to tend to fussy toddlers while I prayed for the strength to handle my Sisyphean workload. My parents convinced me that my work was a duty to God, so it was impossible to view it for what it was: exploitation.\n\nIt wasn't until I started college that I began to be honest with myself, and new friends from worlds far beyond the borders of mine, about how performative my life was. I was depressed, and had been for a long time, but had learned to stifle my feelings for the sake of my family. I was having conversations about astronomy and the validity of the Bible and how religion had hurt so many people. However, I still lived with my parents, and the questions I brought home with me each night were creating a power struggle with my parents over how the younger children might be influenced by what I was learning.\n\nThen one day in 2013, my parents kicked me and my little sister, Lydia, out of their house. I was 22 and she was 19 ― plenty old enough to leave the nest, but we had no cars, no savings and nowhere to go. Like our older sisters, we were never told exactly why we were kicked out. Dad went on and on about how expensive we were, and how we'd have nothing without him. I had loved Jesus with all of my heart, dedicated my life to serving him ― and my parents ― and did whatever I could to stay pure of heart for them and my future husband. I knew my protests would be futile as my dad logged into his bank, which was linked directly to our personal bank accounts, and transferred hundreds of dollars into his own account for imaginary debts he claimed we owed him. Then he said he would start charging us for rent, effective immediately ― $500 each for the small bedroom we shared in a house full of 16 people.\n\nWe left. I don't think my father expected us to find somewhere to go, but some kind friends took us in. That day was a breakthrough because it triggered memories of what I'd been forced to minimize and see as isolated incidents over the years. I dropped out of college a few months later ― my poor home-schooling had made academic success virtually impossible, and I couldn't afford it. I sank into a horrible depression and began seeing a professional therapist, who was alarmed at my poor sense of boundaries and all of the traumatic memories that poured out of me.\n\nGetting kicked out gave me the freedom to question. Maybe being gay wasn't a sin. Maybe birth control and abortion weren't the same thing. Maybe I didn't have to give birth over and over and over again in order to be worthy. Maybe there wasn't an invisible being that knew my every thought that would burn my soul if I didn't do all the right things.\n\nRealizing that my parents and the religion I had been raised in couldn't be questioned without severe consequences was like waking up from a dream. I wanted ― needed ― to get my siblings out. But legally, siblings have no real recourse to protect each other, even if a sibling ― and not the parents ― is actually the one who is doing the majority of the caretaking.\n\nCourtesy of Cynthia Jeub Jeub in 2019.\n\nI still visited the family often, desperate to get through to my siblings. I stood up for them and called my parents out on being unfair, for the first time in my life. For most of my childhood, I didn't advocate for my siblings, because I had nothing to compare our experience to, no way of knowing it was not normal or fair.\n\nThe tension escalated as I continued asking questions, and began reminding my siblings of the times we were all taught to forgive and forget about ― how we always had impossible expectations and responsibilities. But I wasn't living there anymore, and my mother could always come along and tidy up the thought process of a doubting child. She'd done the same for me for the first 19 years of my life.\n\nSoon, my parents banned me from talking to any sibling without their supervision. Then I received the dreaded phone call from my dad: an ultimatum that I could either submit to Christian counseling with them ― and endure more controlling, emotionally devastating attempts to bring me into submission ― or I would lose complete access to my family.\n\nI had to let go of my brothers and sisters, which is by far the most difficult decision I have ever made in my life. As soon as I got the phone call about losing access to my siblings, I began writing on my blog about my parents' abuse. The best evidence I have to back up the abuse claims I detailed in those blog posts came from my dad's attempt to save face. The day after the first post, he released a podcast in which he blamed my delusions on mental illness and left the microphone open for my siblings to respond to what I had written. My dad deleted the podcast within hours. I reported my parents to local authorities for child abuse, as did my therapist. I don't know whether an investigation was conducted, but the following year, six of my siblings were enrolled at the local charter school, and today the eight youngest are in school.\n\nIn 2015, I moved from Colorado to Seattle in search of a new life. Within a year, I was homeless. With no college degree and limited schooling, I only qualified for jobs doing physical labor. I worked at a grocery store deli while sleeping in a car. I showered at a gym and changed into my uniform in the bathrooms of other grocery stores. While I was living in a car, I lost my entire blog and the hundreds of posts I had published, because I couldn't afford to pay the web hosting renewal fee.\n\nTwelve years ago, my family's lifestyle was made into a spectacle for entertainment, alongside a host of controversial shows on The Learning Channel... [My siblings and I] were being under-educated, overlooked due to the sheer number of us, and the older kids were raising the younger ones, while also catering to our parents' every whim.\n\nThis past year, my partner, whom I met through mutual friends in 2016, and I found a community in Olympia, Washington. Here, we are among others who were cast out by extreme religion, most of us LGBTQIA+ and facing poverty and chronic homelessness. We exist to fight the patriarchy and colonizer-capitalism ― and to embrace our lives and love without the guilt our families and the church foisted on us for so many years. Thanks to the help of many friends and strangers from around the world, my blog archives have been restored, and I have some financial support from online patrons of my work.\n\nI suffer from chronic pain and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD). I do not own a car. I can no longer work on my feet because my body is so damaged from being overworked as a child, so I write. Between therapy and the relentless inconvenience of poverty, I write. I write about trauma and recovery, about poverty and injustice, about what I know now.\n\nTwelve years ago, my family's lifestyle was made into a spectacle for entertainment, alongside a host of controversial shows on The Learning Channel. I wasn't allowed to watch TV as a kid, so while my peers were getting to know fourth-wall-breaking humor through comedies satirizing the genre like The Office, my siblings and I were uncertain in front of the camera crew. We were being under-educated, overlooked due to the sheer number of us, and the older kids were raising the younger ones, while also catering to our parents' every whim.\n\nI have not spoken to my parents in three years. I've been told their door is open and that they are willing to welcome me back if I can set aside everything that makes me who I am today. I've never had a chance to come out to them as bisexual. As for my adult siblings, most people guess that our shared experience would bring us closer, but this has not been the case. Deeper still than the religious element of our upbringing was an emphasis on work ethic, being a good asset ― and it was this that came between my sisters and me in recent years. When I was homeless, my two older sisters blamed me for my own poverty. My parents' snare has always been our siblings, and Lydia couldn't bear to lose them. In our last exchange, she told me she was back to taking advice from our parents ― financial advice from my father and advice on essential oils from my mother for her own unvaccinated children.\n\nFour of my adult siblings are still part of the Quiverfull movement. My parents' primary message is that people should have more children, and my siblings are on their way to having large broods, too. Sometimes I receive a phone call from one of my brothers, but the chasm between what I believe now and what they believe makes communication nearly impossible. I miss them, and I hope someday I can build a relationship with them that isn't based on adhering to my parents' beliefs. Though deluded people with nefarious intentions still run the world outside of the one I eventually escaped, my pyrrhic victory is I don't have to delude myself anymore.\n\nCynthia Jeub is a freelance writer based in Olympia, Washington.

Is it possible to become accepted into the Native American tribe of my ancestor? --David C.\n\n_________________\n\nMany Americans believe they have at least one Native American ancestor. More than 900 nations, peoples, tribes, and bands (the terms are interchangeable) once lived on the North American continent, and more than 560 are recognized by the federal government today, with an additional 24 being recognized by states. However, an estimated 80 percent of Native American families became disconnected from each other and from their people over the years. So questions about how to become a member of a tribe are common.\n\nThe answer usually has to do with a concept called blood quantum (which we'll discuss later) and your ability to prove your Native American lineage.\n\nNative American nations set their own enrollment criteria in constitutions, articles of incorporation, and ordinances. These can include tribal blood quantum, tribal residency, or continued contact with the tribe. The criteria vary from nation to nation, so uniform membership requirements do not exist. The key is knowing which tribe or band your ancestor most often aligned with.\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native as Percentage of County Population: 2010. (U.S. Census Bureau)\n\nSearching for Your Ancestor\n\nA good place to start your research is with the free guide to American Indian research at Ancestry, which is full of hints and strategies.\n\nYou need to track your family generation by generation until you get back to the reservation or other location where you believe your Native American ancestor lived. Using U.S. Federal Census records is the easiest way to do this research. (Ancestry has a great article on census search secrets if you want some tips.) The 1910 census included an Indian census at the end of each county's enumeration that lists blood quantum and tribal affiliation. These records can be gold if your ancestor appears.\n\nAncestry has more than two dozen record collections that may reveal your ancestor's tribe. There are also terrific collections of photos, marriage records, allotment records (referring to reservation land given to individuals by the government), and an index card file of over 800 articles and folders with information about Indians who were moved to Oklahoma.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of written records are from five Native American nations: Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muskogee (Creek), and Seminole. The Federal government called these The Five Civilized Tribes for various reasons (one of which was the fact that they owned black slaves). Andrew K. Frank provides the following definition on the Oklahoma Historical Society website:\n\nThe term 'Five Civilized Tribes' came into use during the mid-nineteenth century to refer to the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole nations. Although these Indian tribes had various cultural, political, and economic connections before removal in the 1820s and 1830s, the phrase was most widely used in Indian Territory and Oklahoma. Americans, and sometimes American Indians, called the five Southeastern nations civilized because they appeared to be assimilating to Anglo-American norms. The term indicated the adoption of horticulture and other European cultural patterns and institutions, including widespread Christianity, written constitutions, centralized governments, intermarriage with white Americans, market participation, literacy, animal husbandry, patrilineal descent, and even slaveholding. None of these attributes characterized all of the nations or all of the citizens that they encompassed. The term was also used to distinguish these five nations from other so-called wild Indians who continued to rely on hunting for survival. Elements of 'civilization' within Southeastern Indian society predated removal. The Cherokee, for example, established a written language in 1821, a national supreme court in 1822, and a written constitution in 1827. The other four nations had similar, if less noted, developments.\n\nRecords for these five nations constitute 35-50 percent of all Native American records and 80 percent of all Native American records filmed by the National Archives. This is because in the late 19th century, the U.S. government established the Dawes Commission to oversee land redistribution within the Five Civilized Tribes. To do this, the commission attempted to create an official list of members of each nation, and required families and individuals to fill out applications for acceptance, in essence making them prove that they belonged to that particular tribe.\n\nThe Dawes Commission ended up rejecting almost two-thirds of the applications for various reasons, but census cards and application jackets were created for each applicant and are available for research, whether they were accepted or rejected. Ancestry has most of these records, as well as applications made to the Dawes Commission during an earlier attempt to enroll the tribes in 1896. (Here's an insider's tip: when you check the Dawes Census Cards,be sure to look at the front and back of each card and read all the notes. This will often lead to other cards you should check.)\n\nThe best resource for information about Native Americans other than members of these five nations is the U.S., Indian Census Rolls, 1885-1940, collection on Ancestry. These censuses include 565 federally-recognized tribes besides the Five Civilized Tribes. The early censuses usually list Indian andEnglish names, gender, age, and relationship. Some have additional birth, marriage, death and relationship notations. Not every group took a census each year. Keep in mind that blood quantum was usually not added until 1930s. Blood quantum is a measurement of tribal affiliation based on ancestry. For example, a child with one Native American parent and one non-Native American parent would be considered to have one-half Native American blood. If you have three non-Native American grandparents and one Native American grandparent, your blood quantum would be .25, or one-quarter. And so on.\n\nLocation Is Key\n\nWhere your ancestors lived will help you determine with which particular nation they were affiliated. Tribes were made up of bands of families and often formed and reformed under new leadership over the years. It was often common for a Native American man to marry outside of his nation, and associate with his wife's people going forward. Maps showing where Native American groups lived in the U.S. at specific times can be a huge help to your search.\n\n\n\nFrom The National Atlas of the United States of America (Arch C. Gerlach, editor). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Geological Survey, 1970\n\nOnce you complete your research you will need to purchase the birth, death and marriage certificates (certified copies) for each generation back to the oldest Native American ancestor you can locate, to prove your direct ancestral line to them.\n\nCase Study: Becoming a Citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma\n\nFor some peculiar reason, most Americans, white or black, who believe that they descend from a Native American ancestor believe that that ancestor was Cherokee, so let's use Cherokee records for a case study.\n\nLet's say you wanted to become a member of the Cherokee Nation. How would you go about it? Well, first, Cherokee Nation citizenship requires that you have at least one direct Cherokee ancestor listed on the Dawes Final Rolls. This roll (census, really) was taken between 1899 and 1914 and lists Indians, white citizens, and black Freedmen (former slaves) residing in what was known as Indian Territory (now northeastern Oklahoma). If your ancestor did not live in this area during that time period, they will not be listed on the Dawes Rolls. Certain requirements had to be met in order to be placed on the Dawes Roll, such as being listed on previous Cherokee rolls and a proven residency in the Cherokee Nation. Many modern-day applicants do not qualify for citizenship because their ancestors did not meet the enrollment requirements of the Dawes Commission and were not listed on the Dawes Rolls.\n\nIf you do find your ancestor listed on the Dawes Final Rolls, your next step is to obtain certified birth, marriage, and death certificates proving your lineage to that person. After you have obtained the necessary documents, contact the Cherokee Registration officer in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, to obtain an application to become a member of the nation.\n\nUnfortunately, unless you can find your ancestor's name on an official tribal roll, you will probably not be eligible for membership. Remember, too, that some Native Americans in the 1800s did not remain with their nation when they were moved to reservations or assimilated into the larger American society. Either of these facts can make it much more difficult for you to establish a direct Native American ancestral connection. Of course, this doesn't mean you don't have Native American ancestry. In fact, we encourage you to take a DNA test which will show your percentage of Native American ancestry (but not a specific tribal affiliation or connection), over the last few hundred years. Establishing the DNA basis of Native American identity is fairly straightforward. But using archival records to prove specific Native American ancestry--that is, a connection to one particular group or nation--takes some legwork, and sometimes a little luck, but reconnecting with that heritage can be a source of pride for generations to come, even if you aren't able to join a particular nation.
When the nameless narrator of Katie Kitamura's smart, spare book A Separation finds out that her husband is missing, she's relatively nonplussed. Christopher's prone to fits of whimsy, and besides, they haven't spoken in a month. Because of his philandering and a mismatch in temperament, the couple has separated, but kept the split a secret.\n\nIn a certain kind of book ― a domestic thriller à la Gillian Flynn, say ― this setup would frame the narrator as a suspect responsible for her husband's disappearance. But Kitamura's story isn't so concerned with whodunit. Instead, her narrator reflects on her relationship with Christopher, on his tics and charming habits, and on how to mourn the possible loss of someone she's already drifted apart from.\n\nAlthough she's shacked up with her husband's close friend Yvan, the narrator agrees to travel to Mani, Greece, where Christopher is supposedly at work on a book about mourning rituals. (His last book, a sweeping history of the social life of music, was a bestseller indicative of his capriciousness and aversion to sitting still with a single topic ― or partner.)\n\nIt's Christopher's mother, Isabella, who persuades the narrator to travel to Greece; she's close with her son, but never approved of his marriage. In Mani, the ground is scorched from fires, and the few landmarks away from the beach ― ancient churches, mostly ― are in disrepair. At the swanky seaside resort ― the same place Christopher had been staying before he disappeared ― the narrator imagines her husband's dalliances with a young woman working at the front desk (his type). She imagines Christopher hitching a ride with the same driver who carts her off to meet a professional mourner, under the pretense of working on a book about mourning herself. The lie affords her access to Christopher's probable experiences from a few days prior. She speaks with a woman who, in keeping with an ancient tradition, is hired to offer lamentations at funerals, performing loss for those who are unable to do so, mired as they are in the stillness of grief.\n\nMuch of the book, then, involves a woman trying to imagine the inner life of a man she's fallen out of love with, trying to re-inhabit his thoughts in order to find him. The resulting, meandering observations earned Kitamura praise from Karl Ove Knausgård, who said even minor deviations in the book seem loaded with meaning.\n\nA visit to a police station in Mani results in commentary on fear and how we express it facially; a found issue of a literary magazine leads to an aside about the merits of economical writing. Kitamura's narrator is a translator, and the book's style reflects her interest in deliberateness. Of a poorly written advertisement, she writes, the copywriter had no ear to speak of ― why, for example, somewhat stale rather than simply stale?\n\nKitamura, on the other hand, gives us a book that's worth reading for its inventive cadences alone. And there's more to it than that: surprising turns and honest thoughts on the complexity of loss.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhat begins as a thriller unfolds into a wending examination of closeness, loss and recovery.\n\nWho wrote it\n\nKatie Kitamura is the author of Gone to the Forest and The Longshot, finalists for the New York Public Library's Young Lions Fiction Award.\n\nWho will read it\n\nAnyone interested in spare writing, literary thrillers or reflective stories about relationships.\n\nWhat other reviewers think\n\nThe New Yorker: Kitamura is a writer with a visionary, visual imagination ― she's an art critic, too ― and a bold symbolist streak. The mood she likes best is menace.\n\nSan Fransisco Chronicle: Katie Kitamura's 'A Separation' should be added to the list of superb novels of romantic endings.\n\nOpening lines\n\nIt began with a telephone call from Isabella. She wanted to know where Christopher was, and I was put in the awkward position of having to tell her that I didn't know. To her this must have sounded incredible. I didn't tell her that Christopher and I had separated six months earlier, and that I hadn't spoken to her son in nearly a month.\n\nNotable passage\n\nThis is one reason why you become better as you grow older, when you are young, you do not have an intimate experience of death, of loss, you do not have enough sadness in you to mourn.

Charles LaLa Evans and his wife, Louise, had often spoken about creating a museum for the hundreds of photographs they'd amassed in their decades of marriage. But only when Louise passed away just one month before their 60th wedding anniversary did Evans know he had to move forward with the project.\n\nIndeed, just a couple months after she died, Evans was hard at work transforming his home into a museum of love -- a tribute to his beloved wife, he told The Huffington Post. It was all a memento of her. She was such a sweet lady, Evans said.\n\nAfter hanging up over 1,000 photos and displaying videos of happy times through the house, Evans named the museum LaLa and Louise Land.\n\nThe touching tribute became popular in Evans' native Starkville, Mississippi where he is well-known by locals after serving for 30 years as one of the first black mailmen and then as a shuttle bus driver for Mississippi State University.\n\nEven the rock band Mutemath came to know of Evans. Members were so moved by the tribute they wanted to share the love story of LaLa and Louise in their music. Their latest music video, aptly titled Monument, was filmed in the museum, with Evans happily dancing through the various rooms of the house.\n\nWe used to dance together, Evans said. I learned that when I dance now, I can tell myself, 'This girl ain't goin' nowhere. She's gonna stay right here with me.'\n\nEvans says he's always been a music lover so he was happy to be part of the video and had no hesitation about sharing her legacy with the world. That's why we built it, to open it up to the world, he said.\n\nWatch the video above to see this incredible display of love.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nPHOTO GALLERY TV Couples Who Make Us Believe In Love
Fox News host Tucker Carlson has cooked up a wild new conspiracy theory about President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden: Their entire 43-year marriage is a sham created for publicity.\n\nCarlson, triggered by Valentine's Day coverage of the overtly affectionate first couple, launched into a riff of over-the-top mock praise of the Bidens' relationship based on those media reports.\n\nNot since Antony dined with Cleopatra in downtown Antioch ― before they killed themselves, obviously ― has a country witnessed a love story as poignant as Jill and Joe's, he sarcastically declared, adding:\n\nJill Biden is not Joe's caretaker. She isn't his nurse. She's his fully equal romantic partner. Together, they are like besotted teens, yet, at the same time, they are the wise and knowing parents of a nation.\n\nCarlson specifically cited a Politico report on the Bidens PDA that stated, Historians and relationship experts agree: The first couple's romantic gestures aren't just genuine — they're restorative.\n\nThen he mocked both the coverage and the couple.\n\nSo it's official: The Bidens' affection is totally real. It's in no way part of a slick PR campaign devised by cynical consultants determined to hide the president's senility by misdirection, he said, his voice rising a pitch and turning into a cackle. Not at all! Their love is as real as climate change.\n\nNormally that would mean the first couple's relationship is on solid footing, given that climate change is real.\n\nBut Carlson, like many figures on the right-wing network, is a longtime science denier who has attacked everything from vaccines to climate change... so the comparison wasn't exactly sincere.\n\nHis full monologue is on YouTube. But on social media, critics weren't exactly feeling the love for Carlson's latest claims:\n\nWill someone please cancel this dishonest a$$? https://t.co/1V5RAuZnQE — Khashoggi's Ghost (@UROCKlive1) February 17, 2021\n\nWTF is wrong with this guy?

Marriage means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. But when you really boil it down, there are some surprisingly universal aspects of married life that husbands and wives know all too well.\n\nFor example, you will regularly be tasked with helping your partner find lost items — their car keys, the remote, the ketchup, etc. — that aren't lost at all. One or both of you will routinely fall asleep five minutes into any movie or TV show you try to watch past 9 p.m. And no matter how much you love each other, you will, at some point, find yourself inexplicably perturbed by the way your spouse breathes.
Jimmy Kimmel invoked a higher power Tuesday to slap some sense into President Donald Trump. (Fast forward to the 2:45 mark in the video below.)\n\nIn his latest home-confinement monologue, the talk show host mocked Trump's goal to have the country opened up by Easter to get people back to work amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump's aspiration, Kimmel noted, defies health experts, who say we need to maintain social distancing for a longer haul to stem the death toll.\n\nBy Easter? Kimmel asked incredulously. That's in 2 1/2 weeks. Even Jesus is like, 'Jesus! Calm down, let's think this thing through.'\n\nThe host added: We're all gonna die so the president can eat Peeps.\n\nKimmel also mentioned that first lady Melania Trump tested negative for COVID-19.\n\nOf course she did, she's been six feet way from her husband since Stormy Daniels, he cracked. Their marriage was the inventor of social distancing.
As an entrepreneur, it can often feel as though you fall more often than you rise. It's important to note, that when you imagine yourself getting back up, you tend to picture the physical act of standing. But this is not the case.\n\nWhen you are knocked down. Your confidence can be rattled and thrown into question. Getting back up, means stepping back into the mind, emotion and stature of the confident human being you know that you are. This is something I teach all of my coaching clients.\n\nDo you know where your confidence lives? What are the beliefs, the feelings, the way you use your body that allows you to be at your most confident?\n\nOne of my life long friends (we'll call her Lyndsey) lost her husband two years ago when he suffered a massive heart attack on the way home from work.\n\nShe was devastated.\n\nHer dream was to spend the rest of her life with this man. To watch their children grow up, to hold him one more time. But these dreams were gone.\n\nShe openly shared the journey of the past two years on her Facebook profile. The tears, the fears, the challenge of finding the person she needs to be in order to move forward.\n\nOne day, a few months ago, she declared that she wasn't going to spend the rest of her life feeling like a widow. Defining herself according to that loss wouldn't help her move forward.\n\nShe reclaimed her strength, her confidence and acknowledged the strength of her support system to help see her through it.\n\nYesterday she posted that she'd gone on her first date, and he was a complete gentleman.\n\nMy late mother in law, (my ex wife's mother) ran a seven figure business for well over a decade. She relied heavily on the loyalty of her biggest customer in order to maintain this. But one year, this customer decided to go with another company that offered better pricing.\n\nHer business collapsed and so did her confidence. She died penniless. This didn't have to be her fate.\n\nIt's been said that everything happens for a reason. I don't believe that. I don't believe that the reason is inherent in the events of our lives. I do believe that whenever we experience a loss, especially the big ones. We must examine it for the opportunity it provides. The question that serves us best is, What is required of me, in order to bounce forward?\n\nIn order to bounce forward, you need to make a set of decisions regarding what you'll believe, who will you turn into and who you are willing to work to become.\n\nYour purpose as a business owner and a human being, is bigger than your marriage or the loyalty of one customer. If you happen to lose one or both. It is critical that you don't lose sight of your purpose.\n\nYour purpose is the experience you've decided to bring to the world by virtue of your presence in it. When you fall, commit yourself to rising up. Step back into your confidence. Reaffirm your purpose, and strive on, untiringly.
It's been one day since Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) announced she was running for president in the 2020 election, and parts of her conservative past are already coming back to haunt her.\n\nThey returned in the form of homophobic remarks the congresswoman made over a decade ago. At least twice the Hawaii Democrat publicly called the LGBTQ community and supporters of same-sex marriage homosexual extremists.\n\nIn one instance in February 2004, Gabbard, at the time a 22-year-old state representative, was testifying against a bill aimed at legalizing same-sex civil unions.\n\nTo try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nSix months later, Gabbard spoke more candidly while replying to an email originally sent to her father, Mike Gabbard, who was a Republican city councilman in Honolulu running for Congress.\n\nI smell a skunk, Gabbard told Honolulu Magazine. She was responding to an email that was originally addressed to her father asking about his ties to the leader of a Hare Krishna movement in Hawaii, according to the magazine.\n\nIt's clear to me that you're acting as a conduit for The Honolulu Weekly and other homosexual extremist supporters of Ed Case [Mike Gabbard's opponent], she wrote.\n\nUm, yes. This is language she used frequently then https://t.co/FbIG7wP4OV — Nick Grube (@nickgrube) January 12, 2019\n\nIn a statement provided to HuffPost on Sunday night, Gabbard said she regretted her previous conduct, but noted her recent support for legislation backing LGBTQ rights over her years in Congress.\n\nFirst, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said, Gabbard said. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\n\nOver the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on LGBTQ+ issues, she continued.\n\nMuch work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected President, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all, she said.\n\nGabbard was elected to the U.S. House in 2012 and became the first Hindu member of Congress, as well as one of Congress' first female combat veterans. She quickly became a star of the Democratic Party with her own rogue brand of progressive leadership.\n\nGabbard's remarks from 14 years ago were bound to resurface as she walked even further into the national spotlight with her presidential bid.\n\nAnd while Gabbard, 37, has evolved since then ― she once backed a bill targeting discrimination based on sexual orientation and famously endorsed Bernie Sanders' presidential bid at the expense of her post as Democratic National Committee vice chair ― some people, including journalists from Hawaii to D.C., wouldn't let her off easy for her homophobic remarks.\n\nTulsi Gabbard referred to gay people as homosexual extremists and sided with Assad over Obama (to name a few concerns).\n\n\n\nNext.\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/IbRw4Kt5JE — Peter Fox (@thatpeterfox) January 12, 2019\n\nSo, she'll co-sponsor bills supporting LGBTQ rights, but still personally thinks we're icky. https://t.co/vw5pl67lYs — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) January 12, 2019\n\nTulsi Gabbard is a flat no. For many reasons, including this one. https://t.co/JxX4atDvUb — Mark Harris (@MarkHarrisNYC) January 12, 2019\n\nGabbard may back legislation that supports the LGBTQ community, but it's unclear if her personal views have evolved with her career.\n\nA 2016 profile of the combat veteran published in Ozy suggests otherwise: She tells me that, no, her personal views haven't changed, but she doesn't figure it's her job to do as the Iraqis did and force her own beliefs on others, noted reporter Sanjena Sathian.\n\nThis story has been updated with Gabbard's statement to HuffPost.\n\nDavid Barden contributed reporting.
After the kids go to bed, it's our only real time together.\n\nWe pry our own sleepy eyes open and hold hands while watching TV. We make love when we're exhausted, because it's our one chance.\n\nHe kisses me as he goes out the door to work every morning. We text I love you during the day. Sometimes we text angry things we didn't get to finish talking about before our coffees were finished; before it was time to shower and get dressed for our days spent largely apart.\n\nI stay home with our kids, and this beloved role sometimes feels like it consumes me—I admit it. I love being a mom. I hate being a mom sometimes, too. It's complex, just like my children—just like people—are, but it's everything I dreamed it would be, and it's a billion other things I didn't expect or wouldn't choose.\n\nBut my marriage is far from over, and our us isn't resigned to past tense.\n\nWe do share a history—most couples do. Most couples have a story of their own special romance hidden inside of the 9 to 5, dinner-making, and school bus meeting; tucked inside of a peck of a kiss we wish lasted longer; buried beneath laundry piles.\n\nI admit to wanting a future with more of us waiting before the sunset.\n\nI want to know in my heart our kids will only be little for so long, so we'll cherish and nurture this gentle space in their lifetimes, where we get to be parents, and partners, and a family. I do believe this, but I know also life can be unfair.\n\nI don't want to save our us for someday.\n\nI don't want to pause our romance for tomorrow.\n\nI don't want to wait for the weekends to hold a kiss.\n\nWe try to fit our us into our Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. We try to be the people who met, fell in love, and had children, before finding our love story placed haphazardly underneath a stack of our daughter's school papers. We try to, but the reality is that life and love are different when you are sleep-deprived, loving parents to small kids.\n\nSitters can't come often enough.\n\nDate night can't be frequent enough.\n\nThese two hours we have before finally crashing at night can never be exactly the same as before, when we lazily lounged in bed on Saturday mornings instead of helping tiny people use the toilet right away.\n\nI don't want it to be the same, but I do want more of him, and more of us.\n\nI try to hold that kiss as he walks out the door in the morning, while I've already embraced a billion other to-dos. (I try to stay here with him, and kiss.)\n\nI try to show my daughters who I am, outside of and intertwined with being their Mommy. I try to be a person, and a woman, and their daddy's best friend, and a wife.\n\nI try to laugh with him while we cook dinner, instead of frowning because he didn't place a bowl where I think it should go in the dishwasher. I try to enjoy these moments we do have together, even when they don't feel like enough.\n\nI try to show him I love him. I try to show him I still need his love.\n\nMy marriage is far from over. Although, at times, we feel more like roommates than the pair who fell in love. But we aren't roommates—and if we're soulmates, it's irrelevant—because what I really need him to know is that I choose him over and over again every day.\n\nI choose him with each peck on the cheek as he rushes out the door.\n\nI choose him with every second I stay awake instead of collapsing into bed.\n\nI choose him, over and over again—but sometimes it needs to be said.\n\nThe people we love deserve to be told how much we appreciate them, as often and as freely as it is easy to complain or nitpick. The people we love deserve the best of us. The people we share our lives with every single day need to at least occasionally be reminded we're here because we chose it.\n\nEvery day our kids grow, shape-shift, and age in ways that are both obvious and less defined. Every day my husband and I inch closer to each other, without a child stepping in between our legs as we hug. Every day our marriage is different, in ways that are positive as well as challenging.\n\nEarly this morning, I stood with our toddler in the kitchen.\n\nHer big sister had left for school. Her daddy had left for work. We stood together, and she told me she was a little big girl because she's a big girl, but she isn't big enough yet to get her own breakfast.\n\nBefore we both know it, she'll be less of a little big girl and more of a big girl.\n\nBefore we both know it, she'll be less of a girl.\n\nBefore we both know it, she'll have to reminded she was once my little big girl.\n\nIt's not sad, necessarily, it's just true. It's beautiful, really. It's metamorphosis. It's transition. It's growth. It's change. It's death. It's life.\n\nAnd my marriage isn't over, and it hasn't stalled. It's been gifted with rebirth.
Zach Gibson via Getty Images Mat Staver (far right), the founder of Liberty Counsel, at a demonstration outside the Supreme Court on Dec. 12, 2018. After backlash against his opposition to an anti-lynching bill, the group claimed that listing protected categories in the legislation would limit its application.\n\nAfter more than a century of inaction from Congress, the Senate unanimously approved legislation in December that would make lynching a federal hate crime.\n\nBut some conservative evangelical Christian activists are upset that the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act contains language that specifically protects people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nMat Staver, the founder of the conservative litigation group Liberty Counsel, told the Christian news site OneNewsNow that his team is talking to House politicians to ensure that the act is stripped of this inclusive language.\n\nThe old saying is once that camel gets the nose in the tent, you can't stop them from coming the rest of the way in, he said in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nWhile emphasizing that he's generally in favor of banning lynching, Staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer Americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts.\n\nThis is a way to slip it in under a so-called anti-lynching bill, and to then to sort of circle the wagon and then go for the juggler [sic] at some time in the future, he said.\n\nLiberty Counsel has spent years advocating against LGBTQ rights, prioritizing the religious liberty of conservative Christians over the civil rights of queer Americans. The organization represented Kim Davis, the now-former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical Christian heroine, comparing her at one point to Jewish people who were persecuted by the Nazis.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Staver (left) at a news conference discussing a trial on same-sex marriages in San Francisco in 2006. In a recent interview he said his team is talking to House politicians to ensure that the anti-lynching bill is stripped of language protecting LGBT people.\n\nOn its surface, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act isn't about queer rights. The bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. According to the NAACP, lynching was used after the Civil War to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in America from 1882 to 1968.\n\nSince a new session of Congress has begun, the Senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the House that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.\n\nAs of now, the Senate bill defines lynching as two or more people willfully caus[ing] bodily injury because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nStaver told OneNewsNow that if passed, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nPizer said LGBTQ Americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, only a minority of states have laws that specifically protect queer people.\n\nLambda Legal, the ACLU, and other progressive organizations have been pushing for the passage of the Equality Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination against queer people in employment, housing, education and other areas of their lives.\n\nBecause there continues to be confusion and debate about whether LGBTQ people already are legally equal — and whether or not we should be equal — we need the law to be inclusive and crystal clear, Pizer told HuffPost in an email.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Mike Huckabee (left), Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis and Staver, her lawyer, after her release from jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Kentucky. Liberty Counsel has for years advocated against LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn response to backlash it received for Staver's position on the anti-lynching bill, Liberty Counsel released a statement Thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the OneNewsNow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would limit the law's application.\n\nLynching should be prohibited no matter the person's reason for committing this violent crime, Staver said in the statement.\n\nThe organization also said it has received death threats over the issue.\n\nIn a YouTube video defending the organization, Jonathan Alexandre, Liberty Counsel's public policy director, said that some politicians and media organizations are using lynching's horrible history to push unrelated political agendas. He confirmed that Liberty Counsel is questioning members of Congress about the created list of protected categories.\n\nThe historical victims of lynching should not, as I do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda, he said.\n\nLiberty Counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes LGBTQ Americans should not be treated as a protected class.\n\nPizer said she believes Liberty Counsel has repeatedly used an ends-justify-the-means approach to furthering its goals.\n\nWith the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against LGBTQ people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension, she said. That it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by Christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-LGBT advocacy can become.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Lindsey Graham voted out dozens of President Trump's judicial nominees in his first act as the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nWASHINGTON ― It's hard to keep up with everything going on in Washington, but if there's one thing constantly humming along in the background, it's the Republican effort to push through President Donald Trump's judicial nominees.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to send 44 of Trump's court picks to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote. That's a huge number at once; progressive judicial advocacy groups dubbed the committee's hearing a monster markup.\n\nMost of these nominees were introduced in the last Congress but didn't get confirmed in time, so Republicans are expediting them in one big batch.\n\nThursday's action comes as Trump has already drastically reshaped federal courts. To date, he has seen 30 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices confirmed. That's so many circuit judges ― more than any other president had confirmed by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts are now filled by judges nominated by Trump.\n\nBut Democrats and progressive groups aren't just alarmed by the number of Trump's picks sailing through. Many of these nominees have spent their careers attacking LGBTQ rights, abortion rights and voting rights, and now they're on their way to holding lifetime seats on federal courts.\n\nAs Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) pointed out in Thursday's hearing, more than 80 percent of Trump's judicial nominees so far are members of the conservative Federalist Society. For some context, she noted that less than 4 percent of all American lawyers are members of that group.\n\nMonth after month, we have seen a parade of these so-called conservative activists nominated to the federal courts, Hirono said. They have been groomed by conservative political ideologues. They want to see Roe v. Wade overturned or narrowed into oblivion, LGBT people permanently consigned to the margins of American life, and constitutional and civil rights encroached [based] on the religious preference of a vocal few.\n\nThis story would be pages long if we spelled out the records of all of the controversial nominees who just advanced, so here's a sampling of the people drawing some of the fiercest criticism from civil and women's rights groups. All of these nominees are likely to be confirmed given Republicans' majority in the Senate.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Allison Jones Rushing\n\nAllison Jones Rushing, nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit\n\nThe 37-year-old attorney was a legal intern at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has classified as a hate group, and mentored people through the organization's controversial Blackstone Legal Fellowship program.\n\nAs reported by Rewire in 2013, the Blackstone program focuses on fighting for the criminalization of abortion; against the rights of LGBT people; for so-called religious liberty (which often comes in the form of defending clients who wish to discriminate against gay people based on their religious beliefs); and for organized Christian prayer in government or public school settings.\n\nRushing also argued in a 2013 panel discussion that there were both moral and practical reasons for creating the Defense of Marriage Act, the former federal law that banned same-sex marriage. She frequently referenced the late Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent from the Supreme Court's 2013 decision striking down part of DOMA that said it departed from traditional concepts of marriage and morality.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Eric D. Miller\n\nEric D. Miller, nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit\n\nThe 43-year-old attorney has built a career out of fighting tribal interests and sovereignty, so much so that one Native American leader described Miller's law firm, Perkins Coie, as the go-to destination for jurisdictions that want to fight an Indian tribe.\n\nTwo prominent Native American organizations ― the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund ― wrote to Judiciary Committee leaders in August citing problems with Miller.\n\nOur concern is that he chose to build a law practice on mounting repeated challenges to tribal sovereignty, lands, religious freedom, and the core attribute of federal recognition of tribal existence, the letter says. His advocacy has focused on undermining the rights of Indian tribes, often taking extreme positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal rights.\n\nTheir opposition to Miller is only the third time either group has opposed a federal judicial nominee.\n\nC-SPAN Matthew Kacsmaryk\n\nMatthew Kacsmaryk, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas\n\nThe 42-year-old lawyer wrote approvingly in a 2015 op-ed that the Catechism holds that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered,' 'contrary to the natural law,' and 'do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.'\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Kacsmaryk criticized the Supreme Court's decision in favor of marriage equality, saying that the justices who ruled for it found an unwritten 'fundamental right' hidden in the Constitution so cleverly concealed ... that it took almost 150 years to find.\n\nOn abortion matters, Kacsmaryk fought to give pharmacists the right to deny emergency contraceptives to women. In a 2016 amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court, he wrote that a Washington state law requiring pharmacists either to fill a medical prescription or find an available pharmacist who will, which had been upheld by the 9th Circuit, authorizes an unprecedented and dangerous intrusion on the most basic right of conscience. The Supreme Court let the 9th Circuit decision stand.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Wendy Vitter\n\nWendy Vitter, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana\n\nThe 58-year-old attorney is a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn't tell senators about her extreme comments on the topic.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says they promote women's health, Vitter said in a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new clinic in New Orleans. It is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women's health is to let them live.\n\nAhead of her 2018 confirmation hearing, Vitter, whose husband is former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), did not disclose to the committee that she had moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference peddling false information about the dangers of abortion ― or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms claiming that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News later uncovered these missing materials.\n\nC-SPAN Howard C. Nielson Jr.\n\nHoward C. Nielson Jr., nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah\n\nThe 51-year-old lawyer fought for California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, before it was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n\nDuring the case, Nielson argued that sexual orientation is a choice and disputed the harmful effects of discrimination on LGBTQ people. When a U.S. district court ruled in 2010 that Prop 8 violated the Constitution, Nielson argued that then-Chief Judge Vaughn Walker should have recused himself from the case because he was gay and therefore, Nielson claimed, unable to be fair on the issue. He filed a motion contending that Walker had a duty to disclose not only the facts concerning his [same-sex] relationship, but also his marriage intentions. That motion was denied by another judge.\n\nNielson also defended a former Justice Department colleague who wrote a controversial and now-rescinded memo authorizing the CIA's use of torture.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Patrick Wyrick\n\nPatrick Wyrick, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nThe 37-year-old Oklahoma Supreme Court justice made limiting reproductive rights a top priority when he previously served as state solicitor general. In one case, he defended a law that would have required minors to obtain a prescription before buying emergency contraception. The law would have also forced adult women to prove their age before purchasing such contraception. The legislation was permanently blocked by a state judge in 2014.\n\nWyrick filed an amicus brief in the landmark 2014 Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that closely held corporations are in some circumstances exempt from regulations their owners object to on religious grounds — specifically, the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. In his brief, Wyrick argued that the mandate was unconstitutional because religious faith is more than mere belief. It is practice.\n\nHe also worked closely with then-Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to challenge environmental protections in order to help the oil and gas industry.
Start to finish, Hilary Duff's wedding fashion game was on point.\n\nWhen the Lizzie McGuire actor married singer-songwriter Matthew Koma on Dec. 21 at their Los Angeles home, she stunned in not one, but two looks. For the ceremony and beginning of the reception, she wore a structured Jenny Packham gown, which had empowered shoulders, cape-like sleeves and sweet hidden details like the couple's initials, their kids' initials and date of the wedding embroidered into the skirt.\n\nOn Wednesday, we got a glimpse at the beaming bride's second look when she shared several new photos on her Instagram. In the pictures, Duff is wearing a gold, glittery two-piece ensemble with hoop earrings and her hair slicked back in a low ponytail.\n\nMaking promises to this guy was by far the best day/night of 2019,\n\nDuff captioned the photos. 2018 was so special because of [daughter] Banksy. 2019 will always hold our wedding♥️ feeling grateful for health, our family, love, and dreams coming true.\n\nDuff and Koma announced their engagement in May after dating on and off since 2017. They are parents to 14-month-old Banks; Duff also has a 7-year-old son, Luca, from her previous marriage to hockey player Mike Comrie. Both kids played a role in the ceremony.
Elva Etienne via Getty Images A new study found that nearly 50% of LGB high school students have considered suicide, compared to 13% of straight students.\n\nDespite decades of progress on cultural visibility and political rights, queer youth are still killing themselves at alarming rates.\n\nAccording to a study by The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ suicide prevention organization, lesbian, gay and bisexual young adults are over four times more likely to report planning or attempting suicide in the past year. Nearly 50% of LGB high school students have considered suicide, compared to 13% of straight students.\n\nThe study is based on data from nationwide surveys of high school students and young adults taken in 2017 and 2018. Because federal surveys don't collect data on gender identity for people over 18, the Trevor Project study does not include information on transgender or non-binary students. Research has consistently found that transgender youth have higher rates of suicide than their straight or LGB peers.\n\nThe study also reveals that the suicide disparity between straight and LGB high school students persists into young adulthood.\n\nWe're not seeing LGB youth catching up once they move out of the home and start independent lives, said Amy Green, the Trevor Project's research director. This indicates that the suicide disparity isn't just the result of overt abuse from fellow students or parents during adolescence. Queer young adults may be experiencing lingering trauma from the time they spent in the closet or ongoing discrimination.\n\nThis theory, known as minority stress, may also explain another surprising finding from the study: For high school students, bisexuals were more likely to have attempted suicide than their straight or gay peers.\n\nTrevor Project Bisexual high schoolers have higher rates of suicidal ideation than their straight or gay peers.\n\nTravis Salway, a professor of epidemiology at Simon Fraser University who researches LGBT mental health, said higher suicide risk among bisexuals is a consistent research finding across all age groups. The explanation, he said, is that bisexual individuals often feel rejected from both straight and queer cultures.\n\nIf you're a bisexual in a heterosexual relationship, other people will just assume you're straight, which makes you feel invisible, Salway said. And then if you try to join the queer community, you find that there's very little recognition or representation of your experiences. One of the greatest risks for suicide is feeling like you don't matter or you don't belong. That erasure is a huge challenge for bisexual people.\n\nThe suicide disparity between the queer and straight communities — and between bisexuals and their gay and lesbian peers — persists into adulthood. Salway said rates of suicide attempts are highest among adolescents, fall in young adulthood, then spike again as LGB people reach their 30s and 40s.\n\nA lot of people start to consider suicide in high school, but as they age they develop coping mechanisms through their job or their social network and those suicidal thoughts go away, Salway said. But then, as they lose friends and family members as part of aging, those feelings of loneliness and depression return. We've been attentive to the risk of suicide among queer adolescents but we also need to look at what's happening in adulthood, Salway said.\n\nAll of these findings challenge the presumption that greater societal acceptance of queer people will automatically result in better health outcomes. Despite the massive gains in cultural awareness and advances in political rights, there are still profound disparities in openness to LGB students throughout the United States. According to the LGBTQ anti-bullying organization GLSEN, over 70% of LGBTQ students experienced verbal harassment at school in 2017.\n\nWe know that there are effective ways to prevent suicide, but we need a much stronger national effort to begin actually reducing LGBTQ youth suicide. Amy Green, Trevor Project research director\n\nBroader societal factors could also play a role. Suicides among American adolescents have been rising steadily since 2007, a phenomenon researchers still cannot fully explain. Plus, research has found that depression and drug use spiked among the LGB community during the nationwide debate over banning gay marriage in 2004 and 2005. Recent political developments, such as the highly publicized ban on trans soldiers in the military, may be having a similar effect.\n\nRegardless of the cause, though, Green said that the United States needs to make deliberate investments in suicide reduction among queer youth and young adults.\n\nThis isn't going to get better on its own, Green said. In recent years, the VA has significantly reduced suicide among veterans by providing comprehensive screening and follow-up services for patients receiving services from a VA medical center. The U.S. could make a similar effort with the queer community.\n\nWe know that there are effective ways to prevent suicide, Green said, but we need a much stronger national effort to begin actually reducing LGBTQ youth suicide.
Visual Generation via Getty Images Discussions about menstruation have become more commonplace, but menopause is still a taboo topic in many circles.\n\nHi, readers!\n\nWhen I talked to people around me, it seemed like menopause was considered like the end of life as a woman, which is kind of sad, says HuffPost France's Marine Le Breton.\n\nWhile writing a piece about menopause, Marine found that feminism has encouraged more discussion about menstruation but that menopause is still off-limits in many circles.\n\nMen are praised for their gray hair while women are seen as old, less beautiful, and, moreover, infertile! Marine tells me. She notes that while women seem to be embracing their gray hair, society still appears to have a long way to go to erase the taboo of the time period in which menstruation ends and women's bodies change again.\n\nWomen have also reported facing consequences professionally due to menopause. The Guardian spoke with several women last year who reported anxiety, confusion or loss of confidence, which sometimes led to absences or disciplinary measures at work. Others have reported having to take time off when they are experiencing menopause symptoms.\n\nAnd although workplaces have become more cognizant of many life changes, most don't have policies addressing menopause.\n\nEmployers need to do more, Rachel Maclean, a member of the British Parliament, has said. Employees don't get the support they need.\n\nBut in many places, the first step may be to just talk about the subject more, Marine tells me.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a taboo, she says. It's happening to all women, and it's no disease. It's changing a lot of things for women, but it is not something they should have to hide.\n\nHave you encountered a stigma toward menopause in your community or workplace? Share your story with me.\n\nUntil next week,\n\nSara\n\nSara Bondioli, editor, HuffPost U.S.\n\n***\n\nReaders of French can follow Marine Le Breton (@marine_mlb) for more stories about feminism, discrimination, LGBTQ rights and animal welfare, or follow HuffPost France (@LeHuffPost) for more news about topics of discussion there.\n\nIllustration: Rebecca Zisser/HuffPost Sex workers are facing concerns about their health and their bills amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSex workers in Seattle are worried about their health and their income in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, HuffPost U.S. reports.

Those who don't settle down early on are often made to feel they have become too old to be desirable as a wife. At the same time, women may be encouraged to put educational and career ambitions on hold to first secure a husband — only to feel later that they have passed the optimal time for those pursuits. Today, women are learning how to navigate the anxiety created by these expectations.\n\nICYMI

Yuri Gripas / Reuters Allison Jones Rushing is about to become a U.S. circuit judge at the age of 36. She could be around for decades after President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are gone.\n\nWASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans voted Monday night to advance the nomination of Allison Jones Rushing, yet another of President Donald Trump's judicial nominees who is troubling for a number of reasons.\n\nRushing worked for Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian organization that has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. She has argued that there were moral and practical reasons for banning same-sex marriage.\n\nBut it's her age that may be most notable: She is 36. If she gets confirmed this week, as expected, she will be the youngest federal judge in the country. She has practiced law for only nine years, and her career has focused on defending corporations. She has tried just four cases to verdict or judgment.\n\nLong after this week's Senate vote, after Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are gone, after the 2020 presidential election that the media is so focused on right now, Rushing will be on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit interpreting statutes and making consequential decisions that affect millions of Americans.\n\nWith little fanfare, Republicans advanced her nomination Monday on a party-line vote of 52-43. Her final confirmation vote is expected Tuesday.\n\nRushing, who is a partner at the D.C.-based law firm Williams & Connolly, is not the only exceptionally young judicial nominee getting a Senate vote this week. McConnell has teed up votes for U.S. circuit court nominees Eric Murphy and Chad Readler, who are 39 and 46, respectively.\n\nAll three have the ideological bent that Trump is looking for in his court picks. Murphy, the solicitor general of Ohio, has fought to make it easier to disenfranchise voters, argued against marriage equality in the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case before the Supreme Court and argued against reproductive rights. Readler, who is Trump's acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division, filed a brief in favor of striking down the Affordable Care Act, defended efforts to weaken voting rights and defended Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military.\n\nAll three are members of the conservative Federalist Society, which has been driving Trump's judicial selection process and funneling anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ nominees to the White House.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Eric Murphy is 39, has argued against marriage equality and abortion rights and is about to become a lifetime U.S. circuit court judge. What could go wrong?\n\nTo some observers, the age of these nominees is part of a bigger problem of Republicans not taking the review process seriously and blowing through Senate customs to confirm as many of Trump's circuit court nominees as possible. Circuit courts are often the last word in federal court cases. The Supreme Court hears only about 100 to 150 appeals of the more than 7,000 cases that come before the nation's 13 circuit courts each year.\n\n[This week's nominees] may lack life experience and will be serving many years after Trump … enjoying life tenure on the 'Supreme Courts' for their regions because the Supreme Court hears so few cases, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and an expert in judicial nominations. Many are also being confirmed on extremely close votes and some on party-line votes with insufficiently rigorous vetting.\n\nRushing didn't even have a real confirmation hearing. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman at the time, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), scheduled her hearing last fall when the Senate was out of session and few senators were in town. Not a single Democrat could attend. Just two Republicans attended, and neither asked tough questions.\n\nMcConnell has made judicial confirmations a top priority and has already helped Trump dramatically reshape the federal courts. To date, Trump has gotten 31 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices confirmed. That's so many circuit judges ― more than any other president confirmed by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts is filled by a judge nominated by Trump.\n\nFor some context: President Barack Obama confirmed 55 circuit court judges in eight years. Trump is only two years in and more than halfway there.\n\nThere's not much Democrats can do about any of this, beyond winning control of the Senate in 2020. The minority typically has some tools for affecting judicial confirmations; it is a Senate custom, for example, to wait for both senators representing a nominee's home state to turn in so-called blue slips before that nominee can move forward. But Republicans have been bypassing the blue slip rule in their effort to fill up courts with Trump's nominees.\n\nThe GOP majority has eviscerated nearly all Senate rules and customs, such as consultation and blue slips, that protect the minority party's prerogatives in the nomination and confirmation processes, said Tobias.\n\nNot healthy for the judiciary or the nation, he added.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of the story incorrectly gave Murphy's age as 40 and Rushing's as 37.
By Joanne Sydney Lessner, ZEALnyc Contributing Writer, January 23, 2017\n\nWith eighty concerts a year, a roster of impressive guest artists, a summer residency at Caramoor, and a sparkling new home at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music, the Orchestra of St. Luke's has come a long way since its founding in 1974 as the resident chamber ensemble of The Church of St. Luke in the Fields in Greenwich Village. This season also marks the 30th anniversary of its annual subscription series at Carnegie Hall. To bring the festivities full circle, the twenty-one-member St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, still the nucleus of the larger Orchestra of St. Luke's, returns to its namesake church for the first time since 1997, with a two-program Baroque Series that includes additional performances at the Brooklyn Museum, a longtime partner.\n\nWe wanted to present our musicians in their core repertoire, in the place where the orchestra was born. Also, the acoustics are unrivaled, says Executive Director James Roe. We're excited to reintroduce ourselves to the community of Greenwich Village, who first recognized and loved us. Because of their nurturing four decades ago, the orchestra went on to be noticed. For the players, it will feel like coming home.\n\nThe two programs are designed to delight first-time concertgoers as well as aficionados. Bach and Vivaldi (January 29-30, 2017) showcases soprano Anna Dennis in Bach's Weichet nur, betrübte Schatten, BWV 202, aka the Wedding Cantata, and the less well-known Vivaldi motet O qui coeli terraeque serenitas. Principal flutist Liz Mann provides the virtuoso fireworks in Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 2, and Vivaldi's La Folia Variations round out the program. Regarding the juxtaposition of the latter with the Wedding Cantata, Roe says, We wanted to open up that dialogue of connection between marriage and folly, but we'll leave it up to the audience to decide privately if there's a direct progression.\n\nBritish soprano and celebrated Baroque interpreter, Anna Dennis, guest soloist.\n\nBach and Telemann's Coffeehouse (April 2-3, 2017) conjures both a historical moment, when Baroque was still brand new, and a specific venue, the celebrated Café Zimmermann in Leipzig, where Georg Telemann founded his Collegium Musicum before passing its stewardship to Bach. Composers sought out Gottfried Zimmermann's coffee house for its inviting atmosphere and first-rate musicians. Bach premiered many of his secular cantatas there, including his famous Coffee Cantata, a satirical jab at the audience, who were spared a cover charge, but were required to buy coffee. Women, normally verboten in a coffee house, were granted dispensation to attend the concerts. Another draw was the host's extensive collection of the most up-to-date musical instruments, which he made available to the players.\n\nAs Roe points out, Pre-electricity, musical instruments were the equivalent of high tech. Woodwinds and keyboards in particular were advancing year by year. Zimmermann's collection allowed composers to push the limits of music as far as they could.\n\nCelebrating this virtuosity, the St. Luke's program includes Telemann's Sonata à 4 in A Major and Gigue for Solo Violin, featuring concertmaster Krista Bennion Feeney, as well as Bach's Sonata in G Minor, BWV 1029, and W.F. Bach's Overture in G Minor.\n\nIndividual tickets are $40 and a two-concert subscription is $68 are available.

Less than a year after same-sex marriages were legalized in Bermuda, the governor of the British island territory signed a bill into law on Wednesday that replaced it with domestic partnerships.\n\nAccording to the local news site Bernews, Gov. John Rankin said the new law grants same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples. However, the law permits same-sex couples to enter into domestic partnerships only ― not legal marriages.\n\nThe Bermuda government will continue to recognize same-sex couples who wed before the law was reversed as married couples.\n\nIn a tweet, Chris Bryant, an openly gay member of Parliament, said that Bermuda's decision to ban same-sex marriages totally undermines the [United Kingdom's] effort to advance LGBT rights. Critics and human rights advocates also called the rare move a direct attack on LGTBQ rights:\n\nBermuda has officially repealed marriage equality for same-sex couples. Don't think it can't happen elsewhere - https://t.co/oSXfmaEDj8 — Zack Ford (@ZackFord) February 7, 2018\n\nTy Cobb, director of Human Rights Campaign Global, said in a statement that Rankin and the Bermuda Parliament have shamefully made Bermuda the first national territory in the world to repeal marriage equality.\n\nThis decision strips loving same-sex couples of the right to marry and jeopardizes Bermuda's international reputation and economy, Cobb said.\n\nSame-sex marriage was first legalized in Bermuda in May 2017 after the nation's Supreme Court ruled in favor of a gay couple who sued for equal marriage rights. Winston Godwin, a Bermudian, and Greg DeRoche, a Canadian, filed the lawsuit after their marriage application was declined by Bermuda's Registrar-General, Bernews reported.\n\nAfter the ruling was handed down, conservative leaders argued that it did not reflect the majority interests of the people in Bermuda, per The New York Times.\n\nIn December, Bermuda's Senate and House of Assembly passed legislation designed to reverse the Supreme Court ruling. It passed by wide margins.\n\nGodwin and DeRoche told Bernews on Wednesday that they were deeply saddened that the governor signed the bill into law.\n\nIt's a sad day for Bermuda, it's a sad day for human rights, the couple said.\n\nWalton Brown, Bermuda's minister of home affairs, said the new domestic partnership law was intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female.\n\nProminent LGBTQ rights activists, including GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis and screenwriter Peter Paige, are encouraging people to boycott the Atlantic island using the hashtag #BoycottBermuda.\n\nWelp, guess I'm not going to Bermuda anytime soon, now that they REPEALED same-sex marriage. #BoycottBermuda — Peter Paige (@ThePeterPaige) February 8, 2018\n\nLET'S GET IT TRENDING, PEOPLE!

On a crisp Saturday night in September, a private party celebrating the Hustlers premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival could be marked by two halves: Before Jennifer Lopez and After Jennifer Lopez. BJL spanned 11:30 p.m. to approximately 1 a.m. People were evenly dispersed throughout the bar, enjoying a routine soirée. A place card brandishing Lopez's name sat on an unoccupied table. It was starting to seem like she might not show when murmurs rippled across the room. She's here! AJL had begun.\n\nAs if lured by a magnetic cult leader — or a Hollywood megastar, same difference — partygoers drifted toward Lopez's pulpit, dazed, wanting a glimpse. They could only get so close. Her area had since been roped off. Bodyguards stood at either end to stare down potential interlopers. Other cast members orbited around the venue, but Lopez was the center of gravity.\n\nIn the ensuing weeks, the cosmos saw just how massive Jennifer Lopez's pull could be. Riding a wave of effusive reviews, Hustlers became the highest-grossing live-action film in her 33-year acting tenure, testifying to Lopez's fortitude as a multihyphenate pop phenom. She was dubbed an immediate Oscar contender.\n\nIn the end, though, Hustlers also underscored how much Hollywood has slighted Lopez. That buzz wasn't enough to land her the nomination, a fact that is surely rooted in how the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — and our culture at large — views women. Someone as famous as Lopez isn't serious enough to join such lofty ranks, especially when she's playing a thieving stripper.\n\nOscar omission aside, the success of Hustlers raises a valuable question: Why hasn't Lopez gotten roles this dynamic all along?\n\nHer finest acting comes when she's exuding control, and when she can use that control to mask a character's vulnerability. Think of the Out of Sight scene when Lopez's slick federal marshal has to shoot the criminal (George Clooney) she loves. Or the moment in Selena when she mocks the media's scrutiny by bragging that her diet consists of pepperoni pizza and Doritos. Like Hustlers, those movies understand that Lopez's charisma stems from her ability to win anyone over.\n\nSTX Films Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu in Hustlers.\n\nMost movies don't grasp this. They turn her into an underdog who comes out on top simply because, well, she's Jennifer Lopez. Over the years, she's struggled to find romance (The Wedding Planner and The Back-Up Plan), fled abusive lovers (Enough and The Boy Next Door), cleaned up after wealthy clients (Maid in Manhattan and Second Act) and ingratiated herself to contemptuous relatives (Angel Eyes and Monster-in-Law). Lopez is good in these movies. A primo self-marketer, she makes herself accessible to the audience in a way that transcends her rarefied glamour. Unfortunately, these movies aren't always good to her.\n\nI've wondered for years when Lopez would land another Out of Sight. She can convincingly portray working-class strivers — many pop idols can't — but I suspect that Lopez has hardly demonstrated her full range on-screen. Broader career machinations — her celebrity, in other words — acted as an impediment; having collected $12 million for one of the biggest bombs in cinema history (2003's Gigli) has its consequences. After seven nominations from the tacky Razzie Awards, the industry seemed to deem her unworthy of highbrow fare.\n\nWanting to know how Lopez is perceived in Hollywood and why Hustlers feels like a restitution of sorts, I called up a number of producers, directors and casting agents who have worked with her. What emerged was a classic tale: an it girl steadily reduced by gossip, setbacks and misconceptions. She lost that status and fought to regain it. Resilience was — is — her strength.\n\nIn five vignettes, this is the story of what predated that party in Toronto and how the artist forever known as J.Lo made invincibility her brand.\n\n***\n\nTalk to a few folks with a hand in Jennifer Lopez's ascendancy, and you'll hear the same thing: Everyone knew she'd be a star. That's easy to say in retrospect, a convenient pat on the back for showbiz veterans who love to be in the know. But the anecdotes about a young Lopez brightening room after room sound similar enough to be believed.\n\nAt 16, she was Jenny Lopez, as Pat Golden, who cast Lopez's first movie, My Little Girl (1987), recalled while leafing through old audition notes scribbled with descriptions such as very pretty, talented and lots of potential. A few years after Girl, when Lopez was a dancer on the early-'90s variety series In Living Color, casting director Linda Phillips-Palo received a call from a former colleague who had just hired Lopez for a part in the heist thriller Money Train (1995) and insisted she consider the actress.\n\nWe met Jennifer, and she was just fantastic, Phillips-Palo said. She had it written all over her face. This woman was not going to fail. ... I was around Tom Cruise and a lot of those people when they were getting their first jobs. You'd know that there was nothing else that guy could ever do but be a movie star. And it was like that with Jennifer.\n\nColumbia Pictures via Getty Images Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube in Anaconda.\n\nPhillips-Palo quickly slotted Lopez opposite Robin Williams in Francis Ford Coppola's fish-out-of-water dramedy Jack (1996). The film did lukewarm business, but along with the immigrant drama My Family (1995), for which Lopez received an Independent Spirit Award nomination, it established her screen presence as that of a compassionate everywoman.\n\nTeddy Zee, then an executive at Columbia Pictures, saw the same quality that Phillips-Palo did when Lopez's manager, Eric Gold, encouraged him to pay attention to Lopez while visiting the In Living Color set. Zee was so committed to Lopez's potential that he let her pick between two hot scripts before she was even a household name. Fools Rush In — a traditional romantic comedy released amid the glory days of Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan — had already booked the Friends-anointed Matthew Perry as its leading man. Zee was convinced Lopez would favor Fools over her alternative, the creature feature Anaconda.\n\nI was shocked she chose 'Anaconda,' Zee said. At the time, I thought it was a strange choice. But she was very strong in knowing what she wanted and why she wanted it. … I think she just saw it as an opportunity to market herself.\n\nLopez shot Anaconda and Selena back to back, with Anaconda hitting theaters less than a month after the 1997 biopic about the late singer Selena Quintanilla-Pérez. Lopez secured Selena — and her first $1 million salary — via what was said to be the largest casting search since Scarlett O'Hara. The filmmakers auditioned thousands of upstarts at a time when there were no age-appropriate Latina actresses with name value, according to producer Moctesuma Esparza. When the movie debuted at No. 2 and drew rapturous reviews for Lopez, it validated what our instincts were about her, Zee said. Anaconda suddenly had a lot more weight, especially among underserved audiences of color.\n\nUniversal Pictures via Getty Images Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney in Out of Sight.\n\nWith the one-two punch of Selena and Anaconda, and the Golden Globe nod that accompanied the former, Lopez went from hopeful to headliner. But it was Out of Sight (1998) that certified her movie-star bona fides. Steven Soderbergh first tested Sandra Bullock for the role, but when Bullock and George Clooney's chemistry didn't click, Soderbergh told the studio he wouldn't direct the movie if he couldn't hire Lopez. The character needed to seem intrepid and sultry but not impervious; she had to fall in love with Clooney and precipitate his downfall.\n\nLopez had everything going on, Soderbergh said. That everything included the $5 million paycheck she negotiated against Clooney's $10 million. (Her rationale: Who's going to break their ass to promote this movie while George is on 'ER'?)\n\nShe was smart, she was sexy, she was funny, she was physical, Soderbergh recalled. Working with her as a director, if I were to give her a note, she had a dancer's pride in being able to do your note exactly the way you described it immediately. … I certainly felt like we were catching her at the perfect time. She was clearly on a trajectory, and I felt, 'We're gonna get a lot of props for delivering her at a moment where she's blowing up. Let's be smart, let's be early adopters.'\n\nWith Out of Sight, Lopez made the covers of Entertainment Weekly and Details. In the magazine Movieline, she lambasted Winona Ryder, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz, Madonna and Claire Danes for their acting skills. After a decade of surging fame, Lopez was everywhere. She signed a record deal with Sony and began a highly publicized relationship with hip-hop mogul Sean Puff Daddy Combs, two moves that made her one of the globe's most watched celebrities. But once an actor becomes a tabloid fixation, the calculus of her career shifts.\n\n***\n\nAs the new millennium dawned, Lopez's clout soared. Her name alone was enough to get the experimental psycho-thriller The Cell (2000) an instant green light, director Tarsem Singh said. When she joined the rom-com vogue by signing on to The Wedding Planner (2001), the movie's $10 million budget shot to $30 million, partly to accommodate her $7 million paycheck, which was equal to that of co-star Matthew McConaughey, according to producer Jennifer Gibgot. Meanwhile, Lopez and Combs were central figures in the tabloid-magazine boom times. Following their 2001 split, Lopez was riding high: She was the first person to have a No. 1 movie (The Wedding Planner) and No. 1 album (J.Lo, her second) simultaneously.\n\nLopez fielded question after question from the press about her supposed diva demands — America's way of telling a famous woman she's made it. (She's not high-maintenance, producer Kelliann Ladd contested when I spoke to her.) The single Jenny From the Block acted as a rebuttal, attempting to marry her down-home Bronx upbringing with her newfound wealth. But if you have to inform people you're humble, they might not take your word for it.\n\nArchive Photos via Getty Images Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez in The Wedding Planner.\n\nCome 2002, after the internet-defining Versace dress and a short-lived marriage to backup dancer Cris Judd, Lopez's movie career tried to take the Julia Roberts route. Maid in Manhattan looked a lot like Pretty Woman, and Enough was a cousin of Sleeping With the Enemy. Both were modest box-office hits. Then Gigli happened.\n\nLopez can blame Halle Berry, who was originally cast but dropped out to do X-Men 2. In theory, the appeal of Gigli is evident. It was a major-movie-star vehicle at a time when major movie stars were Hollywood's meal tickets. Ben Affleck was still surfing his post-Good Will Hunting crest, and director Martin Brest had a track record for fruitful comedies (Beverly Hills Cop, Midnight Run). The film netted Lopez an A-list-worthy $12 million. By early-2000s standards, it became an event before the cameras even rolled, so much so that Lopez's renown further eclipsed her esteem. Coupling up with Affleck during production created a media spectacle, and Bennifer became the nickname that inspired a thousand starry portmanteaus.\n\nHeading into Gigli, Lopez had more than enough commercial fortune. But she needed to get critics back on her side. That's where An Unfinished Life comes in. On paper, the midbudget drama had ample Oscar-bait hallmarks, including the backing of now-disgraced Miramax honcho Harvey Weinstein and a stripped-down role that seemed ideal for an actress asking to be taken seriously.\n\nAlamy Stock Photo Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in Gigli.\n\nLadd, who was producing Life, couldn't have anticipated what a calamity Gigli would be when she and prestigious auteur Robert Altman (Nashville) were debating whether to heed Weinstein, who urged them to cast Lopez. Altman instead courted Naomi Watts (opposite Paul Newman as a brusque Wyoming rancher who lends his battered daughter-in-law refuge). When Weinstein later replaced Altman with Swedish director Lasse Hallström (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), in turn losing the initial actors, he again advocated for Lopez. By then, Gigli was in the can but wouldn't hit theaters for another year. Hallström was open to the idea right away, but Newman's replacement, Robert Redford, wasn't quite as keen, Ladd said. Ever the dark horse, Lopez was willing to convince anyone who needed convincing.\n\nShe was self-aware enough to say, 'No, I can tone down the J.Lo look,' Ladd recalled. 'I can be the girl who grew up in Wyoming.' And then she even did a makeup test, probably of her own volition: 'Look, see, I can do it.' She took it seriously.\n\nBut Gigli opened two months after An Unfinished Life completed production, ensuring that no one else would take either seriously. Brest, the Gigli maestro, had clashed with Sony executives over the ending, meant to be more crime caper and less romantic comedy. Lopez and Affleck were called back for reshoots, and what resulted was a cheaply written, inelegantly designed disaster.\n\nAlamy Stock Photo Jennifer Lopez in An Unfinished Life.\n\nGigli is a Jennifer Lopez movie as much as it's a movie about the idea of Jennifer Lopez. Arriving 15 minutes in, she whips around to introduce her glammed face in close-up — the kind of entrance only a dazzling dignitary can make. Lopez has the swagger to play a gangster type, but Gigli channels it through scenes as overcooked as the sensual vagina monologue that she spouts while doing yoga. Still, she runs circles around Affleck, always sure how long to pause before nailing a punchy line or when to arch her back to elicit a laugh. Together, they are so devoid of chemistry that one has to wonder what their actual relationship looked like behind closed doors.\n\nGigli tarnished Lopez's movie image, underscoring how long it had been since she'd made something as exemplary as Out of Sight. Grossing a mortifying $7.3 million on a $76 million budget, it was one of the biggest bombs in history. She and Affleck called off their wedding with four days' notice and broke up four months later.\n\nI was eviscerated, Lopez said in 2017. I lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\n\nOn the heels of Gigli, the Miramax team handling publicity for the single-father comedy Jersey Girl (2004) — also starring Affleck — began quietly highlighting that Lopez's character dies in the movie's first 15 minutes, as if to assure audiences they wouldn't endure much of her. As is often the case with celebrity scandals, the woman's reputation suffered more than the man's.\n\n***\n\nNo one I spoke to captured Lopez's vicissitude better than Leon Ichaso, who directed her in El Cantante, the 2007 biopic about Puerto Rican salsa star Héctor Lavoe.\n\nAccording to Ichaso, Marc Anthony brought El Cantante to him in 2003 as a potential collaboration with Lopez, who was looking to tap into her own Puerto Rican roots. (She would play Nilda Georgina Puchi Román, Lavoe's wife.) Ichaso went to Lopez's Los Angeles home to pitch his vision. What he got in return was a snapshot of her celebrity. The first meeting was really weird, Ichaso said.\n\nHe showed up with a VHS copy of the 1972 documentary Our Latin Thing cued up to a scene chronicling a rowdy Manhattan block party. Ichaso started waxing about his vision when a testy Lopez interrupted him. Leon, you're too interested in history, she said, according to Ichaso. This movie is not about history. Convinced she'd change her tune after seeing the scene, he asked to play the VHS. Only one problem: No one knew how to work the VCR. Not Ichaso, not Lopez, not her manager, Benny Medina, whom she would fire that year and later rehire. Lopez had to march upstairs and wake Affleck, who traipsed down in sweatpants to solve the problem with his signature groggy enthusiasm. After watching the scene, Jennifer turned to me and said, 'That's my movie,' Ichaso recounted.\n\nSlowly but surely, El Cantante got off the ground with a small budget that afforded Lopez a fraction of the sums she'd earned for The Wedding Planner and Gigli. By the time Ichaso went to meet with her again a few months later, she'd broken up with Affleck and begun dating her future co-star.\n\nAlamy Stock Photo Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony in El Cantante.\n\nJennifer was sitting on Marc's lap, which is funny because Marc doesn't have such strong legs, Ichaso said. They were a couple, and they were sharing French fries. They both seemed so, so relaxed.\n\nAnthony and Lopez's new relationship fueled the production. Both had entourages that, according to Ichaso, constituted 24/7 frenzy. They thrived on chaos; Ichaso compared their relationship, which ended in 2011, to Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Marc is the love of her life, with his cigarettes and craziness and drinking and whatever, he said, acknowledging that Lopez seems content with current fiancé Alex Rodriguez. She loves him. She would say to me, 'I couldn't sleep with him last night because of his cigarettes. I locked the bedroom.' They were like kids. They were just, at that time, so happy.\n\nThat energy complemented the tone of the film, and like everyone who has worked with her, Ichaso praised Lopez's commitment. She even smoked cigarettes for a brief period to prepare, despite being the healthiest person in the world, he said.\n\nReviews for El Cantante were tepid, but the film at least succeeded in not positioning Lopez as an underdog. It was the first movie she produced, and it shows: Puchi has tenacity, agency, brass. The theatrical rollout, on the other hand, didn't. The distributors marketed Cantante with an urban vibe accenting the characters' druggy proclivities, and Ichaso felt the PR exploited Latin clichés that didn't represent the film. Plus, by the time it opened in August 2007, almost a full year after premiering at the Toronto Film Festival, the world still hadn't forgiven Lopez for Gigli.\n\nIt was at a time where people didn't like Jennifer very much after she broke up with Ben, Ichaso said. They just didn't take her seriously, and maybe that's what bothered her the most. At the time, there weren't many Jennifer Lopez films that were memorable, so this one just got destroyed.\n\n***\n\nOnce a celebrity union stokes the tabloid fire, the couple involved is targeted for life. Lopez got it especially bad because she dated so many high-profile men. Eventually, photographers were invading movie sets to capture mundane footage to sell to People and Us Weekly.\n\nThe Monster-in-Law (2005) producers knew to anticipate such hysteria, but they didn't know how intense it would get. To combat paparazzi who stalked the production through Los Angeles, the crew had to erect makeshift walls and station assistants with umbrellas blocking the action, according to producer Chris Bender. Nevertheless, photographers scaled roofs and camped out in the Malibu cliffs to snap long-lens shots. Bender, who had collaborated with the likes of Ashton Kutcher and Rachel McAdams, had never experienced anything as manic as the Lopez surveillance.\n\nThere's an upside, though. At the time, that was considered a plus because your movie was getting publicity in advance of the eventual release, he said. That was sort of the pre-Instagram way of taking advantage of celebrity to create awareness for your movie.\n\nAlamy Stock Photo Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez in Monster-in-Law.\n\nAround the same time, the Hollywood trades were littered with the corpses of failed J.Lo projects. Any actor's career is a combination of talent, timing, wise decision-making and sheer luck, and Lopez's missed opportunities tell us a lot about the career she hoped to design. She was considered for Kate Beckinsale's role in Serendipity, according to producer Simon Fields. She developed a modern take on the opera Carmen, an adaptation of the Latina friendship novel Dirty Girls Club and a movie about a psychiatrist who treats superheroes. None of those manifested; one even resulted in a lawsuit. Lopez turned down Unfaithful, which netted Diane Lane an Oscar nod. She lost at least two gigs to Angelina Jolie: First, Paramount thought of her for 2003's Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and secondly, she reportedly exited a prestigious Frida Kahlo biopic to pursue the lead in 2004's Taking Lives. (That role will be the most challenging thing I'm sure I'll ever do, Lopez had said of Kahlo.) She was also supposed to make a big-band musical with Nicole Kidman and a live-action Carmen Sandiego.\n\nShe joined the 2005 rom-com Hitch, after which producers used her name to bait Will Smith for the lead, according to Zee, who said Columbia executives sought an actress of color because they were apprehensive about marketing a courtship between a Black man and a white woman. (Lopez eventually dropped out due to scheduling issues. Eva Mendes took her spot.)\n\nCBS Photo Archive via Getty Images Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'Loughlin in The Back-up Plan.\n\nAfter Monster-in-Law, An Unfinished Life and the 2007 album Brave, which was her first album that didn't debut in the Top 10, Lopez hit a nadir with critics and audiences alike. She took a few years off, giving birth to twins in 2008. By the time she returned with the formulaic romantic comedies The Back-Up Plan (2010) and What to Expect When You're Expecting (2012), the comic-book craze had engulfed Hollywood. The types of adult movies she'd made in the prior two decades — particularly rom-coms — were passé. If no one took her seriously then, certainly no one would do so now.\n\nThe truth of the matter, really, is she has not been considered for a bunch of years a major actress, one Oscar-nominated producer said. She's been considered a major success and a major celebrity, and she has loads of goodwill because she's one of the nicest human beings on Earth. It has probably made it a tad harder on the acting front because of her celebrity status. She might have gotten other roles had she not become such a pop celeb icon.\n\n***\n\nLopez clearly sensed that The Back-Up Plan wouldn't be enough to restore her early-2000s glory. Wanting double the buzz, she timed her next album, Love?, to coincide with the movie's release. But Lopez parted with her record label in what may or may not have been an amicable split after the intended lead single, Louboutins, bombed. With a new wave of pop stars taking over (Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé) and a drastically changing Hollywood business model, Lopez had to rehabilitate her brand.\n\nFirst, Lopez agreed to judge American Idol alongside Randy Jackson and fellow newcomer Steven Tyler. She negotiated a reported $12 million for her first season and $20 million for her second, fees that upped the ante for all superstars appearing on reality-competition shows. Idol ratings were dwindling, and while her presence did little to restore its earlier cachet, it did place her in living rooms across Middle America at a crucial time. She put her name on perfumes, hair-care products, home goods and a Kohl's clothing line. With the much-needed success of the 2011 dance banger On the Floor and her post-Back-Up Plan movie choices, Lopez leaned into her Jenny From the Block persona, opting for digestible, populist vehicles that wouldn't strain credulity.\n\nUniversal Pictures Ryan Guzman and Jennifer Lopez in The Boy Next Door.\n\nIn the screwball thriller Parker (2013), Lopez brought comedic relief and demonstrated the texture of her charisma. (This may be Lopez's most appealing screen performance since she traded barbs with George Clooney in Steven Soderbergh's 'Out of Sight,' The Hollywood Reporter raved.) She delivered a committed, delightful performance in the schlocky The Boy Next Door (2015), which targeted Latinx audiences by hiring Step Up breakout Ryan Guzman, a process she was deeply involved with, according to casting director Nancy Nayor. For the crime twister Lila & Eve (2015), co-starring Viola Davis, she secured a part that once had director Charles Stone III eyeing Charlize Theron, Cate Blanchett, Julianne Moore and Robin Wright.\n\nNo single project illustrates the return to her Jenny From the Block ethos better than Shades of Blue. When creator Adi Hasak was first developing the TV series in 2013, Lopez's longtime producing partner Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas suggested her for the top role, an FBI informant with a troubled past. Hasak was sure Lopez would say no. But movie vets seeking nonfranchise material had begun drifting to television. A week later, Lopez told him she wanted to produce and star in the series, likening it to NYPD Blue and Homicide: Life on the Street. In a way, she anticipated the rise of the late-2010s female antihero. Furthermore, she wanted to pitch it to a broadcast outfit, which would have been expected to enlist Julianna Margulies or another TV-centric actor, rather than a premium network.\n\nABC passed, but superproducer Ryan Seacrest, whom Lopez had befriended via American Idol, helped establish Shades of Blue at NBC.\n\nIt wasn't HBO, it wasn't Showtime, Hasak emphasized. There were other places that were, I would say, as worthy or worthier of Jennifer Lopez. She was fearless. She decided with our team that this was the place to go.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Ray Liotta and Jennifer Lopez on Shades of Blue.\n\nFifteen minutes after their pitch meeting with NBC honcho Robert Greenblatt, Blue was given a 13-episode green light, Hasak said, with Oscar winner Barry Levinson (Rain Man) helming the pilot.\n\nI'm still hoping to work with her on a musical someday, too, Greenblatt said by email, presumably referencing the scrapped Bye Bye Birdie production that Lopez was attached to. She's one of the most professional people I've ever worked with and I also think she's vastly underrated as an actor.\n\nLopez capitalized on Blue to, again, reach a wide audience that didn't necessarily subscribe to the narrative that Lopez isn't a viable actor.\n\nShe's a fucking real person, Hasak said. That bullshit of premier cable versus basic cable? She doesn't function in that universe. … She has the wherewithal of not doing the usual Hollywood bullshit and saying, 'I have to climb the highest mountain.'\n\nMere weeks after the first season wrapped, Lopez launched a lavish three-year Las Vegas residency. Across 2016, 2017 and 2018, she produced and judged the competition series World of Dance, resumed her status as one of the highest-paid celebrities, got engaged to Alex Rodriguez and starred in Second Act. In a roundabout way, that Working Girl-lite comedy, released in December 2018, was a perfect setup for Hustlers. Her character had to fight to demonstrate her business savvy, whereas Lopez had already done that. She was ready for the next challenge.\n\nSTX Films Lili Reinhart, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer and Constance Wu in Hustlers.\n\nA zippy drama about New York strippers who fleece their male clientele after falling on hard times, Hustlers harnesses Lopez's power without sacrificing her vulnerability. She makes an entrance even splashier than the one from Gigli, pole-dancing to Fiona Apple's Criminal. As Ramona, whom director Lorene Scafaria said would have cited J.Lo as her style inspiration, she commands the film. Like Lopez, Ramona constantly sells her personality in exchange for admiration. Also like Lopez, Ramona is resourceful and bewitching, which makes the performance a clever extension of the actor inhabiting it. It also exemplifies the world-weariness that undergirds her screen presence. The role that is so well-suited it acts as a sort of destiny fulfilled.\n\nThe J.Lo brand is peaking in a way it hasn't since roughly 2002, which includes co-headlining the Super Bowl halftime show with Shakira and shepherding a film about Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco. At a time when the entertainment establishment is reassessing how it treats women, Lopez's resurgence is a success story. Even without the Oscar nomination, the fact that her comeback coalesced at age 50 proves that Lopez's work ethic has made her invincible. Maybe the future Jennifer Lopezes of the world won't have to fight so hard not to be underestimated.\n\nSince Hustlers, Lopez has gotten scads of offers for reputable movies, according to Goldsmith-Thomas.\n\nI said to Jennifer the other day, 'Oh, my God, one year ago we would have begged to be in this conversation and now we're passing on this movie,' she said. We're incredibly aware that this is a club that we've wanted to be a part of. We take nothing for granted.\n\nIllustrations by Rebecca Zisser/HuffPost. Photos: Getty, STX Films.

In a relationship, showing your partner love and support through your actions obviously is hugely important. But expressing it in words is essential, too.\n\nThe strongest couples understand the role verbal communication plays in a relationship and how regularly exchanging words of encouragement, validation and empowerment can solidify their bond.\n\nWe asked marriage therapists to share the things the happiest couples say constantly to each other (other than I love you, of course) that keep their connection strong.\n\n1. I'm here for you.\n\nCouples who consistently remind each other that they have each other's backs are more capable of taking on whatever challenges life throws their way. Maybe one partner is grappling with a mental health issue. Maybe the other's dealing with a toxic friend, family member or coworker. Whatever the issue, knowing that you have the unconditional support of your partner and someone to rely on is invaluable.\n\nThis means that you are putting your partner's needs first, and that no matter what they tell you or what they need, you will step up and be present and supportive, psychologist Samantha Rodman told HuffPost. When partners are unsure of each other's willingness to be there for them, relationships can quickly erode.\n\n2. Can I help you with that?\n\nCarrying in the groceries, making the bed, navigating technology disasters, juggling too many things on your to-do list ― even if there's no help to be had, it feels good to know someone is there if you need them, marriage and family therapist Winifred M. Reilly said.\n\nThe happiest couples are independent people, but never forget that they are also teammates. If you sense your partner is overwhelmed, step in and ask if there's anything you can do to lighten their load.\n\nSometimes a partner isn't thinking about asking for help and when a partner offers, it can make a world of difference, psychologist and sex therapist Shannon Chavez said. It shows compassion and that you really care and are thinking about your partner's wellbeing.\n\n3. You look amazing.\n\nGetting regular reminders that your partner is still super attracted to you ― yep, even after all this time ― feels pretty great. You don't need to shower each other in mushy-gushy compliments all day long (unless you're into that!), but getting a little comment about how awesome you look in those pants can put some extra pep in your step.\n\nSuch compliments suggest that your partner sees you and notices your looks. You caught their attention, Chavez said.\n\n4. I have faith in you.\n\nWhen self-doubt creeps in, having someone in your corner who believes in you can provide a much-needed confidence boost. Whether you've just been promoted at work and feel overwhelmed by all the shots you have to call or you're struggling to stick to a healthy eating regimen, receiving words of affirmation from your partner can remind you that you're capable.\n\nYou can say this in other ways, like, 'I trust your judgment' or 'I know you'll make the right decision,' Rodman said. Either way, telling your partner that you have full confidence in their abilities to navigate their lives and important decisions makes them feel confident and secure in themselves.\n\n5. Thank you.\n\nCouples in the happiest relationships express their gratitude for one another often. They don't just wait for Valentine's Day or a birthday to acknowledge all their partner does; rather, they're in the habit of saying thank you for the everyday stuff all year round.\n\nLittle 'thank yous' every day can go even further than the most romantic poetry, marriage and family therapist Spencer Northey said. Some of my clients have initially thought it might seem mundane or redundant to say 'thank you' to their partner for things that are daily expectations in the relationship, such as taking out the trash, taking care of the kids, tidying up, and basic things like that. The reality is that this habit of acknowledging the little things you do for each other and the household maintains a sense of appreciation for each other.\n\nHappy couples tell each other what they need rather than expecting that their partner will or should just know. - Kurt Smith\n\n6. I'm sorry.\n\nCopping to mistakes and admitting that you were wrong requires swallowing your pride, which isn't always easy to do. But the ability to deliver a sincere apology to your partner can make the difference between a small disagreement and a long-standing conflict in the relationship.\n\nAcknowledging a mistake and the impact it had on your significant other keeps you connected and moving forward together, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who specializes in counseling men. Without this correction, hurt feelings can fester and build.\n\n7. Yes.\n\nYou can't always say yes to your partner — a healthy no is an important and wonderful thing. But happy couples adopt a yes mindset with each other wherever possible.\n\nObviously, you don't want to say yes to the weightier things in life ― like deciding whether to have kids ― just to be agreeable. But there's no harm in indulging your S.O. when it comes to the smaller stuff: what band to see in concert, what movie to watch, which restaurant to dine at, where to vacation, etc.\n\n'Yes' calls for flexibility and generosity, a willingness to sometimes go wholeheartedly with our second choice, Reilly said. Not in the mood for sushi? Not a big fan of Hugh Grant movies? A, 'yes' on these sorts of things won't kill you. In my experience, generosity begets generosity. And generosity feels good, both giving and receiving.\n\n8. I would like it if...\n\nYou can't expect your partner to read your mind, no matter how close the two of you are or how many years you've been together. Couples in healthy relationships are able to speak their minds and ask for what they want and need from their partner.\n\nDesires and expectations, unfortunately, too often go unspoken, Smith said. Happy couples tell each other what they need rather than expecting that their partner will or should just know. Resentment and anger develop when this isn't done.\n\nCouples therapist Kari Carroll emphasized the importance of communicating with your partner in a clear, direct way, even when it seems like you're being quite blunt.\n\nToo often we skirt around issues, thinking we are being clear but actually trying not to hurt their feelings, Carroll said. Being more straightforward — like asking, Can you do the dishes in the sink before I start dinner? instead of just complaining under your breath and hoping your partner takes a hint — helps everyone to be on the same page and avoid resentment and miscommunication, she added.\n\n9. I feel...\n\nRecognizing your own feelings and sharing them with your partner can help you process whatever you're going through and bring the two of you closer together. It may be easier to express positive emotions like joy, but it's important to open up about negatives ones, like frustration, sadness and shame, too.\n\nWhile this can be an uncomfortable step for many people, especially men, it's a necessary ingredient for relationship happiness, Smith said. A lot of partners withhold sharing negative feelings out of fear of hurting the other. Yet they can hurt them even more by not being honest.\n\n10. You're right.\n\nNorthey says using words that validate your partner's thoughts, feelings and experiences are like love glue.\n\nCertainly there are times when it is fun and helpful for us to be challenged by our partners to see another perspective, but that only works if there is a foundation of feeling seen, understood and affirmed, she said.\n\nThe happiest couples focus on their partner's positive qualities, instead of dwelling on their shortcomings.\n\nCouples who make a habit of turning toward each other by looking for ways in which their partners make sense, have good ideas and are doing the right thing are sure to see the best in each other and find the best in their relationship, Northey added.\n\n11. I'm working on myself.\n\nCouples who have a genuine desire to improve themselves often make the best partners in the long run. Why? Because they're willing to do some honest self-reflection and the hard work required to actually change their ways.
SuperStock via Getty Images Marriage check-ins are necessary, especially when you're married to the silent type.\n\nExperts say that communication is the cornerstone of a good relationship. That's why it can be deeply troubling when your partner is closed off and guarded.\n\nHow do you get them to open up? Below, marriage therapists share the advice they give clients married to uncommunicative spouses.\n\n1. Don't say we need to talk.\n\nNo sentence is more worrisome to hear in a relationship than we need to talk. If you set up a time to talk, your partner is liable to go on the defense and bottle up his or her emotions; Instead, pick a casual time to pursue the conversation, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who counsels men.\n\nI've counseled men who've been willing to open up over coffee at Starbucks on Friday mornings before work or while walking the dog together, he told The Huffington Post. Many couples with kids will say that they never have any alone time, but you can usually find it during the day-to-day activities of life if you think creatively.\n\n2. Don't broach the subject when you're both tired.\n\nDon't bring up something important when your wife just walks in the door or when your husband slips into bed after a long day with the kids, said Diane Spear, a therapist in New York City.\n\nYou don't want to be so focused on talking that you fail to consider if it's the right time or not, Spear said. You want your partner to feel considered and comfortable when you have big conversations.\n\n3. Explain why it's important to you.\n\nIf your partner is struggling to open up about something in particular, it might help to explain why you feel a conversation is necessary, said Debra Campbell, a psychologist and couple's therapist in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nTalk to your spouse about how it can deepen relationship intimacy when you discover more about what makes both of you tick and what's bothering you.\n\n4. Don't pounce.\n\nIf your spouse has seemingly checked out of your marriage, it makes sense that you might respond with a little anger. But if your aim is to have a constructive conversation, anger isn't going to do much good, said Aaron Anderson, a marriage and family therapist in Denver, Colorado.\n\nAnger provokes an instinctual fight-or-flight response in whoever you're talking to, he said. Your spouse will either fight back or shut down and neither one is good for communication.\n\nInstead, try to hold your temper and use a relaxed tone of voice.\n\nA little patience and kindness will go a lot further than anger in getting your spouse to open up, Anderson said.\n\n5. Open up first about your own vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability breeds more vulnerability, said Kari Carroll, a couples therapist in Portland, Oregon. If your spouse did something last week that triggered emotions from your past, open up about it.\n\nIf you talk about past hurts, your S.O will be more likely to understand the context of this pain for you because you have shared how you've felt pain from others, she said. When your partner sees you find safety in the relationship, they are more likely to do the same.\n\n6. Listen intently.\n\nWhen your spouse does want to talk about something that's bothering them, actively listen, said Amanda Deverich, a marriage and family therapist in Williamsburg, Virginia. That means not jumping in right away with reassuring comments like, Don't worry, it will be OK!\n\nThat shows concern but it's not actually listening, Deverich said. Usually, quiet partners have learned in life not to bother expressing their feelings because they've been overrode by others who engage at a louder level.\n\nThe next time your spouse has something to say, hold back and listen.\n\nTry just being quiet for about 15 seconds, maintain eye contact and a soft expression, she said. If they continue talking, you continue listening. Engage with just your most important sentences, not paragraphs.\n\n7. Ask open-ended questions.\n\nYou're not likely to get the answers you want with yes or no questions, said Elizabeth Earnshaw, a therapist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nQuestions like 'Are you sad?' don't leave a lot of room for communication and can feel invasive or forceful to a closed off partner, she said. Try asking 'What's going on?' or 'Tell me about your day' instead.\n\n8. Check in but don't be obnoxious about it.\n\nFrom here on out, make a point to check in with your spouse. The trick is to do it subtly, so your spouse doesn't feel forced to open up or talk, said Marie Land, a psychologist in Washington, D.C.

Nelson, 93, the new president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, greets family members after a press conference on Tuesday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has officially named Russell M. Nelson as its 17th president.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a news conference, Nelson characterized his selection as sacred and humbling.\n\nHe also paid tribute to his predecessor, Thomas Monson, who died at the age of 90 on Jan. 2. He had served as president since 2008.\n\nNo words can do justice to the magnitude and magnificence of his life, Nelson said.\n\nAt 93, Nelson is the second-oldest person in the 187-year-old church's history to become president.\n\nWatch a recording of the announcement below.\n\nNelson has been temporarily presiding over the church since his predecessor's death. He was ordained for his new position during a religious ceremony on Sunday.\n\nThe president of the Mormon church is believed to be a living prophet able to receive divine revelations from God. Succession is based strictly on seniority. Nelson was the longest-serving member of a church body known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which meant that he was next in line for the role of president. He became part of the Quorum in 1984.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Nelson announced that he had chosen two counselors to stand beside him in the First Presidency, the church's highest governing body. As First Counselor, he chose Dallin H. Oaks, who has long been part of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and is next in line to be president. As Second Counselor, Nelson chose Henry B. Eyring, who served in the First Presidency under Monson.\n\nGeorge Frey via Getty Images President Russell M. Nelson of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints with his wife, Wendy L. Watson Nelson.\n\nGiven the church's succession process, it's unlikely the arrival of a new president will mean changes in how it approaches topics that have caused it controversy in recent years, such as queer sexuality and women in leadership roles.\n\nThis became apparent when, after the presidency announcement, Nelson and his counselors fielded questions from reporters about the church's future and vision.\n\nOne reporter asked about outreach to queer Mormons, many of whom have said they feel ostracized by the church. In November 2015, the church adopted a policy that deemed same-sex couples apostates. It also prohibited children of these couples from getting blessed or baptized until they were 18 years old, at which point they need to disavow their parents' marriage in order to join the church.\n\nNelson said that while God loves all his children and wants them to have joy, there are certain challenges associated with following God's commandments ― challenges to be worthy to enter his holy presence.\n\nOaks was a bit more explicit in his response, suggesting that believers need to follow God's commandments in order to receive blessings.\n\nAs leaders of the church we have a responsibility to teach love and also to teach the commandments of God, Oaks said.\n\nGeorge Frey via Getty Images Russell M. Nelson (center), First Counselor Dallin H. Oaks (left), and Second Counselor Henry B. Eyring (right) answer press questions after Nelson was announced as the 17th president of the Mormon Church.\n\nJana Riess, a Mormon blogger, said that the subtext of both men's remarks seemed to be a reiteration of the Church's position that homosexual behavior is in violation of God's commandments, but that all people are loved.\n\nShe also suggested it's unlikely that the First Presidency's traditional responses to concerns about women's leadership and minority representation in the church will be satisfactory to Mormons with questions about these issues.\n\nThese will be issues to watch in the months going forward, as the new First Presidency defines its mission and eventual legacy, Riess wrote in a blog for Religion News Service.
This article is cross-posted on TheCommunity.com. Click here to add your name to a letter to the UN Secretary General and President of the General Assembly asking for children's rights to be prioritized in the UN's agenda this fall.\n\nThere is a common misperception that we live in a civilized world. At the core of our community are the values of progress and peace. It is, therefore, unfortunate that even though we have transcended galactic boundaries, we have failed to universally uphold these values.\n\nToday, one of the largest and most shameful crises faced by humanity is the issue of children's safety and development. Children in crisis are refused asylum. They are used to propagate violence. Around the world children are sold as inanimate objects for physical and sexual exploitation. And it is the children who suffer the worst outcomes of war.\n\nAll children deserve a life free of violence and fear, a life of hope and dreams. However, the previous century's hasty development agenda has neglected their needs. Today, we stand again on the brink of leaving behind an entire generation. To alter the circumstances, we need to build a strong foundation which prioritizes children and their protection.\n\nFor this reason, fellow Nobel Peace Laureates and world leaders gathered in a Children Summit in New Delhi, in early December last year, hosted by Kailash Satyarthi, the 2004 Nobel Laureate, and the President of India to strategize towards the goal of ensuring that no child is left behind in our policies, programs and promises.\n\nSatyarthi, his wife, daughter, son and in-laws and the rest of their extended family are all deeply involved in the noble pursuit of freeing children from slavery held by powerful economic groups. Braving threats and physical violence and over several decades they have saved over 100,000 children from slavery, sheltered, educated and prepared them for a life in freedom and dignity.\n\nThe New Delhi outcome document called the 'A Will for Children' underlined the moral responsibility of the laureates and leaders to raise their voices against the exploitation of children, support efforts and initiate more concrete and robust measures to safeguard children across the world.\n\nSome Nobel Laureates who attended the Summit in New Delhi were also present at the 16th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Bogotá, Colombia, earlier this month, as was I.\n\nThe direct outcome of our discussions and collective will, as reflected in the final declaration, was the recognition of children's issues as the key to building pathways to a lasting and sustainable peace. The Nobel laureates emphasized inclusion and financial prioritization of children's issues and the need for adequate laws and their effective implementation.\n\nThey reaffirmed the importance of youth voices in creating policies. In the post-world war era, the impetus has been on international coalitions and technological investments for a resilient and more peaceful world. But the gaps in our economic policies have proliferated child marriage, the number of children out of school, children in exploitative sexual and labor conditions and most of all, the disparity of opportunities between children of different ethnicities, regions and backgrounds.\n\nBesides being an acute moral dilemma, protection of children's rights is an urgent economic and development priority. International and regional governing bodies must ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.\n\nAlbeit a little late, the protection of the totality of children's rights is finally gaining momentum at the world stage. And, even more promising is the fact that it is slowly uniting the world.
Laura Dern has done it again, taking home her fifth career Golden Globe for her role as fiery lawyer Nora Fanshaw in Marriage Story.\n\nOn Sunday, Dern, 52, won the 2020 Golden Globe award for best supporting actress for her role in the Noah Baumbach film, which stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Dern's Fanshaw acts as the divorce lawyer for Johansson's Nicole, the straight shooter delivering powerful comebacks to Ray Liotta's Jay Marotta (the divorce lawyer to Driver's Charlie) all while wearing stilettos and plunging necklines.\n\nThe role is rumored to be based on Laura Wasser, a high-powered divorce attorney to the stars who practices in Los Angeles and whose client list includes Johansson herself, along with Kim Kardashian, Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp, and Britney Spears, according to Esquire.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Dern quipped that she was grateful to Baumbach for allowing her to pay tribute to divorce lawyers, saying such an honor was long, long overdue.\n\nIn 2019, Dern also starred in Greta Gerwig's Little Women reboot as Marmee, the beleaguered mother of four girls in Civil War-era New England. While that role didn't earn her a nomination at the Globes, her co-star Saoirse Ronan nabbed one for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.\n\nPreviously, Dern has been nominated for seven Golden Globes and took home four for roles in Afterburn, Recount, Enlightened and Big Little Lies.
By Miles Harter, ZEALnyc Contributing Writer, January 11, 2017\n\nTheater can be entertaining, but it can also educate us about unfamiliar history. Two recent critically-acclaimed theatrical releases tell the exquisite and absorbing stories of three brilliant African American women who were influential in the early NASA space program (Hidden Figures), while another portrays the brave couple whose challenging of an archaic Virginia state law led to the 1967 Supreme Court decision overturning the prohibition of interracial marriage (Loving).\n\nA similarly marvelous biopic, The Imitation Game, released in 2014, helped advance the unfamiliar legacy of Alan Turing, the English computer scientist and cryptanalyst who helped end World War II in cracking German intelligence codes. Turing also was instrumental in developing theoretical computer science and the Turing machine, an early computer. Turing also happened to be gay. Several years after the war, authorities charged and convicted him with gross indecency, and he was chemically castrated. A caption towards the end of The Imitation Game stated that Turing committed suicide at 41. Some criticized the film for inaccurately portraying certain historical events and Turing's own relationships, in particular, his association with a female character portrayed by Keira Knightley. Most significantly, historians debate the actual nature of Turing's death, and whether he indeed committed suicide.\n\nAlan Turing's life story is now being explored again on Thursday evening when both music and history buffs will be able to experience a new opera-in-development -- The Life and Death(s) of Alan Turing. The performance will be a concert reading of this new work by composer Justine F. Chen, and librettist David Simpatico under the auspices of the American Lyric Theatre, founded in 2005 by Lawrence Edelson to establish new operas through nurturing composers and librettists in the developmental process.\n\n\n\nComposer Justine F. Chen\n\n\n\nLibrettist David Simpatico\n\nParticipating in this presentation will be baritone Jonathan Michie as Alan Turing, soprano Keely Futterer, mezzo-soprano Elise Quagliata, tenors Andrew Bidlack and Javier Abreu, and bass-baritones Joseph Beutel and Thomas Shivone, with conductor Lidiya Yankovskaya. These artists, all of whom have performed extensively in the U.S. and internationally, will be joined by MasterVoices (formerly known as The Collegiate Chorale, founded 75 years ago by legendary conductor Robert Shaw), a New York City-based group which celebrates singing and musical storytelling.\n\nThe evening will also provide an inside look at adapting historical subject matter for the stage when afterwards Mr. Edelson, together with the composer Ms. Chen and librettist Mr. Simpatico, will discuss the process involved in the development of the opera. It should be fascinating to hear the creative forces behind this work describe the challenges associated with bringing Alan Turing's life and death to the operatic stage, as well as the obligation and/or responsibility of historical accuracy.\n\n\n\nDr. Alan Turing\n\nThe Life and Death(s) of Alan Turing, presented by American Lyric Theater in partnership with MasterVoices, at Kaufman Music Center / Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, on January 12, 2017 at 7:30pm.

It turns out those allegations haven't stopped Shannon from returning to reality TV.\n\nIf you're wondering what network is willing to welcome Shannon to its airwaves, that would be WEtv. After appearing on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars in 2015, Shannon is getting her own reality makeover show, Mama June: From Not to Hot. The seven-episode series will follow Mama June as she embarks on a quest of self-discovery that will redefine who she is as a woman, mother, lover and celebrity, according to the network's press release.\n\nThat translates to watching Shannon undergo extensive surgeries, hit the gym and try her hand at love once again, according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\nWEtv seems proud to be the network to bring Shannon to television once more.\n\nWe are pleased to show viewers a new side of Mama June as she transforms her body, and her life, while still maintaining her signature sense of humor, WEtv president, Marc Juris, told People in a statement. We are rooting for her as she goes on her amazing journey and we know the audience will too.
Editor's note: HuffPost has chosen to publish the following first-person account without naming the author. We do this only rarely and have done so here because of the potential risk to the author if her real name were used.\n\nThis was supposed to be the year I left an unhappy marriage of almost 20 years that came with psychological and emotional abuse. I still believe this will be my year of freedom since it's only April, but I've had to put my plans and dreams on hold while I wait out the stay-at-home order and all the nonessential institutions and services remain closed.\n\nTo the outside world, when I post on social media or buy groceries, which has become my only public outing now, I may seem to exude happiness. However, I am constantly nervous about what I or my children will do that could anger my husband. How can I keep him from yelling at me? What new list of demands will he issue? Will I find his orders tolerable or soul-crushing? Will he take offense at something and retaliate with more threats and restrictive rules for me and my children?\n\nAnyone familiar with living in the same household with an abuser while going through a divorce knows that arguments, intimidation and retaliation can be the fodder of daily life. But usually when this happened, the courts were open, most of the country wasn't under stay-at-home orders, a deadly pandemic wasn't killing people and we didn't have more than 16 million Americans unemployed in less than a month.\n\nFor those living in fear with their abusers, the coronavirus has compounded the time that they must spend together. It has magnified the stress levels in our homes and surely increased incidents of domestic violence. For many of us, the toxic spouse leaving for work provided needed relief from the barrage of intimidation, verbal battery and abuse. Now many of these significant others are either working from home or unemployed.\n\nThe very nature of this virus isolates people. If we show symptoms of the disease, we must quarantine ourselves from our families and from society itself for at least 14 days. To end up at a hospital can mean lingering and ultimately dying separated from loved ones because no one will be allowed into our rooms as we struggle for our last breath. For weeks we've learned concepts like social distancing, where now we must not intrude within 6 feet of one another's personal space. Steadily all of our in-person social groups and institutions have closed. Some connections have moved online, but this new norm of personal interaction and socialization by computer has left many people anxious, lonely and disconnected.\n\nFor many of us, the toxic spouse leaving for work provided needed relief from the barrage of intimidation, verbal battery and abuse. Now many of these significant others are either working from home or unemployed.\n\nSome have joked that this forced confinement will result in a baby boom in nine months. Most of the media focus has been on those affected medically or financially by this crisis. But the pandemic's upheaval is also exacerbating the pain of those living in homes where they have been mentally, emotionally and/or physically abused. And this often overlooked group needs help, too.\n\nI feel fortunate that over the past month several friends have reached out to check how I'm doing because they know the stress and hostility I experience with my husband. Having them to text, email and talk with during this period of isolation has been vital to my staying positive and hopeful.\n\nNow that we have more hours together in the same house, there are more opportunities for my husband to hurl criticisms at me. As the arguing intensified over the past month, several friends have urged me to move out as soon as possible. There were times I didn't feel safe as he hounded me with his lists of demands, threatened me about the divorce terms, screamed, name-called and incessantly ordered me to explain why something was put in the wrong place.\n\nI reached the decision to seek a divorce unexpectedly last year. Over the years, I had been conditioned to living with the constant fear of what he would be upset about next. Even the good times were never really pleasant because I always knew that he could suddenly turn and become infuriated with me about something. He exerted control sometimes by implementing consequences but mainly by issuing endless threats. Beyond my own fears, I could see that accepting this mistreatment was damaging my children's view of women as they watched their mom being denigrated by her husband.\n\nSo I got a lawyer, but I'm still stuck in place now.\n\nMy lawyer told me to make up with my husband, do my best to get along, wait until I could work for a few months at my new job, and hope that the courts reopen by July.\n\nBeing under a stay-at-home order when I don't feel safe at home is frightening. I recently called my lawyer to tell him that the threats and constant bullying were getting to be more than I could handle and I needed to make a plan to leave earlier than September. My lawyer told me to make up with my husband, do my best to get along, wait until I could work for a few months at my new job, and hope that the courts reopen by July. I understood his reasoning and resolved to do whatever I could once again to be agreeable and endure this time amicably. It appears this will be yet another life stage during which I have to tolerate my husband, my freedom be damned.\n\nI feel like if my resident state truly cared about my freedom, then its divorce law wouldn't require one of us to move out in order to file for a divorce. As long as I can't afford to move to a place that will house my three children, I can't file for a divorce. I looked into my options last summer and discovered that without an income above $160,000 or a letter from someone qualified to guarantee my rent, no landlord would lease to me in my children's school district.\n\nSo when we wonder why abused spouses stay in miserable situations, it's partly because our society still doesn't offer much support to those who are financially dependent on a spouse and have children but still wish to leave. I never felt the pain was bad enough to move to a shelter before, but now it feels like I'm forced to choose between continuing to endure psychological abuse or going to a place where I and my children might be exposed to a life-threatening virus.\n\nIn addition, I was going to start a new job at the beginning of April to earn some income, but that was delayed another month because of this virus. When you haven't supported yourself financially as an adult, starting anew as a single mother of three is intimidating.\n\nI never felt the pain was bad enough to move to a shelter before, but now it feels like I'm forced to choose between continuing to endure psychological abuse or going to a place where I and my children might be exposed to a life-threatening virus.\n\nI am an optimist by nature and have staggered through this marriage by focusing on whatever I could that was positive. Like any mother during this lockdown time, I do try each day to make sure that my children are able to engage in some fun activity like playing a board game, throwing a ball in the yard or baking.\n\nIn responding to external crises that I cannot control, I find comfort in the writings of Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. I hope everybody making the best of confinement and abusive situations might find solace in this quotation as well. He wrote, Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms ― to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\n\nThere are times in life when we have to reevaluate, grit our teeth and make the best of our circumstances. We can choose our response and our outlook. And if we know someone having a tough time right now, try to check in on them and remind them that they are not alone and that there is a future on the other side of this crisis.\n\nNeed help?

Just before I climbed back into the car, after dropping bags of groceries at my parents' door and firmly declining an offer to come inside for a cup of tea, my mom stepped outside to wave goodbye to me. My dad stayed behind the door watching us through its window. I grabbed my phone and asked her to pose for a snapshot to send my sister an update about our successful social distancing in the face of COVID-19.\n\nCourtesy of Louise Gleeson The author's mom, Doris, in front of her home earlier this week.\n\nNever one to shy away from a camera, my mom threw her head back and gave me a dazzling smile. It's always a surprise when people learn she's almost 70 — she's playful and vibrant, with the high cheekbones and beautiful skin often seen in Chinese women. I always say I hope to inherit her agelessness to join the dark eyes and olive skin she gave me. I drove away with tears in my eyes; my desire to keep my parents safe overwhelming me. I'm grateful they moved close to us years earlier, so I can take care of them now.\n\nThis is who I am protecting. I need you to protect her, too, I wrote when I shared the photo on my social media once I got home.\n\nHours later, I read a tweet from Donald Trump in which he called COVID-19 the Chinese Virus (the first of several times in recent days he's done that and a term he defended at his press briefing on Wednesday). My concern was no longer just about my mom's vulnerability to the coronavirus. Simmering worries I've had about our ethnicity became icy fear as I scrolled through the comments. Trump's language and the expected ripple effects feel very dangerous, even here in Canada, where statements from leaders south of the border have incited and inspired people to behave badly.\n\nThe United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 16, 2020\n\nIn the earliest days of the coronavirus, my mom underwent two-phase eye surgery at our local hospital. No extra precautions were taken when she went in for the first eye, but two weeks later when we returned for the second, screening signs were placed throughout the waiting area and news of the virus had overtaken the media. Headlines played in a loop on the television mounted to the wall above the rows of chairs filled with patients and their family members. The tension was palpable.\n\nWhen she coughed, I could feel the eyes upon us immediately. The furtive glances pushed me upright in my seat, ready to defend her if I had to. I was sitting right beside her, but even with her coloring in my features, my Irish father's genes made me separate. And in that moment, being white-passing felt like letting her down when she needed me most.\n\nMy mom knew she wasn't a threat — having not traveled since before the onset of the outbreak and knowing her intermittent cough is a side-effect of the blood pressure medication she takes — but for many people in that room she was. Because of her cough, but also because of her ethnicity.\n\nGrowing up in a small, predominately white town in the 1980s, my sister and I were targeted and taunted by peers, and I often felt embarrassed by our parent's interracial marriage. I had to be walked to kindergarten every day by our neighbor's son because a group of older kids had been throwing rocks at me while pretending to speak Chinese. I suffered the terror alone for days before finally telling my parents, because I didn't want them to feel at fault for what was happening to me.\n\nEven when we visited our cousins from my mom's side in a bigger city, we would face jeers while visiting playgrounds and swimming pools. I felt great empathy for them, knowing they faced racism more often and perhaps more viciously than we did, because our biracialism kept us safe a lot of the time.\n\nWhen our younger cousin came to visit us, a neighbor kid threw her to the ground, shoved snow into her face, and called her a Chink. Overcome with rage and protectiveness, my sister and I pulled him off and chased him to the door of his house, where we were met by his unimpressed parents. We went inside and confessed what we did to our father, worried that he'd find out about it eventually. He didn't waste a moment before announcing, You have to stand up to people like that your whole life.\n\nCourtesy of Louise Gleeson The author and her parents, Doris and Tom, when the family first arrived in Canada in 1974.\n\nSince moving from that town and growing older, my experiences with racism have been much more intermittent. Living in a culturally diverse community has helped me fully embrace my biracialism and allowed me to honor my culture and teach it to my own children. It has felt safe to be openly Chinese, and my children are proud of their heritage, too, sharing it with their peers and making presentations about it at school.\n\nBut I haven't forgotten the importance of teaching them about the racism we've experienced. I remind them they are fortunate, thus far, to know it only by way of our stories. They've listened to tales from my childhood and they know about my mother's traumas, too.\n\nIn 1969, she was a 19-year-old student who immigrated to England from Hong Kong, where she was born and raised, to attend a nursing college in a community hospital. She was young, alone, and had no more than a handful of English phrases. She was placed directly on to the hospital wards, where she learned by watching and listening. She had to navigate language and cultural gaps daily, and often heard racist insults from patients.\n\nAlthough she was treated well by many, she was also screamed at and physically threatened by others. She kept showing up anyway, and made a difference to countless patients when they were at their most vulnerable.\n\nOver the past two months, since the coronavirus outbreak began making news, I've scrolled past countless articles with click-bait headlines and commentary that perpetuate stereotypes and prejudices against Asian people and set off xenophobic alarm bells. The posts are being shared widely by strangers, but also by people I know. My outward appearance and father's last name perhaps make it easy for them to forget that my family is Chinese.\n\nAnd it's not just headlines I'm experiencing. Last month, I overheard a conversation among colleagues expressing concern about attending a staff potluck where spring rolls were going to be served. I am watching from the sidelines in terms of how Asian people are being treated in my once-safe community because I am seen as white.\n\nCourtesy of Louise Gleeson The author and her grandmother shortly after the family immigrated to Canada in 1974.\n\nWe know that fear can lead to defensiveness and blame. I can tell myself that Trump's dog-whistle tweets are an attempt to distract from his administration's failures in preventing and controlling the spread of the virus. But I will not feel compassion for his fear, as he clearly lacks any for the fear his words have ignited in the Asian community ― or any concern about the very real and very dangerous acts that his words could inspire in others.\n\nWe all carry the traumas of the generations before us, who bravely faced persecution and prejudice when they immigrated here. It terrifies me to think of my children's generation having firsthand experience of such prejudice to share with the next one.\n\nMom, I just saw Trump's tweet, my 17-year-old daughter tells me after noticing it on her Chinese friend's social media. She's really angry.\n\nWe talk about how we feel angry, too, even though it's much scarier for her friend's family and her grandmother than it is for her.\n\nWe have to stand up to people like that, I remind her, stopping myself before adding the words, your whole life, like my father did for me. I want to hold on to the hope that she won't have to.\n\nLouise Gleeson is a Toronto-based freelance writer, specializing in family life and parenting.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The discredited practice of conversion therapy for LGBTQ children is now banned in Utah, making it the 19th state and one of the most conservative to prohibit it.\n\nSupporters navigated a winding path to passage and some dissent remains, but barring it in Utah could give a boost to similar efforts in other right-leaning states, said Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nIt's really given people a lot of hope, said Minter, whose group has pushed for bans around the U.S. Virginia is considering a ban, and the issue could also come up in this year in Texas and Kentucky, he said.\n\nThe change in Utah comes after the state hammered out a regulatory rule that had the support of the influential Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Leaders had opposed a previous version because it didn't have certain exceptions for clergy.\n\nRepublican Gov. Gary Herbert took the unusual step of calling on regulators after a proposed law was derailed by changes made by conservative lawmakers. State officials confirmed the rule became final late Tuesday.\n\nThe original sponsor of the proposal, GOP Utah Rep. Craig Hall, applauded the rule going into effect, saying in a statement that it prohibits dangerous practices while protecting healthcare professionals.\n\nThis measure will truly save lives, he said.\n\nConversion therapy is a practice used to try to change sexual orientation or gender identity. Many people who have been through it say it deepened feelings of depression and increased thoughts of suicide. The new rule bans Utah therapists from subjecting LGBTQ minors to the practice that the American Psychological Association has said is not based in science and is harmful to mental health.\n\nStill, the ban has drawn pushback in Utah. Opponents argued it would prevent parents from getting help for children with unwanted gay feelings and keep therapists from even talking about sexuality with their kids. The rule could become an issue during the 2020 legislative session.\n\nUtah's predominant faith, known widely as the Mormon church, opposes same-sex marriage and teaches that intimate same-sex relationships are a sin. But it also urges members to be kind and compassionate to LGBTQ people. The religion holds tremendous influence in Utah, where the majority of state lawmakers and nearly two-thirds of the state's 3.1 million residents are members.\n\nThe faith got behind the conversion therapy ban after supporters included assurances that church leaders and members who are therapists would be allowed to provide spiritual counseling for parishioners or families.
I was recently asked if I had any financial advice for 20-somethings. As I wrote out my thoughts, and reflected back on 10 years helping newlyweds make their wedding and honeymoon dreams come true without blowing their budget, I realized that a few smart money moves in one's twenties can be hugely impactful on future success-- especially marital success. Given that, the best financial marriage tips may be things you must do before you get married. Here are my six personal finance tips for anyone with marriage in their future.\n\nLearn to Budget for Big-ticket Expenses\n\nWhen you're planning for an expensive and important event like a wedding, it's imperative that you already know how to budget and save. So learn now. (If you're new to the concept of maintaining a monthly budget, learn the basics, here). You can actually have a lot of fun practicing how to budget for an extraordinary expense! Is there a trip you've been meaning to take? Or another big-ticket item you're dreaming of, like a car? Here's how to make that dream happen:\n\nFirst, figure out how much your trip or item will cost, and determine how much you're willing to spend. That's your budget.\n\nIf you have some money already set aside for this item, subtract your savings from your budget. That's how much you still need to save, or your savings goal.\n\nDivide the savings goal by the number of months to the purchase date. That's your monthly savings goal. Or, figure out how much you can afford to save per month and calculate your target date from there.\n\nAsk your employer to divert that amount from your paycheck into your savings account each month until you reach your purchase date.\n\nYou may need to adjust your daily spending habits to meet your savings goal. The easiest and most impactful thing to cut out is the little daily expenses like morning coffee and eating lunch out -- they add up over time. Avoiding Starbucks and bringing your lunch to work five days a week should net you about $80-100/week!\n\n(It's easy enough to make your coffee at home and cook extra at dinner so you have leftovers for next day's lunch.) For more savings, limit dinners out to once each week -- that's another $25/week or more in your savings account!\n\nAnother way to help your savings along is through the generosity of friends and family. Open a Plumfund ahead of your birthday, graduation or other gifting occasion and your loved ones will happily contribute gifts toward your special trip or wish.\n\nUse Credit Wisely\n\nCredit cards can be alluring in your twenties, and before you know it, you've racked up thousands of dollars in debt. You want to be extremely careful not to start your marriage with a huge credit card bill you can't pay off!\n\nHowever there are advantages to having and using a credit card in your twenties. For example, you'll have a longer positive credit history, which can set you up for better mortgage rates when you buy your first home. The best way to use a credit card is to charge your regular monthly expenses, and pay the balance each month. Paying it off each and every month is crucial to avoid interest charges. Another compelling reason to use credit cards is to earn rewards that can help cut the cost of things like travel or even everyday expenses. For example, I have enjoyed free flights, discounted flights, and free first class upgrades with bonus points earned by opening an airline-branded credit card. Visit Honeyfund's blog for more info on how to use credit card rewards points for travel.\n\nMax Your Retirement Account Contributions\n\nYour mid-twenties is the best time to start your retirement account. You have time on your side now more than any other time in your life, which means you will get the maximum benefit from compounding, or the ability to earn more money on the earnings in your account. It's also the time in adulthood when you are likely to have the fewest expenses -- before you have a home mortgage, multiple cars, children, etc. Now is the time to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k), especially if your employer has a matching program. Compounding and employer matching are two opportunities for free money you may not have any other time in your life!\n\n\n\nEarn More\n\nEarning more income is a great strategy to help you meet savings goals and set yourself up for a solid future marriage. Take some time to do a career checkup. Ask yourself these questions: Are you in a job with upward mobility? Is it time to ask your employer about a promotion? Even if you aren't ready now, what are some things you could be doing this year prepare for a promotion later on? Are you due for a raise? Don't be afraid to ask your employer any one of these questions -- a raise or promotion often won't come unless you ask.\n\nIf you have some savings outside your retirement account, look around for some investments that can earn more money on your money. Savings interest rates are at historic lows so you might need to think outside the typical savings account. One example is a peer-to-peer lending program like Prosper, which can return 6 percent or better, depending on your risk tolerance.\n\n\n\nChoose Wisely\n\nBecause you've taken the time to practice your financial skills before marriage, you should have a good sense of your money values. That is a critical first step to ensuring financial compatibility with your partner. One of my favorite kernels of wisdom from Kevin O'Leary's recent book Cold Hard Truth on Family, Kids and Money is that the person you choose to marry is the most important business decision you'll make -- so choose wisely.\n\nHave Fun!\n\nWhen you find Mr or Ms Right, have fun taking on financial challenges and solving them together. The first will certainly be the wedding -- and there are endless ways to plan an epic wedding on a budget. At Honeyfund, we've helped nearly half a million couples hack their honeymoon by inviting friends and family to contribute to their once-in-a-lifetime trip as a wedding gift.\n\nOnce you're married and you've successfully navigated budgeting, saving and paying for your own wedding, you should be in a great position to take on your financial future together and have fun with it!\n\nThe key is to agree on your goals and work together toward them. My husband, Josh, and I like to make a date night out of our financial discussions. You know, that romantic time where you sit down to review your income, expenses, assets and debt and make sure you're on track to hit your goals? No, really! This is the top thing you can do to ensure you don't end up like 45 percent of couples who divorce over financial disputes, so make it fun. Open a bottle of wine, get out your favorite board game, and when your financial chat is over, enjoy the feeling of accomplishment while you have some fun together. You're ahead of the game.\n\nAbout Sara Margulis, Honeyfund & Plumfund\n\nSara Margulis is the CEO and co-founder of Honeyfund and Plumfund.

Mark Harmon will be celebrating 32 years of marriage to actress Pam Dawber next month — an impressive milestone in general and certainly by Hollywood standards.\n\nSo how did they do it? In an interview with People, the NCIS star said their age when they married (both were 35) could have something to do with their longevity as a couple.\n\nWe were both in our thirties when we got married, so hopefully the stupid stuff we did earlier, Harmon told the magazine. That's probably the closest I have to what the key is.\n\nAfter being introduced by a mutual friend, Harmon and Dawber said their I dos in March 1987 in an intimate ceremony attended by only a few friends and family members. Dawber, who starred in Mork and Mindy and My Sister Sam, later took a break from acting to focus on raising the couple's two sons, Sean and Ty.\n\nThe couple has long been private about their life together.\n\nIt's not even a choice. It's who we are. We stay home. A lot, Harmon told TV Insider in 2017. I'm not a Twitter guy or a Facebook guy. Our sons aren't into that either. Pam and I have both made a living in this business, and still, there's a part of that that's just not natural.\n\nRon Galella via Getty Images Pam Dawber and husband Mark Harmon at an event in 1989.\n\nDuring the interview with People, Harmon was asked about the eagle-head ring he was wearing on his left ring finger (he believes it once belonged to his grandfather).
Not long after Jessica Mann moved to Los Angeles in 2011 to pursue acting, she says Harvey Weinstein forced himself on her in a hotel room in Beverly Hills. The famous producer performed oral sex on Mann without her consent while her friend was in the next room, she testified last week during Weinstein's sexual assault trial in New York City.\n\nThe more I fought, the angrier he got, she told the jury. The disgraced film mogul is facing five felony sexual assault charges, which stem from multiple allegations from Mann and Weinstein's former assistant Miriam Haley.\n\nMann said she left the encounter at the hotel feeling confused, but attempted to maintain a relationship with the producer, in part, because he had promised to cast her in one of his films.\n\nI had been sexual with very few people, and I couldn't undo what had already happened, said Mann. It was at that point, Mann said, she decided to be in a relationship with Weinstein. That first alleged assault was the beginning of a four-year relationship between Mann and Weinstein, which included both consensual and non-consensual sex acts, she testified. Weinstein allegedly raped Mann twice during this period.\n\nWeinstein's defense attorneys tried to make it seem like the consensual encounters invalidated her assault claims. You had a choice to walk right out of that hotel room and never see Harvey Weinstein again, isn't that right? Weinstein's lawyer asked.\n\nBut throughout the trial, Mann was very clear about what happened to her. I know the history of my relationship with him, Mann said during her testimony. I know it is complicated and different, but it does not change the fact that he raped me.\n\n***\n\nMann's relationship with Weinstein may have been complicated, but it's not unimaginable. Multiple experts told HuffPost that some sexual assault survivors do have consensual sex with their attackers after an initial assault.\n\nI certainly understand that it seems bizarre, Dr. Laura Wilson, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at the University of Mary Washington told HuffPost by phone on Thursday. But in actuality, when you think about how people respond to victimization it makes a lot of sense. Wilson, whose research focuses on post-trauma functioning in sexual assault survivors, explained that most survivors don't initially use the terms assault or rape to describe what they've experienced. Instead, they might conceptualize the assault as bad sex or a miscommunication.\n\nJOHANNES EISELE via Getty Images Former actress Jessica Mann arrives for the trial of Harvey Weinstein at the Manhattan Criminal Court, on Jan. 31, 2020 in New York City.\n\nOften times, the survivor in this scenario is in an ongoing relationship with an abusive partner, Wilson said. People tend to believe rape is perpetrated by a stranger ― not someone known to the victim like a partner, classmate or colleague. So when sexual violence is perpetrated by someone the survivor knows (which is 80% of the time, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), they often don't have the correct language to describe the encounter.\n\nWhat we know through research is that people have, what we call, a 'stereotyped rape script,' Wilson explained. What most people assume rape looks like is a strange man raping a woman in a dark alley, there's typically a weapon involved, and she normally fights back. Anything that doesn't fit that script, we don't know what to do with it. We don't know how to conceptualize it.\n\nFor periods of time after the assault, a victim could continue to be in a friendship, a consensual sexual relationship and even a marriage with their rapist.\n\n***\n\nBesides Mann, other high-profile sexual assault cases have involved similar patterns. Brooke Nevills, the woman who accused former NBC host Matt Lauer of anally raping her in 2014, continued a consensual sexual relationship with Lauer after the alleged assault. Many of R. Kelly's alleged victims, a majority of whom were young female fans, stayed in a relationship with the singer after alleged abuse took place.\n\nPower imbalance is definitely a factor that contributes to situations like these, Kristen Houser, a consultant and sexual violence expert formerly with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, said.\n\nPeople who perpetrate this kind of violence are highly-skilled at recognizing vulnerabilities, she told HuffPost. This is not about miscommunications, this is about somebody reading fear or vulnerability and taking advantage of it anyway.\n\nMann discussed in length during her testimony how much power Weinstein wielded over her career and how she attempted to make him a pseudo father figure. When defense attorney Donna Rotunno asked why Mann didn't simply walk away from Weinstein after the first alleged rape, Mann responded: That could have been death to any attempt of a career.\n\nOften, this power imbalance leads to or fuels an abusive relationship, whether emotionally and/or physically, which Mann alluded to in her testimony when she described Weinstein as Jekyll and Hyde.\n\nHouser said this is a textbook example of gaslighting from an abusive partner.\n\nThe 'Jekyll and Hyde' description of somebody who is nice, who will behave in ways that seem thoughtful, that seem caring, that seem authentic is part of a pattern, Houser said. It creates confusion. It creates a sense of distrust of your own experience. The ongoing contact is part of keeping victims confused and questioning the nature of the relationship.\n\nHouser added that sometimes survivors of sexual violence consent to sex with their rapist after an attack in order to take back their power.\n\nInitiating a sexual relationship or sexual contact with somebody who has rendered you helpless can give you a feeling of mastery over that helplessness, she said. Now you can be in control. Now you are able to give consent.\n\nMann's experience seemed to be in line with this phenomenon. During her testimony, she read an email she wrote to her then-boyfriend in 2014. I remembered the day I realized I was controlling my world because I was sexually assaulted, and that story played out where I played into sexual dynamics with people to feel like I would never be taken advantage of again, Mann read from the email before breaking down in tears.\n\nThe prosecution in Weinstein's case rested on Thursday and his defense is up next. His attorneys are expected to call expert witnesses, including a psychologist who can speak to human memory, most likely to cast doubt on Mann and other alleged victims' accounts.\n\nWeinstein's trial, which was expected to last at least six weeks, is moving quicker than expected. A verdict could be handed down by mid-February. Weinstein, who has been accused by at least 100 women of sexual misconduct, is facing five felony sex assault charges, including the most serious, predatory sexual assault. If convicted on this charge, he faces life in prison.
MediaNews Group/Torrance Daily Breeze via Getty Images via Getty Images A protester holds up a sign as presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg speaks at a campaign rally in Compton, California, on Feb. 3.\n\nWhen Rep. Harley Rouda became one of the first members of Congress to endorse Mike Bloomberg for president, the California Democrat billed it as a marriage of moderates.\n\nHe has been a fiscal conservative and a social progressive, which is where I believe most Americans are, Rouda said. That's exactly what I ran on.\n\nBut Rouda has another reason to feel an affinity for the 77-year-old billionaire. In the 2018 midterms, when Rouda was locked in one of the most contested elections in the country, Bloomberg spent $4.5 million of his vast personal fortune on ads thrumming Rouda's Republican opponent.\n\nNow, Rouda is in Congress — and one of three members who endorsed Bloomberg after a super PAC financed by Bloomberg spent millions of dollars to help elect them, records reviewed by HuffPost show.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan each received $2.2 million in support from Bloomberg's super PAC in 2018; in the past week, each has given him a glowing endorsement.\n\nAll told, Bloomberg spent $8.9 million supporting Rouda, Sherrill and Stevens — nearly a quarter of his total spending in the midterms.\n\nRouda, Sherrill and Stevens all denied that their endorsements were tied to Bloomberg's political largesse. Using today's vernacular, there was no quid pro quo, Rouda told McClatchy when pressed about the connection.\n\nSome of the candidates Mike has supported over the years have supported his presidential campaign, many have not, said Stu Loeser, a longtime Bloomberg spokesperson. But Mike is hardly alone in building relationships with candidates who later supported him ― other 2020 Democrats have gone out of their way to show that they were doing the same thing.\n\nThe correlation highlights the power of Bloomberg's extraordinary personal fortune to warp the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nHis estimated net worth is more than $50 billion, making him one of the richest people on the planet. Since entering the presidential race less than three months ago, Bloomberg has spent north of $300 million of his wealth playing catch-up to candidates who have been campaigning for a year or more. It's working: Bloomberg has amassed more TV airtime, polling support and prominent endorsements than some candidates have accrued over more than a year of arduous campaigning. And he is polling high enough in some national polls to meet one of the qualifications for the Democratic debate stage.\n\nA former Republican, Bloomberg has also secured roughly as many endorsements from party leaders as two of the current front-runners, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nMany of those throwing Bloomberg their support are mayors whose cities have benefited from seven- and eight-figure donations from Bloomberg's vast network of philanthropies. Others have personally attended an elite, Bloomberg-financed boot camp for mayors. Stevens cited her past work as a fellow with Bloomberg Philanthropies as one of the reasons for her endorsement.\n\nThe endorsements from Rouda, Sherrill and Stevens stand out because House Democrats are being unusually slow this cycle to make endorsements. More members of Congress had endorsed Hillary Clinton by this point in 2016 than have endorsed any of the candidates running in 2020 thus far. Of the 232 Democrats in the U.S. House, more than 100 remain undeclared. Nine are currently endorsing Bloomberg.\n\nRouda, Sherrill and Stevens received Bloomberg's support in the form of TV ads bought by a super PAC, Independence USA PAC, which receives all of its money from Bloomberg and his gun control advocacy group.\n\nIsabella Carapella/HuffPost Some 23% of Bloomberg's electoral spending in 2018 went to three House Democrats who are now endorsing him for president.\n\nIn the past, Bloomberg has used the PAC to support Republicans and Democrats. But in 2018, he spent $38.1 million supporting only Democratic candidates in 33 House and Senate races. Rouda, Sherrill and Stevens were the second-, sixth- and seventh-largest beneficiaries, respectively, and their races accounted for 23% of what the super PAC spent.\n\nThe spending against Rouda's opponent accounted for an astonishing 12% of what all candidates, parties and interest groups spent on the race. Bloomberg's spending pushed Rouda's race into the 10 most expensive in the country that year.\n\nLike Rouda, Sherrill and Stevens are moderate, suburban Democrats who peeled off traditionally Republican districts in the 2018 blue wave.\n\nSherrill, who supported Sen. Cory Booker until he dropped out of the presidential race, cited Bloomberg's support for gun control and infrastructure projects in making her endorsement. A spokeswoman for Sherrill said the congresswoman and Bloomberg have met and had productive interactions but did not give specifics.\n\nStevens' office said her two-year fellowship with the city of Louisville, Kentucky, which was sponsored by Bloomberg Philanthropies, figured into her endorsement.\n\nI have seen him build a strong team to tackle tough problems, Stevens said in a statement, and I think his unique combination of public and private sector leadership make him the best candidate to unite the country and defeat Donald Trump.
Getty Images\n\nAlthough miscarriage is very common, it can feel difficult to talk about. Up to 20% of known pregnancies end in loss, yet many who've been through it still describe a sense of shame and stigma around the experience.\n\nIt may feel even more uncomfortable to address miscarriage with children. If your child knows he or she is getting a new sibling and then that changes, you may be left wondering how to break the news or if you even should.\n\nAlthough very painful and difficult, it is important for parents to take the step of explaining pregnancy loss to their children because even at a very young age, children can pick up on others' emotions, said Becky Stuempfig, a licensed marriage and family therapist.\n\nThey are likely sensing that their parents are sad even if parents think they are 'acting normal' while with their child. They may overhear conversations and wonder what is going on, but feel fearful of asking or not know how to ask in the case of young children, she added. Neurologically our brains want to make sense of what is happening around us, so if parents don't explain pregnancy loss, children will begin to come up with their own explanation.\n\nAs a parent, you can help your child understand pregnancy loss and the emotions it evokes. But how exactly should you approach conversations about miscarriage with kids? Below, Stuempfig and other experts share their advice.\n\nMake sure you're ready.\n\nAs the common saying goes, you must put your own oxygen mask on before administering someone else's, said Jessica Zucker, a psychologist specializing in reproductive and maternal mental health and the author of I HAD A MISCARRIAGE: A Memoir, a Movement.\n\nChildren pick up on and often rely on their parent's emotions to help them form their responses to situations, so it's most helpful to make sure you're in a headspace that will best allow you to guide your child through their own process as they digest the discussion, she noted.\n\nTake some time to process your own feelings before talking to your child. Choose to start the conversation at a time when you feel calm and are available to talk for a long time in case they have lots of questions.\n\nIt can be helpful for parents to have the discussion together with their child so that partners can feel supported by one another and if one partner becomes flooded with emotion, the other partner can take over the discussion, Stuempfig said. It's okay for a child to see parents grieve, but it is important that parents are emotionally available to the child during the conversation and not so overcome with their own emotion that they are unable to attend to their child.\n\nBe honest and direct.\n\nWhen parents are faced with explaining pregnancy loss to a child, they should keep the conversation honest and simple, Stuempfig said. When you are dealing with children and grief, it is best to provide a small amount of information in a concise way and then check in with the child to see if they have questions.\n\nDon't get too bogged down in complicated details or say unnecessary extra words. Let their specific questions guide the discussion and keep it simple with straightforward answers. You can turn to children's books to help explain loss and grief.\n\nThe best way to go about it is to be as direct and factual as possible within the appropriate developmental stage of the child, said Jenny Yip, a clinical psychologist and author.\n\nTailor the discussion to your child.\n\nTake your child's age, developmental level and temperament into account when you share your pregnancy loss. With toddlers and preschoolers, avoid euphemisms or terms they won't understand, like passing away or going to the great beyond.\n\nYoung children take everything literally, so parents should avoid saying things like 'we lost the baby' because they might start worrying that their parents will lose them too, Stuempfig said. An honest explanation can be easier for children to comprehend, such as 'We don't know why this happened. Sometimes babies are born healthy like you were and sometimes it doesn't happen that way and the baby isn't born.'\n\nPrepare to have to explain it to your child multiple times and try not to shut the conversation down if they bring it up again.\n\nThe concept of pregnancy can be very hard to understand, and this makes explaining the loss even harder for children, said Perri Shaw Borish, a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in maternal mental health. For a younger child, provide small amounts of information at a time and answer their specific questions. For an older child, you can tell them that the baby was not strong enough to live outside the mommy's belly, and that means that the baby died.\n\nFor even older kids, there may be an interest in the science of the human body and reproductive health. You can talk about the scientific details of reproduction, complications that can arise and chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMake it clear it's no one's fault.\n\nMuch like conversations centering around divorce or a parent separation, it's common for children to immediately blame themselves for a pregnancy or infant loss, Zucker noted. This is primarily due to their cognitive development, which leaves them centering themselves or only seeing things through their perspectives. So it's vital that throughout the conversation, and perhaps even at the start, you remind your child that they are in no way responsible for any pregnancy outcome, especially one that ends in a loss. And that it's not the fault of the mom either.\n\nEmphasize that it's nobody's fault, just something sad that happened. If your child asks why the loss happened, you can explain that miscarriage is rather common and often due to abnormalities out of our control, not the result of anything anyone did or didn't do.\n\nAbove all, let your children know that you love them, and that you are pleased they are in your life, said Catherine Athans, a licensed marriage and family therapist. Hugging and kissing go a long way to make your child or children feel safe!\n\nTalk about your feelings.\n\nAfter a miscarriage, the emotional reaction from parents ranges anywhere from ambivalence to anger to complete despair, said Misty Richards, program director for the UCLA Semel Institute's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship. Often times, this manifests in bouts of crying, wanting to be alone, and quiet moments of reflection that can be witnessed by a child. Rather than hide this emotional response, help your child understand what they are seeing by naming the emotion ― 'Mommy was crying a little bit because I am sad about the baby.'\n\nWhen you name the emotion and the reason why, your child learns how to identify feelings and also hears the message that it's normal to feel sad and cry sometimes. It's also useful to let them know that even though you feel sad sometimes, you're going to be OK. Parents should model vulnerability and healthy coping skills, like taking breaks, asking for help and sharing their feelings. Ask your child for a hug if you need one.\n\nLearning to talk about and process losses together as a family is a critical skill that a child can take with them into adulthood and draw upon for the rest of their lives, said Neha Chaudhary, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The more we talk to kids about tough topics like pregnancy loss, the more we can model what it means to experience the hard parts of life and navigate big feelings together, head-on.\n\nValidate their emotional response.\n\nJust as you open up about your emotions, invite your children to do the same. Ask them what they're thinking and feeling during the conversation and check in days later to see if that changes as they've processed the information.\n\nEncourage kids to ask questions, draw pictures or write a letter and express their feelings, said Sheryl Ziegler, a psychologist, play therapist and the author of Mommy Burnout. Playtime is another area where their emotional response may manifest, so pay attention to the words and themes they use.\n\nDepending on your culture, you may engage in grief rituals following a pregnancy loss. Invite your child to participate.\n\nWith pregnancy loss, parents can ask even young children if they would like to join them in a simple goodbye ritual, such as making a card or drawing saying goodbye to the baby, or planting a flower or tree honoring the baby, Stuempfig said. These rituals do not need to be elaborate, but it can help children express their own grief when they see adults grieving in an honest and open manner.\n\nThe important thing is to be present and open to any reaction your child may have. Emphasize that you are always there for any questions in the future.\n\nTry to accept all of their thoughts, emotions and behaviors with open arms, even if they are not reflective of how you feel, Richards said. This models acceptance and helps reinforce the concept that you will continue to be their safe haven no matter how they respond. If they do not seem impacted by the news, that is OK too.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDon't feel like you have to tell them.\n\nIf the child was unaware of the pregnancy, sharing the news of pregnancy loss is a matter of personal choice for parents, Stuempfig said. If the child is exposed to parents' sadness and grief, it can be helpful for the parents to fill the child in so that they do not begin assigning other explanations such as blaming their own behavior for their parents' moods. Typically trying to keep things covered up results in more anxiety and frustration for the whole family.\n\nYou can tell your child the reason you're not feeling well by sharing the news of the loss or you can simply name the emotion and talk about that aspect. Richards advised saying something like, Sometimes Mommy feels sad, but I talk to Daddy about it and I feel better. You have seen Mommy sad a lot lately ― it is not your fault, and I am going to be OK.\n\nIf you already told your child that you were pregnant, it's important to address the fact that you're not anymore so that they aren't confused, but you can also do that without going into the loss.\n\nIn my situation, my son was too young to comprehend my pregnancy and the loss of it, so with much consideration and upon seeking consultation about how best to relay the news, we decided it was best to say, 'We thought Mommy was pregnant, but it turns out she isn't,' Zucker explained. When my son was 10, however, we had a frank and nuanced conversation about my 16 week miscarriage and how it affected me, our family, my work life and the age gap between my two children.\n\nTake care of yourself.\n\nRemember to take the space you need to take care of yourself, if not for you, then for your family, Chaudhary said. Children notice when something is wrong with their parents or caregivers and they feed off that energy. Grieve. Reach out to friends and family. Vent. Yell into a pillow. Cry. Join a group. Focus on you and your healing. Give yourself permission to take care of yourself.\n\nThere's no right or wrong way to grieve, so do whatever you need to do to cope with the loss. Talking to others who have experienced pregnancy loss can be helpful, although everyone's story and healing process will be different.\n\nThe worst you can do for yourself is ignore or avoid your feelings, Yip said. If your thoughts and emotions become intolerable or too much for you to handle, seek help from a mental health professional.\n\nAsk your doctor for recommendations for organizations that support families through perinatal loss. Stuempfig suggested turning to Postpartum Support International, which can help you find support in your area or online.
The hands of a marriage. Linked fingers two boyfriends after a wedding.Las manos de un matrimonio. Enlazados los dedos de dos novios tras una boda.\n\nGetting married to the person you love is such an exciting experience. Just the thought of having someone else to ride through the storms of life with you; someone to come home to; someone who is committed to you and only you; someone to laugh with or cry with; someone you can lay in bed with and eat cold pizza at 3:00 a.m.; someone who calls you out when you're wrong; someone who will support that crazy dream. All of that! It's like a sleepover with your best friend for the rest of your life.\n\nOne of the things that many people think about is the kind of wife/husband they'd be. Have you ever thought about that and it just scares you straight? It's like a forced, voluntary pressure to be the best at it, hands down. You want your spouse to think you're the best thing since slice bread and government cheese. You want them to desire you and never have eyes for another person. All of that translates into fear for some people. Again, that voluntary pressure to be the best; to be perfect. Thoughts flow through your mind such as What if I am not good enough... What if I get tired and want to give up... What if they just don't do it for me anymore and my eyes start drifting? These are real thoughts that some may think about when considering marriage. Yet they still want it!\n\nSo how does one get over that fear? How do you cancel the thoughts of not being good at this?\n\n1. Understand this, in any relationship, you will most likely mess up at some point. Big time too! And guess what, your relationship won't be unique to those storms. Everyone goes through that life: * You will act out of emotions verses logic. * You will say some really bad things and you will question the walk down the aisle. * That cutie from the coffee shop will give the look that pretty much says Say the word and its on. * You will possibly have those thoughts about leaving your spouse while staring into their eyes. * You will slam the door and walk out when your spouse is the most vulnerable. * You will question your worth, to them and to yourself. * You will throw your hands up for the very last time. These things happen and its real! We're talking about spending a lifetime with another person....trust and believe it WILL happen. Anybody that says that they don't experience at least one or two of those things is lying; to themselves and to their spouse. So, knowing the cons going into the whole marriage thing doesn't feel like pressure anymore (and of course, the pros far outweighs the cons). It's like you are going in and you already know you will (not if) miss it in some areas. I don't know for you but for me, when I'm getting ready to do something big, I want to know all the bad stuff first lol...after that, I will make a decision on whether I will go forward. But there's a sense of security when you know it's not going to be easy and you have some bumps ahead of you. It's like you can prepare for it ahead of time.\n\n2. So how do you get past that? It's a CHOICE you have to make. This is a different type of choice though; it's the kind of choice/decision that you make between you, your spouse and God that no matter what, you are in it till the VERY end. Don't get scared by that! It's ok to be in it till the very end. Why go into something to leave midway? Too commonly, people treat marriage like a car. The minute stuff starts going sour, (transmission, engine, got over 100k miles, etc) they find every reason in the book to trade it in or even sell it. It's too much work and too expensive at times so lets cut ties. And with cars, that is realistic and understandable, but not when you are dealing with a human being. But, if you have that mind set, as it relates to marriage, then when this new car starts going sour, it will be traded-in too. Now, I'm not saying that cutting ties aren't necessary in certain cases. Surely if you total your car, there's no fixing that. Likewise in marriages, if its totaled beyond repair then you do what's necessary.\n\nRemember, some things in life requires us to hang in there; there's no magic. You can't run every single time to the next best thing. I mean, is it really the next best thing or is it the temporary fix? That really speaks on your endurance or lack thereof. And I get it, sometimes it just can't work. I'm a product of a divorce, so I understand. But trust me when I say, it's a choice. Some of us go into marriage with CHOICES versus just A CHOICE.
A Missouri couple is considering next steps after a federal judge dismissed their discrimination lawsuit against a local senior community this week.\n\nBev Nance, 68, and Mary Walsh, 72, of Shrewsbury, Missouri, filed the lawsuit against Friendship Village in July 2018. The women, who have been married since 2009, claimed in the suit that the nearby senior living community had rejected their application for a unit after they'd paid a $2,000 deposit because of a longstanding cohabitation policy defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, as marriage is understood in the Bible.\n\nIn a 10-page ruling issued Wednesday, however, U.S. District Judge Jean C. Hamilton noted that sexuality is not explicitly a protected characteristic under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status and national origin.\n\nAt no time do Plaintiffs assert that had they been men involved in a same-sex relationship or marriage, they would have been admitted as residents in Friendship Village, the ruling, which can be found here, continued. Under these circumstances, the Court finds the claims boil down to those of discrimination based on sexual orientation rather than sex alone.\n\nIt went on to note, The court recognizes that several federal courts have held otherwise in recent opinions, concluding that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination. However, the opinion said, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which is the immediate appeals court above Hamilton's own, has not changed its position on the issue, and so the court must dismiss.\n\nOne of the couple's attorneys, however, argued that the discrimination that her clients experienced is a form of gender discrimination, and therefore prohibited under law.\n\nPlanning for senior housing is a big decision, and Mary and Bev chose Friendship Village because it was in their community, they had friends there, and it offered services that would allow them to stay together there for the rest of their lives, attorney Julie Wilensky of the National Center for Lesbian Rights told HuffPost in an emailed statement. The discrimination they experienced was very hurtful.\n\nShe added, If Mary were a man married to Bev, instead of a woman married to Bev, Friendship Village would not have turned them away. This is a very straightforward example of discrimination 'because of sex.'\n\nSAGE, a national LGBTQ senior advocacy group, agreed, calling Friendship Village's rejection of the couple's application blatant discrimination.\n\nMary Walsh and Bev Nance were discriminatorily denied admission to the Friendship Village retirement community for one reason only ― because they are two women in a committed relationship rather than a woman and a man, SAGE CEO Michael Adams told McKnight's Senior Living.
In their first interview as a couple since assuming the roles of president and first lady, Joe and Jill Biden spoke with People magazine about supporting each other over 43 years of marriage.\n\nShe has a backbone like a ramrod, the president said in the interview, which was published on Wednesday. Everybody says marriage is 50/50. Well, sometimes you have to be 70/30. Thank God that when I'm really down, she steps in, and when she's really down, I'm able to step in. We've been really supportive of one another.\n\nHe added that he was glad his wife had kept working as a college professor over the decades, stressing that in order to keep a marriage strong, it was important for both parties to have their separate passions and goals.\n\nJill Biden, who still teaches English composition at Northern Virginia Community College and has a doctorate in education, is the first first lady with a paying job outside the White House.\n\nIt's important that she has the things that she cares a great deal about, her independence, the president said. And yet we share each other's dreams.\n\nJill Biden said that the couple had endured much pain together over the years, a likely reference to the loss of her stepson Beau Biden, who died from a brain tumor in 2015 at the age of 46.\n\nBeau was the eldest child of Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, who died in a car crash in 1972 with the couple's one-year-old daughter, Naomi.\n\nAll that we've been through together — the highs, the lows and certainly tragedy and loss — there's that quote that says sometimes you become stronger in the fractured places, she said. That's what we try to achieve.\n\nThe president, when asked if he would be able to perform his role without the support of his wife, stressed that we each could do our jobs, but not as well as we do them, adding that she was the glue that held it together.\n\nIt's not that we don't fight and argue sometimes, he said. I'm just lucky.\n\nWell, after 43 years of marriage there's really not that much more to fight about, the first lady added.\n\nThe couple, who married on June 17, 1977, also touched on Joe Biden's Catholic faith ― which the president equated to meditation ― and the surreal experience of re-entering the White House after having spent so much time in it when he served as vice president in Barack Obama's administration.\n\nRead the full interview here.
At a recent book signing, a reader asked me why precisely it is so difficult for Mormons who stop believing or begin to believe in a different way to leave. I've talked about this before here. I've also talked about the costs of being excommunicated officially by the Mormon church, even if you no longer believe in the supernatural effects of such a ritual here.\n\nThe reality is that Mormonism isn't quite the same as most other religions. Leaving Mormonism and joining another form of Christianity is not like moving from one Protestant faith to another. Mormonism is more of a culture than other forms of Christianity and it permeates more of our lives than just Sunday worship. Mormonism includes marriage and having children, food and housing choices, work and friends, hobbies, and our very sense of self. Making it hard to leave may be partly a design of the church, but in some ways it is unintentional.\n\nYes, some Mormons shun family members in an attempt to get them to reconsider a choice to leave. But there are more important, subtler problems with leaving. Leaving Mormonism can mean leaving the certainty of having instant friends wherever you move, as well as specific financial assistance in hard times, from direct funds from fast offerings in the local ward to food from The Bishop's Storehouse, not to mention the uncountable hours spent helping ward members clean houses, mow lawns, paint, shovel snow, babysit children, and even move out of the ward boundaries geographically.\n\nI went through a faith crisis following the death of my sixth child, Mercy. Though I considered myself an atheist for several years, I continued to attend services, in part because losing my friends and family members as well as my faith system was too much of an obstacle while I was in the midst of suicidal depression. But it is also true that even if I didn't believe in God anymore, I was still unable to disentangle all the parts of myself that had been raised Mormon, including a kind of judgmentalism about those who left the Mormon faith.\n\nMormons believe that while everyone will get some level of heaven, only a very tiny portion will go to the highest level of the third kingdom, the celestial kingdom. There are many Mormon scriptures that talk about the strait and narrow path to God, as in Matthew 7:14 (strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it). In 3 Nephi 27:33, it reads,\n\nAnd it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at the strait gate; for strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but wide is the gate, and broad the way which leads to death, and many there be that travel therein, until the night cometh, wherein no man can work.\n\nIt becomes reflexive after years of Mormonism to think of every step outside of the strict lines of Mormonism as a sin that leads off this narrow path. Even thought can be a sin. Leaving the church entirely? For many, it is impossible. The only people who do that were lazy and don't want to obey the Word of Wisdom any longer. These people choose coffee and alcohol or smoking over their faith. Others leave Mormonism because they wanted to rail against the church, or to kick against the pricks.\n\nWhile I didn't believe in God or Mormonism for that time, I also did not have the energy to become anti-Mormon and to hate the religion I had grown up in. I had no frame for talking about a life after Mormonism that wasn't filled with either hate or debauchery. I also didn't have any pattern for finding a path within Mormonism that was different than the typical strict interpretation of the doctrine that I had followed before. I had been told all my life that Mormon intellectuals (though I was one) were to be feared. I had stayed away from the very thriving community of thinkers represented by the Sunstone symposium (sometimes called Sinstone by those who are more rigid in their thinking) who might have helped me.\n\nAs a result, I felt entirely alone and isolated, unable to talk about my journey to a new way of thinking with other Mormons, even those I considered close friends. If I did try to gently get at the problem, I was encouraged to read the scriptures more, to pray more, and to do more church service, which felt like a brush off.\n\nIt's only been recently that I've started to find Mormons who, like me, are finding their own way, clinging to doctrines they love, rejecting others they find abhorrent, studying Mormon history with a critical eye, and finding a faith that is more resilient--as well as ex-Mormons who know the faith's beauties and foibles and have found paths outside of faith. I wish I'd had more of those people around me when I was at my darkest spot, when suicide seemed the answer to my anguish over what seemed like God's death in my life.\n\nDr. Kristy Money, Mormon psychologist and founder of Healthy Mormon Journeys, has created a new podcast that helps Mormons along the way of faith transition. Her new website offers free counseling to those who cannot afford it, in an attempt to save marriages and families that could be at stake when it comes to faith changes. There are too many Mormons who are divorcing because they cannot see how to negotiate family life after a faith crisis, too many parents who won't speak to adult children, too many aborted family reunions.\n\nThe new foundation HMJ launches next weekend in SLC, kicking off with a sing-a-long concert on Thursday January 19 at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, including John Bonner and Jan Chamberlin (who resigned from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir over the group's decision to sing at Donald Trump's inauguration. There will be a reception Friday night at the South Valley UU society, and a communication workshop there Saturday. All are welcome. on).\n\nI'm hoping that all Mormons will be able to see some wider paths to take with family members, no matter their faith, and that Healthy Mormon Journeys becomes the norm rather than the exception.
London Scout/unsplash.com\n\nAs a psychotherapist working with surly teens and their frustrated, stressed-out parents, it hurts me to write this.\n\nEvery week I get calls with the question at the top of every parent's mind:\n\nHow do I get my kid to follow my rules?\n\nBut it's the wrong question.\n\nAnd trust me, discovering the correct answer was the hardest lesson l learned as a rookie therapist when counseling families.\n\nEarly on I noticed a trend with the discipline delinquents. After a few sessions, a large percentage of adults still couldn't get their kids to change no matter how hard they tried.\n\nAnd the worst part:\n\nIt wasn't entirely their fault.\n\nThey came to therapy, they read the books, the blogs, and all the Parenting Dos and Donts in-between.\n\nWhat am I missing here? I'd worry. Maybe I needed to work harder, re-read my text books…\n\nDespite my increased efforts, little progress was made with rule compliance — worse, parents grew more frustrated after each weary session. Who could blame them?\n\nThe saving grace was getting trained in the Back to Basics Parenting model.\n\nIt changed everything.\n\nTurns out the key to unlocking change involved asking a set of questions around the parents' own childhood.\n\nThe Brutal Truth About Being a Good Parent\n\nNobody is going to raise your child, but you. And that's how it should be.\n\nMy clinical supervisor used to say if she had to choose between working with the child or working with the parent, she'd choose the parent.\n\nBut how is that going to help Sara quit smoking weed on the weekends? I wondered.\n\nAlas, after one too many frustrating sessions, the light bulb went off.\n\nThe following mindset shifts are game changers whether you're a newly minted family therapist, or a parent at the end of your rope.\n\nThree Critical Parenting Steps to Establishing Effective and Consistent Rules\n\n1. The parent must be willing to change their behavior first. A common pitfall is confusing discipline with punishment.\n\nDiscipline is the structure that helps the child fit into the real world happily and effectively. It is the foundation for the development of the child's own self-discipline. Effective and positive discipline is about teaching and guiding children, not just forcing them to obey.\n\nStudies show that children tend to be better behaved if their parents combine warmth with clear and consistent rules and boundaries. For some, this means recognizing that empty threats may have worked when Sara was nine, but no longer work at thirteen.\n\nIf you warn your child that you're going to discipline him but then don't follow through, you'll have no credibility, says author Rex Forehand, Ph.D. You might as well wear a big sign that reads, 'Don't listen to anything I say!'\n\nFor others, addressing childhood trauma is warranted, especially if the goal was to raise their child in the opposite manner in which they were raised. Regardless of the motives, all-or-nothing parenting results in kids having too much power, or too little wiggle room to learn from their mistakes.\n\n2. The parent is encouraged to examine their own childhood and how their early experiences impact their parenting style.\n\nMost adults know it makes perfect to set boundaries around unruly behavior. However, the advice doesn't stick if parents don't understand why saying no, disappointing their child, or being disliked is hard for them in the first place.\n\nThe following questions adapted from Back to Basics Parenting helps parents connect the dots:\n\nDid you want to raise your children differently from how you were raised?\n\nHow was anger expressed in your household?\n\nWhat happened when you got angry growing up?\n\nWhat coping mechanisms did you learn to handle stress as a child?\n\nAre you currently using any of these coping skills now as a parent?\n\nWhat do you most fear will happen if you get angry at your child?\n\nWhat reaction do you most fear in your child when s/he gets angry with you?\n\nAnger is a strong, and often scary emotion. Growing up in a household with a ranting and raging parent may have meant walking on eggshells to avoid punishment. Or, screaming and bullying your parents may have resulted in feelings of empowerment because you ultimately got what you wanted.\n\nGetting in touch with anger, as well as addressing your greatest fears regarding what would happen if you did lay down the law are critical pieces of the parenting puzzle. Practicing calm in the eye of the storm (a Herculean task, if ever there was one) is also essential.\n\n3. The parent honestly examines why they don't want to change their parenting style (or why the desired change runs secondary to what they are able to avoid by not enforcing rules). This is a highly unconscious process, by the way. A skilled therapist is the bet for gaining insight and support for being comfortable with conflict, and addressing other problem areas in the home. For example:\n\nBeing overly consumed with my kid's problems means I don't have to face the fact that I no longer want to be in my marriage.\n\nI can continue to blame my partner when our son gets caught fighting at school. After all, if she didn't work so much, she would have more energy to help raise our kids.\n\nParents may not be aware of the ulterior gains of not setting rules. Reinforcing how ambivalence is a normal part of life, coupled with empathic support for the challenges of parenting, goes a long way. Once parents understand the connection between what they learned from their own parents growing up, and how these coping skills no longer serve them, motivation toward change increases.\n\nLearning to discipline with a calm, loving and firm hand does not happen overnight. However, the payoff is raising well-behaved, emotionally stable, and autonomous kids.\n\nAnd children have one shot at childhood.\n\n*****\n\nA version of this article appeared on PsychologyToday.
LGBTQ rights groups are speaking out against Australia's new deputy prime minister, who expressed homophobic views during his years as a newspaper editor.\n\nMichael McCormack was chosen by the Nationals ― the junior partner in the governing Liberal-National coalition ― to take over as party leader and deputy prime minister from Barnaby Joyce. Joyce, who had been in office for less than three months, resigned Friday after confirming he'd had an affair with a former staff member, Vicky Campion, who is pregnant.\n\nThough McCormack isn't as high-profile as Joyce, a disturbing editorial he wrote during his time as a newspaper editor has resurfaced on social media in the wake of his accession.\n\nThe 1993 article, which McCormack wrote while serving as editor for Wagga Wagga's Daily Advertiser, appeared to blame the sordid behavior of gay people for the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\nCongrats to Michael McCormack, new deputy PM, who wrote this in 1993 when I was eleven. pic.twitter.com/mlhi80W73k — Bec Shaw (@Brocklesnitch) February 25, 2018\n\n#BREAKING: Michael McCormack, the man who once penned a shocking homophobic tirade against gay people in a newspaper article, is Australia's new Deputy Prime Minister. https://t.co/1z87Scudyw pic.twitter.com/QWLBVqwebx — news.com.au (@newscomauHQ) February 25, 2018\n\nNeedless to say, LGBTQ rights advocates in Australia and around the world quickly condemned McCormack's words.\n\nCrazy that you make comments like this and go on to become deputy prime minister of Australia— just months after making gay people campaign for their civil rights. Gooooooooooood times. https://t.co/Jsd2ZcWun5 — David Mack (@davidmackau) February 25, 2018\n\nThe Guardian points out that McCormack has apologized for the piece, which sparked several complaints to the Australian Press Council, on more than one occasion.\n\nMcCormack voted in favor of same-sex marriage in Australia last year, and has said his views on the LGBTQ community have evolved in the 25 years since he wrote the piece.\n\nI have grown and learned not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique, he said in August 2017.\n\nStill, one of the country's most prominent LGBTQ activists believes McCormack needs to walk the talk if he wants queer voters to look beyond his hateful rhetoric.\n\nAgreed.\n\n\n\nCroome: The apologies Mr McCormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he may step in to, he needs to walk the talk,\n\n\n\nAustralia's new deputy PM once blamed gay people for the AIDS crisis. https://t.co/0eExWDU4Ow — Dameyon (@DameyonBonson) February 26, 2018\n\nHe needs to get behind initiatives that will reduce the unacceptably high levels of LGBTI isolation, prejudice and suicide that still exist in some parts of rural Australia, Rodney Croome, who is the spokesman for both the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group and Just.Equal, told the Australian Associated Press on Monday.\n\nHe needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.
I think it's time we talk about the voices in your head. Everyone has a voice in their head. If you think you're the exception, then a little voice in your head probably just said something like, Pfffff. I do not have a voice in my head. Only crazy people have voices in their heads.\n\nSee? Everyone has one.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge the voice in your head. Give it a name if it's helpful. Arianna Huffington refers to hers as her noisy roommate. Thanks to my friend Kate, who penned the term, I like to think of mine as my Debbie Downer.\n\nI love the term Debbie Downer because the voice can be downright mean. It's a second-guessing, critical, backseat-driving, constant companion who analyzes every decision we make and action we take -- past, present and future. It's relentless, judgmental, competitive, what-if-ing and worst-case-scenario-ing. All day. Every day.\n\nIt's exhausting. It makes me tired just writing about it.\n\nSure, sometimes the voice is nice (Good job redecorating the family room!), but my research shows that 78 percent of the time, the voice in a mother's head is very critical and very cruel, judging and second-guessing her every move.\n\nThankfully, most people's Debbie Downer doesn't berate them at the same volume throughout the day. The voice might be an annoying whisper on some occasions, but a loud, grating whine at others. It turns up the sound in scenarios where you feel the least confident or the most unworthy.\n\nPerhaps your mean inner voice shows up more frequently when you're at work: How can you not figure out this project? Most people could do it in their sleep. Maybe it lingers when you're with your children: You were late to the field trip? Again? Or maybe Debbie Downer has become a third wheel in your marriage: Every other wife makes her husband dinner and lets him play golf on the weekend. You'll be lucky if you're still married to this man six months from now.\n\nSounds like cruel and unusual punishment if you ask me.\n\nI'm intimately familiar with little Miss Debbie. Her voice has ebbed and flowed throughout my life. At different points in time, she has not-so-subtly suggested that I'm a terrible mother, wife, friend, sister, daughter, employee, boss, exerciser, pen pal, organizer, etc.\n\nOK, that last one is not true. I'm a fantastic organizer -- a real neat freak. And she knows it.\n\nAnyway, right now, my inner Debbie Downer loves to show up and shut me down when I'm on the tennis court.\n\nEvery. Time.\n\nWhen my opponent walks out onto the court, Debbie pipes up: Good luck beating that woman. She looks like a real tennis player -- unlike you. And she certainly doesn't have a muffin top hanging over her skirt.\n\nCause that's embarrassing.\n\nAnd when I make a mistake, she's just plain ugly: Nice one. It's a miracle the club lets you keep your membership. Even when I play well she's cruelly sarcastic: Oh, wow. Look at you playing tennis.\n\nI've been playing competitive tennis for six years and I've never been able to shut her up. She's just so quick. She starts insulting me before I even start playing. Pre-match, without fail, when my opponent politely asks, Would you like to back up to the baseline and warm up? Debbie Downer pipes up and says, No I'm not ready because I don't know how to play tennis.\n\nCharming. Nothing says I'm ready to win like I can't play.\n\nAll of this horrible self-talk rages in my head like a wrecking ball on steroids, preventing me from paying attention to the match, which I carved time out of my busy schedule to accommodate.\n\nSometimes the self-talk gets so loud and distracting that I can't remember the score of the match, which I'm supposed to call out before I serve.\n\nOpponent: What's the score?\n\nMe: Huh?\n\nOpponent: The score?\n\nMe: I have no idea.\n\nOpponent: Awesome.\n\nThis dynamic has brought a whole new meaning to the notion of not having your head in the game.\n\nAny of this sound familiar?\n\nWhen do you find your inner Debbie Downer being the meanest? Is it in a certain place: at work, in the carpool loop, at church? Or at a certain time: during your morning commute, while you're getting ready for date night, when you're exhausted? Or when you're with certain people: your exercise buddies, your boss, your sister-in-law? Awareness is half the battle.\n\nThe other half of the battle is choosing whether you listen to her or not.\n\nWhen our Debbie Downer is being the meanest of mean girls and attacking our tired, stressed-out souls, we don't turn a deaf ear. We don't tell her to shut the hell up.\n\nWe listen. We listen to the voice. We believe the voice. We trust the voice.\n\nI spent 20 years not only listening to the voice in my head, but kneeling at the altar of it. I hung onto her every word, believed every sentiment. I even trusted the voice. Eventually, I lived in fear of disappointing the voice.\n\nIn that sense, maybe there's some truth to the idea that only crazy people have voices in their heads. It's got to be pretty close to crazy to live in fear of letting down a person who doesn't even exist.\n\nWhile I haven't gotten my own Debbie Downer to completely shut up yet, I have managed to teach her some manners, to put her in her place. A few tips and tricks have helped tremendously; here are a few of them:\n\nRemember that you are not the voice in your head. The voice in your head is a dramatic interpretation of what's going on in your life--as told by your fragile ego. It's not you. It's a story: a story with a plot created in your mind, overdramatized by your ego and fueled by your high expectations.\n\nSet more realistic expectations. The reason your inner voice is attacking you is because you've set sky-high expectations for yourself. So when you inevitably fall short, she starts in, saying I told you so. The end result of having more realistic expectations will be a happier you. And a much quieter Debbie Downer.\n\nWhen you hear it, simply acknowledge it. When you hear the voice in your head adding toxic color commentary to whatever you're doing, pause for a second and in the most neutral, least judgmental tone you can muster--simply acknowledge it's happening. Not, Here we go again! Just, It's happening. If you're aware of the voice in your head, when you acknowledge that it's there, separate from you, then it can't control you.\n\nImagine the voice is a real person. Imagine a flesh-and-blood woman named Debbie saying the degrading things your inner Debbie Downer says to you: The Johnsons hosted you at their beach house a month ago and you still haven't written a thank-you note? Great job. You'd never tolerate someone talking to you that way.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's up to you to take control. It's up to you to acknowledge and admit you have a mean inner voice rattling around in your head every day. Nobody can solve this problem for you because nobody hears the voice except you.\n\nDeep down, you know that what it's saying isn't true. You're just having a hard time remembering it because the mean voice has been so vocal for so long. After hearing my own mean inner voice for 20 years and having heard thousands of mothers discuss their own Debbie Downers, there's one thing I know for sure: just because you can hear the voice, doesn't mean you have to listen.\n\nThere's a difference.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Katherine Wintsch's blog InAllHonesty.com.
As humans and Americans, we also innately desire things other people have, said Jessi Gold, an assistant professor and psychiatrist who primarily sees health care professionals and college students at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nTo be just a little bit glib about it, this season's hot item isn't a Birkin bag or Apple's latest toy, it's Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, said Gold.\n\nThe vaccine is limited in availability, and anything limited is psychologically appealing to us ― and culturally as well ― and that innately will make us jealous and want it, the psychiatrist said.\n\nWe know our turn is coming, but that doesn't mean we like waiting for it, Gold explained. We see images posted on Instagram of people getting the shot, and that only makes us want it more.

She already had recorded a string of hit songs and was starting to make her mark in film.\n\nFans of Aaliyah, the '90s R&B singer who died tragically at the age of 22 in a plane crash more than 17 years ago, flocked to Twitter Wednesday with one collective message: we miss you.\n\nThe reason for the outburst of love is due to the date — Jan. 16 would have been her 40th birthday.\n\nYou will always be an inspiration to me and I will always keep your memory alive.

The parts eventually went to Jessica Alba and Marvin Gaye's daughter Nona Gaye, respectively, after Aaliyah's death.\n\nShe was also known for her collaborations with Missy Elliot and, most notably, R. Kelly, who she secretly married in 1994 at the age of 15. At the time Kelly was 27.\n\nReps for Kelly have confirmed the union but denied that he knew his bride was underage at the time. This denial has come under scrutiny amid the mounting allegations of abuse against Kelly and footage featured in the controversial 2018 documentary Surviving R. Kelly. The film includes footage from 1994 in which Kelly openly admits he knows Aaliyah's age.\n\nIn one scene, Kelly can be heard saying, Right now I'm producing a very talented lady — a young lady. She's 14, Aaliyah. She's real street.\n\nTheir marriage was annulled not long after their wedding.\n\nAaliyah remains remembered for her songs, undeniable talent and as a woman who was poised for stardom but had her life taken too early.\n\nIf her fans are still posting tributes to her so many years after her death, it's pretty apparent many still think of her as one in a million.
Newly minted couple Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas have broached a key stage in any modern courtship: taking photos of each other for the 'gram.\n\nDespite vacationing around the world together in increasingly romantic locales, the two actors have yet to confirm they are dating, so it's on us pop culture sleuths to put the pieces together.\n\nJust last week, Affleck, 47, and de Armas, 31, were photographed enjoying a barefoot beachside stroll in Costa Rica, with the Oscar-winning director leaning in for a kiss at one point.\n\nAnd since he's so comfortable behind the camera, Affleck was also seen taking a series of photos of the Knives Out star as they took in the sunset.\n\nDe Armas clearly isn't too concerned with the rumors, because on Tuesday she shared the photos taken by Affleck on her own Instagram account with a sparkle and a heart emoji in the caption.\n\nIn one photo, the actor stares directly in the camera, while she appears out of focus frolicking on the beach in the five following pics.\n\nThe two were seen alone together on the walk with the actor taking a photo at the same angle, which is pretty convincing evidence Affleck was the man behind the camera.\n\nIn these new photos, De Armas is also wearing the same sheer brown dress that she was sporting with Affleck, so this wasn't some other beach excursion.\n\nWhile the Cuban actor kept it cryptic in her caption, her followers couldn't help but comment on Affleck's photo skills with some offering less than flattering reviews.\n\nBen Affleck sucks at focusing. Not me though, one fan wrote.\n\nOh, we know who took these pics, a different follower added. Another joked, These photos were taken by Batman.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAffleck and de Armas first met while filming Adrian Lyne's upcoming erotic thriller Deep Water, which filmed last year in New Orleans.\n\nThe pair reportedly had an instant connection and great chemistry right from the start on set, according to People, which seemingly developed into a full-blown romance.\n\nMonths after the film wrapped, they traveled around De Armas' native Cuba for a vacation, where she played tour guide and took him to all her favorite places before turning up the PDA days later in Costa Rica.\n\nAffleck is divorced from ex-wife Jennifer Garner with whom he shares three children ― Violet, 14, Seraphina, 11, and Samuel, 8. De Armas, meanwhile, was previously married to Spanish actor Marc Clotet, but the two divorced in 2013 after two years of marriage.\n\nNext stop for these two? Going Instagram official.
Fox & Friends featured a live audience on the show for the first time ever and decided to treat these special viewers to a snack.\n\nToward the last third of Fox News' morning talk show, hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Janice Dean passed out sandwiches and other food from Chick-fil-A, telling viewers they were celebrating the opening of new locations in New York City, where the show is filmed.\n\nBut Doocy shouted another potential reason into the camera:\n\nThe president had fast food at the White House the other day, today we've got Chick-fil-A.\n\nThe host, of course, was referring to the infamous fast-food banquet President Donald Trump threw to honor Clemson University's championship football team on Monday.\n\nIt's particularly interesting that the show chose to give out Chick-fil-A, as the fast-food chain has long been embroiled in controversy. For a refresher, in 2012, Chick-fil-A executive Dan Cathy ― now the chain's president ― proudly announced his opposition to same-sex marriage, saying: We are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, 'We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,' and I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to define what marriage is about.\n\nAdditionally, Chick-fil-A has a history of donating millions of dollars a year to anti-LGBTQ organizations via its WinShape nonprofit organization. Since this became public knowledge, many members and allies of the LGBTQ community have boycotted Chick-fil-A. As HuffPost's own Noah Michelson wrote in an op-ed last year, If you care about queer people ― or you yourself are queer ― you have absolutely no business eating at Chick-fil-A. Ever. It's really that straightforward.\n\nSure, some could argue that Fox wasn't doing this as a political stunt and that it was simply an effort to make the audience happy. But Twitter users found the whole episode comedic in its own right.\n\nAs some pointed out, the Fox News hosts appeared to channel Trump throwing paper towels at Puerto Rican people recovering from Hurricane Maria by hurtling sandwiches into the crowd of people sitting five feet in front of them.\n\n.@foxandfriends hosts are literally throwing Chick-fil-A sandwiches at their studio audience.

Hate crime charges have been filed against a Washington state man who authorities say taunted, groped and assaulted a married lesbian couple at a Seattle Seahawks game.\n\nAccording to the King County Prosecutor's Office, Jay Dee Harp III, 34, faces charges of second-degree assault, third-degree assault and malicious harassment. The latter of the three charges is the legal term for a hate crime in the state.\n\nState police tased and arrested the Tacoma man on Dec. 30, after he allegedly attacked two married women inside the CenturyLink Field stadium during the Seahawks home game against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nAccording to newly filed court documents HuffPost obtained, authorities allege a highly intoxicated Harp spent the majority of the football game making crude, vulgar comments toward the women.\n\nKing County Deputy Prosecutor Rhyan claimed Harp called one of the women a fucking dyke and said, Do you need a man in your life? In another instance, Harp was allegedly seen motioning towards his mid-section and thrusting his hands before asking the women if they, wanted some dick.\n\nThe video below posted to YouTube appears to show the alleged assault and may be upsetting to some readers.\n\nThings took a turn for the worse during the third quarter of the game when authorities say Harp physically assaulted one of the women.\n\nWhen the defendant returned from purchasing a beer, the defendant grabbed the victim's wife, unzipped her jacket, and grabbed her breast, Anderson wrote in court documents. When several bystanders intervened … the defendant fought them off and punched the other female victim in the face, causing a nose bleed, significant pain, and breaking her front tooth in half.\n\nA witness to the incident restrained Harp and held him until police arrived on the scene. The court documents allege Harp resisted arrest and punched one of the officers in the stomach before he was tased and taken into custody.\n\nIn a written statement included in court documents, one of the victims said:\n\nI have been an active member of the LGBT community for decades and fought for marriage equality as an adult. The man's chronic and repeated comments about our sexuality, based on my experience, suggest my sexual orientation may have motivated today's assault.\n\nAccording to Seattle's KIRO-TV, the woman who was punched underwent nose surgery on Monday.\n\nAuthorities jailed Harp for investigation of malicious harassment and felony assault. He was released the following day after posting a $25,000 bond. In light of the circumstances, prosecutors are now asking the court to raise that bond to $100,000.\n\nThe requested bail amount more appropriately takes into account the violent nature of the defendant's attack, Anderson wrote in court documents.\n\nWhile the defendant has no known criminal history, the defendant's willingness to sexually assault a female — a complete stranger — in a crowded sports stadium and then violently punch another female victim in the face demonstrates that he is a clear danger to the community, the prosecutor added.\n\nA spokesperson at the prosecutor's office told HuffPost that Harp is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 16. Court records do not list an attorney for him. HuffPost was unable to contact Harp on Thursday.\n\nSend David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

***\n\nI didn't sleep the night after my mom told me the news. She sat me down and looked very grave as she asked if I knew what a transexual was. I was only 12 years old and I didn't. In 1972 I doubt anyone in my Midwestern suburban neighborhood would have. I worried it might have something to do with me preferring Barbies and Easy Bake Ovens over Hot Wheels racing cars or baseball gloves. Was I going to have an operation? I didn't like having my tonsils out and this seemed a lot worse. But I soon realized she was referring to my sister, who was 18 and what people referred to as a tomboy.\n\nI worshipped my big sister. We both loved bringing home stray animals and filling our home with those misfit pets, and she never tired of trying to teach me to be handy with tools no matter how hopeless I was. Even though she often had dark, intense moods, I knew I could always charm my way to her tender side.\n\nWhen our mother mentioned the surgeries my sister was planning, I began to feel overwhelmed. What exactly were these operations? I had so many questions but didn't dare ask them. Those parts of the body weren't something I was eager to talk about with my mother.\n\nShe has done a lot of research and is convinced this is the issue she has struggled with her entire life, she told me.\n\nWith her commanding voice, bleach-blonde hair, midi-skirts and fringe vests, my widowed mom was a mix of Dinah Shore and Bea Arthur.\n\nWe are going to respect and support her wishes, she said firmly. This is a very brave thing she is doing. She just wants to be happy.\n\nI wanted my sister to be happy too, but as I stared at my bedroom ceiling that night, I wished I knew how I was supposed to help.\n\n***\n\nDo you want orange or grape juice? my mom called out cheerfully as she dropped two frosted brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts into the toaster the next morning.\n\nMy sister had already graduated from high school and as I sat down at our kitchen table, I was relieved she'd slept in late that day. I was planning my escape to the bus stop before any awkward encounter with her when I heard the creak of the stairs. My stomach knotted as she appeared at the doorway and sleepily shuffled past me. She looked exactly the same. I had thought the hormones my mom said she started taking might instantly transform her.\n\nGood morning... I stuttered. I didn't know if I was supposed to use the girl name I had always known her by or her new boy name, and realized I couldn't even remember what her new boy name was.\n\nBut my sister just grunted at me grouchily like she did every morning before her first cup of coffee.\n\nYou're going to be late, Mom reminded me.\n\nI felt like I was in the Bewitched episode where Samantha acted like everything was normal even though Ben Franklin was lounging on the sofa.\n\nCourtesy of Keith Hoffman The author with his big sister in 1965, several years before his sister came out as transgender\n\nAt my Catholic elementary school, I kept to myself and could barely focus on my lessons. I wanted to try to find out more information from the school library but realized that would be impossible. What could I possibly say? Hi, I would like some books on the great battles of the American Civil War, and could you toss in anything you have on transsexualism?\n\nSince there was no episode of The Brady Bunch where Jan feels like she was assigned the wrong gender at birth, I realized I pretty much had to figure out this hybrid brother/sister thing all by myself. My mom's guidelines were clear: we will accept this, but we will not talk about it — not even with each other. That first conversation I had with her was also our last.\n\nOnly a few days later, I arrived home from school and was stunned by my sister's new buzz cut. Soon after, I noticed a slight mustache and some facial scruff. She still wore her usual jeans and t-shirt, but her short frame began to noticeably bulk-up. Soon, even her voice was changing. She talked like my sister but lower and deeper. And she never used this new voice to talk about the past. Then we began calling my sister he, which was easier than I ever would have guessed. It was soon like my big sister had never existed.\n\nBut no one outside our house understood the new rules. The neighbors had tolerated mom mowing our front lawn in her lime green bikini, but the girl-next-door turning into the boy-next-door was harder to ignore. I tried to convince myself that everyone thought my sister was just trying out a new summer cut with sideburns. I soon realized I was fooling myself when my best friend Cindy began making snide remarks about my weird sister who thought she was a man. I was embarrassed and ashamed but had no way to defend myself. If I told Cindy the truth, she would tell her mom and her mom would tell everybody. It was safer to just stop being Cindy's friend.\n\nOur conservative, Catholic relatives already thought my mom had sinned when she attended the touring production of Hair with its infamous nude scene. But allowing her daughter to do that to her body and be okay with it was absolutely unforgivable. If I wanted to play with my cousins, I had to be dropped off and picked up in our driveway like a kid shuttled between divorced parents. Many, like my grandmother, refused to speak to my new brother. I could feel something new emanating from every single person who knew or suspected what was happening in my family. It wasn't just judgment ― there was emotion behind it. It was disgust.\n\nMy brother left home a few months later. He told me those operations he needed were done on the West Coast, but I wondered if he was also aching to get far away. He never wavered in his conviction that this was the right thing to do, but he'd been completely ostracized by everyone except a very few of us. As he drove off, even I felt a wave of guilty relief. Now maybe everything could go back to normal.\n\nMy mom moved us to a new school district before the year was out.\n\n***\n\nFive years after his surgeries, my brother came home. I felt jealous when he first stepped out of his pick-up in his trucker's hat and t-shirt. Even though I'd hit puberty, I was not nearly as masculine as the man standing before me.\n\nHe restarted his life and eventually met a conservative, religious widow who he married.\n\nThat's great, I said to my mom on the phone when she told me. By then I had moved to New York City and surprised no one when I came out as gay. Is his wife cool about his past?\n\nMy mom sounded offended by my question. Why would she need to know about that? It would only cause problems.\n\nI was used to my family's skill at hiding the truth, but this took it to a new level. When my brother's new wife asked my mom to see pictures of him as a child, she told her they had all burned in a fire. Over the next seven years, I often wondered what mix of naiveté and denial kept their marriage going, but I wasn't going to ask my brother. Although we shared the bond of being outsiders, we never talked about him being transgender ― even with each other.\n\nIt was a much different time and a much different world then. As difficult and dangerous as it can still be for transgender people to come out, it was virtually unheard of ― and unthinkable ― at that time. So many trans people were not able to live the lives they wanted to live, and those who did often found themselves dealing with secrecy or shame or both.\n\nCourtesy of Keith Hoffman The most mod mom on the block, the author notes of his mother in this photo from the mid-1960's.\n\nHis marriage inevitably ended in disaster. His wife was furious their relationship was founded on a massive lie. And my brother's shame and guilt eventually led to a suicide attempt.\n\nTwenty-five years have passed since then. My brother got needed support from groups and therapists that became increasingly available to trans people, and he happily remarried a woman who knew his story from their first date. Now he lives a peaceful small-town life under the radar while I live out loud and openly as a married gay man.\n\nBut whenever I wanted to tell the truth about my family, I felt I was betraying the sacred rule passed down from our mom: accept but don't talk about it. Although we scattered her ashes in 2009, speaking about this part of our past still felt disloyal. The last thing I wanted was to reopen old wounds. But wasn't this my story, too? Didn't I have the right to speak about it?\n\n***\n\nIt's a good story, my brother said when I called him recently to let him know I was writing about our lives.\n\nIt's not easy to tell, I replied.\n\nIt wasn't easy to live.\n\nI was relieved and grateful he didn't try to stop me. I knew this wasn't exactly fun for him. My brother was never a trailblazer by choice. He became a pioneer out of necessity. Transitioning saved his life. And my life was forever changed because of it.\n\nHe was never able to teach me to be the handyman he is, although he impatiently tried, rolling his eyes when I handed him pliers after he asked for a socket wrench. But our relationship taught me something more important — how to not get hung up on the external and to be able to recognize the humanity in others. When I see how much time the world wastes demonizing the other and causing unnecessary strife and pain, I know now is not the time to be timid. I need the same courage to take the kind of action that he and my mom showed me all those years ago.\n\nWhen my brother remarried, my husband and I danced at his backyard reception with him and his wife. It was a bright spring day and we were surrounded by supportive relatives. My grandmother died without ever speaking to my brother again. Others in the family took a few decades, but finally came around and now adore the man they've come to know. Their kids and grandkids weaved through us as we danced, playing a game of tag, unaware that the groom had once been thought of as perverse and disgusting by many of the people around them. I marveled at this wholesome family scene. This was all my brother had ever wanted.\n\nKeith Hoffman has written for such television series as The Secret World of Alex Mack, Sister Sister and the popular Nickelodeon cartoon Doug.

HOWELL, N.J. (AP) — A man who set off fireworks near a movie theater as his friend made a marriage proposal created panic among moviegoers who mistook the fireworks for gunshots, leading to 911 calls and an evacuation, authorities said.\n\nHowell Township police responded to the Xscape Theater around 6 p.m. Wednesday and soon learned the theater manager had confronted a man who had lighted fireworks outside another business near the theater, authorities said.\n\nThe remnants of the fireworks were located, and it was determined that no shots had been fired.\n\nA 23-year-old Lakewood man told police he had set off the fireworks as part of his friend's marriage proposal at the other business.\n\nWhile noting there was no intent to cause panic at the theater, a post on the Howell police Facebook page stated that obviously this was a very poor decision rather than an overt act.\n\nThe Lakewood man was charged with a fireworks infraction and disorderly conduct.\n\nNo injuries were reported.
Gavin Rossdale discussed his much-publicized divorce from Gwen Stefani in a recent interview, saying it was the opposite of what he wanted and that divorce is one of the hardest, most painful things to go through. He also lamented the loss of her unconditional love for him. These sentiments may come as a surprise to people given that Gavin had a three-year affair with the family's nanny, which is what led to their divorce. It raises the question, why would someone have these regrets so long after the indiscretions that tore his marriage apart? Perhaps it's the age-old saying that you don't know what you have until it's gone. The truth is, many times people may not value their partner until they are separated and can finally recognize all the love they had, which is now lost.\n\nMarriage is a slippery slope. There are so many moments in any given day during which your partner might do something to irritate you, or you them. It can be something small, like forgetting to take out the garbage or pay the bills, even after being reminded again and again. Or it can be something bigger, like refusing overtures toward sex, for whatever reason, but it might serve to hit one of you right in the ego, conjuring up hurt and anger. One thing to keep in mind is that whatever it is that your partner is doing to upset you, it is generally not intentional. Your spouse is not out to hurt you. More than anything, they are probably trying to please you as best they can, but their own needs get in the way. Because of that, in your eyes you wind up focusing on what went wrong and overlook what they did right which keeps them in the minus column. In fact, very often there may be several plus moments in any given day, things that are done with caring but come to be expected and are overlooked and taken for granted, and as a result go unmentioned and unappreciated. A hot cup of coffee, a text to check in and see how you are, or a hello kiss can oftentimes get overshadowed by the tension of seeing what they're not doing as opposed to what they are doing.\n\nA study out of The University of Georgia Center For Family Research found that the number one indicator of a happy marriage is feeling valued and appreciated by your spouse. When someone's efforts to please go unnoticed or are eclipsed by what has not been done, that person might feel taken advantage of and unimportant. One easy step toward happy-proofing your marriage is to take inventory of the good and pay attention to the things your partner does do for you, and to make sure to acknowledge them with a thank you. Although they might let you down and disappoint you at times, balance it by keeping in mind all the times they are there for you. Also reflect on how treasured you are feeling for the things that you do. If you are feeling shortchanged in being valued, let your partner know that a thank you would go a long way.\n\nThis can help you stay on the tracks of gratitude and appreciation so that you keep your marriage train from derailing. Sadly, sometimes this doesn't happen until it's too late, which seems to be the case with Gavin and Gwen.\n\nPlease tune in to the Doctor on Call radio hour on HealthyLife.net every Tuesday at 2 PM EST, 11 AM PST.

It took a three-hour road trip, an overnight hotel stay and an untold number of sleepless nights, but she did it: On Jan. 5, Terri Lynn received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine in northern Florida.\n\nI was just floating after I got it, the 65-year-old Naples resident told HuffPost.\n\nI feel empowered that I did something, she continued. I didn't realize it until afterwards, but I'm just so proud.\n\nLike many of her friends and family, Lynn was eager for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and to be eligible for the shot in her arm. After about nine months and more than 300,000 deaths in the U.S., the first batches were finally released in January — light at the end of a monthslong tunnel. All of the country's 50 states have designed their own distribution plans, some of which have gone more smoothly than others.\n\nFor Lynn, information about the vaccine had been spotty, but after setting up multiple Google alerts and all but living online, she learned that Publix grocery stores were going to be offering the vaccine in three Florida counties — all of which were more than a three-hour drive from her Naples home.\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes, I was trembling, she said of the moment, sometime around 4 a.m., she saw she could sign up for a vaccine dose. After successfully booking her own appointment online, she rushed to book another for her husband, Mark.\n\nI didn't realize how frantic I was going to be about it. It was like winning the lottery — even better, she said.\n\nWhat the COVID-19 vaccine physically feels like\n\nSo far, most people who've received the vaccine report mild to moderate side effects. Injection-site pain, headaches and fever are some of the most common symptoms, which experts say are typical for any type of routine inoculation.\n\nIn general, side effects like these are an expected immune response of the body. Candidates for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials experienced stronger side effects after their second dose compared to their first.\n\nIn some of the studies from Moderna, about one-third of people had a fever after the second dose, and they didn't after the first, Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious disease epidemiologist at Stanford University, previously told HuffPost. We know less about the potential long-term side effects of the vaccine ― there don't seem to be any, but we'll learn more in the months to come.\n\nI was just floating after I got it. - Terri Lynn\n\nLynn said she was happy to feel the little bit of tenderness in her arm because it meant the vaccine was in her body.\n\nFor Andrew Geller, a 37-year-old dentist in Bronxville, New York, his first vaccine dose came with more than a little tenderness. I had a pretty intense reaction about 20 hours after I received the vaccine, he told HuffPost.\n\nGeller said he experienced flu-like symptoms, but the incident isn't derailing his will to get a second dose. He thinks it's important to share stories like his, even though the majority of people who get the vaccine will show little to no side effects.\n\nYou have to be honest with patients, he said, explaining that doing so helps mitigate fear. If they are aware and then they have the symptoms, it gets rid of the panic. I had 24 hours of flu-like symptoms and then it went away and that's OK. It's a possibility and you don't panic.\n\nRuth Schwartz, a 99-year-old resident at Atria Senior Living home in New York City, said she feels very, very privileged, to have received the vaccine, and shared that the actual inoculation was painless.\n\nEverything went well and I felt fine after, and still do, she said. Now that I have the vaccine I feel much better about [my situation]. I feel that I'm not existing but, hopefully, will be able to live.\n\nCourtesy of Atria Senior Living Ruth Schwartz, a 99-year-old resident at Atria Senior Living home in New York City, was excited to get the vaccine and said she had minimal side effects.\n\nOther feelings to expect after getting the immunizations\n\nOf course, the feelings attached to getting the vaccine are not just physical; many people report experiences of emotional release and relief.\n\nMelinda Olsen, a licensed marriage and family therapist in San Jose, California, said when she tells patients she's vaccinated, they respond with a mix of joy and playful jealousy.\n\nAfter I got the shot I started to tear up; it felt like there was finally some hope after a long 10 months of personal difficulty and collective trauma due to the pandemic, the 37-year-old told HuffPost.\n\nOlsen said she and other therapists have experienced a new type of challenge in their professional lives during the pandemic. When I'm holding other people's traumas, it's usually removed. But I think it's a whole other thing to hold somebody's trauma in real time while you yourself are experiencing that same kind of trauma, she said.\n\nAs a working mom with a 3-year-old at home, Olsen has had to shake up her lifestyle to make things work — a disruption that mirrors the lives of many of her patients. Sharing this trauma is surreal and very different, but I guess it's also connecting, she said.\n\nAfter I got the shot I started to tear up; it felt like there was finally some hope after a long 10 months of personal difficulty and collective trauma due to the pandemic. - Melinda Olsen\n\nLynn Zakeri, a licensed clinical social worker in Skokie, Illinois, has also been meeting with clients throughout the pandemic. It's very relieving — I like that everyone I know is going to feel the way I do, she said.\n\nShe added she was so emotional in taking the shot, I felt giddy and I feel so lucky and privileged to get it.\n\nJean Gilsinian, a 91-year-old resident of the Christian Health Care Center in New Jersey, is keen on getting back to the things she loves to do.\n\nI want to be able to go and enjoy my games again, sing again, dance again, do it all again. I want to be able to do again, she said.\n\nGilsinian said she's most looking forward to freedom, and it's so close she can almost taste it. Receiving the vaccine didn't just supply her with a powerful COVID-fighting agent, but a dose of faith, too. I have hope, Gilsinian said. I know I did the right thing.\n\nSimilarly, 61-year-old Debbie Brilliant, a program instructor at an Atria Senior Living home, said she feels amazing and hopeful after her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. As a caretaker who has visited Atria's residents throughout the pandemic, Brilliant was able to participate in her company's vaccine dispersal, which was like a celebration. Brilliant and the seniors for whom she works were greeted with balloons, lively music and snacks that she said felt right for the occasion.\n\nThis is really a historical moment — whoever thought that anything like this would happen and that we were at the top of the list to be able to get this vaccine and get on with life as we knew it? she wondered in disbelief. Even with all the bad, I just feel that life is going to be so much sweeter when this is all behind us. I think we're going to have so much more appreciation for life and for each other.\n\nSchwartz said she's been having a difficult time since the pandemic's onset; the activities she's so enjoyed in her residence at Atria, like going to operas, lectures and museums, have been on a long pause, and she hasn't been able to spend time with her family.
Victoria Kelly's poetry collection When the Men Go Off to War received widespread critical acclaim since being published in September 2015 by the Naval Institute Press. The Military Times hailed it for her themes of departure, absence and homecoming [which] are universal in place, and esteemed poet Dick Allen called it Meticulously crafted [and] highly readable ... one of the finest first collections I've read in the last decade.\n\nVictoria holds degrees from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Harvard University and Trinity College in Dublin, where she was a U.S. Mitchell Scholar. Her fiction and poetry have appeared in the anthologies Best American Poetry 2013 and Contemporary American Poetry, as well as Alaska Quarterly Review, Southwest Review, Prairie Schooner and North American Review. Her debut novel Mrs. Houdini, about the passionate marriage of Bess and Harry Houdini, will be published by Atria Books in March. A military spouse, she lives in Virginia with her husband and daughters.\n\nAs part of Words After War's January Book Club, Victoria answers a few questions from Matt Gallagher, author of the forthcoming novel Youngblood.\n\n***\n\n1) What was the first poem in When the Men Go Off to War that you remember writing a draft of? Care to share what was going on in your life at that time, or what maybe led you to that draft?\n\nAlmost was the first poem I had written in over ten years. I used to write a lot of poetry, but in college, after churning out some pretty bland ones, I took a break; I think I realized I had too little to write about at the time. When my husband deployed in 2011, I was a new bride with my whole life ahead of me, but I was lonely and bored. I was teaching at a university but was off for the summer; I was working on a novel that seemed to have dead-ended. I took a poetry class at a local writing center because I wanted to find another creative outlet. I still remember sitting on my balcony on a very hot day, looking at the speck of ocean in the distance, and thinking about what it would have been like to have chosen a different, safer life, one that took me back to the small town in New Jersey where I grew up. The life I had almost lived. By the end of writing it, I realized that the life I really wanted was the one I already had.\n\n2) There's a recurring tension to your narrator, a grappling with and for the military culture she's married into. This is perhaps most directly confronted in the poem Lessons - you can read Chaucer but not the bars/on a uniform and you never expected the loneliness, the certainty/of homelessness. What struck me about that tension is that it evolves and devolves through the course of the collection, there's nothing linear about it. Why is that?\n\nMost people in my daily life, until this book was published, didn't know that I went to college at Harvard. Once, someone who knew my background asked me how it felt to have given up that life for the military. My time at Harvard was a magical four years, but being a part of a military community feels much closer to the life I had before college, when I was going to public school in a small town. When I visit my college friends now, who are doctors and lawyers and businesswomen in big cities, I see how our daily lives have diverged. The military community, to me, feels very contained; bases have moved to largely rural areas, and the conflicts being fought abroad aren't really a part of most people's everyday lives. I felt like it was important to address the discrepancy between these two very different stages of my life. There isn't a linearity to the tension because it is more of an observation; I don't necessarily think it's something that has to be resolved in the story arc. I do feel like there should be greater public attention paid to what service members are doing, but at the same time, many of the people I know who are fighting do it so that those in civilian life don't have to be preoccupied with war; they don't have to live fearfully every day. My husband likes to quote John Adams: I must study Politics and War that my sons may have liberty to study Mathematics and Philosophy.\n\n3) When the Men Go Off to War is structured into three different sections: Departure, Absence and Homecoming. The titles feed into both the macro themes of the sections, and on a micro level, the connective tissue from poem to poem. Was this structure planned, or something that you decided on as you were compiling your various works into the collection?\n\nI wrote this book initially without a structure in mind, because for a long time I really considered each poem individually, without thinking of one as an extension of another. Each poem draws on a single event, experience or emotion I have had as a pilot's spouse. It was only after the Naval Institute Press wanted to publish the collection that I realized there was an obvious story arc there that I hadn't drawn out. A lot is said out there in movies and literature about the difficulty of returning to civilian life after war, and the stress it can put on a marriage. A story that is less often told (and one I know to be common among military families) is how sometimes the anticipation of war and separation can be just as traumatic. Quite often, the greatest struggles happen before the deployment even begins.\n\n4) Place and memory play such central roles in When the Men Go Off to War. A good example of this is the poem Prayers of an American Wife (one of my favorites, and also the title of your chapbook that preceded this collection) - I would dream back that too-bright place. That idea of dreaming back was something I found a lot of in your poems, but in a way that suggested immediacy and activeness over longing for the past or simple nostalgia. How did you convey that dichotomy, and why was it important to do so?\n\nI met my husband when I was still a teenager; our relationship has been full of great adventures, of growing up together. Nostalgia influences a lot of my work; I think the act of looking back at the past often turns something mundane into something beautiful. Everything is shinier in memory, and the luster of youth makes things magical. But I didn't want to write about things that had happened, especially pretty things; I thought it was important to write about the grittiness of the now. Sometimes people forget that being in the military today can be very dangerous; many we have known have died too young. It is sobering. But connecting my current life to the past let me combine magic and realism. In Prayers of an American Wife, for example, I look back on a time when I first felt truly alone--twenty years old, in a tiny village in Chile--and compare it with the loneliness of being at home during a deployment. Suddenly that little village on the other side of the world became enchanting, almost unreal.\n\n5) What are some of the books and poetry collections that have most influenced you?\n\nThe hardest question of all! I tend to love certain authors' styles of writing and have a hard time picking singular works. Some of the (many) poets who have inspired me are: Dick Allen, Jehanne Dubrow, Jack Gilbert, Dorianne Laux, David Lehman, W.S. Merwin, Faith Shearin, Sharon Olds. Some of the (many) fiction writers who have inspired me are: Geraldine Brooks, Willa Cather, Jennifer Haigh, Maile Meloy, Keija Parssinen, James Salter, Elizabeth Strout, Richard Yates. And I have to add, with great sincerity, that the Book Club selections by Words After War are stunningly beautiful and intelligent; I had read almost all of the 2015 picks long before my book was selected.\n\n6) You have a novel coming out in March from Atria Books (whoop, whoop!) called Mrs. Houdini - does your poetry inform your prose, or vice versa? Updike famously had separate writing rooms for his fiction and nonfiction writing - do you find different spaces and environments more helpful depending on the form you're working in?\n\nI always considered myself a fiction writer and a poetry reader until my husband's deployment inspired me to write When the Men Go Off to War. I will say that this collection was written in great humility because when I began it, I never intended to publish it; it began as a kind of a literary exercise. Now, I feel blessed that I can consider myself both a novelist and poet. For me, physical space doesn't inspire different genres. It is really about the idea. Some ideas are more suited to poetry while I know others would make better novels, or short stories. I knew immediately when I started thinking about Bess Houdini that I had to write a novel about her search to communicate with her dead husband's spirit. But while When the Men Go Off to War also tells a story--of a marriage, tested by war, that ultimately finds redemption--I found it easier to write that story in verse form.\n\n***\n\nWords After War is a nonprofit literary organization with a mission to bring veterans and civilians together to examine war and conflict through the lens of literature.\n\nFollow Words After War on Twitter @WordsAfterWar\n\nFollow Victoria Kelly on Twitter @VKellyBooks\n\nFollow Matt Gallagher on Twitter @MattGallagher0
The markets sank again on Thursday amid fears over the COVID-19 coronavirus infection rapidly spreading around the world.\n\nBut on TV, the late-night hosts were fighting fear with comedy.\n\nNBC's Seth Meyers lamented that the nation's health and safety were now in the hands of President Donald Trump... or, as he put it, a mentally incontinent game show host who's incapable of thinking of anything other than his own self-interest.\n\nMeyers ripped into Trump for saying that in theory the virus will miraculously go away in spring as the weather warms up.\n\nNo one ever says 'in theory' followed by the word 'miraculously.' That just proves how bad your theory is, he said, then went into his Trump impersonation: In theory, she'll catch me having an affair, and it will miraculously make our marriage stronger.\n\nOn the Late Show, definitely not panicking host Stephen Colbert broke out his surgical gloves. Then asked for someone to burn them... and then burn the person who burned them.\n\nAnd later in the segment, he broke out his plague bell:\n\nTONIGHT: Wall Street is panicking over the Coronavirus. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/c0KhcdoKr0 — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 28, 2020\n\nColbert wasn't alone with the protective gear.\n\nTrevor Noah on The Daily Show had his own surgical mask as his on-screen graphic asked: 'Is this how we die?'\n\nBut Noah mockingly praised the virus for its stance on equality.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you are in the world, from China and Spain to Saudi Arabia and Japan, the coronavirus is going after everybody, which is really scary, he said. And also really woke.\n\nHe cracked that the virus is more diverse than the Oscars: Everyone gets a chance.\n\nJimmy Kimmel cracked that the stock market is down and the coronavirus is up; this planet is going to Purell in handbasket.\n\nThen, he ripped Trump for a move two years ago that's making it harder to fight the virus today.\n\nThis is a funny joke, too: Back in May of 2018, to save money the Trump administration disbanded the U.S. pandemic response team, he said. Although to be fair who could've ever seen something like that coming in handy?\n\nAnd back on the Late Show, Colbert's team created a mock coronavirus PSA... as might be envisioned by Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of Trump's task force on the situation:
LONDON (AP) — Ireland's prime minster issued a formal state apology Wednesday to the thousands of unmarried women and their children who endured pain, shame and stigma at church-run institutions, saying his government was determined to start righting the country's wrongs.\n\nPrime Minister Micheal Martin's apology came a day after the final report of an inquiry said 9,000 children died in 18 mother-and-baby homes — which housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage — during the 20th century. The inquiry was part of a process of reckoning in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Ireland, where church-run institutions were often tied to a history of abuse.\n\nMartin said Ireland must acknowledge the scandal as part of its national history and show our deep remorse. He apologized on behalf of his government for the profound and generational wrong visited upon mothers and their babies who ended up in the institutions.\n\nThey should not have been there, he said in Ireland's parliament. The state failed you, mothers and children in these homes.\n\nMartin said it was deeply distressing that authorities at the time knew about the very high mortality rate at the homes but did not appear to have intervened. The report said 15% of all children in the homes died from disease and infections like stomach flu, almost double the nationwide infant mortality rate.\n\nMartin added: We must learn the lesson that institutionalization creates power structures and abuses of power, and must never again be an option for our country in any circumstance.\n\nChurch-run homes in Ireland housed orphans, unmarried pregnant women and their babies for most of the 20th century. The mothers were abandoned by their families and hidden away out of shame, and many of the children were separated from their mothers for adoption.\n\nThe institutions came under intense scrutiny after historian Catherine Corless in 2014 tracked down the death certificates for nearly 800 children who died at a mother-and-baby home in western Ireland — but could only find a burial record for one child.\n\nInvestigators later found a mass grave containing remains of babies and young children in an underground sewage structure on the grounds of the home, which was run by an order of Catholic nuns and closed in 1961.\n\nThe commission of inquiry said about 56,000 unmarried mothers and about 57,000 children had lived in the homes it investigated. Most were admitted in the 1960s and early 1970s.
The hotel restaurant shouldn't always be a last resort. In some cases--like these--it deserves to be first choice.\n\nHotel restaurants can get snubbed but oftentimes, they totally shouldn't be. That would be a horrible mistake and would mean skipping out on an experience like Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at InterContinental Bordeaux. Sometimes traveling means going downstairs.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Map Happy.\n\nHotels can often do so much more than restaurants than can be done in other circumstances: They have the resources to recruit the best chefs (sommeliers, too!) and then give them ample room to be creative for a dazzling display of gastronomy.\n\nThese are several hotel restaurants that make me want to book a ticket and a table all at the same time since I haven't had a chance to experience it all. I figure I can worry about the wallet later.\n\nAl Mahara at the Burj Al Arab\n\nFloor to ceiling windows? Try floor-to-ceiling aquarium. Though\n\nlooks subterranean it actually is located on the ground floor on one of the most luxurious hotels in the world, the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. Apropos for a place set amid aquariums, seafood is the specialty. Not a terrible idea to start at the top of Burj Al Arab--at the observation deck--and work my way down to dinner at Al Mahara.\n\nAqua at The Ritz-Carlton, Wolfsburg\n\n, a Zen space, and the hotel's setting are striking in Wolfsberg, Germany,and I can only think to best describe it all as industrial-luxe. (When it's a Ritz-Carlton across from an auto plant, that's a term that'll get conjured up, I suppose.) Chef de Cuisine Sven Elverfeld is behind the restaurant, which yes, has three Michelin stars, and he delivers plates that look almost too perfect to eat. But that's not the point.\n\nDinner by Heston Blumenthal at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London\n\nFor anyone that has the notion that British cuisine doesn't have much to offer on the world stage, point them to\n\n. Blumenthal, of course, is best known for The Fat Duck, a three-star Michelin restaurant located in Berkshire, England. The chef traces British history with his menu, dating items to their origin, like Savoury Porridge (c.1660). The setting is nothing antiquated, though; it's sleek but inviting.\n\nEpicure at Le Bristol Hotel\n\nBecause some like it haute. If I'm going to go that route when visiting Paris (and where else better to?) I might as well go all out or go home. And I've pinpointed Epicure, with its three Michelin stars and chef Eric Fréchon at the helm, as the place to do it. Fréchon is able to give a slight spin on the most ordinary of dishes: stuffed macaroni with artichokes, black truffle, duck foie gras and Parmesan cheese. It just can't be bad.\n\nEl Motel at the Hotel Emporda\n\nIf I could have redirected my friends to Dalí's Catalonian hometown of Figueres for a few hours.\n\nlooks beautiful but not at all presumptuous, and while the website leaves pretty much everything to the imagination, they offer a seasonal, rotating menu of modern European and Spanish dishes, with a tasting menu that apparently can be had for about €40 (with an extra €10 for wine pairings).\n\nNobu Las Vegas at Caesars Palace\n\nI've never been to Nobu, a name synonymous for best sushi ever on this side of the world, and at this point I want to have my first Nobu experience in a place where glam\n\n. That has to be Caesars Palace Las Vegas. And for a full immersion experience there's a\n\nsituated right within Caesars Palace, too.\n\nSiete Fuegos at the Vines Resort & Spa\n\nIf you've seen the Netflix-original series Chef's Table then its hard to forget the nature-loving and free-loving chef behind this place: Argentine Francis Mallmann. (I couldn't not include Argentina!)\n\nMendoza is one of Mallmann's places in the world and Siete Fuegos at the Vines Resort & Spa location is his latest venture. It involves lots of rustic, delicious food (and lots of meat, of course) cooked slowly over crackling, open fires right nearby. This is the Maillard technique in its full glory.\n\nWolfgang Puck at Hotel Bel Air\n\nA golden chef who got his restaurateur start in the Golden State: it's a perfect marriage. The celebrity chef might be big but when\n\nat the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles opened after the hotel's renovation in 2011, it seems he's shown he's deserving of all that fame. The dishes, which fall under California cuisine with Mediterranean influences, looks so fresh, and the setting so stylish yet comfortable. Seems apropros.\n\nLung King Heen at Four Seasons Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong is hotel-centric as it gets when it comes to fine dining. (The Peninsula Hong Kong is most well known for its coveted afternoon tea.)\n\nwas the first Cantonese restaurant in the world to be awarded three Michelin stars in 2009. But if Cantonese isn't what you're feeling, French restaurant and fellow Michelin-starred restaurant Caprice is located in the same building.\n\nKarina Martinez-Carter is an editor-at-large at Map Happy.

For BRIDES, by Elizabeth Mitchell.\n\nGetty Images\n\nNew year, new marriage. Well, sort of. Whether you just got hitched in 2016 or are coming up on your 10-year anniversary, it's never too early (or too late) to start working on your relationship and building toward a healthier, happier future together. But exactly what goals should you set, and more importantly, how in the world will you actually get yourselves to stick to them? That, couples, is the question.\n\nAccording to research from the Journal of Clinical Psychology, approximately 8 percent (yep you read that right) of Americans actually make good on their New Year's resolutions, which, admittedly, doesn't look so promising. The biggest problem, however, is the goals themselves. Instead of thinking big (i.e. we'll do spinning together five times a week), in reality it's best to start small (i.e. we'll do one spinning class a week) and work your way up from there.\n\nYou'll also want to get much more specific with your resolutions, as opposed to keeping them very vague and general. For example, don't just vow to be more affectionate in 2017; find measurable ways you can achieve this goal, like touching each other every time you watch TV, and make that your New Year's mission. See, easy right? And definitely not nearly as overwhelming as just trying to get in more physical touch.\n\nFrom learning his love language to playing the appreciation game, we've put together 18 New Year's marriage resolutions to get the love flowing and the bonds growing in 2017. Remember: you can tailor any and all of these to make them reachable and achievable for your own relationship.\n\nSee More: The 50 Most Beautiful Wedding Cakes Ever\n\n1. Plan a weekly (or bi-weekly) date night.\n\nEven if it's at home once in awhile, commit to a weekly (or bi-weekly) date night to reconnect and keep the romance alive in your relationship, suggests psychologist and relationship expert Paulette Kouffman Sherman, author of Dating from the Inside Out.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2. Practice more positive talk.\n\nVow to say five positive things for every negative remark toward your spouse, recommends Sherman. Not only will this help nip the negativity in the bud, but it will also build both of you up and encourage you to focus on the good in each other — as opposed to dwelling on the not so good.\n\nGetty Images\n\n3. Play the appreciation game.\n\nEvery evening at dinner, practice telling your partner one thing you appreciate about him and have him do the same for you. It can be something specific like how he helped you solve a dilemma that day or more general like the fact that he works his booty off to support you and the fam! Switch it up nightly, and let the love flow.\n\nSee More: The Biggest Fall Wedding Dress Trends from Bridal Fashion Week\n\nGetty Images\n\n4. Actively seduce each other.\n\nAnd vow to make it a priority at least once a month (if not more), advises NY Times Bestselling author of 101 Nights of Great Sex, Laura Corn.\n\nDream up something unique to do together in the bedroom, make a plan at least a week out and let your partner know something special is coming. Drop hints along the way (sexting works well!) until the big, unforgettable night. The elements of surprise and anticipation that this helps create are critical to a lasting, powerful sexual relationship.\n\nGetty Images\n\n5. Fight fair.\n\nAccording to marriage and family therapist Alicia Taverner, LMFT, owner of Rancho Counseling, the best New Year's resolution for couples is to fight fair.\n\nThis means refraining from things like name calling, criticism, attacking personality or character traits and bringing up past issues into a current fight. You want to fight about the topic at hand and discuss it until you feel there is resolution or an agreement to disagree.\n\nHere's how she recommends structuring the gripe: I'm upset/angry/sad about ____. In the future I'd like it if you could ____.\n\nGetty Images\n\n6. Touch each other every time you watch TV.\n\nOne thing Crystal Rice, owner of Insieme Consulting, finds that couples in trouble have stopped being affectionate in non-sexual ways. So vow to do better!\n\nBy simply sitting next to your partner on the couch, you increase the probability of affection, a commodity often seen far too little in long-term relationships, she says.\n\nSee More: The 50 Best Places to Get Married in America\n\nGetty Images\n\n7. Stop lying about the little things.\n\nLike looking good in a sweater that's gotten too small! Yep, you heard us right.\n\nWhen we lie about the little things, it gets easier and easier to lie about the bigger stuff, explains Rice. And then one day you wake up and realize you've been lying about feelings or thoughts or concerns that should have been brought to light many months or years earlier. You don't have to be a rat about it. You can say, 'I like you better in the blue sweater.'\n\nWhatever you do, just don't lie.\n\nSee the rest of Resolutions Every Married Couple Should Make Together on Brides.com
Jane Austen, for many today, is practically synonymous with demure romance and traditional marriage. Documents turned up by the Hampshire County Council, however, suggest she held a more irreverent attitude toward the marital institution.\n\nAusten, who never married and died at 41 in 1817, apparently created not one, but two fake marriage announcements for herself, filling out forms meant to document the publication of banns (a public proclamation of an intended marriage, read out on three successive Sundays from a church pulpit). The entries appear in the Steventon parish marriage register for 1755–1812.\n\nOne entry announces an impending marriage between herself and Henry Frederick Howard Fitzwilliam of London, and the other between herself and Edmund Arthur William Mortimer of Liverpool. In a statement, Hampshire County noted, Whether or not Fitzwilliam or Mortimer actually existed is a mystery. It should not be overlooked, however, that Fitzwilliam and Edmund later cropped up as Christian names for two of her iconic romantic heroes, Edmund Bertram (Mansfield Park) and Fitzwilliam Darcy (Pride and Prejudice). Perhaps she had a fondness for those particular monikers.\n\nUniversal History Archive via Getty Images Elizabeth Bennet is introduced to Fitzwilliam Darcy in an illustrated scene from Pride and Prejudice.\n\nGeorge Austen, the novelist's father, was the rector of the parish of Steventon, and accordingly would have been one of the officials in charge of maintaining the marriage registry for the parish. Jane likely had relatively easy access to her father's papers, allowing her to playfully forge fictitious marriage announcements.\n\nJane would have been in her teens when she wrote these fake marriage entries, commented Hampshire County Council's Executive Member for Culture, Recreation and Countryside, Councillor Andrew Gibson in a statement, and some could say it reveals a mischievous side during her younger years. Given the mischief found in her spirited, witty novels, such a quality should hardly be a surprise.\n\n\n\nEvery Friday, HuffPost's Culture Shift newsletter helps you figure out which books you should read, art you should check out, movies you should watch and music should listen to.

I was deep in a Regency romance binge a few years ago when I pitched a highly self-interested piece to my editor: an investigation into why this didn't exist onscreen.\n\nThis was a creature apart from the Jane Austen adaptations and sedate period pieces I already enjoyed, or sexy but bloody cable costume dramas. A Regency romance is set in a fantasy version of British high society in the early 19th century, and the central action revolves around the courtship between a woman (often a well-bred beauty) and a man (often a rakish peer). They consummate their attraction in improbably acrobatic sexual encounters, and then they live happily ever after.\n\nIn the post-2016 election malaise, these novels became my anxiety palliative of choice. They piled up next to my bed and in my e-reader. But sometimes I wanted more, wanted to see the gossamer petticoats and lingering glances and gently unfastened bodices. The piece I pitched never materialized, but the object of my longing did. On Christmas Day 2020, Shondaland's Bridgerton arrived on Netflix.\n\nWhat ensued was both somewhat exhilarating — getting to see my Regency escapism come to life — and unnerving. My private indulgence, one generally viewed with dismissiveness if not contempt by non-romance readers, had become the target of a full-blown cultural discourse. Bridgerton was met with valid and vital critiques, especially over its treatment of consent, but also ones that made me wince: that it was formulaic, predictable, vapid, historically inaccurate, best suited for teens.\n\nMany of the critiques, understandably, seemed rooted in unfamiliarity with the genre's conventions, or in the expectation that Bridgerton, which is based on a series of books by Julia Quinn, would resemble a Pride and Prejudice remake. You don't get it! I wanted to shout. That's not what this is! The historical romance has finally gone mainstream — and that means a whole new audience is learning how to read a genre so long relegated to the margins. Sometimes that can be a bumpy ride.\n\nWith its bounty of sherbet-hued satin gowns, scandal rags full of malicious gossip, unblinkingly earnest romance, and on-screen lovemaking, Bridgerton seems to defy easy categorization for many critics, journalists and viewers — and even Regé-Jean Page, who stars as the smoldering Duke of Hastings.\n\nIt's a little bit of Jane Austen meets 'Gossip Girl' with maybe '49 Shades [of Grey'], he told The Wrap in a December interview. Critics and viewers, at their wits' ends trying to make sense of this sexy, gossipy, frothy Regency costume drama, also tried to characterize it in terms of beloved on-screen classics: Pride and Prejudice, Downton Abbey, and, yes, Gossip Girl. These comparisons convey some bafflement, an uncertainty about how to categorize a show that isn't really a realist historical drama, nor an edgy satire, nor a campy soap.\n\nThough it's true that Austen was the inspiration behind the whole subgenre — the first Regency romance novelist, Georgette Heyer, was emulating Austen's work — it has evolved into a well-established genre with its own tropes, conventions and standards.\n\nThere's a way that those kinds of incredibly popular adaptations of Austen will make you, I think, expect that you're watching a certain kind of thing, and romance novels are not trying to do the same thing at all, critic Aaron Bady said in a phone conversation. If you go in watching 'Bridgerton' and say, 'I think I'm watching Jane Austen,' you're going to be disappointed. It feels a little Jane Austen-y, but it doesn't work like a Jane Austen novel.\n\nNor is period romance merely a form of realist period fiction. In her review of the show, Patricia Matthew, an associate professor of English at Montclair State University, placed it in a long artistic tradition of Black women depicted in Regency settings. But ultimately, she said in a phone interview, Nobody's reading Julia Quinn because they're looking for disquisitions on historical precedent.\n\nBursting though a romance novel may be with carefully researched, period-accurate details about Vauxhall entertainments, Almack's vouchers or ribboned chemises, these novels really aren't about the Regency era, or at least not primarily.\n\nHistorical romance does a different kind of work than historical fiction, Sarah MacLean, a popular historical romance author, told me during a phone call. The work of the romance novel is not to tell the story of the past. It is to hold a mirror to the present.\n\nBy building a love story between the primary couple, one that is guaranteed to end happily ever after or happy for now, a romance novel not only provides escapism and the heart-pounding rush of vicarious passion, but a space in which to explore how romantic relationships can and should be, and how women can find fulfillment and happiness. And that means these stories have little to do with how the marriage market of Regency high society actually functioned; they're about what readers — predominantly women — want to see in their lives today.\n\nThe appeal of the time period for readers is very much about being able to distance readers from certain kinds of social issues and then reframe them as a reflection of society now, MacLean explained. In the 1970s, novels typically featured brooding alpha males who took what they wanted sexually ― a narrative device, MacLean argued, for the fictional heroines of the time to have plenty of sex without being seen as loose and deserving of punishment. Historical romance novels today often feature heroes and heroines having what seem like rather anachronistically tender exchanges about consent.\n\nElla Dawson, a sex and culture critic, sees period romance as a way to provide a balm — an experience in which violence and trauma are, if not absent, superseded by a reassurance of ultimate well-being — while also walking readers through more thorny questions.\n\nRomance as a genre is really interested in consent, in diversity representation, in political issues, she said. Romances are so infused with these issues that I [am] really passionate about, and they explore it through this really fun, romantic, swoony, but still very intellectual, thoughtful, accessible lens.\n\nAs odd as it felt to see a straightforward romance adaptation dissected as if it were a failed attempt at matching Jane Austen, it makes sense. Because the genre is generally regarded with such disdain in mainstream culture, it occupies a rather marginalized niche. A non-romance reader is unlikely to have a firm grasp of many things about the genre, outside of well-worn jokes about throbbing members and Fabio's flowing hair, and though romance is among the bestselling genres in the book industry, it's rarely adapted for TV or film.\n\nWhy has this omission persisted for so long? I can't imagine that it isn't a huge amount [due to] patriarchy, in the sense that for the same reason it gets disdained on the page, it gets disdained on the screen, said MacLean. To this day, the people deciding which films and shows to finance are almost entirely men. Shonda Rhimes is that rare exception — a woman with creative control over a TV empire, and a fan of the Quinn series.\n\nPractical obstacles to adapting romance also pop up. A novel stuffed with sex scenes and building toward a tidy happy ending may be tricky to adapt for network TV, which needs to keep things a bit cleaner — and keep the narrative drama going indefinitely.\n\nAnd it's not just the network TV standards and the tidy endings. The heightened reality and bodice-unclasping of the genre, Matthew said, rely on an intimacy between the reader and the page that's difficult to translate to the screen.\n\nI think the plot lines are bananas. I think they're so extreme that they strain credulity, she said, laughing. You have to believe that a sane man, an adult, would say, 'Oh, I'm just not going to have children so I can spite my father.' It only works if it's you with a glass of wine, kind of throwing yourself over to the world of romance. It's awkward to sit with someone else, knowing they're watching the same melodramatic story unfold, partaking in a pleasure that feels somewhat private, if not embarrassing. We all have these fan worlds that when they're exposed to other people that aren't a part of that world we might feel protective of, or feel bashful, she said.\n\nThen there's the money question. Whereas romance novels are relatively cheap to publish, printed in the most inexpensive format (mass-market paperbacks) and typically garnering small advances for authors who churn out multiple volumes per year, the vision they conjure is decadent, over-the-top. There's a sumptuous world that has to be depicted, and it seems like that's a very expensive endeavor, Matthew said. (Bridgerton reportedly had an eye-popping budget.) On camera, the heroine's jewel-encrusted gown costs far more than some well-chosen keystrokes. The visual equivalent of a $7.99 mass-market volume calls for a prestige TV budget. And for a prestige TV budget, many viewers expect a period piece to be an ambitious work of art, not a faithful adaptation of a cheap paperback they might see in a grocery store aisle.\n\nLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX The lavish world that is depicted in Bridgerton might lead viewers to expect a piece of prestige TV, but the story is based on romance novels.\n\nWhen we see the telltale signs of a period piece, we have reason to expect something that will submerge us in the era being depicted, in all its grit as well as its glamour. As Jane Hu wrote in a skeptical Vulture review of Netflix's other recent soothing period hit, The Queen's Gambit, the visually ornate period piece approaches something like a nostalgic fetishization of whiteness in decline. They should not make one feel: 'I want to go to there.' Instead, the effect is more like: 'I can never go back there again.'\n\nWhen we see such a glossy period piece, in other words, we expect the trenchant historical insight of a Mad Men or Austen — not Harlequin. Not I want to go to there.\n\nBut this, as Bady wrote in an essay on The Queen's Gambit, is not really the Netflix way. Netflix is TV that you binge or chill or fall asleep to, TV for relaxing, he wrote. [T]he immaculately rich interiors and production detail of 'The Queen's Gambit' make it less a period piece than a kind of fantasy of what the past was like, or could have been, the past re-imagined as product.\n\nNetflix makes historical shows that salve our anxieties with a past where, as he puts it, nothing bad happens. In a very real way, this is what the Regency romance genre is, part of its particular appeal: They're gorgeous, escapist stories that end happily ever after.\n\nThe idea that historical romance would be able to unpack and solve these big issues of colonialism and race and gender and sexual politics and identity from a massive lens is unrealistic when the books are really doing a very specific kind of work around the domestic role of women and other marginalized people in our current society, MacLean said. The work of the romance is to show characters in hope and prosperity and joy and love.\n\nIt's not, in other words, to expose the decay at the heart of Regency-era society. Perhaps it was inevitable that Netflix and Rhimes would be the ones to plunge full-throttle into a genre defined by happy endings, unqualified pleasure, and a vanished historical setting that looks good enough to eat.\n\nBut if historical romance is not, as a rule, a genre interested in undermining our nostalgia for an imagined, bygone golden age, it is also not empty of political concerns ― and the easily mocked anachronisms common to the genre, like the empowered heroines who are determined to find a love match or embark on a scholarly career, reveal what's really at play in the worlds of these books.\n\nThere's all of these ways that these novels themselves are trying to have it both ways, to give audiences a world of fantasy ― a world of the aristocracy, where everyone's lives look very elegant, people go to balls, women are swept off their feet by dashing rakes, and in return reform the rakes with their love, said Matthew.\n\nAt the same time, she said, we don't want to see heroines who are marriage-obsessed and weak. She pointed to the scene in which Daphne Bridgerton punches a loutish suitor who attempts to compromise her, as a moment that would not have appeared in a Regency romance even a few decades ago. I think it's a response to our audience needs, not to see women as simply in the service of strong, often wicked men, she said.\n\nHistorical romances live in these tensions — the escapism of another time battling against the more enlightened social attitudes of the modern era; sheer fantasy coexisting with a critique of gender roles, or even the slave trade and colonialism. Happily ever after has a tremendous amount of power that I think is subversive in many ways, said MacLean. Much of that has to do with telling stories in which women find joy and comfort rather than being harmed or neglected.\n\nFor Black women, this is particularly true. Though the romance world has been undergoing a painful and overdue reckoning with racism in its institutions (most notably the Romance Writers of America), Black romance novelists including Alyssa Cole, Vanessa Riley, and literary legend Beverly Jenkins have found in the genre a way to center Black women's happiness and care, both in contemporary settings and in historical ones.\n\nThough Quinn's Bridgerton novels are entirely white, the Shondaland adaptation featured diverse casting to controversial effect. In a Medium essay on the series, Tressie McMillan Cottom argued that the adaptation's addition of people of color to Bridgerton coupled with a light-handed explanation of their presence, made historical escapism possible for Black viewers, who are often confronted with brutal reminders of slavery and colonialism when consuming historical fiction. The show, she wrote, offered just enough realism to give a Black viewer permission to suspend disbelief and enjoy the sumptuous sights and passionate sighs.\n\nThat's the comfort of the genre: It doesn't intend to thoroughly represent or deconstruct all the ills of society. Instead, a successful romance constructs a world that directs you to focus on a story of love and possibility, and it lets that be sufficient.\n\nThe economics and politics of that world that Bridgerton makes, it just makes no sense. And that's fine, that's not what they're trying to do, Bady said. There's a way that the show is telling you, here is how to enjoy this. Don't really worry about other things. I think that's a big part of how genre works.\n\nLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX The story of Marina Thompson (Ruby Barker) in Season 1 of Bridgerton could set the stage for a more subversive story than the conventional, white Regency romance.\n\nMatthew also told me that because of the particular genre, she's not interested in scolding the series for not matching the history that I know it comes from.\n\nBut having given it the multicultural world, she went on, I'm really looking forward to what they do with that moment. With Marina, a young mixed-race debutante who gets pregnant out of wedlock and needs to enter a marriage of convenience, she sees possible groundwork being laid for a more subversive kind of story than the conventional, white Regency romance.\n\nYou had that figure of the 'tragic mulatto,' who's the mixed-race woman whose narrative requires her to have a bad end, Matthew pointed out. [Marina] is drawn with a different set of challenges to face that mirror Daphne's around childbirth. But I think she's also a woman who is loved and respected. That's not how that narrative usually unfolds … they make her such a sympathetic character without making her weak or obsequious. She's beautiful and playful and making the best of a situation.\n\nWith careful writing in future seasons, she said, I think there's a lot that could happen with these characters of color that doesn't reduce them to being characters of color while still acknowledging that there's a historical trajectory that brings them there.\n\nAcknowledging the show as a certain kind of fluff, even giving oneself over to the pleasure of the escapism, doesn't mean disengaging critically. Some critics who love the romance genre hated Bridgerton; others loved it; others felt all kinds of complicated things about it. The shocking scene in which Daphne, Season 1's heroine, sexually assaults the Duke in order to get pregnant against his wishes, has received particular scrutiny. Some romance lovers, like Matthew, cringed at the sex scenes, while others (guilty) found them deliciously steamy.\n\nDawson noted that while she has plenty of issues with the show and the source material, including its troubling portrayal of nonconsensual sex, as far as adaptations go, it did a fantastic job adapting what it is like to read a romance. It included so many of the little genre touches that make romances so satisfying ― the physicality, and the tension, and the anticipation.\n\nA romance isn't meant to be restrained and biting like Austen, or a gritty work of art like Mad Men, or even a constant churn of drama like Gossip Girl. It's a show about the slow build, and the explosion of passion. The sex is a payoff! They fall in love, and there's a payoff! They're happy at the end! MacLean said, quoting a male friend of hers who discovered romance ― and the purpose of all those erotic scenes — through Bridgerton.\n\nAnd amid all the sex and swooning and utterly frivolous fashion, there are stories about the relationships we want to have, the work that goes into making them, and the social context that shapes them. Bridgerton isn't Austen, but it never claimed to be. Romance is its own kind of story, and, as many critics and fans have discovered, it's worth paying attention to — on its own terms.
By Julie Detraglia, Head of Advertising Sales Research, Hulu\n\nWith the advertising industry in a state of perennial disruption and viewers experiencing content on more screens than ever before, it's time that advertisers rethink the age-old 15- and 30-second spots. Traditional television businesses have taken up that banner: NBC ran live commercials during its Hairspray broadcast. Turner is running half the commercials in originals on TNT in 2017. But that's only part of the story.\n\nHere are the three things that marketers need to know in 2017:\n\n1. Viewers are Receptive to Ads\n\nConsumers have multiple options for ad avoidance: ad blocking, fast-forwarding or paying premiums for ad-free services. But the reality is that the majority of consumers are, in fact, receptive to ads.\n\nAccording to research from Hulu, 93% of consumers have some level of receptivity to ads, with 35% saying they are highly receptive. And each week, the majority of new Hulu subscribers choose the ad-supported model – viewers are self-selecting into a brand-sponsored TV experience.\n\n2. Receptivity Is Related to Content and Choice\n\nWe've all heard (and used) the phrase content is king a million times, but it is a virtually indisputable fact that there is no content on earth more engaging than premium long-form television.\n\nOn-demand, purposeful viewing has a positive impact on ads: when viewers are watching a favorite show their likelihood to view commercials increases by 21%, and by 46% for their #1 favorite.\n\n3. We Need to Customize to Optimize\n\nViewers tell us that they prefer ads that are informative, relevant, and tailored to the environment in which they view them. The marriage of ad and program becomes most powerful when creative messages are customized for the platform, as Hulu discovered when we tested sequential ad messaging: creative units that tell a story over the course of the program.\n\nUniting commercial storytelling with content storytelling drives engagement and effectiveness, and decreases annoyance.\n\nWhile the media landscape, and along with it consumer expectation, has transformed, commercially supported media is nowhere near dead. Consumers have a desire and a need to be informed about the products and services that are relevant to their lives.\n\nIn order to effectively engage consumers, we must usher in a new era of innovation and creativity, reimagining the 15-and 30-second spots in advertiser-supported television.
A genuine, heartfelt apology is a powerful step toward mending hurt feelings and finding a resolution. A half-assed apology, on the other hand, can be worse than none at all.\n\nIllustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost Photos: Getty\n\nThe difference between a sincere apology and cheap one has a lot to do with how it's phrased. Word to the wise: If you say sorry and then immediately follow it with a conditional word like but or if, you're headed in the wrong direction.\n\nWe asked therapists to share the phrases you should avoid when trying to apologize to a friend, family member, significant other or pretty much anyone, for that matter. Here's what they had to say.\n\n1. I'm sorry you feel that way.\n\nEven though this phrase begins with the words, 'I'm sorry,' it is not a real apology. It does not take ownership of any wrongdoing. It does not communicate remorse for your actions, and it does not express any empathy towards the other person's feelings. Instead, it may imply that you think the other person is being irrational or overly sensitive. Try to understand and take responsibility for how your actions or words hurt the other person, saying something like, 'I'm sorry that I canceled our plans at the last minute. It was inconsiderate of your time and I understand why you are angry at me.' ― Gina Delucca, clinical psychologist at Wellspace SF\n\n2. I'm sorry I said that, but I never would have if you hadn't behaved the way you did.\n\nAgain, we are hearing blame. 'Look what you made me do.' This is not an apology for one's behavior but actually a maneuver to hold the other person responsible for one's behavior. In other words, 'You caused me to say this to you.' We are all responsible for our behavior, no matter what the other person says or does. A heartfelt apology is to recognize the pain we cause and own our behavior: 'I'm sorry that I reacted the way I did and upset you.' ― Carol A. Lambert, psychotherapist and author of Women with Controlling Partners\n\n3. I was stressed out! (or tired...or hungry...)\n\nThis makes a recurrence of the offense almost inevitable. Always connect the apology to the future. For example, 'The next time I feel that way (whatever triggered the offense), I will remember that I love you and that our bond is so important to me,' or, 'I'll make sure I get centered in my values so I don't act on impulse.' The subtext should always be: 'I'm sorry that I hurt you and harmed the bond between us.' ― Steven Stosny, psychologist and author of Love Without Hurt\n\n4. I said I'm sorry already, why can't you just let it go?\n\nBlaming your partner for not immediately accepting your apology, forgiving you and moving on is unrealistic and unfair. For an apology to be effective, it must be clear that: 1) You accept full responsibility for your actions and inactions; 2) You are sincerely sorry for anything you've done to cause pain and 3) That you want to remedy the situation by giving your partner what they need to feel safe in order to move on and forgive you. Not all apologies lead to immediate forgiveness. It may take time. And it may take apologizing more than once. Start by asking what your partner needs in order to trust you and feel safe and then do it. ― Sheri Meyers, marriage and family therapist and author of Chatting or Cheating: How to Detect Infidelity, Rebuild Love and Affair-Proof Your Relationship\n\n5. I was reacting to...\n\nThis is an excuse, not an apology. ― Stosny\n\n6. I'm sorry if I offended you.\n\nThis is an example of a conditional apology that doesn't truly acknowledge any remorse or personal responsibility. By using the word 'if,' you are communicating that the problem isn't really about what you did, but is about how the person reacted to what you did instead. Essentially, this type of 'non-apology' places the blame back onto the person it's directed at. Simply remove the word 'if,' and your apology can take on a whole new meaning: 'I'm sorry I offended you. I will make sure to be more considerate and careful with my words in the future.' ― Tara Griffith, marriage and family therapist and the founder of Wellspace SF\n\n7. I may have done this, but you did that!
Russell Wilson discussed the love he has for his stepson, Future, in a joint GQ interview with Ciara, published on Thursday.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks quarterback and the Grammy-winning singer opened up about their marriage and their three children: Future, 6, Sienna, 3, and Win, who was born this past July. Ciara had Future with her ex-partner, the rapper whose stage name is Future.\n\nWhen Wilson first met Future, after he began dating Ciara, the little boy was only 9 months old. (The couple wed in July 2016.) The football star told GQ that Future coming into his life was a blessing and an opportunity to be there for him every day.\n\nAnd so I think the greatest thing that I've ever learned in life is probably in that relationship with Future, because the reality of being a stepparent is that biologically they're not necessarily yours, but the reality is that you have to love them as if they are, Wilson said. They're your own blood in a way. You get to love them that way. And I think every kid deserves that and needs that and yearns for that.\n\nWilson, who often shares photos and videos of Future and his two other children on Instagram, told GQ that he sends his three beautiful brown-skinned kids inspirational video messages when he's not at home to reaffirm their sense of self-worth. These efforts have felt especially important this past year, he said, as uprisings took place across the nation over the summer in response to police violence against Black people.\n\nCiara told GQ that the way Wilson fathers their children is something she finds sexy.\n\nHe's obviously really beautiful to me in every way, but the father in him is by far one of the things that makes him the most sexy to me, she said. Hot. To me it's hot. (Read the entire GQ profile here.)\n\nWilson shared similar sentiments about his children and his relationship with Future during an appearance on BuzzFeed News' AM2DM in 2019.\n\nIt's easy to love somebody that's blood and everything else, but when you can love somebody just like it's your own child and everything else, that's what real love is like, he said.\n\nOn Jan. 1, Wilson shared a photo on Instagram of himself with Ciara and their children. In the post, he reflected on 2020, saying it had brought obstacles... opportunities to change... great loss of loved ones come and gone... as well as new life.\n\n2021... I don't know what you will bring... but for my family we will continue to Believe that Love is the way! he added.
Nina Kouprianova and Richard Spencer were married during a small ceremony in Niagara Falls in August 2010.\n\nSpencer's father is a doctor in the Dallas area. His mother, Sherry, is a socialite and artist whose home on Big Mountain in Whitefish, Montana, is full of tiles she painted herself. Kouprianova, an artist and photographer, got along with Sherry, who had one of her own mother's rings resized as the engagement ring. It's a beautiful large diamond in the middle of an art deco setting.\n\nKouprianova and Spencer scheduled a larger ceremony for January 2011 in Whitefish, where they planned to have skiing and dogsledding. The invitation was also done in an art deco style. Designed by Kouprianova, it depicted a man and a woman on a ski slope, each looking a separate way.\n\nKouprianova recalls being sick in the days before the Montana ceremony. She'd caught a stomach bug from Spencer's nephews. As she lay in bed in a room in the Whitefish home, she says, Spencer came in and demanded that she go into the basement and watch a movie with him — a James Bond movie. Maybe the one with Famke Janssen, the Bond girl that Spencer often compared her to? She can't remember, she says. She was so sick.\n\nShe told him no. He yelled at her. Then, she says, he pulled her down the stairs using her hair and her legs. What she remembers isn't the pain so much as the faces of the tiny angel figurines that decorated his mother's house — rococo angels with round cheeks, mouths parted as if mid-moan, naked with pale glowing folds of skin, staring at her with searching and plaintive eyes.\n\nThey had the ceremony. Kouprianova felt hopeful. Maybe it wouldn't happen again.\n\n***\n\nNow, after eight years as his business partner and confidante, ally and enemy, Kouprianova is divorcing Spencer, America's second-most notorious racist. The fallout is a bitter tangle of fear and rage, with dueling allegations of abuse and harassment. In the affidavit filed in their divorce proceedings is a copy of an email Kouprianova sent to Spencer on Jan. 4, 2011. She's replying to an email he sent. Did you arrive back… the subject line reads. And in the body: ...safely?\n\nYeah, she replied, apart from seeing the bruises on my wrists and knees from yesterday's adventure down your staircase that you sent me on, the trip back went without major incident.\n\nAre you working tonight? he replied.\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost Richard Spencer during an interview with HuffPost in a remote location outside Gainesville, Florida, on Oct. 18, 2017.\n\nSpencer is often depicted as white nationalism-lite. Profiles of him in the past two years gild the racist, portraying him as suave, respectable, intelligent, in control. Journalists who have profiled him tell me he's slick. He's polished. He's experienced. He's polite. He wears suits and went to a private high school and Duke. Mother Jones coined the term dapper white nationalist to describe him. The Los Angeles Times noted that he looks like many young staffers on Capitol Hill.\n\nSure, he promotes an ideology of white supremacy and supports ethnic cleansing — but, you know, peacefully, and in a suit.\n\nDespite Spencer and the so-called alt-right's attempts to be respectable, violence seems to follow them everywhere. There was the death of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia, a neo-Nazi Spencer follower threatening to feed a reporter into a woodchipper in Washington, D.C., beatings outside a tony club on the Upper East Side — and now, allegedly, violence in Spencer's own home.\n\nSpencer is often depicted as white nationalism-lite. Profiles of him in the past two years gild the racist, portraying him as suave, respectable, intelligent, in control.\n\nWhen I eventually talk to Spencer, in the minutes before he yells at me, he insists he's a private person. He doesn't want to be there, talking to me. This is a private matter. Plus, he adds, Nina's politics aren't that much different than his. They were partners. Can't I leave it alone?\n\nBut the affidavit that Kouprianova filed, alleging abuse, is public. The judge refused to seal the divorce records, citing the public's right to know. So, what can the public know from this mess of personal pain, tragedy and loss? Why should anyone care that someone like Spencer is accused of beating his wife?\n\nThey should care because the abuse Kouprianova has described and documented would, yet again, put the lie to the whole idea of nonviolent white nationalism. Because it would show us once again that violence that sips fine wine and dresses up is still violence. I don't know how often we have to learn this. After all, there is no more American story than taking a man at face value, giving him power, and only later seeing all the horror he has wrought.\n\nSpencer denies ever physically abusing his wife. He admits only that he's yelled at her and said terrible things — things he regrets.\n\nI get frustrated, he says. She makes me frustrated.\n\nIlana Panich-Linsman for HuffPost Nina Kouprianova poses for a portrait in Whitefish, Montana.\n\nKouprianova grew up in Moscow in the 1980s. The oldest daughter of academics, she was raised to discuss ideas around the dinner table. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the world she knew fell apart. Her family moved to Canada and she fell in love with heavy metal, traveling to festivals in Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Baltimore.\n\nIt was a violent, sexist world. One time, she went backstage to meet the members of a band she loved. They made disgusting comments about her body and tried to grab her ass. She was 16. She saw bloody fights break out between antifa and skinheads. She dated someone in the metal scene who was abusive. It was a world that was supposed to be violent and extreme. She was desensitized to it.\n\nKouprianova met Spencer on Facebook in 2009. They had a mutual friend in common — she doesn't remember who — back when friending was a simple gesture. They felt an immediate connection and began exchanging messages.\n\nSpencer lived in New York, where he worked for Taki's Magazine, the far-right magazine founded by Greek multi-millionaire Panagiotis Taki Theodoracopulos. Spencer wore professor sweaters and they talked about Eugene Onegin, art and Soviet films. His Facebook page was filled with pictures of him with Ron Paul.\n\nKouprianova was impressed. She was a bright history Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto who wore army fatigues to class, wrote well and had a passion for Japanese culture. Her dissertation was titled Revolution, Tradition and Modernity: Russian Consumer Advertising in the Era of NEP.\n\nHe asked her to write for him. She filed blog posts about Russia and Canada and weighed in on politics, Russian culture and Obamamania in Canada.\n\nSpencer came to visit her in Toronto, and when she left in the fall of 2009 to go to Russia to do research for her dissertation, he begged her to come back. He missed her. They were in love. Kouprianova returned and spent the holidays with Spencer's family. She was in awe of what appeared to be the perfect nuclear family. They were married on Aug. 31, 2010.\n\nI didn't understand the nuances of American politics, she says now. I knew he was conservative, but…\n\nI know what she means. In 2005, I married a libertarian and in 2018, I divorced a Trump supporter.\n\nThe move was slow. Like boiling a frog in water. By the time the frog realizes what's happening, he's holding a Tiki torch.\n\nBut maybe that's disingenuous. Maybe we were just young. Maybe we were just deluded or deluding ourselves.\n\n***\n\nIn an affidavit filed in June, Kouprianova claims that her eight-year marriage to Spencer was rife with abuse — emotional, financial and physical. In July 2014, when Kouprianova was four months pregnant, according to the affidavit, Spencer pushed her down and held her by her neck and her jaw. She has pictures of the bruising.\n\nIn an email about the incident, he apologized, saying he felt terrible. There was also the time he pushed her into the stove when she was pregnant, she says. He would wake her up screaming at her, telling her to kill herself. She recorded hours of him screaming at her, some of which she transcribed and included in the affidavit.\n\nIt might be hard to understand why someone would stay in such a violent relationship. Spencer — who, again, denies ever physically attacking his wife — has questions: If he was so violent, why didn't Kouprianova call the police? Why didn't she leave?\n\nIt's hard to explain if you've never been there. I can tell you the statistics on abuse, how it takes most women seven tries before they finally leave their abuser. I can tell you how abuse requires the slow breakdown of self.\n\nYou are worthless.\n\nYou are a disgusting cunt.\n\nKill yourself.\n\nScreenshots of text messages Nina Kouprianova says she exchanged with her husband, Richard Spencer.\n\nOver and over until you can't breathe, can't understand, can't see your way out. There is the isolation and the shame.\n\nKouprianova tried to reach out to her family, but she struggled to tell them the extent of what was happening. Her mother thought they were having the same fights every couple has. The few friends Kouprianova had in Toronto didn't like Spencer. Right after the wedding, she moved to a new country, a new place, and was surrounded by Spencer and his friends and family.\n\nI can also tell you that abuse rewires the brain, creating neural pathways that make victims either hyper- or hypo-aware. This means they are either incredibly sensitive and jumpy, or desensitized. Kouprianova was desensitized. Spencer would threaten her, intimidate her, call her disgusting and ugly. She would respond in a monotone.\n\nBut one of the things that helps explain why she stayed is what's hardest to comprehend about Kouprianova: She and Spencer were partners.\n\nShe wrote for the same publications he did — Taki Magazine and Radix Journal. She translated Aleksandr Dugin, the fascist Russian philosopher who once called for the genocide of Ukrainians. In 2017, she mulled the idea of peaceful parting as an alternative to ethnic cleansing to reach Spencer's dream of an ethnostate for people of European descent. She helped Spencer with technical work and graphic design. She answered interview questions for Spencer through email.\n\nYou do Richard Spencer better than Richard Spencer, he told her.\n\nThere is no more American story than taking a man at face value, giving him power, and only later seeing all the horror he has wrought.\n\nIn 2016, she wrote a letter to a Montana paper, the Flathead Beacon, defending Spencer. She compared the town's reaction to Spencer to a witch hunt. She wrote about her grandfather, a Russian Orthodox priest, who, according to family lore, was jailed and shot by the communists.\n\nShe has vigorously defended Russian nationalism, Putin and Russia Today, the government-funded English language news agency. In 2010, after two women carried out suicide bombings on the Russian metro, Kouprianova in a blog post on a site called Alternative Right blamed the progressive policies of Europe:\n\nSuicide bombers target busy subway stations, while Chechen children refuse to learn the Russian language in Muscovite public schools. In London, politicians flirt with Sharia law, as that city gets further ghettoized. In France, second-generation Muslim rioters caused €200 million worth of damage in one year. In Sweden, the number of immigrant-linked rapes has quadrupled over the past twenty years or so. And, in Fort Hood, Texas…\n\nSpencer acknowledges Kouprianova's contributions to his work but insists he's his own person. She didn't make me who I am today, but she clearly supported what I was doing, there's no question, he says. I am proud of our collaborations.\n\nKouprianova explains the op-ed by saying she was trying to fix her marriage. She was isolated, with a young child. She insists Richard Spencer is responsible for Richard Spencer.\n\nIlana Panich-Linsman for HuffPost Nina Kouprianova takes her basset hound, Rody, out in Whitefish, Montana.\n\nThis fall, I went to see Kouprianova in her 800-square-foot apartment in Whitefish where, until November, she was working as a building manager for Sherry Spencer. Surrounded by the gray shoulders of the Rockies, hemmed in by Douglas fir, lodgepole pines and alpine larch, the town is a beautiful trap. Kouprianova has no car; Spencer took it when he left. She receives only $550 a month for child support and no alimony.\n\nWhat she has left are two small children, a basset hound named Rody, the apartment, and no way out.\n\nKouprianova double-checks the locks and jumps whenever Rody growls. On walks with her kids, she scans every driver's face, making sure it isn't him.\n\nOnce, when Kouprianova was pregnant, she and Spencer went into town to get coffee. The barista started yelling and refused to serve them. I was just standing there, watching her yell, my belly is out to here, she says, holding her hand a foot from her stomach.\n\nThe barista was mad at Spencer, but moments like that leave a mark. Kouprianova is ashamed. She has some friends but doesn't open up to many people. She's worried about her children; she wants them to have friends and lives. She's trying to cobble together freelance work. But — she shrugs and gestures to the apartment, which is clean but cluttered with cloth hampers filled with toys, shelves of books, stuffed animals lined up on the couch. There isn't room for everything. Most of the furniture, like the side table with gold-painted scrollwork, is a hand-me-down from her mother-in-law.\n\nIn the apartment, at the small table that's littered with small dinosaur figurines and stuffed animals, she plays me some of her audio recordings of Spencer — until my hands are shaking and I bite the inside of my mouth, tasting blood, trying not to cry. Kouprianova sits still, her eyes deep and dark and emotionless. She tells me about him pushing her into the stove when she was pregnant, dragging her down the stairs by her arms. She plays me recordings of him screaming at her while the children sob in the background. Telling her he will Fucking break [her] nose, telling her to go kill herself, to jump off a bridge.\n\nWill your parents even go to your funeral? he taunts in one recording. I can hear the high-pitched sound of cartoons playing in the background ― the children are right there. In one recording, he wakes her up at 1 a.m. to repeatedly ask her what her problem is.\n\nLet me sleep, she begs. You are waking up the baby.\n\nI would recommend that you murder yourself because you have nothing to offer the world, he says. You are profoundly disgusting.\n\nIn another video, he berates the 65-year-old babysitter, who testified against Spencer in the custody hearing.\n\nDo you think you are not stupid and ugly? he says. She tries to record on her phone, but he snatches it out of her hand. The baby is in his arms screaming.\n\n[You are a] fucking sub-mediocre human being, he says.\n\n[A] fucking moron.\n\nIn the background, a small, scared voice calls out, Papa, stop. He doesn't stop.\n\n'Will your parents even go to your funeral?' he taunts in one recording. I can hear the high-pitched sound of cartoons playing in the background ― the children are right there.\n\nFor the past few months, Spencer has only been allowed supervised visits with the children, but he will soon be allowed unsupervised visitation at his mother's house. This worries Kouprianova, who is concerned about her children being at a home with guns in it.\n\nHuffPost also obtained text messages from Spencer's current girlfriend, Megan Bobonick, describing him screaming at her, too. Bobonick acknowledges sending those texts but denied that any of Spencer's behavior rises to the level of abuse.\n\nIn November of 2018, Bobonick wrote a post on Medium, insisting that Kouprianova was hounding her online and on her phone. In our interview, Spencer implied that maybe Kouprianova had leaked nude photos of her online. When I asked Kouprianova about all of this, she shrugged — not confirming, not denying. If anything illegal was done ― leaks, harassment ― let the police get involved, was her stance. It's Spencer's stance, too. Even in the falling apart, it's easy to see how the two of them got together.\n\nKouprianova and I discuss her complicity and her relationship. She says she now denounces his ideology. But only as the visit was ending did I think to ask about my complicity — the media's complicity in making Spencer who he is, in enabling all of this. After all, if Kouprianova deserves to be implicated in Spencer's actions because she enabled him, what does the media deserve? What do I deserve?\n\nIlana Panich-Linsman for HuffPost Nina Kouprianova walks with her children in Whitefish, Montana.\n\nAfter a six-hour interview, I tell Kouprianova I am going to talk to Spencer. I say something about him perhaps yelling at me. Her jaw tightens. The color drains from her face.\n\nDon't try to make him mad, she tells me. It's not worth it.\n\nShe's been jumpy whenever the dog growled. But this is the first time I've seen her afraid.\n\n***\n\nRichard Spencer sits in the breakfast room of the Best Western in Whitefish with a glob of mustard on his face. He's eating a sandwich from Panera — roast beef and gouda. He doesn't notice the mustard and I try not to stare at it. He's talking about voting. He's talking about the death of the right. I let him talk while he eats his sandwich. I don't care about any of those things. I'm just here to find out what he has to say about the allegations in Kouprianova's affidavit.\n\nBut he talks with his mouth full. He's explaining John Judis' The Emerging Democratic Majority. It's the weekend before the midterms, and he's telling me he predicts a blue tide. He licks the mustard off his face. Takes a bite. Another glob of mustard appears.\n\nIn just an hour, he's yelling at me.\n\nBut before that, after he finishes his sandwich, I tell him I want to know why he told his wife he wanted to fucking break [her] nose.\n\nI did not break her nose, he says. It's tough talk, words said in anger. There is a red line between actually doing something.\n\nHe tells me that I need to understand the context of their relationship. She wouldn't listen to him. So yeah, OK, there is no question he's said things he regrets. Things that are unkind and bad. He does this with friends and family, too. It just is what it is.\n\nAnd those recordings Kouprianova made? Well, those are what make the situation toxic. Montana is a two-party consent state for recordings. Kouprianova is the one doing something illegal. The recordings are illegal. He would never record. Kouprianova recording him yelling is just her resorting to a manipulative tactic.\n\nSpencer absolutely denies the physical abuse. He scoffs at the idea of financial abuse. And he doesn't deny telling his wife to kill herself or threatening to fucking break her nose. OK, what he said was nasty. But Kouprianova? Well, she is isolated from the community. She's an anti-American analyst. She's a Kremlin mouthpiece.\n\nHe reminds me he is only there because he feels he has to be. He has no desire to smear Kouprianova. If he was so bad, he argues, why didn't she leave?\n\nI ask him if he'd let her leave. He says he would. But when I ask why he won't give both his children passports so she can go to her parents in Canada, he says she's a flight risk. But still, he insists, why didn't she leave?\n\nI tell him about the cycles of abuse. The statistic about women trying to leave seven times before succeeding. In response, he tells me he left. He came back. He is the victim here. He absolutely feels emotionally abused. He is a reasonable human, he tells me.\n\nBut how does a reasonable person scream at their wife and tell her to murder herself in front of their kids?\n\nHe's leaning forward over the table now. His dapper hair is falling into his face. He asks me where I went to school and what my graduate degree is in and smirks when I tell him about my MFA in creative writing.\n\nThis is the cycle. I ask about the abuse; he tells me there is a greater context. I ask what context justifies the words he's not denying. He insists I'm being unreasonable; I ask again. He tells me he's a victim. He's left her five times. And where is the crime in what he did?\n\nAccording to Montana law, a person who purposefully aids or solicits another to commit suicide, but such suicide does not occur, commits the offense of aiding or soliciting suicide.\n\nHe demands to go off the record.\n\nWhen we go back on the record, he apologizes for what he's said during that time. Look, I take back anything that you might have taken as an insult, he says. He was just frustrated, after all. I made him frustrated.\n\nNeed help?

Email askdoyin@huffpost.com.\n\n―\n\nLightFieldStudios via Getty Images Adults love to joke that the boys are gonna come knocking soon; better get the shotgun ready! as young girls mature. And it's gross.\n\nI have two teen daughters whose figures make them look much older than they actually are (13 and 15 years old). During a holiday get-together, my father-in-law repeatedly made awkward comments around them, like, I hope your dad buys a shotgun for when boys come to the house. My girls were really uncomfortable, but my husband laughed it off as the kind of joke that every dad ― or grandfather, in this case ― makes when talking about teen daughters. But the girls didn't like it one bit, and neither did I. How do I talk to my husband and his dad about this so future holidays aren't so cringeworthy?\n\n― Ashley in Oakland, California\n\n<sarcasm font> It's sooo edgy and cool for dudes to threaten gun violence on children who attempt to date their daughters. </sarcasm font>\n\nI'm 100 percent with you on this one, Ashley. I'll never understand men who make comments like this. They're inadvertently telling their daughters (or granddaughters), I don't trust your ability to choose the right person, so I'm going to intimidate all of them by putting a killing machine in their faces. That will teach 'em to treat you right. It's straight up stupid. And the fact it's assumed boys will soon come knocking based on your teen daughters' mature looks is really gross and not exactly empowering to them as young women.\n\nI know, I know. People are surely reading this thinking, Oh boy, the PC police are sounding the alarms, again. But if being a member of the PC police means not being an out-of-touch asshole, then I'll proudly rock that badge. Feel free to stop me if you've heard this before, but gun violence is a big problem in America. The mere suggestion or joke that an adult should pull a gun on a teenager is beyond my level of understanding. So is making inappropriate comments about teenagers' physical attractiveness, knowing what we do about how these kinds of comments can negatively affect young women's sense of self-worth as they grow up.\n\nMy two daughters aren't even close to dating age yet, but when they are, I plan to tell them they can bring anyone to our house (boy or girl), and I'll do my part to make them feel comfortable and welcomed. Of course, if these guests engage in behavior that make my daughters unhappy or uncomfortable, I'll address it accordingly, just like any well-adjusted grownup should. And it won't entail waving a gun around like Yosemite Sam.\n\nYour situation is a pretty simple one, Ashley. Tell your husband to knock it off. Tell him your daughters don't find the jokes funny at all ― in fact, they were offended by them. Anyone who continues to spout off the same comments after being told your girls were upset by them is one of those aforementioned out-of-touch assholes. Your husband will fall in line if he doesn't want his daughters to think of him that way.\n\nYour father-in-law? He may be a bit more challenging; old heads tend to be pretty set in their ways. But you have the leverage, here, because you are in charge of how much (or how little) he gets to hang out with his granddaughters. And you're not going to make your kids spend time with people who make them feel uncomfortable — family, friends or otherwise. Make that very clear and institute a zero tolerance policy going forward. Note: This is a conversation you need to have with their grandfather, because he needs to see how serious you are about it. If you leave the discussion up to your husband, there's a good chance the message could be lost in translation.\n\nIt's 2019. If we all do something big or small to eliminate bad behavior this year, we'll help make the world a better place.\n\n―\n\nTVP Inc via Getty Images Your job as the husband? To do whatever necessary to make sure your wife is able to take care of herself.\n\nMy wife had a really rough 2018. Her best friend died in a drunk driving accident, and her mom was diagnosed with cancer. She and I have always lived a fit and healthy lifestyle, but her depression has gotten really bad. She's distant with our kids, has stopped exercising and has (and I really don't mean to sound like a jerk) gained a worrying amount of weight. My wife is normally a superwoman kind of mom ― she goes to work every day, cooks and cleans, reads stories to our daughters every night, and is at every ballet and soccer practice. I'm helping out as much as I can, but it's been challenging. I love my wife and want to help her start off the new year on the right foot and get her mental and physical health back. I'm not even sure she realizes how bad it's gotten. What can I do?\n\n– Jim in Los Angeles, California\n\nMy guy, your wife is a woman in America. She's probably fully aware she's gained weight, no matter how depressed she is (not to mention that depression and weight gain often go hand-in-hand). I'm curious as to whether you're more concerned about her physical health or mental health. You describe yourselves as a normally fit and healthy couple, so my guess is her weight gain has become an issue for your relationship. I get it: Sex and attraction are extremely important in a marriage. But I'll be honest: It sounds like this might be more about you than her.\n\nSomeone once told me that women are expected to work as if they don't have children and raise children as if they don't work. Go back and read what you sent me, Jim. Your wife works outside of the home, cooks and cleans, takes your kids to their extracurricular activities and generally sounds like a great mom ― one who is probably already exhausted and overwhelmed on a good day. Then, her best friend dies in one of the most tragic ways possible, and her mom gets sick. Of course she's struggling!\n\nYou say you're helping out as much as you can, but what does that mean, exactly? Are you offering to cook (and are they healthy meals)? Are you doing the laundry without asking? Do you know what an arabesque is or how to braid your daughter's hair? I hate it when husbands talk about helping out around the house as if they're being heroic by lending a hand.\n\nIt's disappointing that you need a complete stranger to tell you this, but now is the time for you to step up like you never have before. And don't wait for her to ask you to do it, either. You're a grown-ass man. You know what it takes to run a household. So do it.\n\nNext, let's address your wife's mental health. It's good that you recognize that she's depressed and want to help her. Is she seeking therapy? Does she need additional medical attention? Does she have a support group of friends she can spend time with when she's down? Are you making sure people know you're currently the go-to parent for the kids, so any extra burden is lifted from your wife's mental plate? Your job now is to do whatever's necessary to ensure your wife is taking the requisite time for herself.\n\nThen, and only then, will she be able to start addressing her physical health. And you can do it together in a way that makes sense for everyone. Take family walks around the neighborhood after dinner. Start a simple workout routine as a couple. Make a point to eat healthier meals in the new year as a family. Don't mention her weight gain specifically, because I promise you, she's totally aware of it. Just be her partner and stay supportive.\n\nLast, and certainly not least, tell her how much you love and appreciate her. Every day. I've been told by my mom friends that hearing thank you has the same (if not more) impact than hearing I love you. No matter what happens, keep emphasizing how important she is to you and your family — because at the end of the day, happiness is the goal.\n\nDoyin is a best-selling children's author, keynote speaker and dad dedicated to making the world a better place for parents and their kids.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge has revealed how one of Jennifer Lopez's hit songs influenced Fleabag.\n\nThe show's winning streak continued on Sunday night, picking up two more prizes for its acclaimed second series at the Critics' Choice Awards.\n\nFleabag, already a Bafta, Emmy and Golden Globe winner, was named Best Comedy Series while Phoebe won Best Actress In A Comedy.\n\nChris Pizzello/Invision/AP Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepts the award for best actress in a comedy series for Fleabag at the 25th annual Critics' Choice Awards on Sunday, Jan. 12, 2020, at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nTaking to the stage to accept the show's prize, the 34-year-old actress thanked J-Lo for inspiring a portion of Fleabag.\n\nThis is a bit of a random shout-out, she said. But you have no idea how you can accidentally inspire people just by doing your work and somebody inspired this show in a way that you'll never know – and that's J-Lo!\n\nJordan Strauss/Invision/AP Jennifer Lopez arrives at the 25th annual Critics' Choice Awards.\n\nWaller-Bridge told the star-studded audience, which included J-Lo, that she decided the Priest's favorite song was Jenny From The Block. She said the choice of song opened the entire character up for me.\n\nSo, I don't know where she is, but that's really genuine, so thank you, thank you J-Lo, Waller-Bridge added.\n\nDuring the same acceptance speech, Waller-Bridge also thanked her sister and Fleabag composer Isobel Waller-Bridge, saying her music covered and elevated the slightly mediocre bits of the show.\n\nWaller-Bridge also revealed her sister inserted an Easter egg of sorts for Latin speakers, with completely filthy words used in some of the songs.\n\nRichard Shotwell/Invision/AP (L-R) Brett Gelman, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Andrew Scott pose in the press room with the award for best comedy series for Fleabag at the 25th annual Critics' Choice Awards on Sunday, Jan. 12, 2020\n\nSo thank you for keeping the DNA of the show right in even to the classiest music possible, she added.\n\nOther big winners at this year's Critics' Choice Awards included Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood, which was named Best Picture.\n\nThe Best Director prize was shared between Parasite director Bong Joon Ho and Sam Mendes for 1917″ after Broadcast Film Critics Association voters could not split them.\n\nAndrew Scott, who plays the Priest in Fleabag, won Best Supporting Actor In A Comedy Series.\n\nCritics' Choice Winners List: Best actor – Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) Best supporting actress – Laura Dern (Marriage Story) Best supporting actress in a comedy series – Alex Borstein (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel) Best supporting actor in a comedy series – Andrew Scott (Fleabag) Best action movie – Avengers: Endgame Foreign language film – Parasite Best supporting actress in a drama series – Jean Smart (Watchmen) Best supporting actor in a drama series – Billy Crudup (The Morning Show) Best movie made for television – El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie Best animated feature – Toy Story 4 Best actor in a drama series – Jeremy Strong (Succession) Best actress in a drama series – Regina King (Watchmen) Best limited series – When They See Us Best comedy film – Dolemite Is My Name Best actress in a comedy series – Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag) Best actor in a comedy series – Bill Hader (Barry) Best acting ensemble – The Irishman Best screenplay – Quentin Tarantino (Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood) Best supporting actor in a limited series or movie made for television – Stellan Skarsgard (Chernobyl) Best supporting actress in a limited series or movie made for television – Toni Collette (Unbelievable) Best actress in a limited series or movie made for television – Michelle Williams (Fosse/Verdon) Best actor in a limited series or movie made for television – Jharrel Jerome (When They See Us) Best supporting actor – Brad Pitt (Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood) Best young actor/actress – Roman Griffin Davis (Jojo Rabbit) Best comedy series – Fleabag Best drama series – Succession Best actress – Renee Zellweger (Judy) Best director – Sam Mendes (1917) and Bong Joon Ho (Parasite)
Jon Bon Jovi totally rocks with Fresh Off The Boat.\n\nThe musician sent the series' writers some Bon Jovi swag after he saw Jessica Huang, played by Constance Wu, make a reference to his relationship with the rocker Dorothea Hurley, his wife of almost three decades, in a recent episode titled The Car Wash.\n\nWe're shot through the heart! 💙 Our #FreshOffTheBoat writers are looking awesome in their new swag, thanks to @BonJovi! pic.twitter.com/8oJNmUCRrK — Fresh off the Boat (@FreshOffABC) January 24, 2018\n\nPhotos featuring the sitcom's writers proudly modeling their new Bon Jovi sweatshirts, T-shirts, and robes were posted on the show's Twitter account on Tuesday.

If anything, you are my Dorothea Hurley, Jessica says in the episode, before detailing Hurley's relationship with Bon Jovi to Louis.\n\n″He married his high school sweetheart and they're still together, Jessica adds.\n\nIs that romantic or what?\n\nNow we can only hope our relationships are as loving as the one between Bon Jovi and Hurley — or Jessica and Louis.
The daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz has signaled her approval of a forthcoming movie about her famous parents, noting that the divisive casting choices are a done deal.\n\nWritten and directed by Aaron Sorkin, Amazon's Being the Ricardos will take place during one production week of the classic sitcom I Love Lucy, which ran from 1951 to 1957. The screenplay follows Ball and Arnaz as they face a crisis that could end their careers and another that could end their marriage.\n\nAs of last week, Oscar winners Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem were said to be in final negotiations to play Ball and Arnaz, respectively.\n\nAfter news of the film's as-yet-unofficial casting broke, many fans expressed their disapproval on Twitter by suggesting a litany of other actors who could portray Ball. Debra Messing, who nailed an impression of Ball's I Love Lucy character on the final season of Will & Grace last year, went a step further by retweeting messages about why she should star in Sorkin's movie.\n\nOn Sunday, Lucie Arnaz released a short video on her Facebook page attempting to quell the ongoing Being the Ricardos debate. In it, she urged viewers to trust the creative process behind the project, which she described as a nice film.\n\nArnaz, a theater and TV actor who is an executive producer of Being the Ricardos, confirmed the movie's reported casting in her video, but emphasized that actors' contracts had not yet been signed. Many of the dissenting voices, she added, were overly fixated on Ball's Hollywood persona.\n\nNo one has to impersonate Lucy Ricardo nor do the Vitameatavegamin routine, or the chocolate factory routine or any of the silly things, she said. It's the story of Lucille Ball, my actual mother, not Lucy Ricardo, and her husband, Desi Arnaz, my dad, not Ricky Ricardo.\n\nThough much of the dramatic action in Being the Ricardos is set against the backdrop of I Love Lucy, Arnaz stressed that the sitcom will not be an integral part of the film.\n\nVery little of the show is actually 'I Love Lucy'-type stuff, she said. I don't think you will be disappointed with that, however. ... It is a two-hour feature film about these two people and some of the remarkable things they lived through.\n\nIn an apparent wink at America's current political climate, she concluded, The voting is over.\n\nA four-time Emmy winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee, Ball died in 1989 at age 77. Arnaz died in 1986 at age 69. The couple divorced in 1960 after 20 years of marriage and also had a son, Desi Arnaz Jr.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that Cate Blanchett was being eyed to play Ball in an earlier incarnation of Being the Ricardos, which was then titled Lucy and Desi. A CBS miniseries simply titled Lucy aired in 2003, featuring Rachel York and Danny Pino as Ball and Arnaz.
Charley Gallay via Getty Images Colton Haynes and Jeff Leatham at the FX Networks celebration in September 2017. They got married in Palm Springs, California, the following month.\n\nUPDATE May 6: After this story was first published, Haynes tweeted this about his new music video.\n\nJeff would never cheat. He's an amazing man. Please stop being mean to him. The song I wrote was about a past relationship. ❤ — Colton Haynes (@ColtonLHaynes) May 5, 2018\n\nPreviously:\n\nColton Haynes and Jeff Leatham have ended their relationship after six months of marriage, US Weekly and TMZ reported Friday.\n\nIt's not clear whether they plan to file for divorce.\n\nHaynes posted a cryptic music video to his social media accounts Thursday that some people are interpreting as a reference to the split.\n\nI don't like when you're staying out all night and never answer your phone, I follow you around the world just to be left alone, and man, it sucks, the Teen Wolf star sings in the video, which can be viewed below. I said I loved you despite the cheating drama. ... Maybe in the future, you'll come around.\n\nA representative for Haynes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeatham, who works as an artistic director for Four Seasons Hotels, hasn't been featured on Haynes' Instagram for a while. The last photo of the couple to appear on the actor's account is dated Jan. 21. Haynes also dropped his hyphenated married name, Haynes-Leatham, from his Instagram handle; Leatham's account does not appear to have changed.\n\nIf confirmed, the breakup will mark the end of a whirlwind romance for the couple. The two men tied the knot in Palm Springs, California, in October in a ceremony officiated by Kris Jenner.\n\nThey got engaged in March 2017, a few weeks after Haynes confirmed they were dating.\n\nLeatham told People in October the relationship had been love at first sight.\n\nA lot of people protect their hearts but you have to keep your heart and your mind open, he said. Colton has been such an inspiration to me. We couldn't be more different but our love is the same and I think that's the strongest part of our relationship.
Within the therapy community there is a general belief that counselors and psychotherapists are gender neutral and that they do not impose their personal beliefs about gender roles onto their clients. In my experience, this belief is incorrect. Many of my clients tell me stories of how their previous therapists encouraged them to comply with gender roles and stereotypes that limited their voice and power. And last month I met with a psychotherapist whose unconscious and covert sexism biased her understanding of me and the advice she gave.\n\nI went to see the psychotherapist because I wanted help with how to facilitate a new normal in my marriage. I chose her because she said on her website that she had a background in women's studies, did couples and family therapy, and understood that clients live in social contexts that impact the choices they make. I thought that these ingredients would help her understand the subtle power issues I was trying to navigate. Power issues that involve examining the deeper issue of what it means to be female in a world where men's voices and men's needs still dominate.\n\nOver the last four months I have experienced what it really feels like to be entirely cared-for by my husband. During our thirty-plus year marriage I have had to ask, and sometimes badger him to listen to what I need. But then last September when I suddenly became seriously ill, my relationship with my husband changed. He now listens more closely to what I need and sometimes he just knows without me having to ask. It is an amazing feeling to feel understood without having to explain myself. Admittedly at first all this attention felt uncomfortable. But as I got used to it I realized that this is the normal I have been yearning for with my husband for a long time and I do not want to lose it. Why shouldn't I be effortlessly understood? Why shouldn't what I need be naturally present in my marriage, just like my husband's needs have been present from when we got married?\n\nWhen I shared this experience with my therapist I could see from the look on her face that she was struggling to understand where I was coming from. Her body language communicated that she was uncomfortable with my desire to stop being my family's main caregiver, even though my children are adults. And when we discussed my desire for my career goals to now take precedence over my husband's, she started arguing with me.\n\nWhen I said to her that I no longer want to be the main caregiver in my family, she asked me if I was thinking of leaving my family. And when I told her that I want my work and career goals to take precedence in my marriage, she asked me if my husband was retiring. She went on to ask what my husband's career goals were, suggesting that if I put myself ahead of him I would be jeopardizing this career. I felt as if I was back twenty-three years ago when my husband and I left New Zealand so that he could study for his doctorate in America. Not a single person at that time asked me what my plans were or what I was hoping to get out of our move. Everyone expected me to be the dutiful, supportive wife and again, that is how this therapist saw me.\n\nI was shocked by her lack of understanding of the subtle nuances of male dominance that force wives into doing more of the accommodating. I could not understand why in her mind, she thought that asking for a more shared caregiving in my family I would end up being alone. And why after thirty years of fitting my work around my family and my husband's work, I did not have the right to claim my time and my turn. Her reaction made me feel angry that this trusted professional was trying to guilt-trip me into ignoring what I need. I wondered how another female client, who feels less entitled to her needs and voice than I do, might feel? Chances are she will walk away from therapy feeling guilty and ashamed for wanting more.\n\nI agree with Carmen Knudson-Martin, who comments in her article Why power matters: Creating a foundation of mutual support in couple relationships, Family Process, Vol. 52, No1, (2013), that therapists are not gender neutral and that successful couples therapy must include an understanding of the socio-cultural context couples live in, and the subtle power hierarchy within their relationship. I would go further and suggest that all therapy must include an understanding of the client's family system and the gender roles and expectations that have been passed down from generation to generation.\n\nWhat I needed from my now ex-therapist was a space in which to process the over-accommodating and self-neglect I have inherited from my mother and grandmother, and how these behavior patterns fitted beautifully with my husband's inherited male entitlement. Both of us come from families where wives feel duty-bound to accommodate and husbands do not feel duty-bound to listen to and emotionally support their wives. Thankfully my husband and I are changing this inherited pattern. I am the first woman in my family who is learning to be more self-accommodating, and my husband is the first male in his family who is learning to inquire after and honor what his wife needs.
On a hot morning in the summer of 2015, my partner, our newborn and myself piled into a friend's car and headed for our local Zen temple. We weren't going for the usual Sunday morning service, though it was at the same time. We were headed to the temple to get married.\n\nWhat made this a little unusual is that we had already gotten married, two years before, in a huge old church, surrounded by friends and family. We didn't split up and get back together, but we are a queer couple, and our home state of Michigan didn't legally recognize same-sex marriage until the Supreme Court forced them to.\n\nHeading to my second, now-legal wedding to the same person, I felt exasperated and ambivalent about the whole ordeal. As far as I was concerned, it was just about paperwork.\n\nAs soon as we'd gotten engaged before our first wedding, the questions started rolling in from well-meaning straight people in our lives. So how does that work, legally, in Michigan? was the most common one, a question that was either a polite way to ask What is the point of this wedding if you won't really be married afterward? or, more often than not, portrayed just how little people knew about the legal realities of being gay.\n\nApparently, while I might have sobbed my eyes out when in 2004 an amendment was added to our state constitution declaring marriage to be between one man and one woman, the enormity of that hadn't really registered for a lot of straight folks. I answered their questions by pointing out that most straight people viewed their wedding, and their marriage, as something much larger than a legal agreement. It was important for us to have a wedding, legality be damned, because we wanted to commit to sharing a life together. And so we did.\n\nWhile my partner and I are now both out as transgender ― my partner is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns and I am a trans man ― at the time of our first wedding we weren't even the slightest bit out. We read to the world as a lesbian couple, and we both wore lace dresses to tie the knot. I even borrowed my mother's veil. It was a beautiful day, and we made our promises and then danced the night away with our loved ones. It was everything I could have hoped for, except, you know, the legal privileges afforded to married people.\n\nAmy Young Cronkite Standing on the bridge where we got engaged, right after the first wedding in 2013.\n\nAt the time, many people assured us that eventually the tides would turn and we would get that coveted legal status. I wasn't so certain. As the gay marriage issue made its way through the courts, we were treated to the same tired old arguments again and again; namely that people like us weren't suitable to be parents, and therefore shouldn't get to file our taxes together either.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, our lives moved on. We decided to have a baby, and after a miserable pregnancy and grueling labor (I carried the pregnancy, my dedicated spouse carried basically everything else while I was too sick to function), we had one. We were flat broke, exhausted and trying to adjust to life with a newborn while my recovery got more and more complicated.\n\nI was in the hospital, again, this time to have my gallbladder removed, when the news broke. We could finally get married… even though we were already married. All of a sudden, people were congratulating us all over again.\n\nAnd so, like so many other queer people that summer, we rushed to get married. We certainly weren't the only ones who lacked the excitement that the media romanticized. This wasn't about finally getting to declare my love for someone, I had already done that. This was about legally binding our already combined lives. Annoyingly, the state didn't see it that way.\n\nYou can't get married just by signing a piece of paper. The government requires that you have some kind of ceremony, whether religious or civil. Lots of people that summer chose stripped-down courthouse weddings, but even those cost money. It was a relief when the lead teacher at our temple offered to perform a small ceremony for us, nothing major, for free.\n\nIt was only in the week before the wedding that we realized what we were in for. He wanted a copy of our vows, which we had to dig out of storage, and then he wanted to know what flowers might be suitable. I hadn't even invited my family, on the basis that it was just a technicality, but suddenly it was something more. The night before we picked out somewhat matching outfits: newsboy caps and jeans and vests.\n\nRob Ritzenhein Looking over my vows, while Chet whispers something in my ear, at the second wedding.\n\nAnd so, bleary-eyed and sleep-deprived from new parenthood, we got married. We passed the baby back and forth between us, at one point setting them down to sleep on a meditation mat. We stood in front of a room of people, about half of whom didn't realize they were about to be at a wedding at all, and re-read the vows we had written two years, and a lifetime, before.\n\nAnd that was when it hit me, the enormity of the promise to be with someone for as long as you live. In one very small way, it was a gift, to have that chance to slow down and remember that we were in love with each other. How many people would take the time to reaffirm their commitment to their spouse while caring for a brand new baby? I know I certainly wouldn't have without prompting.\n\nBeing forced to get married twice, while unjust, turned out to be a little bit of a blessing in disguise.\n\nThat baby is three years old now, and our lives have changed in a million ways. But that second wedding reminded me that change is actually the whole point of marriage ― you change together, you carry each other as you grow and shift. We have, like most people, become busier than we'd like, and most of the time our marriage is the background again. We often joke that we'll just keep getting married, every so often, just for the excuse to throw a party. Somedays I think, maybe we really should.\n\nDo you have a personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost? Find out what we're looking for here and send us a pitch!
Our long, scruffy national nightmare is over: Justin Bieber has shaved his mustache.\n\nThe pop star has been rocking a particularly bedraggled form of facial hair for a while now much to the dismay of his legion of fans and even wife Hailey Bieber, who wouldn't allow him to walk down the aisle at their wedding if said 'stache was present.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Justin Bieber (and his mustache) performs on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.\n\nAfter the internet banded together to urge the singer to keep a stiff upper lip (and shave his own), Bieber seemingly finally got the message and posted a series of videos of himself on Sunday in the bathroom with a razor.\n\nAs The Rolling Stones song Miss You and Kelly Clarkson's Since You Been Gone played in the background, the Yummy singer shaved his face clean in one fell swoop.\n\n.@JustinBieber documented the shaving of his mustache on his Instagram stories. 🤣 pic.twitter.com/T6OiRzJ6Ix — Pop Crave (@PopCraveMusic) February 16, 2020\n\nBieber seemed quite content with the new look, sharing a fresh-faced selfie on Instagram after the deed was done.\n\nBut he went on to tease his fans in the caption that the facial hair might make a return some day.\n\nI shaved, he captioned a photo of his baby face, before somewhat threateningly adding, MUSTASHIO went on holiday, but he will be back in due time.\n\nThe makeover won him major praise on social media with his wife chiming in with yeeeeee 😍, while Bieber's mother added in the comments, Ya praise God.\n\nWhere the hell is ricardo musatachio?? What have you done with him, manager Scooter Braun wrote.\n\nBeliebers online were similarly enthused with many gleefully posting about the transformation.\n\ni love justin bieber and all but thank god he shaved his mustache — vale (@valeeexv) February 16, 2020\n\nhe finally shaved my prayers got answered i am so thankful for this day i am so happy never thought this day would come but justin bieber realy shaved he did it best day of my life pic.twitter.com/6wFbPy5Wqg — morsal is streaming changes (@typicalbizzzle) February 16, 2020\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER FINALLY SHAVED YAAASSSKSKSKS WE WON SISLIEBERS pic.twitter.com/Oh1fuaF50K — MYRA / CHANGES OUT NOW (@forevesr) February 16, 2020\n\nThe 25-year-old at least has had a sense of humor about the ordeal.\n\nHe previously posted a photo with the @dudewithsign Instagram account about his refusal to shave, while promoting his latest work, Changes. The new album was released earlier this month along with a revealing 10-part docuseries, Justin Bieber: Seasons,″ that takes fans behind the curtain of the singer's sometimes-troubled public persona.\n\nThe album, Bieber says, is a love letter to his model wife, who's stuck by him through thick and thin ― no, we're not talking about his facial hair anymore.\n\nI got the best wife in the world. She supports me through so much. I'm really honored to be her husband, the singer recently told Apple Music's Beats 1 host Zane Lowe.\n\nThis is an album I wrote in the first year of our marriage, so it's so fresh, he continued. There's so much more to learn about commitment, and building trust, and foundation.

Earlier this month, Bermuda made history, and not in a good way. The territory claimed the dubious honor of becoming the first place to legalize and then overturn marriage equality. Bermuda Governor John Rankin, approved the Domestic Partnership Act 2017, a bill that essentially took away marriage equality and replaced it with civil partnerships.\n\nBermuda's government is justifying this breach of equality as a win-win, a way to appease social and religious conservatives and LGBTIQ people. And it was a compromise, of sorts: the majority of the public rejected any recognition of same-sex partnerships. In a nonbinding referendum in 2016, a year before the Bermuda Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, 69 percent of Bermudians voted against marriage equality. In that same referendum, 63 percent of voters rejected civil partnerships. The Domestic Partnership Act preserves civil partnerships, but this win-win has left LGBTIQ Bermudians feeling like second-class citizens.\n\nWhile the reversal in Bermuda is the first of its kind, we cannot assume that what happened here is an isolated case. To the contrary, Bermuda's backtracking sheds a light on where marriage equality stands globally, and where it is headed. Simply put, LGBTIQ people and our allies should be prepared for the long haul if we want to spread and protect marriage rights.\n\nIt is easy to forget, but the first country to legalize same-sex marriage — the Netherlands — did so only 17 years ago. Today, only 26 countries in the world allow same-sex marriages. Even in socially progressive countries like Switzerland, marriages are reserved for heterosexual couples, while same-sex couples only have the right to a civil union (polls show that a Swiss majority supports marriage equality, so most likely the law will follow suit in the not-too-distant future). And in the United States, it wasn't until 2011 that the share of adults who favored marriage equality outweighed those who opposed it, and merely by a margin of 1 percent — 46 percent in favor to 45 percent against. Only after this shift did marriage equality become a reality in more than a few states, before the Supreme Court made it legal nationwide in 2015.\n\nIn Bermuda, the ruling Progressive Labor party proposed the Domestic Partnership Act less than a year after same-sex marriage became legal in the British territory; the bill passed Bermuda's House of Assembly and the senate in December 2017. The Act needed only to be assented by Rankin to come into effect.\n\nIn other nations, anti-marriage campaigners have challenged court rulings that legalize same-sex marriage. In May 2017, Taiwan's constitutional court, the Judicial Yuan, ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry. The court gave the parliament two years to amend the civil code to reflect its decision, in the absence of which same-sex couples will be able to marry using the institutions that are already in place. The ruling was met with exuberant celebration, but also with visible homophobic backlash. On Feb. 15, 2018, the faith-based Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of the Family launched its second appeal against the Judicial Yuan's decision and filed a petition to Taiwan's Central Election Commission to hold a referendum on same-sex marriage.\n\nIn Latin and Central America, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled last month that all countries in its jurisdiction must enact marriage equality; backlash to this decision is already unfolding. Costa Rica, for example, saw relatively obscure presidential candidate Fabricio Alvarado propelled to the front of the polls after pledging to disobey the ruling and threatening to leave the Court's jurisdiction.\n\nMarriage is not the be-all and end-all; in fact, in most parts of the world, marriage rights are not the priority for LGBTIQ people. The community continues to face egregious and systematic human rights violations including extrajudicial killings; physical and verbal abuse; forced marriages; and discrimination in almost all aspects of life, including in housing, health care and education. Over 70 countries in the world still criminalize homosexuality, with punishments that can amount to 10 or more years in prison. Some countries even have the death penalty on the books.\n\nIn countries without straightforward sodomy laws — measures that render certain sexual acts illegal — other punitive laws are used to criminalize LGBTIQ people, including debauchery laws, public morality laws, laws against cross-dressing and other religion-based laws.\n\nWhile marriage equality advocates have made significant gains in less than two decades, global surveys indicate that in much of the world, homophobia and transphobia are pervasive. In some places, like Indonesia, Egypt and Chechnya, these attitudes and subsequent crackdowns on LGBTIQ people are intensifying. In 2017 alone, hundreds of LGBTIQ individuals worldwide were harassed, arrested, detained and tortured.\n\nUntil these these basic safety issues are resolved and greater protections are put in place to secure the security of LGBTIQ people, equal marriage will continue to be a distant dream for much of the world.\n\nMarriage equality should be neither the only bar by which to measure the rights of LGBTIQ people, nor for gauging how homophobic and transphobic a nation's policies and cultures are. Bermuda is a clear example of that; in many ways, life for LGBTIQ people is better there than in much of the world. The island has enacted laws prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and secures adoption and immigration rights for same-sex partners. Clearly, these priorities outweighed marriage equality. While the reversal on marriage rights is cause for concern, we can also stand to learn from the country's many accomplishments.\n\nDespite the many obstacles in achieving marriage equality, with time and advocacy, it will become more common. LGBTIQ people, their allies and organizations everywhere around the world will continue investing in and fighting for change. LGBTIQ people have overcome even the most shocking circumstances to change hearts and minds, and enact legislation that is more aligned with human rights principles. The trajectory of such change may not be linear, and while opponents to LGBTIQ rights argue the alternative, it will ultimately bend toward justice.\n\nRashima Kwatra is Communications Officer at OutRight Action International, an international LGBTIQ human rights advocacy organization.
In 1998, under the bright lights of Hollywood, a beautiful, funny, all-American girl and a handsome, charming, all-American guy met and fell in love.\n\nThose two people, Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt, got married, said some lovely things about one another in public and then ― like many celebrity couples ― got divorced. They had subsequent relationships (hi, Justin Theroux and Angelina Jolie), but their once-perfect union remained tabloid fodder throughout. People couldn't help but fantasize about an eventual reunion.\n\nNow, the dedicated enthusiasts who have obsessed over the ex-couple for the past two decades find themselves at a curious junction: Both Jen and Brad are single again. (Aniston announced her separation from Theroux on Thursday, while Pitt and Jolie split back in 2016.)\n\nLike clockwork, these shippers came out of the woodwork this week to demand Aniston and Pitt reignite their flame. But why? What makes people feel so invested in the fate of these two once-wedded blonds? What do they think they'll accomplish by tweet-begging for Brad to call Jen?\n\nWe weren't sure. So we asked a few experts to help.\n\nIllustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost Photos: Getty\n\nDr. Kathryn Smerling, a New York-based psychotherapist focused on transitory and crisis phases of life, told HuffPost that people feel personally involved in the reunion of Aniston and Pitt because, well, it's all fantasy.\n\nWhen there's hope that love is possible for a once-shattered marriage like Brad and Jennifer's, there's this fairytale-like feeling that happily ever after is possible for all of us, she said. We all think that what's happening to Hollywood couples is happening to us. We think to ourselves, 'If they can get through it, maybe I can, too!'\n\nBrad and Jennifer captured our hearts when they were together, she added. When we see a couple as admired as Jen and Brad were, it's like seeing our role models fail ― in turn that leaves us vulnerable, saddened, and fearing the worst.\n\nDr. Lindsay Henderson, PsyD, a psychologist who treats patients virtually via telehealth app LiveHealth Online, agrees. When something like a breakup or separation happens, she told HuffPost that the negative event does not match up to the fantasy image we prefer to have of their lives that we hold on to. The joyous events fit much more neatly into the perfect image that we have already created in our minds.\n\nOur over-identification with the celebrity ends up causing personal discomfort, and because we have elevated them to having achieved such enviable success, it can sometimes be more troubling to us when they fail than when people in our lives that we actually know and have relationships with fail, Henderson said.\n\nGregg DeGuire via Getty Images\n\nWhen Aniston and Pitt announced their separation back in January 2005, after nearly five years of marriage, the world mourned hard. Once news surfaced that Pitt had apparently fallen for his Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star Jolie, and reportedly left Aniston as a result, media coverage spiraled out of control. Did Pitt cheat on Aniston? Did Jolie pressure him into getting a divorce? Was Aniston OK?\n\nAnd it only escalated from there.\n\nA few months after the breakup announcement, Pitt was pictured with Jolie and her adopted son Maddox on a beach in Kenya. A year later, the pair announced they were expecting a child together. The headlines read: Angie's Joy, Jen's Pain, How She Stole Brad, Jen Breaks Down. It was the love triangle heard 'round the world ― apparently, it still is.\n\nCue the Pitt-Aniston reunion campaign on social media:\n\nJennifer Aniston: single ✔️\n\nBrad Pitt: single ✔️ pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz — Mrs. Robot (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018\n\nSo Brad and Jen are totally getting back together, right? #exofmyexismyex pic.twitter.com/zRXo7HlFLc — Kennedy Elsey (@downtownkennedy) February 15, 2018\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are separating, which can only mean one thing: even more tabloid covers like THIS pic.twitter.com/HDq42QIAxo — Sadie Gennis (@sadiegennis) February 15, 2018\n\ni mean i fundamentally agree, but the gossip in me wants brad + jen to get back together and then tell all in a tasteful vanity fair cover — Alex Bruce-Smith (@alexbrucesmith) February 15, 2018\n\nMe: *reading about Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux split* awww that sucks\n\nAlso me: planning Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt's second wedding — Ally Reid (@ashallann) February 16, 2018\n\nWhen asked why they craved another Jen-Brad romance, Twitter users happily provided their own answers.\n\nThey look good together and seem like a good match, Mike Starcher said. We want them to be happy.\n\nI honestly think that they have always still had feelings for each other, Allison Alderton added.\n\nIt's obviously very private and none of our business but life would come to full circle for both of them, Kushbu S. Mehta explained. Blame the number of Mills and Boons I've read in school! #hopelessromantic.\n\nBefore deleting their tweet, a user with the display name Pantera Negra said it simply: Want two hot people to do it.\n\nAnd then there were the dissenters. Cherie MacDonald said, He cheated on her, why would she want to be with him again? There is someone perfect out there for Jennifer but it's not Brad in my opinion.\n\nI would rather Angelina date Justin, Will English joked over text, or become BFF with Jen, like Debbie Reynolds and Liz Taylor.\n\nLiving vicariously through other people to make up for the voids in their own lives I would think is the real reason. Whether they realise it or not. — Lee (@EaRthQuAk5) February 16, 2018\n\nUltimately, Smerling believes we get hooked on what happens next in a celebrity's life in the same way we get hooked on soap operas or reality TV. We're obsessed with the drama and the scandal, she said. For some people, it ― albeit, unfortunately ― is like a drug. We as a society are addicted to escapism in many forms, and celebrity fanatics are no exception.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's damaging for people to invest in a celebrity couple so passionately.\n\nThe inclination to get wrapped up is totally natural. But our cardboard-cutout culture has de-humanized celebrities, to the point where they're perfect in our eyes. That's where it takes an unnatural turn, she said. We have forgotten that they're human and experience real emotion, real depression and certainly real mental health issues. And it's because we think they're perfect that we lack sympathy, and automatically resort to feeling giddy when the plot thickens in their lives.\n\nHenderson agrees.\n\nIt is good to remind ourselves that celebrities are normal people facing the same basic human emotions and struggles that everyone else does, especially if you find your emotional responses to events in their lives seeming a bit disproportionate, she told HuffPost. These are normal people who experience the same emotions as everyone else, but generally speaking with a much larger bank account with which to live their glamorous lives.
We could listen to Adele talk about love and relationships all day.\n\nDuring a recent concert in Brisbane, Australia, the singer got real about the inspiration behind one of her biggest hits, Someone Like You. Adele wrote the beautiful-but-heart-wrenching breakup song to help her feel better about herself after a terrible split.\n\nThe Oscar-winner admitted she felt bitter after the breakup, but explained, I was trying to remember how it was I felt at the beginning of the relationship that inspired that record because as bad as a breakup can be, as bitter and horrible and messy as it can be, that feeling when you first fall for someone is the best feeling on earth, and I am addicted to that feeling.\n\nThen she not-so-subtly sent some serious love (and again seemingly confirmed her marriage) to her longtime partner Simon Konecki saying, Obviously, I can't go through those feelings because I'm married now. I've found my next person.\n\nAs I'm getting older, a lot of my friends are finishing their first marriages ― not me! But they are! ― shit, she joked. I see how much they hate who they're married to, who they have kids with. And I'm not in that position and I can't relate to that right now and I hope I never do.\n\nEarlier this year, Adele appeared to confirm her marriage to Konecki during one of her acceptance speeches at the Grammys. The couple, who have 4-year-old son Angelo together, have been dating for five years.\n\nIt was rumored the two tied the knot at some point in early 2017, when a photo of the Water Under The Bridge singer wearing a gold band on her ring finger started circulating in January. The photo led many to believe she and Konecki had secretly married. At the time, Adele's reps refused to address the speculation, but it seems like we've got all the proof we need now.

Head tilt? Check. Sullen eyes? Double check. Iconic wardrobe? Yep, that sure looks like Princess Diana.\n\nWhile some feared that casting Kristen Stewart as the former Lady Diana Spencer in a biopic might spell disaster given the spotty track record of portrayals of the princess on the big screen, the actor looks positively royal in the first look at Pablo Larrain's Spencer.\n\nIn the photo released Wednesday, Stewart channels Diana as she solemnly stares out the window, dressed in a red blazer and black blouse with a matching hat and fascinator, which sits atop her signature feathered shag.\n\nThe Twilight alum will star as the late princess in an upcoming biographical movie from the Jackie filmmaker that focuses on a critical weekend in the early 1990s, when she ultimately decides her marriage to Prince Charles is beyond repair.\n\nKristen Stewart is Diana, Princess of Wales, in Pablo Larraín's SPENCER. pic.twitter.com/ldpNLOGhOt — NEON (@neonrated) January 27, 2021\n\nDecember, 1991: The Prince and Princess of Wales' marriage has long since grown cold, the film's official synopsis reads. Though rumours of affairs and a divorce abound, peace is ordained for the Christmas festivities at Sandringham Estate. There's eating and drinking, shooting and hunting. Diana knows the game. This year, things will be a whole lot different.\n\nPrincipal photography on the project has already begun with filming taking place in Germany and the United Kingdom. The film, which also stars Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins and Sean Harris, is expected to launch in fall 2021, a year before the 25th anniversary of Diana's death.\n\nStewart teased that the film is a dive inside an emotional imagining of who Diana was at a pivotal turning point in her life, as the princess wrestles with an identity crisis of sorts.\n\nIt is a physical assertion of the sum of her parts, which starts with her given name; Spencer, she continued in the press release. It is a harrowing effort for her to return to herself, as Diana strives to hold onto what the name Spencer means to her.\n\nThe Charlie's Angels star recently pulled back the curtain on how she prepared to play the late royal, revealing that mastering Diana's unmistakable lilt was the biggest challenge.\n\nThe accent is intimidating as all hell because people know that voice, and it's so, so distinct and particular, Stewart told InStyle magazine in October, explaining that she consulted a slew of biographies and texts as part of her research. I'm working on it now and already have my dialect coach.\n\nIt's one of the saddest stories to exist ever, and I don't want to just play Diana — I want to know her implicitly, she continued. I haven't been this excited about playing a part, by the way, in so long.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Bob Dylan, Kesha and Valerie June are among the musicians and singers reimagining classic love songs as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender anthems in a new album released on Thursday.\n\nThe six-song Universal Love album is meant to give the community songs that reflect their own gender identity by flipping pronouns or having male and female singers reverse traditional roles.\n\nDylan, the Nobel Prize-winning composer and performer, covers He's Funny That Way, a standard sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Diana Ross that has also been part of Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby's songbooks as She's Funny That Way.\n\nGuitarist and singer St. Vincent, who has said publicly she identifies as neither gay nor straight, performs And Then She Kissed Me, a version of girl group The Crystals' 1963 hit Then He Kissed Me.\n\nThe great thing about music is that it transcends all the barriers and boundaries, and goes right to peoples' hearts, St. Vincent said.

Whispers of a reconciliation have been swirling ever since their separation, as the two have been regularly spotted in public together with their three children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.\n\nJen has called off the divorce, a source allegedly close to Garner told the magazine. She really wants to work things out with Ben. They are giving things another try.\n\nAccording to People, the two aren't officially back together yet, but apparently both Affleck and Garner decided to put the divorce on hold.\n\nThe two stars separated in June of 2015 amid rumors that pegged Affleck as the guilty party for an alleged affair with the couple's nanny. Garner later shot down speculation that extramarital activities had contributed to their split in a refreshingly candid interview for Vanity Fair, explaining that their problems began long before nannygate.\n\nDespite high-profile interviews about their decision to divorce, Garner and Affleck have continued to live on their shared Los Angeles property over much of the past 20 months, co-parenting their children and even vacationing around the world together over the holidays.\n\nThere is always a chance of reconciliation. They love each other, the source added. They also really, really love their kids, and those kids love their parents.\n\nListen, if these two have the strength to endure years of public scrutiny, a nanny scandal, Batman v Superman and still want to be together, more power to them.\n\nThe Huffington Post has reached out to Garner's and Affleck's representatives and will update this post accordingly.\n\nDon't go yet!

Peter Dazeley via Getty Images\n\nPrenuptial agreements are on the rise, particularly among millennials.\n\nIn a recent survey of American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, 62 percent of the lawyers polled said they saw an increase in the number of clients seeking prenups during the previous three years. And more than half of the attorneys said they'd seen an uptick in the number of millennials requesting prenuptial agreements.\n\nThe prevalence of prenups doesn't make asking your partner to sign one any easier, though. To make the conversation less thorny, we asked divorce attorneys to share their advice for best ways to ask for a fair, equitable prenup.\n\n1. Have the conversation as early as possible.\n\nThis is a delicate, uncomfortable conversation, but if it's something that genuinely matters to you, you owe it to your partner to bring it up as soon as possible, said Lisa Helfend Meyer, a family law attorney in Los Angeles.\n\nIn fact, bring up the subject when you are still dating, Meyer said. That way, you can gauge your partner's reaction to one. If the reaction is to move to the other room, then you know you will need to handle with extra sensitivity.\n\n2. Know that it's going to be a weird, heavy conversation.\n\nThere's no way around it: Broaching the subject is going to cause some tension in your relationship, said Atlanta-based divorce attorney Randall Kessler. In his 30 years in family law, he's rarely heard of a prenup conversation that's been hiccup-free.\n\nI've heard all kinds of approaches. What usually seems to work best is the truth, Kessler said. Say something along the lines of, 'My family and I have always discussed and agreed that if I or my brother ever got married, we would sign a prenup,' or, 'My best friend went through a horrible divorce and all he can remember from it is his lawyer saying, 'If only you had signed a prenuptial agreement.'\n\nIf you communicate your wishes in an open and honest way, and your S.O. respects that, you're very likely on the road to a solid relationship, Kessler added.\n\n3. Emphasize how much of a headache you'll be saving yourselves later.\n\nUltimately, a prenup has the power to uncomplicate a messy, knotty personal situation, said Carla Schiff Donnelly, an attorney in Pittsburgh.\n\nEmphasize the fact that a prenup will simplify a divorce and make it quicker, less expensive and less emotionally taxing, Donnelly told HuffPost. That will benefit both your fiancée and any future children.\n\n4. Remind your partner that all relationships end one way or another. You're just trying to make the inevitable easier.\n\nOne way to introduce the idea of a prenup is to talk about how you'd each want to be treated at the end of your marriage, said Katherine Eisold Miller, a divorce attorney in New Rochelle, New York.\n\nAll marriages end, one way or another. Instead of saying, 'I can't marry you until we have a prenup,' try framing it this way: 'At the end of our marriage, whether it ends in death, as we anticipate, or divorce, what would be important to you and how would you like to be treated?'\n\nThen, pivot and ask your partner if they'd be open to hearing what would matter most to you in either case.\n\nA prenup should do something for both people and give them some certainty in difficult times, Eisold Miller said. A conversation like this allows for both voices to be heard.\n\n5. Point out that a good prenup benefits the lower-earning spouse, too.\n\nIf you're worried about coming across as greedy or penny-pinching by bringing this up, remember that a carefully written, thoughtful prenup protects both parties, Kessler said.\n\nSometimes, the prenuptial agreement is even more valuable to the less-wealthy spouse because it gives him or her some security about finances in the event of a divorce, he said.\n\n6. Suggest that you co-create the agreement.\n\nDon't make this a weird power play: Both partners should be active participants in drafting the prenup to ensure that it's equitable, said Dennis A. Cohen, a family law attorney and mediator in Marina del Rey, California.\n\nThe trick is to make this a co-created agreement that deals with both of your concerns, not just the partner who has substantially more income or assets than the other, Cohen said. It may be helpful to have a neutral mediator help you reach an agreement that addresses both of your needs and desires.\n\nRegardless of how you go about it, end the conversation with a promise to be fair and reasonable throughout the process, and actively listen to your partner's concerns.
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa ― The news that Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had died on Monday at 81 years old brought South Africa to a standstill almost as dramatic as that which greeted the death of her husband, Nelson Mandela, five years ago. In an outpouring of memory and grief, she was hailed as a co-liberator of South Africa and the mother of the nation, as he was the father of the nation.\n\nAt her home in Soweto, crowds gathered as quickly and spontaneously as they had gathered outside Nelson Mandela's Johannesburg home when he died.\n\nAs with Nelson Mandela, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's death was announced with gravitas by the presidency. This time, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa hailed her role as a heroine of the struggle and said she had lived a rich and remarkable life.\n\nMadikizela-Mandela died a political figure as resonant in South Africa today as Nelson Mandela is. Indeed, his politics of peace, reconciliation and non-racialism are regarded with skepticism by a new generation, whereas her radical focus on African nationalism, land reform and militance make her legacy a less contested one these days.\n\nThis is because South Africa's movement toward greater equality, more muscular land transfers and harmonious race relations has often been a tortured journey. And so with her death, Madikizela-Mandela's legacy is quickly being reassessed. Her path, many believe, may have delivered the fruits of freedom more quickly than Mandela's path, which favored peace and reconciliation over the more militant road that Madikizela-Mandela often said the African National Congress should not have forsaken.\n\nShe was the archetypal good bad woman. Her ungovernable, take-no-prisoners style is well-loved in South Africa where heroines are often crafted from the tough streets of political and social struggle. The website South African History Online tells the first page of her story like this:\n\nOnce, while quarreling with her younger sister, Princess, Winnie fashioned a knuckleduster out of a nail and a baking powder tin and accidentally struck her sister across the face while aiming for her arm. It was one of many instances for which her mother administered a hefty beating.\n\nShe was politicized while very young. One tale is that she begged her father to attend a welcome home ceremony for soldiers after the Second World War, but at the city hall, they were not allowed in because it was for whites only.\n\nIt was one of the many instances of oppression and segregation that created the freedom fighter who would someday be chronicled in books and films. Madikizela-Mandela chose social work as her field because it allowed her to both care for her community and organize politically.\n\nShe was drawn into the circles of ANC politics when she shared digs with Adelaide Tsukudu, who was then courting the ANC Youth League leader Oliver Tambo, who was then a partner at law with Nelson Mandela. Their introduction led to a marriage that lasted some four decades and a love that, arguably, did not end until he died. Madikizela-Mandela was at his bedside when Mandela died and, along with his widow Graça Machel, mourned him as a husband in the long days of official memorials and funerals that followed.\n\nThe two Mandelas were absolute equals. It is worth reiterating that Winnie was already politically interested and involved in activism long before she met her future husband. She was particularly affected by the research she had carried out in Alexandra Township as a social worker to establish the rate of infantile mortality, which stood at 10 deaths for every 1,000 births, notes SA History Online.\n\nIn the 1980s, released from government banishment, Madikizela-Mandela took to heart Tambo's injunction to make apartheid South Africa ungovernable. Ungovernability, arguably, became an indelible and attractive part of her persona, both personal and political. As SA History Online explains:\n\nWhilst Nelson and his Robben Island coterie had become more academic and statesman-like during their years cut off from grassroots politics, Winnie, on the other hand, was forced to become a soldier on the ground. During her decades of police intimidation and harassment; her emotional brutalization (having had her family torn apart and her closest friends betray her); and her physical imprisonment and banishment, Winnie had developed combative defenses against a world that was unfailingly hostile. Since the latter stages of her exile, rumors had begun to circulate about Winnie's increasingly erratic behavior; her recourse to drink and her occasional bouts of violent behavior. Once established in Soweto, these rumors refused to dissipate and her frequent public appearances in khaki uniform did little to quell speculation that her approach to liberation was becoming increasingly military driven and violent.\n\nHaving been targeted by repeated banning orders and left alone as a very young woman to care for her children while Nelson Mandela was on trial and then imprisoned, Madikizela-Mandela went through a winter of discontent in the '80s, when a soccer club that she helped launch to get young people off the streets turned into a vicious vigilante group.\n\nThe Mandela United Football Club used its political protection to undertake a reign of terror in Soweto, and the lid was blown wide open when 14-year-old Stompie Seipei died after falling out with the rest of the crew. It was believed that Seipei had been kidnapped and tortured by the club, along with three other young people. At trial, Madikizela-Mandela herself was sentenced to five years imprisonment related to those events, a punishment that was later commuted to a lesser sentence.\n\nIt was the worst of times for Madikizela-Mandela, and yet it intersected with a moment of rare elation when Nelson Mandela was released in 1990 after nearly three decades in prison. One of the world's most iconic images remains that of Mandela leaving prison firmly holding his wife's hand, both of them with raised fists. That unity was not to last, as the couple divorced when Mandela was stung by his wife's affair with Dali Mpofu, then her deputy in the ANC's social welfare department.\n\nThough divorced, however, the two were never alienated from each other. Madikizela-Mandela remained a constant in the statesman's life, through his subsequent marriage to Graça Machel and through his long illness.\n\nAs a deputy minister and as an ANC member of parliament, Madikizela-Mandela was a total rebel against the strictures and protocol of formal political life. She was a serial truant in parliament and, truth be told, a very poor deputy minister. Far more powerful for her was the battlefield of street struggle and other arenas where she could sit on a people's pulpit and criticize what she believed was the compradorist politics of the ANC.\n\nEnormously popular in the ANC (she always ended up at the top of the party's leaderboards for national executive positions), she remained a vote-puller to the very end, although many felt that her politics had increasingly become more suited to those of the radical Economic Freedom Fighters (she is a heroic figure to that young party). The EFF is a splinter party from the governing ANC. It practices a brand of politics that is a copycat of the Latin American revolutionary parties of Cuba and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. It won 6.5 percent of the vote in the last election, but its circle of influence is much wider.\n\nWinnie Madikizela was a complicated figure. But as she breathed her last after a battle with complications arising from diabetes, her spot in the heroes' acre was secured, and her legacy is not nearly as contested now as it had been in the days she entered the heart of darkness.
WASHINGTON -- In the rush to present a legislative response to last year's terrorist attacks in Paris, lawmakers passed a bill in December denying visa-free entry into the U.S. to foreigners who are dual nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria -- or who have visited any of those countries in the past five years.\n\nUnder the current visa waiver program, citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe, can visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without undergoing the lengthy process of applying for a visa. But under the changes, people from these exempted countries who also happen to be citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria would be forced to obtain one.\n\nThe new visa waiver restrictions aim to ensure that people with ties to countries thought to pose a terror threat cannot travel to the U.S. with minimal screening. But the short-sighted legislation affects a slew of people who have never traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria and who have no ties to terrorist groups.\n\nBecause Iranian, Sudanese and Syrian nationality is inherited from one's father rather than determined by one's country of birth, even individuals who have never traveled to any of the four blacklisted countries could lose their visa-free travel privileges, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The law doesn't bar these individuals from visiting the U.S., but they have to get a visa first -- a more time-intensive process.\n\nDespite civil rights groups' opposition, the bill passed 407-19 in the House in December, with the Obama administration's support. It was later tacked onto the must-pass omnibus spending bill at the end of the year and then signed into law.\n\nBefore the visa waiver changes even became law, members of Congress began to have misgivings about their support for the bill. Thirty-three House Democrats, including 13 who voted in favor of it, wrote to Senate leaders less than a week later, warning that the bill could have unintended consequences.\n\nSpecifically, the signatories of the letter said that the new provisions discriminated against people based on their ancestry and could affect people who had legitimate reasons to travel to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria as journalists or on business.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced last week that it can waive the restrictions for journalists, humanitarian workers and people conducting business in any of the four countries -- but the exemptions are considered on a case-by-case basis and do not offer guaranteed protection to people who have these specific reasons to travel.\n\nA group of five House Republicans slammed the possible exemptions as inappropriate and contrary to the plain language of the end-of-year bill in a letter sent Thursday to President Barack Obama.\n\nMeanwhile, some members of Congress who initially supported the bill are now pushing to reverse the provision that applies to dual nationals.\n\nOn Jan. 14, Reps. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) introduced a different bill that would remove the prohibition on dual nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria. Amash and Massie supported the initial visa waiver changes in December, while Conyers and Dingell voted against them. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are backing a parallel measure in the Senate.\n\nIn a press release announcing the new measure, Durbin explicitly acknowledged that the initial visa waiver changes weren't sufficiently thought through. The unfair provision was rushed through the House in the wake of the horrific terror attacks in Paris, and won't make our country safer, he wrote.\n\nIt's far from certain that the new bill will gain enough support from Republicans to pass and replace the language passed in December. The website GovTrack gives it a seven percent chance of passing. In the meantime, the unintended consequences of the visa waiver changes are all too clear.\n\nI officially feel like a sub-EU citizen: my #ESTA visa now reads not authorized to travel to US under #VisaWaiver Program #HR158 — Ellie Geranmayeh (@EllieGeranmayeh) January 22, 2016\n\nEllie Geranmayeh, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, tweeted that the changes made her feel like a sub-EU citizen.\n\nBBC reporter Rana Rahimpour, who was born in Iran and is a British citizen, told The New York Times that she has been unable to safely travel to Iran because of her work with the BBC -- making her ineligibility to travel to the U.S. without a waiver particularly ironic.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis told U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday that he was praying that God would guide his efforts to bring reconciliation in the United States, while the nation's bishops condemned Biden's pro-choice stand on abortion.\n\nIn a message sent shortly after the second Catholic U.S. president was sworn in, Francis also said he hoped Biden would work towards a society marked by true justice, freedom and respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those with no voice.\n\nUnder your leadership, may the American people continue to draw strength from the lofty political, ethical and religious values that have inspired the nation since its founding, Francis said.\n\nI likewise ask God, the source of all wisdom and truth, to guide your efforts to foster understanding, reconciliation and peace within the United States and among the nations of the world in order to advance the universal common good, he said.\n\nThree days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Congress by supporters of former president Donald Trump, Francis said the violence had left him astonished.\n\nIn Wednesday's message to Biden, the pope said the grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses.\n\n(L'Osservatore Romano/Pool photo via AP) Pope Francis meets then Vice President Joe Biden at the Vatican on April 29, 2016.\n\nIn a statement released at the same time, the president of the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, pledged that the bishops will continue to fight Biden over his position on several moral issues, mainly abortion.\n\nBiden, like many other Catholic politicians, has said he is personally against abortion but cannot impose his position on others.\n\nGomez praised Biden for what he called the new president's moving witness on how his faith brought him solace in times of tragedy and his commitment to the poor but said bishops had to proclaim all the truth of the Gospel.\n\nSo, I must point out that our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender, Gomez said.\n\nMany Catholic conservatives supported Trump. Francis had a rocky relationship with Trump, disagreeing with him on a series of issues including immigration and climate change.
When Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) announced her candidacy for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination, she did something that would have been unheard of in previous election cycles: She explicitly criticized Silicon Valley's big technology companies.\n\nFor too long the big tech companies have been telling you, 'Don't worry! We've got your back!' while your identities are being stolen and your data is mined, Klobuchar said.\n\nShe isn't the only Democrat running for president with a critique of Big Tech. In fact, every major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has issued some form of statement critical of the industry or introduced legislation that would crack down on its most abusive practices.\n\nThat's a huge shift for a party whose leaders have spent the last 30 years basking in the glow of the valley's mythology of innovation and entrepreneurship, courting tech titans for their support and campaign contributions. It's a marriage that reached its peak during the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nStephen Maturen via Getty Images Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) criticized the tech industry when she announced her bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\n\nObama was the first president who really got Silicon Valley ― and Silicon Valley got him. He brought tech insiders to Washington to bring their new ideas into government and streamline inefficient and outdated government technology infrastructure. And political hands went through the revolving door to work for those same tech companies.\n\nHillary Clinton, Obama's first secretary of state and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, made technology and the internet a central part of her foreign policy, advocating that tech adoption would advance democracy. Her presidential campaign's tech policy was a love letter to Silicon Valley, according to Recode.\n\nNow, that's over, said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank that has called for the government to break up Google, Facebook and Amazon. Nobody thinks Big Tech is generally good ― or everybody has to at least acknowledge that they're a problem. Nobody can say we need more Google in government.\n\nThe Democratic Party's diversion from Silicon Valley veneration to pointed criticism has coincided with a so-called Techlash ― the public backlash against tech industry abuses of user privacy, consumer protection and, most importantly, their market position.\n\nCongress has spotlighted these abuses in a series of hearings over the past two years. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives faced questions from lawmakers about a range of issues, from foreign countries using their platforms to manipulate U.S. political sentiment to the failure to protect user privacy to whether or not the companies constituted monopolies.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one leading Democratic presidential candidate, was out ahead of the pack in 2016 with a stinging critique of Big Tech.\n\nShe criticized Google, Apple and Amazon for using their platforms as a tool to snuff out competition and compared the tech giants to too big to fail financial institutions at an event at the New America Foundation, the Google-funded think tank whose then-chairman was ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The speech launched a row where Google complained to the think tank about the speech and eventually led to the expulsion of antitrust scholars there who would go on to found the Open Markets Institute.\n\nWarren's call for greater antitrust scrutiny of giant tech companies helped inform the Democratic Party's adoption of anti-monopoly policies in its 2018 campaign platform. And many of her fellow candidates have since echoed her concerns.\n\nKlobuchar has led on these anti-monopoly issues in the Senate from her perch as the ranking member on the antitrust subcommittee. She introduced legislation in 2017 that would ban companies with market capitalization above $100 billion from making any new acquisitions. While not specifically targeting Silicon Valley, the market cap limit in her bill would include the Big Four tech giants ― Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who announced his presidential bid on Tuesday, previously released a set of videos featuring Stacy Mitchell, an antitrust expert at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, explaining the impact of Amazon's monopoly power.\n\nEven 2020 candidates with strong tech ties like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have changed their tone. Booker has close ties to the industry from his time at Stanford University, raised $100 million in charitable donations from Facebook's Zuckerberg to the Newark public school system, and previously ran a tech start-up. But he is now calling for regulators to consider breaking up companies like Google and criticized Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.\n\nAnadolu Agency via Getty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is one of many Silicon Valley executives to testify before Congress about the many abuses in the powerful industry.\n\nThe U.S. government should be far more active in antitrust actions because when they have taken actions, it's often created collateral benefits to society, Booker said in a 2017 interview.\n\nIt's not just monopoly concerns that 2020 candidates are focusing on in their critiques of Big Tech.\n\nKlobuchar crafted a bipartisan data privacy bill with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) and alongside Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) introduced the Honest Ads Act, which would require social platforms to disclose political advertising.\n\nSanders targeted Amazon for failing to pay its workers a living wage with legislation pointedly named after the company's CEO Jeff Bezos. One month after Sanders introduced the bill, Amazon announced it would pay its warehouse workers a $15 minimum wage.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) opposed New York giving Amazon tax breaks to locate a new headquarters in Queens. Amazon canceled the deal amid intense local opposition.\n\nAnd Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has raised concerns about federal police and immigration agencies that use facial recognition technologies. She also grilled Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg last year over the social media giant's inability to police hate speech and white supremacy on its platform.\n\nThat exchange drew attention to Facebook's inability to fully grasp how its desire to promote the most engaging content to users could be easily gamed by people promoting white supremacy or other hate-filled ideologies.\n\nIt was also symbolic of the changing relationship of the Democratic Party and Silicon Valley: a northern California senator chastising a powerful tech executive who just two years prior had been on Clinton's shortlist for secretary of the treasury.
Helen Viola Jackson, the last known widow of a Civil War soldier, has died at 101.\n\nShe died Dec. 16 at Webco Manor Nursing Home in Marshfield, Missouri, where she had been a resident for many years, according to a statement on her Facebook page.\n\nIn 1936, when Jackson was 17 years old, she married James Bolin, a 93-year-old widower who served in the 14th Missouri Cavalry during the Civil War.\n\nThe war ended in 1865, 156 years ago.\n\nJackson's father had volunteered her to stop by Bolin's house each day to help with chores on her way home from school. Bolin did not want to accept charity and after a period of time, asked her to marry him in order to provide for her future, according to the statement.\n\nHe said that he would leave me his Union pension, Jackson told the historian Hamilton C. Clark in an interview. It was during the Depression and times were hard. He said that it might be my only way of leaving the farm.\n\nThey had a small ceremony in front of a few witnesses at Bolin's home in Niangua, Missouri. Bolin told his wife the marriage would be on her terms, and she continued to live on her family's farm and retained her surname, the statement said.\n\nBolin died on June 18, 1939, less than three years after the two wed.\n\nHe had recorded the wedding in his personal Bible, which is now part of a rotating exhibit on Jackson that has traveled to several museum locations, according to a post on the Missouri Cherry Blossom Festival website.\n\nJackson never applied for the pension or remarried.\n\nShe had been private about her story until 2017, when she shared details while working on the details of her funeral with her minister, according to the Missouri Cherry Blossom Festival.\n\nHow do you explain that you have married someone with such a difference in age, she reportedly said at the 2018 Missouri Cherry Blossom Festival. I had great respect for Mr. Bolin and I did not want him to be hurt by the scorn of wagging tongues.\n\nJackson was a prominent figure in her local community, serving as a charter member of the Elkland Independent Methodist Church and Cherry Blossom Festival Auxiliary, a member of the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic, and numerous other groups, according to the Cherry Blossom Festival site.\n\nShe was a 2018 honoree on the Missouri Walk of Fame.\n\nThe Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War issued a statement on Jan. 2 ordering 30 days of remembrance.\n\nBefore Jackson shared her history, Maudie Hopkins was believed to be the last known surviving widow of a Civil War soldier. She died in 2008. She married Confederate veteran William Cantrell when she was 19 and he was 86.
It was 7 p.m. by the time my husband got home from work ― delayed by a stop-off at the grocery store to pick up the necessities: milk, eggs, Kotex pads (the long ones).\n\nPerched on an exercise ball in the middle of our living room, a warm towel fresh from the dryer splayed on my lap as I folded laundry, my welcome home greeting was followed by a request. Can you make dinner, please?\n\nShedding his wool coat and shooting the cuffs of his collared work shirt up his arms, he nodded, already shoving his fingers beneath the running tap water to ready for dinner prep. On it.\n\nThis is where I've gotten used to adding a quick dash of humility, a sign that I feel guilty for having trumpeted my good fortune. I married a mensch who matches his own socks and our daughter's, too! I'm hashtag blessed!\n\nTranslation: I'm sorry if you spend hours cooking, doing laundry and scrubbing toilets while your partner sits on the couch watching a football game or playing video games. I don't mean to rub my shared workload in your face like a jerk.\n\nThe word I tend to hear when I let slip that my husband makes homemade cinnamon rolls or stows his own socks in his drawers is lucky.\n\nWow, the women — it's always other women — say. You're lucky. I wish my husband did that.\n\nFrom the looks of a recent study published in the journal Gender and Society, we are certainly outliers in my house. Reviewing survey data from around the nation covering the years 1976 to 2016, researchers from the University of Chicago found that while attitudes in the U.S. have become more focused on a workload balance that's equal across genders, a majority of Americans still believe cisgender women should do more homemaking and child-rearing. And while studies show the average modern dad is spending three times as much time on childcare as our granddads were in 1965, that three times as much is still just a self-reported (with wide margin for error) eight hours a week.\n\nOur understanding wasn't automatic. It's been hard-earned. Now I ask, but that's only after years of demanding.\n\nRaised by a mother who largely stayed at home and a husband who liked it that way, my husband knew little about home labor when we were first married, and even less about cooking. I still tease him about the mess he made out of an attempt to prepare Lipton noodles before we were married, on a night when my maid of honor and I sat, camped in our living room, piecing together centerpieces for our wedding.\n\nOur understanding wasn't automatic. It's been hard-earned. Now I ask, but that's only after years of demanding.\n\nFor much of our first few years of marriage, I worked 60-hour weeks as a newspaper reporter and hours at home too: cooking, cleaning and collecting his dirty, crumpled socks from the spot on the living room floor.\n\nThe birth of our daughter was the proverbial straw. She screamed. She pooped. She clutched at me with her pincer-like fingers, pleading for me to hold her at every second.\n\nThe louder she cried, the louder my voice became. Please, clean out the dishwasher. Please stir the cheese sauce. Please make the cheese sauce. Please don't make me say please.\n\nIn those early days of parenting, I turned passive-aggressive, angrily ignoring towers of dishes in the sink or laundry piles on the bathroom floor, treating him to increasing amounts of silence as days passed without him making a move to clear either and life with a baby created mountains more of each. He'd ask me what was wrong, and I'd grunt out nothing or I don't want to talk about it.\n\nWhat I meant was Everything is wrong. Why can't you just see that I need help?\n\nWhat he heard was me closing a door, refusing to let him inside. He couldn't read my mind. He certainly didn't know I just wanted a load of laundry run and dishes stacked in the dishwasher.\n\nHis attempts to fix things were sloppy but well-intended: bags of my favorite candy brought home from the grocery store to cheer me up, calls home to see if I'd like him to pick up pizza for dinner. They'd work to thaw my frosty demeanor, and I'd take care of the dishes, the laundry, the vacuuming and the dusting. But then the house would start to get messy again, and the cycle would repeat itself.\n\nWe talked. I screamed. We even went to couples' counseling.\n\nIt was through arguing that I learned that he wanted me to speak up more. Arguing (not fighting) was productive for us because we communicated, we used our words. The more I learned to spell out in words what I needed, the better he became at anticipating my needs.\n\nAt 18 years, our marriage is still imperfect. But we're loving and we're learning.\n\nI am the primary breadwinner, with a salary that has outpaced my husband's in all but two years of our 18-year marriage — the years immediately after the birth of our child. I do some of the household chores, but when I work my second and sometimes third jobs, he does even more.\n\nWhat he heard was me closing a door, refusing to let him inside. He couldn't read my mind. He certainly didn't know I just wanted a load of laundry run and dishes stacked in the dishwasher.\n\nHe is the baker of fragrant loaves of fresh bread on weekends and thick, homemade sauces on weeknights, the one who returns home from work late in the evening after trips to the grocery store and turns to the stove to prepare wholesome (and sometimes not-so-wholesome) meals for our family of three.\n\nAnd yet I'm no more lucky than the hundreds of thousands of men whose wives come home from long days of paid toil only to shed their coats and roll up their sleeves to turn to the domestic work that remains ― to this day ― an expectation of their gender.\n\nI'm not lucky. I'm equal.\n\nFor our daughter, raised in a home where Mom has always worked three jobs to Dad's one, this is the norm. Mom may spend the evening in her office, editing photos from a recent family portrait shoot (one of those three jobs is as a photographer), while Dad runs a mop over the dining room floor and readies a lasagna for the oven. Mom may rest on the couch on a Sunday afternoon, book in hand, exhausted after working five long days at her day job and then spending Saturday shooting a wedding, while Dad mows the backyard.\n\nShe sees parents who have figured out an equitable rhythm. That's wonderful, but it's not lucky.\n\nLucky is finding the four-leaf clover. Lucky is winning on a scratch-off ticket. Lucky is making it through the intersection before the light turns red.\n\nTo say it's lucky that my 40-something husband can and does make his own dinner, places his own towel in the bathroom hamper, and calls to ask if he can pick our daughter up from soccer practice when he gets out of work early takes us from a sign that he is an adult to evidence that I've scooped the bonus prize out of the cereal bag of life.\n\nBut there's nothing lucky about opening your box of breakfast cereal in the morning and finding corn flakes inside. The problem is opening the box and finding nothing at all.\n\nDo you have a personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost? Find out what we're looking for here and send us a pitch!
Jordan, a doctoral student in Britain, spent the early weeks of the pandemic fretting about how the coronavirus might affect her elderly grandparents.\n\nThe same couldn't be said for her parents. Even as the British government slowly began to ramp up its coronavirus response, Jordan said her parents, both in their 50s, were too lax about the threat.\n\nThey are continuing to work, which I understand because my mom is a teacher ― schools are still open in the U.K. ― and my dad works outdoors, but they're not really taking it seriously, said Jordan, who asked that we use only her first name so she could speak openly.\n\nHer parents are still visiting her grandparents and going out to eat at restaurants.\n\nMy dad keeps saying 'it's just like the flu' and that 'a lot of people die every day,' she said. They don't seem to understand how social distancing can help other people because they are not worried about getting it and they don't seem to listen when I try to talk to them about it.\n\nAcross the pond in Maryland, writer Micaela Walley is dealing with the same resistance from many of her relatives.\n\nI live in Maryland, where our local officials have been very proactive in taking steps to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, Walley said. But a large portion of my family lives in the Deep South, where their local officials are known for being notoriously inactive across the board.\n\nWhen Walley brings up the preventative steps being mandated in her state, her family tells her the threat of COVID-19 is not as big of a deal as the media portrays it to be.\n\nIt's extremely disheartening to see the people that I love react this way, Walley told HuffPost. And my family members are some of the very people that would be the most vulnerable to this virus if they contracted it.\n\nMillennials and Gen Z have been roundly criticized for not taking the threat of coronavirus seriously (and rightfully so; look at all the young people who've been busted for house parties). But as Walley's and Jordan's stories illustrate, baby boomer parents and relatives are just as likely to dismiss the need to social distant. That's especially worrisome because COVID-19 is most dangerous for older adults or those with serious health conditions. (An older adult is broadly defined as anyone over the age of 60).\n\nI think some people are naturally immune to the panic even though they are not immune to COVID19, said Shane G. Owens, a psychologist and the assistant director of campus mental health at Farmingdale State College (SUNY).\n\nWhen you mix this with Americans' deeply rooted sense of liberty, it can be a dangerous combination, Owens said. We do not like being told where not to go and what not to do.\n\nIn these challenging times, we have to look beyond ourselves. But how do you convince your relatives that this isn't a political issue or even a family issue, it's a major global health crisis?\n\nBelow, Owens and family therapists offer their advice for talking to family and close friends who still don't believe they're affected by the pandemic.\n\n10'000 Hours via Getty Images Whether it's your partner, spouse, roommate, neighbor, relative, parents or kids, avoid judgment when broaching this subject. Instead, experts say, to try empathy.\n\nDon't come at your relative with judgment, just concern and facts.\n\nExpress your opinion clearly and non-judgmentally. Owens suggested using I language. (For instance, I am worried for your health and the health of others you might come into contact with instead of You really should be doing more to keep the numbers down.)\n\nCome prepared with facts available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization, he said. Talk about how, even if they're young or relatively healthy for their age, they can be a carrier for the virus and spread it without ever experiencing symptoms.\n\nSome relatives may heed your advice, but others will need hard facts, Owens said, drawing on his personal experience as an example.\n\nI had to call my parents last night and tell them I think they should stay home for a while, he said. While still young for parents of a guy my age, they are at greater risk. It went as predicted: My mom, who tends to be anxious about some things and the one who taught me the importance of following rules, said, 'Well, OK, if you say so.'\n\nHis dad reacted the opposite way.\n\nMy dad, who's less anxious than almost anyone I know and has a healthy distrust of rules and authority, pushed back some, Owens said. He trusts science, though, and doctors — especially me and my best friend, who's an infectious disease doctor —and said he'd think about it.\n\nThe most important thing, Owens said, is that the person is left to choose for themselves while understanding their responsibility and the consequences.\n\nApproach the conversation in a loving way.\n\nMost of the time, when something stirs us up or we disagree, we don't think about how we're delivering our message. When talking about coronavirus, approach it from a place of love, said Liz Higgins, a family therapist and founder of Millennial Life Counseling in Dallas.\n\nThink of ways to deliver your message that get to the heart of the point, which is that you care about their safety, their health, and want to do your part in at least communicating that to your loved one, she said.\n\nFor tough conversations like this, don't just spring it on them. Tell them you'd like to jump on the phone and talk about something important to you when they have a chance.\n\nAsk if you can talk to them about something without just confronting them and catching them off-guard, Higgins said.\n\nJGI/Tom Grill via Getty Images Remind people that personal sacrifice is necessary for the greater good, said Virginia Gilbert, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles.\n\nFocus on something they care about.\n\nGet your relatives' buy-in to social distancing by focusing on something that they do consider important, said Nikole Benders-Hadi, a psychiatrist and medical director of behavioral health at Doctor on Demand.\n\nNo one wants to be told what to do, so instead of telling them how they ought to change their behavior, focus instead on things they do actually prioritize, she said. They may have concerns about family members who may be immunocompromised, or the long-term financial consequences of this pandemic, or something else.\n\nYour cousin may be wrapped up in making questionable vacation plans, but she'll likely understand that grandma's health comes first.\n\nCompare coronavirus to pandemics and health emergencies of the past.\n\nYour relative might not be convinced that the threat of coronavirus is serious, but if they've lived through other pandemics and health crises, they've seen the consequences of inaction.\n\nMaybe they experienced the polio epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s. Or maybe your grandpa was born just a few years after the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 675,000 Americans among a staggering 20 million to 50 million people globally.\n\nTalk about these historic moments with younger relatives who want to go out, too.\n\nRemind people that personal sacrifice is necessary for the greater good, said Virginia Gilbert, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles.\n\nOlder generations who lived through the Depression, the World Wars and other pandemics should be able to understand that there's more to life than their personal happiness, as young people are learning now.\n\nSocial distancing is hard. We like to be around others, even though we spend a lot of time on social media. - Shane G. Owens, a psychologist\n\nBe realistic about what you can do.\n\nIt's hard to find two people who can agree on the exact same amount of caution or seriousness with which to approach COVID-19. If your relative is still not taking the bait, it's OK to establish boundaries (for instance, no grandkid visits for the time being) or to physically distance yourself, said Marie Land, a therapist in Washington, D.C.\n\nOnce you've tried to make your point, it may be better to just try to see how you can both make this work, Land said. I know college students want to rent an Airbnb or stay with friends or other family because there are differences in how restrictive they want to be compared to their parents.\n\nAcknowledge that social distancing is hard even for you.\n\nEveryone is feeling the brunt of coronavirus. Even those who are in denial or appear to have no emotions about it most likely do. One of the most important things you can do is to approach your relative with empathy: You're just as bummed out about self-isolating as they are. Tell them that.\n\nSocial distancing is hard, Owens said. We like to be around others, even though we spend a lot of time on social media. And those — like me —with kids are going to find it increasingly difficult not to have playdates and to keep them away from their older relatives. It impacts us all.
To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said then. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nShe went on to use similar rhetoric in the ensuing years but changed her tune when she ran for U.S. Congress in 2012. Gabbard has since worked to protect LGBTQ rights, including by backing a 2017 bill targeting discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nI look forward to being able to share more of my story and experiences growing up — not as an excuse — but in the hopes that it may inspire others to truly live aloha; to love and care for others, Gabbard said in the video.
Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) took to the chamber floor on Thursday and unleashed against the Trump administration's nomination of politically controversial, and young attorneys to lifetime federal judgeships.\n\nThis body yesterday confirmed a judge who would limit rights for a generation, Brown, speaking for nearly 10 minutes, said to fellow lawmakers. We used to pick ... sort of wise, prudent lawyers who believed in public service. Didn't believe in some far-right agenda where they put their thumb on the scale of justice.\n\nHis comments came shortly before the Senate voted to confirm Eric Murphy to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. The 39-year-old has been the solicitor general of Ohio since 2013, and had faced harsh criticism for defending Ohio's voter purge law, writing that same-sex marriage would be disruptive ... to our constitutional democracy and arguing against women's access to contraception.\n\nThe day before, the Senate confirmed another Trump appointee to a lifetime judgeship. Allison Jones Rushing, 36, was approved with a 53-44 vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and faced similar criticism. Democrats pointed to her work for the Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom, classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and her arguments that there were moral and practical reasons to ban same-sex marriage.\n\nBrown railed against his Republican colleagues ahead of Murphy's confirmation vote, urging fellow senators to vote him down while expressing his frustrations with the politicization of lifetime-appointed positions.\n\nI just can't imagine they came here thinking I'm going to take the oath office, right here, and you know one of the things I'm going to do? I'm going to vote to restrict voting rights, I'm going to vote to tell gay people they can't marry, I'm going to vote to take away worker rights. I'm going to vote for judges that put their thumb on the scale of justice, Brown said.\n\nHe later accused the Republican party of losing political fights through the democratic process and instead telling themselves that you win through the backdoor in the judiciary.\n\nHis speech came shortly after he said he would not run for president in 2020, but rather, devote his political efforts to Congress.\n\nConnie and I have spent the last few months traveling around the country to make dignity of work a centerpiece of Democrats' 2020 campaign, and we are so grateful to everyone who has welcomed us into their communities and into their lives, Brown said in a statement, referring to his wife. We've seen candidates begin taking up the dignity of work fight, and we have seen voters across the country demanding it – because dignity of work is a value that unites all of us. It is how we beat Trump, and it is how we should govern.\n\nHe said he would work to help elect a Democrat next year to challenge Trump, and said that the best place for me to make that fight is in the United States Senate.\n\nWatch the entire moment above.
Ben Affleck's recent and very public redemption tour has seemingly led him into the arms of a new woman: Ana de Armas.\n\nThe two actors, who became close while filming the upcoming thriller Deep Water last year in New Orleans, are rumored to be dating after they were spotted vacationing together in the Knives Out star's home country of Cuba.\n\nAfter an unnamed source confirmed to People earlier this week that the pair were indeed an item, photos of them on a romantic beachside stroll have the rest of the internet convinced that their romance is officially a go.\n\nPhotos obtained by the Daily Mail show Affleck, 47, and de Armas, 31, walking side by side in Costa Rica on Tuesday, with the Way Back actor placing his arm around her waist at one point as he seemingly leans in for a kiss.\n\nClearly prepping for his next role of Instagram boyfriend, Affleck even stopped to take photos of de Armas before they continued to walk barefoot on the sand.\n\nEmma McIntyre via Getty Images Ben Affleck visits the Jess Cagle Show on March 3 in Los Angeles.\n\nStephane Cardinale - Corbis via Getty Images Ana de Armas attends the Saint Laurent show on Feb. 25 in Paris.\n\nThe PDA-heavy display arrives after the duo had Havana, Cuba, buzzing about their potential romance, as they stopped to take pictures with fans while dining out and shopping.\n\nBen and Ana had a great time in Havana, an unnamed source told People.\n\nAna was his tour guide and took him to all her favorite places, the source continued. Ben seemed to love the trip. He was in a great mood and very friendly. He was approached by fans multiple times and happily posed for pictures. They visited several restaurants and enjoyed Cuban cuisine.\n\n📸 • Ana hoje (5) no restaurante La Corte del Principe em Cuba com Ben Affleck. pic.twitter.com/33uP8aIa3U — Ana de Armas Brasil (@dearmasbr) March 5, 2020\n\n📸 • cubagossip via Instagram. pic.twitter.com/qkyMzzVsDJ — Ana de Armas Brasil (@dearmasbr) March 6, 2020\n\nWhile neither de Armas nor Affleck has publicly acknowledged the rumors, that hasn't stopped onlookers from noting their particularly affectionate behavior in recent weeks.\n\nOne fan spotted them kissing at a Costa Rica airport, presumably before they hit the beach.\n\nI'm sitting on the floor of the domestic Costa Rica terminal I see a couple come through a very small security making out like arms draped, an eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight. As soon as I saw him I knew it was Ben.\n\nA bystander also claimed to see them grabbing dinner together back in January while filming Deep Water, tweeting that Affleck was right behind me spitting game to Ana de Armas in Spanish all night.\n\nThe Oscar-winning director has recently boasted about his Spanish skills, joking about how his eldest daughter, Violet, is studying the language and keeping him on his toes.\n\nShe's always been a very good student, and she's been interested in Spanish, and so I would often help her, Affleck recently said on The Kelly Clarkson Show. Now, all of a sudden, she's gotten into the grade where she's, like, in the harder Spanish classes and she's getting better.\n\nAffleck shares Violet, 14, as well as children Seraphina, 11, and Samuel, 8, with ex-wife Jennifer Garner.\n\nDe Armas, meanwhile, was previously married to Spanish actor Marc Clotet, but the two divorced in 2013 after two years of marriage.
Mother Teresa once said, Love has to hurt. I must be willing to give whatever it takes not to harm other people and, in fact, to do good to them. This requires that I be willing to give until it hurts. Otherwise, there is no true love in me and I bring injustice, not peace, to those around me.\n\n\n\nThis is true for all of us, and sometimes being kind and loving hurts us. For example, one day I was doing my usual grocery shopping. I was in the freezer isle. The isles are narrow. Before I reached to open the freezer door, an elderly man riding a motorized shopping cart stopped me dead in my path. I offered to let him go ahead of me and get whatever he was looking for, thinking I was being polite. But he refused and said his wife just got home from the hospital yesterday, and that he had some free time to shop for the all the things that she needed.\n\n\n\nI remarked what a nice husband he must be for taking good care of her. I then began to reach for the freezer door. But before I could open it, he asked if I would play a game with him that he's really good at. I didn't know what to say, but I said okay because I felt sorry for him and I didn't want to turn him away. He said he wanted to guess my age, and that I must be around 50-55 years old. I said thank you for the compliment, but then told him he was way off. I now wasn't sure if he was flirting or just looking for someone to talk to. So I responded and guessed his age to be 67, and he said he was 92. I told him he looked much younger, paying him the compliment he was fishing for. I then reached to open the freezer door and took my ice cream. Then, while I still had one hand on the freezer door and the other hand holding a quart of ice cream, the man drove his shopping-cart into mine, pinned me inside the freezer, then jumped out of the cart, grabbed both my arms, nestled his face into my neck, kissed me on the check and said, 'Wow, what I could do with you!' My whole body trembled and I wanted to shout for someone to help me, but I felt uneasy doing this because of the man's advanced age, guessing he might be senile, so I didn't scream for help. I freed myself, put the ice cream in my cart and swiftly walked away.\n\n\n\nSince that incident, I thought about the many times in my life when men came on to me. I also thought about the many times that I took their advances for a compliment, and shrugged-off my trembling. Now, years later, in hindsight, I realize that it didn't matter if those men were married or what their age was. I've also learned that I wasn't the only one they tried to put their hands on. Perhaps, they're not satisfied with just looking because they feel they are entitled to more. After that incident in the supermarket, I wondered just what it takes for any of us to be content with what we already have? How do we remain true to the love that sometimes hurts?\n\n\n\nI know my own marriage improved greatly once I vowed to take God as my spiritual husband. I knew I could not keep a family and husband otherwise. Most people don't go around talking about it, but prayer and giving might be the key to their marital success. People making advances might not be aware that we're all confronted with those same temptations, but they have devoted spouses and also hurt sometimes. They may believe they are the only ones who are dissatisfied, that they deserve more and then buy into it, opening themselves up for more temptations. Sadly, that will lead them away from ever finding true love or happiness with the person in front of them.\n\n\n\nA couple of extreme examples: I once talked with an acquaintance asking me for help. She who was sorry she'd left her husband for a shoe salesman. She told me that she was minding her own business, just buying a pair of shoes, and couldn't help that the salesman was going crazy over her. Everywhere she went, men would flirt with her, something that turned her head and that led to her making poor choices in her life. She said it made her believe she was more desirable and attractive than other woman, and it wasn't her fault that she drew so many men into her life. I told her that I had the same kinds of encounters, and so do thousands of other women! But something prevented her from seeing the truth and she ended up living a lonely, solitary life.\n\n\n\nAnother example: A young man who owned a fine restaurant once told me that the men working there would bet on what women they would be able to seduce. He had 10 waitresses working for him, and said it disturbed him that he could make conquests of every one of them, even the married ones! He also told me he was surprised that he could even lure them away from their homes and their own children! This sickened me and broke my heart, but what's even sadder is that he did break up several marriages, including his own, because all those women left everything for him.\n\n\n\nWhen women and men will see through this behavior and egotism and not buy into it, we'll all be better off. In the words of Pope Francis,  Let us never lose hope! There are also many strong, spirited men and women, a special breed who know better, and I've been blessed in having some around me. I thank them with all my heart for their great examples that they set, and for leading the way for all of us. Their examples helped save my own marriage and family and I'll always be grateful.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Jill Biden offers comforting advice to Kelly Clarkson, telling the singer and talk-show host who is going through a divorce that things happen for the best and that life will eventually look better.\n\nThe first lady — a divorcee herself — also reveals what she looks forward to when COVID-19 clears up and explains why women should take time for themselves every day, as she does. She spoke during an interview with Clarkson that is set to air nationally on Thursday.\n\nClarkson recently brought her show to the White House for a socially distant conversation with Biden in the East Room. NBC released interview excerpts Wednesday, including a clip of the first lady offering comforting words about carrying on after a relationship breakup.\n\nCiting her late mother's advice, she tells Clarkson things happen for a reason. She also says her divorce freed her to meet Joe Biden and have a family with him.\n\nMy mother always said to me things are going to look better, tomorrow, Jill Biden said, encouraging Clarkson to take one day at a time, and things will get better.\n\n'I look back on it now, and I think, you know, if I hadn't gotten divorced, I never would have met Joe, she continued. I wouldn't have the beautiful family I have now. So I really think things happen for the best and I think, Kelly, over time, I don't know how long it's been for you, but I think, over time, you heal, and you're going to be surprised and I can't wait until that day comes for you.\n\nClarkson has spoken in other interviews about the pain of her public breakup. She filed for divorce last year from Brandon Blackstock after nearly seven years of marriage. They have two children.\n\nAfter marrying Joe Biden, Jill Biden helped raise his sons Beau and Hunter after their mother and baby sister died in a car crash in 1972. The couple later had a daughter, Ashley. Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46. The Bidens also have six grandchildren.\n\nDuring her first solo television interview, Jill Biden also discussed her interest in education, military families, cancer research and healing the country. She also answered questions from members of the show's virtual audience.\n\nMaybe go have a martini and some french fries, she told one audience participant who asked what she would do when COVID-19 clears up.\n\nShe explained why she loves to exercise and carves out time for herself.\n\nI run, I bike. It clears my head, so that's really important to me and I think all women should have something, it doesn't have to be exercise, although hopefully it would be, she said. Just to take a moment for yourself.\n\nSo I get up early, and that's my time that I have for myself, Biden said.
This being a digital age, our lives are suffused with fonts. Just about every word we read is set in a font crafted by an artist, a team of them, or even multiple generations of designers. But for the non-graphic designers among us, who mostly interact with font without a second thought, the medium's possibilities may not seem particularly exciting.\n\nFuturacha Pro is poised to change that.\n\nTyping with Futuracha Pro, designed by graphic designer Odysseas Galinos Paparounis of Greek branding agency høly, is no static, predictable experience. That's because the font responds to context, flipping between different letter designs depending on the makeup of a word. It's chameleonic and mesmerizing to watch in action ― and the result can make anyone's typing look like the work of a practiced designer.\n\nhøly\n\nThe font itself, a fine-boned classic Futura embellished with Art Deco-inspired swirls, was inspired by an unlikely muse: the Caribbean cockroach.\n\nFutura, Paparounis told HuffPost in an email, had become something like an obsession during his graphic designer studies. When he was tasked with creating a typeface as a class assignment, he found himself examining two Caribbean cockroaches he was using for an illustration class. Inspired by the antennae and thorns on their feet, he garnished the Futura framework with rounded spurs and swooping ligatures.\n\nhøly All the letter designs that make it happen.\n\nThus was born Futuracha, a marriage between Futura and the cucaracha ― cockroach in Spanish. One could say that Futuracha is a sans serif font that transformed into a serif one in a mood for exaggeration, he told HuffPost.\n\nOriginally, the font ― which featured numerous variations of different letters to allow for optimized combinations ― was only available in a format that required individual positioning of letters in a graphic design interface. Thanks to a new crowdfunding push, that's about to change with the launch of Futuracha Pro, an OpenType font that users can simply type with.\n\nhøly Funky!\n\nFuturacha Pro isn't the first font to offer adjustments as people type, but it is a step beyond the usual. Most fonts take advantage of ligatures and embellishments in an attempt for visual corrections, Paparounis said. Futuracha on the other hand, not only provides ligatures, but a wide variety of them to choose from. It places creativity beside functionality, play before instructions, experimentation before manuals.\n\nDesigners and typography nerds aren't the only ones who should have fun with fonts ― and with a magical type like Futuracha Pro, everyone can play along.\n\nTo check out the font in action, visit høly's Indiegogo page.
For BRIDES, by Sherry Amatenstein, LCSW.\n\nGetty Images\n\nI was so overtired and cranky that I shouted at my fiancé, 'If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have to be going through all this insanity!' He started to argue back, saying, 'Well then I can unpropose! Do you want to call the 100 guests who are coming or should I?' I said, 'Let's divvy it up!' Then we looked at each other and burst into laughter! —Tina\n\nSee More: The 50 Most Beautiful Wedding Cakes Ever\n\nI had the worst MIL-zilla — constantly driving me crazy throughout the wedding planning. I kept a lot of her demands from my fiancé; she was his mother, after all. But during the wedding rehearsal, when she started trying to stage-manage everything, I took Ted aside and hissed at him, 'If you don't get her to back off, I will, and it won't be pretty!' He looked at me and I saw thought bubbles over his head with captions like 'Hoo boy. If I don't start putting my wife first, there will be hell to pay!' He said, 'Okay, but you've got to let me hang the Mickey Mouse picture you hate in our bathroom.' I shrieked, 'Aaagh. I guess I have no choice!' and we went back to the rehearsal. We didn't discuss it again, but he talked to his mother, she was fine during the wedding, and I gnashed my teeth but let Mickey be a part of our decorating scheme. —Beth\n\nI had a nutty insecurity dream that Brad ran off with Taylor Swift and left me at the altar. Bursting into tears woke me up, and I screamed at my fiancé, peacefully sleeping beside me, 'If you want to be with someone else, don't let me go through with this farce of a wedding!' The poor guy was so gobsmacked, he fell out of bed! That jolted me back to reality. I apologized, he explained he does love me despite my insanity, and we went on to have a fabulous wedding. —Jill\n\nI loved being single and gave it up only because I loved Tim more. But still there were times when I feared what not being sole captain of my life would feel like. So right before the wedding, I lashed out at him: 'If you think I'm going to be Homemaker Hannah, then you're marrying the wrong girl.' He got all huffy: 'If you seriously think I don't know the woman I'm marrying, then maybe we are making a mistake!' I immediately deflated: 'What? You don't want to marry me?' Tim said: 'Of course I do. But I want you to understand that I want you to be who you are, not make you a Stepford Wife.' In that moment, my fears fell away. Marriage to this wonderful man would enhance me, not cage me. —Sheila\n\nI couldn't find my something blue — a diamond-crusted sapphire pendant necklace my fiancé had given me as a wedding present. I really lambasted the poor guy: How could he let me lose it? It was his job to not let my airheadedness get in the way. After I was finished ranting, he calmly pointed out that the necklace was hanging around my neck. —Amanda\n\nMore From BRIDES:
ILLUSTRATIONS BY JANET SUNG\n\nWhen you're in a long-term relationship, a discussion around merging finances is a really good idea. Most often, cohabitation is the the right time to have the money conversation. Before then, it might make your partner uncomfortable. Moving in together means sharing costs, so it makes sense to start then, though it's ultimately up to you to decide the best time.\n\nSince money touches almost every one of our day-to-day decisions, merging finances can bring more clarity and efficiency to your life. When my colleagues and I work with clients, our goal is to get them to shift their individualistic mindset and take on more of a team approach.\n\nWe've seen couples who have been married for years still Venmo'ing each other for rent. Let us tell you: There's definitely a better way!\n\nThe Team Mentality\n\nAs you can imagine, most couples come into a relationship with different financial situations. One person might be earning more, have credit card debt or student loans, better healthcare benefits at work, or a higher 401(k) match, etc. If you start thinking as a team, deciding which levers to pull and how to approach saving and debt decisions becomes more straightforward because you're looking at things from a big-picture perspective.\n\nWhile some people feel their S.O.'s student debt is not their responsibility, we remind them that over the course of their relationship, they will benefit from the higher income that their S.O. may obtain because of that debt. (By virtue of being more marketable.) So, if one person can help their S.O. pay down that debt even faster, both can start working toward other, more fun goals much more quickly.\n\nWe totally understand that this is a huge mindset shift and will not happen overnight — or, in some cases, at all. But, starting a conversation about money is an important step.\n\nCombining In Stages\n\nSometimes couples can work to merge their assets in stages. Pre-debt, post-debt, pre-marriage, post-marriage, etc. But overall, I encourage clients to move away from thinking of their assets and liabilities as mine or theirs, and instead to think of them as our assets and liabilities.\n\nWhen one person comes enters a relationship with a child from a previous relationship, most of us would agree that it's best to think of the child as our child. Similarly, over the course of your life together, you will tackle many challenges together and your finances are no different.\n\nFor married people who are exceptionally concerned with having their own money, it makes sense to discuss a prenup or post-nup, as the law would override individual assets, making the state of your savings — individual or joint — irrelevant.\n\nHow To Talk About Finances Early In A Relationship\n\nSome financial professionals say to wait on these conversations, but I think the earlier the better. Financial habits are a good indicator of priorities; if you and your partner don't share priorities, that may be a sign other issues will arise down the road.\n\nThe important thing is to start small, don't jump into heavy-duty conversations. Start with simple questions, and try your best not to interject with immediate commentary or judgment. You want these conversations to be constructive and productive.\n\nAn app I've recommended to clients who are in relatively new relationships and aren't ready to graduate to a joint account system is called Honey-Fi. It's simple to set up and easy to use. Also, it's flexible in terms of giving you full autonomy over how much information you want to share; the rest you can keep private.\n\nHow To Combine Finances When You Live Together\n\nFor couples who do want to combine their finances, here's a step-by-step guide to how to do so:\n\nJoint Emergency Fund\n\nOnce you're living together, it's a good idea to have an emergency fund with cash savings equal to three months worth of your joint fixed expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, transportation costs, etc.). Calculate what that number is, multiply it by three, and slowly work toward saving that amount together. You can automate a monthly savings amount directly from your joint checking account.\n\nJoint Credit Card\n\nOnce you know how much of your paycheck is going to rent, other monthly expenses, as well as student loans and other savings, the rest is yours to enjoy. Figure out what that number is and then use a joint credit card for all those costs, from SoulCycle to happy hours and dinners out to get as many rewards points as you can. (Shout out, points junkies!)\n\nEvery few days, log in to your credit card app to keep an eye on how much you and your partner have racked up so you don't go over the amount you can feasibly pay off each month. You never want to put more on your credit card than you can afford to pay off in any given month. If you can't pay off the item you're purchasing, you cannot afford it yet — period. (There are exceptions, but this is the rule.)\n\nConsider opening up a savings account and stashing money away for a few months until you can afford that item, and then feel free to put it on your credit card, confident in the knowledge you will be able to pay the bill off in full when it comes due.\n\nHow To Combine Finances When You're Married\n\nIn addition to everything in the last slide, married couples should consider having joint accounts:\n\nJoint Checking Account\n\nHaving a single account where paychecks get deposited keeps everyone on the same page about what's going in and what's coming out. If this doesn't feel right, we recommend having a side stash — a little money on the side that's a judgement-free zone your partner can't comment on. Your main paycheck should go into the joint checking account, but you pick a number or percentage together (no more than a few hundred dollars) that goes into your side stash. Many couples find this to be a helpful tactic to cap fun money, while avoiding arguments.\n\nJoint Savings Account\n\nWhen you're planning for goals together, it's a good idea to segregate that money from the rest of your financial life in a completely separate account. We like using an online bank, which has the added benefit of keeping your savings out of sight, out of mind. You can then set up a monthly or biweekly automatic transfer from your checking into that savings account; and when you hit your goal, spend that money guilt-free. Take that trip, or buy the couch!
In 2020, America might finally elect its first female commander in chief. And with her could come the nation's first first gentleman.\n\nIn an already crowded field of Democrats seeking to challenge President Donald Trump, several women are among the leading candidates: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) ― each of whom would bring along a husband to run the East Wing of the White House.\n\nWhen it comes to the role of first spouse ― or first lady until now ― there are no legal parameters, according to experts. But there are still certain expectations of the activities those in that role have taken on ― and much of these have fallen along traditional gender lines.\n\nThe primary role is social hostess: decorating the White House, holding events when foreign diplomats are here, giving tours, said Jean Wahl Harris, a political science professor at the University of Scranton, who has studied the role of the first lady for nearly two decades. Many of the expectations are very gendered, not things we would expect men to do, like hostessing ― but I think the expectations for the [male] spouse are not going to be the same.\n\nFirst ladies in the past have orchestrated official events, working with the White House social secretary, chefs and florists to do so. As White House custodian, each first lady has also chosen a set of china and rearranged the interior decor. They're expected to travel abroad to represent the presidency to foreign governments, and at home, to choose a cause ― usually something noncontroversial, such as nutrition and exercise in Michelle Obama's case.\n\nThat will be the change: If they [first gentlemen] choose to keep their career, said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush from 2005 to 2009 and now directs programming on the legacies of America's first ladies at the Center for Presidential Studies at American University.\n\nUntil now, no first lady has kept her job once her husband reached the White House ― even when that meant leaving behind a hard-built career, like Obama who left a leadership position at the University of Chicago medical center to enter the White House. Any future first gentleman keeping their job would mean juggling work with first spouse duties, and could also pose a challenge to ensure there are no conflicts of interest with their private sector work.\n\nHuffPost reached out to Harris, Gillibrand and Warren's campaigns, who did not comment for this story.\n\nAnother question is whether the first gentleman would bear the same intense scrutiny by the public and media, particularly of their fashion choices, as first ladies always have.\n\nThat will be the most interesting thing, McBride said. That conversation will go away for the [male] spouse, but I bet it will not go away for the [female] president, she guessed.\n\nExactly how America's first male presidential spouse may adapt to the role remains to be seen.\n\nIt has been a very gendered role, so will having a 'first man' really change the expectations? Harris wondered. We may not expect as much from him ... but I hope I'm wrong.\n\nHere's what you need to know about some of the men who may become America's first first gentleman.\n\nBruce Mann, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's Husband\n\nHis job: Mann, 68, is a law professor at Harvard Law School, teaching American legal history and property, according to his bio on Harvard's website. This spring semester, he is teaching a legal U.S. history course covering 18th to 19th century America, including the impact of the American Revolution on the law and crime and changing legal definitions of slavery and freedom.\n\nWhere he lives: Mann and Warren live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with their golden retriever Bailey ― whom Mann convinced Warren to get last summer, saying, The heart wants what the heart wants.\n\nWhere he grew up: Mann is from Massachusetts.\n\nHow he and the senator first met: Mann and Warren met in the late 1970s at a law conference in Florida, the Boston Globe reported. At the time, Warren was a single mom with two kids who had divorced from her first husband. After she proposed to Mann in a classroom after seeing him teach, they got hitched in July 1980, and have been married for nearly 39 years.\n\nHow he's supported his wife in her political career: Warren has called Mann her best friend, biggest supporter and love of her life. Early on, he supported Warren's career as a professor, giving up a job in Connecticut to move in with her and her kids in Houston, Texas, and later commuting from Philadelphia to their home in Cambridge on weekends, when Warren got tenure at Harvard before he did. He did it all, Warren told the Globe. Bruce flew back and forth and back and forth. Since Warren's been a senator, Mann has become a fixture in her Instagram, and lately he's been on the campaign trail or sending her cute pics of their dog Bailey when she's off stumping without him.\n\nFun fact: Warren calls Mann her sweetie.\n\nBest guess at the cause he'd choose as first gentleman: As a decades-long professor, Mann could become a champion for U.S. education and improving access to higher education.\n\nMost likely domestic household initiative he'll take on: As someone who offered his wife a newly installed and organized hallway closet for their anniversary, Mann would likely be a good steward of the White House's interior decor. Combined with his affinity for U.S. history, he may choose to switch up some of the busts and portraits in the storied halls, and may enjoy giving White House tours to visiting students.\n\nHow he might decorate the White House for Christmas: In black and white, matching one of their favorite films, Casablanca, which Mann and Warren watch every New Year's Eve together.\n\nWhat designer he should wear to the Inaugural Ball: While it may be hard to get Mann out of his apparent favorite fashion staple, the quarter-zip sweater, our bets are that for the inaugural ball he'd sport a traditional suit by a U.S.-based designer.\n\nScore 1-10 as an Instagram husband: 8/10 ― Mann gets a high score for his regular appearances in Warren's Instagram posts, including casually passing on her offer for a beer during an Instagram live video: I'll pass on a beer for now, he said. Enjoy your beer. However, he gets docked a couple of points for not having an Instagram of his own dedicated to highlighting Warren's accomplishments or their occasionally matching outfits.\n\nDouglas Emhoff, Sen. Kamala Harris' Husband\n\nHis job: Emhoff, 54, is a dad, hubby, lawyer, wannabe golfer, according to his Twitter account. He is currently a partner at DLA Piper law firm focused on intellectual property litigation. According to his bio on the site, he's passionate about legal aid, human rights, social justice and the well-being of children. He has two college-aged children, Cole and Ella, from a previous marriage, and when he's not working on a case or supporting his wife on the campaign trail, he can be found golfing, maintaining his fantasy football team or helping his wife in the kitchen, Vogue reported.\n\nWhere he lives: Emhoff and Harris moved to Brentwood, California, shortly after they were married.\n\nWhere he grew up: Emhoff was born in New York. He moved to California to study law at the University of Southern California ― a lucky move, as it was in the Golden State that he later met the woman who could become Madam President.\n\nHow he and the senator first met: Harris and her future hubby met on a blind date set up by one of her friends. They got engaged on March 27, 2014, with Emhoff dropping to one knee in Harris' San Francisco apartment and presenting her with a diamond and platinum engagement ring. (Spoiler: she said yes). The couple had an intimate wedding that August at a Santa Barbara Courthouse, where Harris' sister, Maya Harris West, officiated and they honored Emhoff's Jewish heritage by breaking a glass after the I do's. Mazel tov!\n\nHow he's supported his wife in her political career: Though Emhoff is typically out of the public eye, he is his wife's biggest fan and shows it with a social media presence largely comprised of tweets about and retweets of Harris' platform and accolades. Emhoff will likely continue to be Harris' main cheerleader as she takes on Trump and maybe takes the White House.\n\nFun fact: Emhoff's aforementioned fantasy football team is named Nirvana after the band. Sounds like someone has a go-to karaoke song in his back pocket...\n\nBest guess at the cause he'd choose as first gentleman: According to his bio for his law firm, Emhoff is passionate about many charitable causes, including those that impact the well-being of children. Emhoff may focus on education, the foster care system, children's hospitals or any other area that would promote the well-being of America's future generations.\n\nMost likely domestic household initiative he'll take on: Harris spends a great deal of time in the kitchen planning meals and menus, but as the potential leader of the free world, her plate is likely going to be too full to continue to be a master chef. So First Gentleman Emhoff will have to graduate from sous chef and make sure the White House kitchen is preparing all of Kamala's favorite comfort foods exactly the way wifey would make it.\n\nHow he might decorate the White House for Christmas: Emhoff and Harris post holiday cards to her Instagram page every Christmas. His decor style is likely traditional and welcoming, just like the cards ― think classic golds, greens and reds on the tallest pine trees in every corner and crevice. Emhoff is Jewish, so it would make sense for him to use the holidays as an opportunity to pay homage to his heritage and holiday celebrations across cultures. The Harris White House in December would likely be a spot of multicultural celebration.\n\nWhat designer he should wear to the Inaugural Ball: Emhoff tends to favor a simple blue button up and jacket in most photographs of the couple out and about, so he'd likely go for a designer who can keep things simple and comfortable, yet chic ― perhaps Chanel for a classic, sophisticated look. We'd have them know that the man also looks great in a bowtie.\n\nScore 1-10 as an Instagram husband: Unfortunately, Emhoff doesn't seem to have an Instagram account of his own, but his presence on his wife's page is a 10 out of 10. Not only is he a perfect selfie partner, posing for date night pics and holiday photos that could be in a Hallmark card, but he's also comfortable behind the camera, snapping pics of his wife on the road and on TV. He's her personal paparazzi.\n\nJonathan Gillibrand, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's Husband\n\nHis job: Jonathan Gillibrand, 50, is a business consultant. Sen. Gillibrand told New York Family in 2013 that, over the course of their marriage, Jonathan has held different jobs and [had] different levels of flexibility.\n\nWhere he lives: In 2011, the Gillibrands purchased a house in Brunswick, New York near Sen. Gillibrand's family, which remains their primary residence.\n\nWhere he grew up: Jonathan is a Brit! He grew up in the United Kingdom and came to the United States to study abroad at Columbia University and get his MBA. He only planned to stay for a year, but then he met Kirsten.\n\nHow he and the senator first met: The Gillibrands met on a blind date while Jonathan was studying in New York City at Columbia University. At the time, Sen. Gillibrand was a lawyer in the city. I thought he was one of the nicest and kindest people I'd ever met, the senator told Vogue in 2010, describing her first date with her future husband. That's what charmed me. Their second date involved going to mass together at St. Ignatius, on the Upper East Side.\n\nHow he's supported his wife in her political career: Sen. Gillibrand has long maintained that her husband is incredibly supportive of her political ambitions. She told New York Family that Jonathan really believes in what [she's] doing in Washington, adding that he once told her: As long as you're making a difference, as long as you're helping people, this is something we're going to do. And the day that you're not is the day we're not going to do it! However, the senator told Vogue that the one part of the job her husband has trouble with is when she gets publicly attacked. He gets very upset, she said.\n\nFun fact: Jonathan proposed using a snowball with a ring in it, which Sen. Gillibrand almost threw at a squirrel instead of opening it up.\n\nBest guess at the cause he'd choose as first gentleman: As a business consultant, perhaps he could focus on pushing comprehensive financial education for young people.\n\nMost likely domestic household initiative he'll take on: As a British national, Jonathan could be instrumental in helping to host foreign events for dignitaries and build bridges between the U.S. and its allies. (Also… the china. He's gotta pick out the White House china.)\n\nHow he might decorate the White House for Christmas: Unclear exactly what his decorating style would be ― maybe a simple red and white plaid motif? ― but we think he'd definitely want pints of Guinness served at the White House Christmas Party.\n\nWhat designer he should wear to the Inaugural Ball: Jonathan seems to favor simple button-ups and sweaters, but we're sure he would dress it up for an inaugural ball. The real question is, would he favor a designer from his native U.K. or an American designer, like Tom Ford? It seems likely that he'd go full American patriot for the occasion, just as American Meghan Markle chose a British designer for her royal wedding gown.\n\nScore 1-10 as an Instagram husband: 7/10 ― Jonathan is a fairly private person, but he seems pretty game to show up for photos with his wife and kids (Theodore Ignatius and Henry Nelson). These Insta appearances are especially frequent during the holidays, like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Halloween, or on special occasions, like Sen. Gillibrand's birthday.
Warning: This story contains some graphic details.\n\nA Colorado man convicted of murdering his pregnant wife and two young daughters told investigators that he had been fighting with his wife about their relationship before strangling her and smothering their children.\n\nIn interviews with Colorado investigators on Feb. 18, Chris Watts, described how he killed his wife, Shanann Watts, who was 15 weeks pregnant; their 3-year-old daughter, Celeste; and their 4-year-old daughter, Bella. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation released hours of audio from the interviews on Thursday.\n\nI didn't want to do this, but I did, he told investigators about strangling his wife in a bedroom of their Frederick home. Why couldn't I just let go?\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Nov. 19, 2018 file photo, Christopher Watts sits in court for his sentencing hearing at the Weld County Courthouse in Greeley, Colo.\n\nChris Watts initially told police that he had no idea where the three went after a friend of his wife's reported them missing on Aug. 13, 2018. He pleaded with his family to return home during local TV interviews.\n\nTwo days later, Chris Watts was arrested and confessed to killing his wife and daughters. He later claimed he strangled Shanann Watts in a fit of rage after she strangled Bella and Celeste in response to his request for a divorce.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to murdering all three of them in November in what some said was an effort to avoid the death penalty. He was sentenced to three life terms in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nBut last month, during prison interviews with CBI investigators, Chris Watts admitted to killing his wife and children and offered new horrifying details about how he did it.\n\nHe told investigators he was unhappy in his marriage and had been having an affair with a co-worker at Anadarko Petroleum for over a month when his wife returned home from a business trip around 2 a.m. on Aug. 13, 2018.\n\nHe woke up a few hours later, he said, and decided to confront her about their relationship issues while she lay in bed. He said she accused him of having an affair, which he denied, and he eventually told her he wanted a divorce.\n\nHe said she was upset by the request and told him, You're never gonna see the kids again. That's when Watts said he went into a rage and snapped, putting both hands around her neck and strangling her.\n\nI just wished I could've let go, he told investigators. It was like picturing someone around you, holding your hands, holding you and keeping you from letting go.\n\nWatts said Bella walked into the bedroom moments after he killed her mother.\n\nWhat's wrong with Mommy? he said Bella asked as he wrapped Shanann Watts in a bedsheet.\n\nMommy don't feel good, he said he responded before dragging his wife's body down the stairs and loading it into his truck.\n\nHe told investigators he then drove Bella, Celeste and the body to an oil site where he worked. After removing Shannan Watts' body from the truck, he said he smothered Celeste with a blanket in the backseat while her sister looked on.\n\nFacebook Chris and Shanann Watts with their two daughters, Celeste and Bella. He was sentenced to three life terms in prison for killing them.\n\nIs the same thing gonna happen to me as Cece? he said Bella asked when he returned from dumping Celeste's body into an oil tank.\n\nHe told investigators that Bella pleaded with him not to kill her and that he didn't remember whether he responded.\n\nDaddy, no! were her final words before he smothered her too with a blanket, he said. Investigators said evidence shows Bella put up a fight as her father murdered her. After shoving Bella's body in a different oil tank, he buried his wife's body in a shallow grave nearby. Investigators found the remains days later and arrested Watts.\n\nChris Watts can be heard crying on the audio recordings as he describes killing his wife and two daughters — in contrast to his court appearances last year, in which he largely appeared emotionless.\n\nI trusted you to take care of them, not kill them, Shanann Watts' father, Frank Rzucek, read in a statement at Chris Watts' sentencing hearing in November.\n\nYou heartless monster, Rzucek continued. You have to live with this vision every day of your life, and I hope you see it every time you close your eyes at night.\n\nChris Watts told investigators that he keeps pictures of his wife and children in his prison cell and reads Scripture to them every night.\n\nI never knew I could have a relationship with God like I do now, he said. It's like the amazing grace with all of this, but I just wish nobody had to pay any kind of price for this.\n\nProsecutors and state investigators said they found Watts' tape-recorded confession last month to be mostly credible, with several of his anecdotes matching evidence they collected.\n\nI'm assuming what he is telling is truthful, Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke told The Coloradan. I don't think that everything that came out of his mouth during those interviews was the truth, because I honestly don't believe that this monster has the ability to have remorse at all.\n\nNeed help?

When the coronavirus pandemic hit last year, large gatherings were put on hold indefinitely, throwing many couples' wedding plans up in the air.\n\nFolks had to make some tough and emotional decisions: postpone their dream wedding a year or more, have a small ceremony now and do a party down the road, or scrap their original vision altogether.\n\nWe talked to couples who canceled or postponed their planned celebrations in light of COVID-19 and decided to elope instead, opting for a tiny ceremony with no (or few) guests. Below, they explain why it wasn't what they envisioned initially but ended up being the right choice.\n\n1. Katie + Molly\n\nDe Nueva Photography The couple initially planned to get married with 180 relatives and friends in attendance. They ended up tying the knot in a much more intimate ceremony.\n\nWe originally planned to get married on Oct. 12, 2020, at St. Paul's United Methodist Church in Northport, New York, and our reception was going to be held at Flowerfield Celebrations in St. James, New York. We anticipated having approximately 180 guests join us.\n\nAt the beginning of April, we decided to postpone our big wedding celebration to October 2021. Things had just begun to get bad in New York and we could see that it would most likely not be safe to have 180 people in the same room for a long time. Ultimately, our deciding factor was that Molly's entire family lives in the Midwest. We were worried that they wouldn't be able to safely travel to New York, and we certainly didn't want to celebrate without them. While we knew that we were making the right decision, that didn't stop us from grieving the big wedding we had planned. It was heartbreaking and devastating and we cried a lot about it, but we don't regret the decision.\n\nWhen we considered the state of the world and our own health, we knew we needed to get married. But also, months of quarantining together had shown us how much we wanted to get married. We eloped on Oct. 11 at The Roxbury at Stratton Falls in Roxbury, New York. We've been regularly visiting The Roxbury for a few years and they were the first place we thought of when we decided to elope.\n\nDe Nueva Photography They exchanged vows at the base of Stratton Falls in Roxbury, New York.\n\nWe woke up that morning feeling like the sun decided to shine extra bright for us that day. The Roxbury pulled out all the stops for us and did everything in their power to make our day extra special. We were married by the owner, Greg, at the base of Stratton Falls. The day looked nothing like our original big church wedding, but it was magical to speak our vows to one another against the backdrop of the rushing waterfall.\n\nWe are so happy with our decision to elope! The whole experience was intimate in a way that a big wedding never could be. We are excited to celebrate with our friends and family when it's safe to do so, but it was incredible to have our special day be just about us. — Katie and Molly Brand\n\n2. Adiel + Richael\n\nShawnee Custalow The two eloped in Washington, D.C., and took pictures around the city.\n\nWe'd planned to get married in 2021 with about 100 or so guests on a friend's farm on a beautiful piece of land in Virginia. The night we heard the news that Ruth Bader Ginsburg had passed away, we were sitting in our living room, and I turned to Richael and said, 'Love, let's just get married.' And that was it. We planned everything within a few weeks. There was something about that stretch of time, with the new addition to the Supreme Court and growing uncertainty around the upcoming election, that moved us as an interracial queer couple and as two people deeply committed to social justice and liberation.\n\nThere's no telling when we'll be able to have the wedding we've dreamed of and what the world will look like then. In the meantime, we took it upon ourselves to celebrate our love and commit to one another in a way that felt right to us. It was very sweet — and very queer. We eloped on Oct. 30 in Washington, D.C., at a quiet little spot in Rock Creek Park. It was just the two of us and our amazing, queer photographer, Shawnee Custalow.\n\nAfter our ceremony, we took pictures at a couple of quintessential D.C. spots, including the queer love mural in Blagden Alley. Then just before sunset, we took pictures on the steps of the Supreme Court. It was surreal to be there as a newlywed queer couple in that moment. The grief and intensity of the year were heaviest in the days before the Nov. 3 election — we could feel the fear and uncertainty in our bones. And we had so many Black and Brown and queer and trans folks on our hearts that day.\n\nShawnee Custalow The couple called their elopement a bright spot amid the heaviness of 2020.\n\nWe couldn't be happier with our elopement. We hope that one day when it's safe to be together again, we can have the ceremony we dreamed of, a celebration with all of our dear ones. For now, we are deeply grateful to have had this moment together — a bright spot amid the heaviness of 2020. Our hearts are full, going into a new year side by side. — Adiel Suarez-Murias and Richael Faithful\n\n3. Annie + Jimmy\n\nLace and Luce They said their I do's at their home in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nOur original date was supposed to be Aug. 8, 2020, at the Shaw Centre, which overlooks downtown Ottawa, Canada. The original number of guests was around 220 with many coming in from other cities and overseas.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic in March, I had friends planning on getting married in May and July who were still hopeful, so I thought August was not going to be a problem at all. By late May, I brought up wanting to get married in 2021 instead since my maid of honor was stuck in the U.S., my wedding dress was still in Italy and my grandparents were still in China. Our parents suggested that we still wait a bit to see how things developed.\n\nI slowly came to terms with the fact that a big wedding wouldn't be possible. I still wanted to use my original vendors, as I had already paid a large deposit to secure them for the original date. We received the blessing of our parents to host a smaller ceremony. We still got married on our original date of Aug. 8 on our home patio in Ottawa using some of our original vendors. It was just us and our closest family for a total of eight people. It was truly a rollercoaster of emotions from being hopeful, to losing hope, to holding onto the original vision of the wedding plans, to finally being OK with a micro-wedding given the circumstances.\n\nLace and Luce The couple eloped on their original wedding date.\n\nWe feel very fortunate to have been able to still get married on our original date since eight is a very auspicious number in Chinese culture. The micro-wedding was super intimate. We got to spend a lot of time with our parents and siblings, whom we don't see often since they are based in Montreal. We feel very happy to have gone ahead with that route because now I still don't feel that I could have had the original perfect wedding this year, given the increased COVID-19 cases and ever-changing public health guidelines. The only thing I regret was not wearing a wedding dress with a long train. Since we decided to elope in a micro fashion, I had a short cocktail dress. Maybe I will get to wear my original wedding dress one day in the future! — Annie Cao and Jimmy Wang\n\n4. Hillary + Tim\n\nAdventure Instead - Elopement Photographers & Guides The couple first postponed their wedding until fall 2021 but then eloped in Lake Isabelle, Colorado, on their original wedding date.\n\nOur initial wedding was planned for Sept. 5, 2020, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with a guest list of about 220. Due to the timing of our wedding, we didn't want to take the risk of any of our guests getting sick. When we decided that we needed to push the reception back a year, Tim initially proposed that we elope abroad. But due to the travel unknowns, we thought it best to remain in the U.S. and create an adventure here. I was uncertain at first about not having our families there. But after conversations with our parents, they all were excited for us and the new plan: to elope at Lake Isabelle, Colorado — about an hour outside of Boulder — on our original date of Sept. 5.\n\nIt was quite the experience standing just the two of us in front of the most beautiful alpine lake as the sun is coming up, saying our vows to each with only our photographer, Maddie Mae , present. We got engaged on a trip to Europe in 2019 while we were in Brugge, Belgium. We both like to travel and given the circumstances, we were able to make our wedding an adventure just like our engagement.\n\nAdventure Instead - Elopement Photographers & Guides The adventurous duo wanted to elope against a scenic backdrop.\n\nOur elopement ended up being perfect. After the ceremony, we then spent the morning popping champagne, eating Voodoo Donuts instead of cake and taking in the gorgeous view. We were very happy with our decision but do wish we could have planned it where our family was able to be present. But with a month before the wedding date, it just wasn't possible to get the family out West. — Hillary and Tim W.\n\n5. Shie + Yoshi\n\nManiSol Wedding The couple eloped in Lake Como, Italy, with just their parents present.\n\nWe were supposed to get married at Villa del Balbianello in Lake Como, Italy, in September 2020 with all our family members and close friends. We eloped at the same place on the same date, but because of the pandemic, we decided to invite our parents only. I felt sad and sorry about my family in Japan, who were looking forward to coming to the event but couldn't because of travel restrictions.\n\nThe elopement became one of the greatest moments for us. Because we still can't predict what will happen in the future, we selected an option that we could do in the current situation. And it was the right decision.\n\nManiSol Wedding Due to travel restrictions, their loved ones were unable to fly in from Japan for the occasion.\n\nWhat made our experience so special was other people's kindness. There were amazing encounters that played a big role in our elopement: our photographer Selene, the villa staff, hotel staff, water taxi guy, restaurant chef and tourists who celebrated us in Lake Como and all who gave us big support for our elopement. — Shie and Yoshi Y.\n\n6. Kenny + Krina\n\nAdventure Instead - Elopement Photographers & Guides The couple was planning a larger wedding, but ultimately appreciated the intimacy that an elopement allows.\n\nWe saved money to afford the larger-than-life Indian wedding that has become the norm for Krina's side of the family. These weddings typically have more than 300 guests, but we wanted a smaller guest list in the 100 to 200 person range. We tentatively set a date for May 8, 2021, but being in health care, we waited to book a venue or a city due to concerns about the pandemic.\n\nAs the pandemic grew in strength, our future wedding date became increasingly uncertain. We wanted to be married by the time we finished our medical residencies in July 2021. We love to go hiking and lose ourselves in the outdoors, and Krina has been a fan of elopements for years. We set up a meeting with photographer Maddie Mae and immediately decided we would elope. We were not sure how our families would react, but we knew they would ultimately understand. Rather than cancel our dream wedding, the pandemic allowed us to be married uniquely without all the concerns of a traditional wedding.\n\nAdventure Instead - Elopement Photographers & Guides They said their I do's in San Juan National Forest in Colorado.\n\nWe eloped in San Juan National Forest in southwest Colorado on Sept. 22. We said our vows as the sun rose at this beautiful alpine lake. It was the best decision we have ever made. Our wedding day was the one bright spot in this strange year. We spent the week with our immediate families (nine people, all tested for COVID) for the first time all year. We hiked amongst beautiful mountain lakes, went rock climbing and spent valuable time with the people we loved the most. Most people are pulled in a thousand directions on their wedding day. We had the nine people we care about most in the world with us on our wedding day. — Kenny Chang and Krina Amin\n\n7. Haley + Jenna\n\nShawnee Custalow The two said the decision to cancel their original wedding was difficult but ultimately the right choice.\n\nWe planned to get married on Sept. 26, 2020, at a historic mansion house in Baltimore's Mount Vernon neighborhood. Our guest list was small — family only for the ceremony — but we planned to invite all our friends who wanted to join us to celebrate later that evening after we said 'I do.'\n\nThe decision to cancel our wedding was both easy and excruciating. We have family members who are high-risk, who are health care and front-line workers, and who would've traveled great distances to join us. We knew we absolutely did not want to ask anyone to put themselves at risk. For a long time, we oscillated between acceptance and sadness and everything in between. But ultimately we knew it was the safe, smart decision. We canceled our venue in May and began thinking through other options that would be safer. In August, we decided we would elope.\n\nWe were very committed to keeping our original date, so we still got married on Sept. 26. Because it wasn't feasible for our families to safely join us, we decided to skip all the fanfare and marry in Washington, D.C., at the Supreme Court. As a couple with one trans-identifying partner and one queer-identifying partner, it felt extremely fitting and urgent to stand under the pillars of the Supreme Court building and remember that our marriage is a right and, for so many reasons, a privilege. Our day was punctuated by the fact that the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was lying in state steps away at the Capitol building.\n\nShawnee Custalow The couple eloped outside the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.\n\nOur wedding day was more personal and intimate than anything we'd originally planned and was certainly memorable. We exchanged our vows in a small garden outside of the Supreme Court building. Even though the streets were bustling with people, the garden was secluded and felt like our own personal venue. After we married, we bounced around the Supreme Court building and Library of Congress with our photographer, Shawnee, for some amazing shots that we could share with friends and family. We were able to enjoy an incredible dinner on the outdoor patio at Tyber Creek Wine Bar. The owner worked with us to craft a special wedding night menu, which could not have been more romantic.\n\nWhile the day was nothing we could have planned back in March when we got engaged, we are able to look back at our elopement and know it was a day that fully represented us as a couple and our love for one another. We feel extremely lucky to have gotten married in spite of all the uncertainty around us in 2020. — Haley N. and Jenna S.\n\n8. Missy + Harley\n\nDe Nueva Photography During a hectic year, the couple said they appreciated the low-stress nature of an elopement.\n\nOriginally we were planning on eloping in Big Sur, California, among the Redwoods on May 21, 2020. About a week or two before the pandemic took hold, we paid everything in full to the person organizing it for us. But it was too risky to try and travel to California to get married. Due to a contract, we can't get a refund on anything but the flowers at this point. So in some form, we are going to carry it out, perhaps for our anniversary.\n\nWe were pretty upset and anxious about having to cancel our elopement. It had been my dream since getting engaged to get married in such a surreal atmosphere. We considered ways to still make it happen when it was safer to travel. However, travel restrictions and general fears surrounding COVID made it seem like we could be waiting for a long time. My husband is from Australia, and we were in a long-distance relationship for over two years. We were getting married while he was here on a K1 visa, so it was a bit time-sensitive for us. We were OK with the idea of doing a town hall ceremony or even in our living room over Zoom. However, I think after all the hardships we faced, especially with the pandemic, we wanted it to be more than about meeting the requirements of a visa, just as it was meant to originally be. Once I started doing some research into what options we had to elope nearby, I realized that we can still have our perfect day, just with a different backdrop.\n\nDe Nueva Photography They may get married again in Big Sur, California — their original wedding destination — at some point in the future.\n\nWe eloped on July 16 in Brooklyn Bridge Park, near Jane's Carousel, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. While I imagine eloping in Big Sur would still be amazing, I can't imagine having a better wedding day than the one we had. Because of the pandemic, there were barely any people out in Brooklyn when we got married. Our photographer took incredible pictures of us in locations that would normally be crowded. The ceremony was so intimate. We don't feel shortchanged in the respect that it wasn't done in front of guests — just two people in love, stumbling their way through vows.\n\nAfter we got married, we were able to go back to our Airbnb and have some cake and then take a nap! How smoothly everything went for us just reinforced that we had made the right decision in not having a bigger, traditional wedding. In a year filled with stress, anxiety and fear, we could not have imagined getting married with the stress of a big wedding! — Missy and Harley Eames\n\n9. Harry + Erin\n\nHeatherLynn Gonzalez They exchanged vows outside Boulder, Colorado, in October.\n\nOur original plan was to have about 80 people for a ceremony and reception in Atlanta, where we met and where most of our friends and family live. We sent our 'un-save the dates' in early August. We didn't want to have anything looming over the day or to be remembered as a 'COVID wedding.' It was frustrating at the time, but still felt like the right thing to do. We thought, 'What if someone we love got really sick from this?' and it seemed like an easy decision.\n\nWe exchanged vows on Oct. 10 just outside Boulder, Colorado. After we decided to cancel, we were able to focus on making it 100% about us. It was a beautiful day. We felt really lucky at the time and still do. Of course, we missed having our people around us to celebrate, but there will be time for that later. — Harry and Erin\n\n10. Sarah + David\n\nThe Hearnes The two eloped in Moab, Utah, with just a few family members present.\n\nOriginally, our wedding was supposed to be on Sept. 26, 2020, in Middletown, Connecticut. We planned on having around 150 guests. We knew our large wedding was not happening in 2020, so the decision was whether to postpone getting married altogether until we could have our big wedding sometime in the future or to get married now and celebrate with our friends and families later whenever it becomes safe to do so. We weighed postponing our wedding to September 2021, but feared that we would postpone once, only to have to cancel or postpone again in 2021, given the unknowns about the virus and potential vaccines.\n\nI decided to reach out to The Hearnes — photographers I have been following on Instagram for years — on a whim. I figured at that point I had nothing to lose and expected them to be completely booked. I felt tied to getting married on Sept. 26 specifically. After having that date in my mind for so long, I was hesitant to move to a new date. Our photographer, Abbi, reached out to me and told me Sept. 26 was the only date in September 2020 that they actually still had available so it felt like it was meant to be. Shortly thereafter, we booked the Hearnes, called our parents, and told them we were eloping in Moab, Utah, a place neither of us had ever been before. We went back and forth about whether we would elope alone or whether our parents and siblings would come. I felt strongly that I did not want them traveling and placing their health at risk but they insisted on coming. So our seven immediate family members flew to Moab to watch our socially distanced ceremony.\n\nLooking back, I am so happy we decided to go for it. We had a more intimate ceremony than we had originally planned ― neither of us were keen on reading our own vows in front of 150 people. While we were sad that our grandparents, extended family and friends could not be with us, videotaping the ceremony helped and we plan to have a party to celebrate whenever it becomes safe to do so. With so much uncertainty about when COVID will be controlled, it's nice to at least know we are already married. — Sarah B. and David C.
BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) — The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 89. Relatives said one extended family lost 10 members.\n\nThe 23 people killed in the nation's deadliest tornado in nearly six years came into focus Tuesday with the release of their names by the coroner.\n\nThey included 6-year-old Armando Hernandez Jr., known as AJ, torn from his father's arms two days after singing in his first-grade class musical; 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who loved horses and was visiting a friend's home when the twister struck; and Jimmy Lee Jones, 89, who perished along with his wife of six decades, Mary Louise, and one of their sons.\n\nJust keep those families in your prayers, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said, two days after the disaster.\n\nAssociated Press Residents searched through the rubble to find anything that could be salvaged.\n\nThe search for victims, pets and belongings in and around the devastated rural community of Beauregard continued amid the din of beeping heavy machinery and whining chain saws. But Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of the missing had shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.\n\nWe've got piles of rubble that we are searching just to make sure, said Opelika Fire Chief Byron Prather Jr. We don't think we'll find nobody there, but we don't want to leave any stone unturned.\n\nFour children were killed, ages 6, 8, 9 and 10.\n\nThe youngest, AJ, had taken shelter in a closet with his father and older brother when the tornado hit, said Jack Crisp, the boy's uncle. The punishing winds tore the family's home apart, Crisp said, and pulled both boys from their father's arms.\n\nHe had them squeezed tight, and he said when it came through, it just took them, Crisp said. It just demolished the house and took them.\n\nThe boy's father and brother both survived. AJ did not.\n\nJackie Jones said she and her siblings rushed to her parents' house after the storm passed and nobody answered the phone. They usually answer on the first ring, she said.\n\nThe siblings found the home reduced to its foundation. One of their two brothers who lived at the house survived and was taken to a hospital. But Jimmy Lee and Mary Louise Jones, married for more than 60 years, had died along with their 53-year-old son Emmanuel.\n\nThose three deaths meant cousins Cordarrly and Demetria Jones lost their grandparents and an uncle. They said seven others killed were their cousins by blood and marriage.\n\nEverybody in this area just about was related, said Demetria Jones, 28. It's devastating.\n\nThe body of David Wayne Dean, 53, was found by his son in a neighbor's yard after the twister demolished his mobile home. He was known as Roaddog because of his love for Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\nHe was done and gone before we got to him, said his sobbing widow, Carol Dean, who was at work at Walmart when the storm hit. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.\n\nThe tornado was an EF4 with winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and carved a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama, scraping up the earth in a phenomenon known as ground rowing, the National Weather Service said. It traveled a remarkable 70 miles or so through Alabama and Georgia, where it caused more damage.\n\nNinety people were injured in the Beauregard area, authorities said. Most have been released from the hospital.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he will visit Alabama on Friday to see the damage. It's been a tragic situation, but a lot of good work is being done, he said at the White House.\n\nAlong the two-lane country road where some of the victims died, firefighters used heavy machinery to overturn pieces of houses that were blown into a gulley. A car sat atop the remains of one house. A red-brick foundation was all that was left at another lot.\n\nThe search took its toll around Beauregard, an unincorporated area of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia line. Church chaplain Ike Mathews walked down a road lined with broken trees and debris as he went to check on members of his congregation and emergency workers.\n\nYesterday I talked to some team members who had found bodies. They're hurting. The community is torn up. They started crying talking about it, said Mathews, an associate pastor at Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nMany of the people living in the area are senior citizens who moved to the country after retiring from textile mills or an old magnetic-tape manufacturing plant that closed years ago, Mathews said.\n\nThey start with a mobile home and hope they can build a house someday. They invest in their homes, and they have a sense of legacy. It's something to leave their kids and grandkids, he said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The tornado blew a home clean off its foundation in Beauregard, Alabama on Tuesday.\n\nIt was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.\n\nGovernment teams surveying storm damage confirmed that at least 20 tornadoes struck on Sunday in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nCindy Sanford said one of her neighbors in Beauregard died in the storm, and another neighbor remained missing Tuesday.\n\nI pray to God that they find her, Sanford said as picked through remains of her home, which tumbled in the wind and is now scattered across neighbors' land.\n\nSanford said she left home with her 5-year-old grandson about five minutes before the storm struck after she got a feeling it was unsafe.\n\nIt was God, she said. And then I heard the siren.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback and Jeff Martin in Atlanta and Russ Bynum in Savannah, Georgia, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the coroner now says the oldest victim was 89, not 93.
Dr. Adizes: I welcome you to Adizes Methodology.\n\nI think it would be good if I express to you what I believe is critical to make the methodology successful and why some companies are not fully successful.\n\nWhat is the essence of the Methodology?\n\nWe all deal with change. Whenever there is change there are going to be problems. How do you handle problems? How do you grow a company when there is so much change?\n\nThe problem is that there is uncertainty, you don't know what is going to happen, and there is risk. How to handle uncertainty and risk better than the competition?\n\nThis methodology was not developed in the library in a university. I left the university to go to the real world and see how to make this happen; how to make companies grow, in spite of uncertainty and risk.\n\nThis methodology has been tested for 50 years. Please look at our website and you will see presidents of companies who say they grew the company from $12 million to $4 billion with the Adizes Methodology. It is a testament for the methodology. It has been tested in 58 countries, in companies from startups to the biggest in the world.\n\nWhy the success?\n\nIf you have a complementary team, you see things I don't see; I see things you don't see. Together we see more. That reduces uncertainty.\n\nNow, if you have the same interest, if we have common interest, that will make risk lower because those who you need will cooperate. When there is common interest there is cooperation. When there is cooperation there is less risk. A complementary team that shares knowledge and is based on common interests, reduces uncertainty and reduces risk.\n\nThat raises the question, what causes people to share information to make better decisions?\n\nMutual respect.\n\nAnd what will make people have common interest?\n\nMutual trust.\n\nSo the whole Adizes Methodology is how to build mutual trust and respect in a company, so that the company can handle risk and uncertainty, and handle change better. Not only to make you happier, but also to make you richer.\n\nA company will grow better outside if it is integrated inside. If people are fighting inside, no energy is available to deal with the outside.\n\nNow the question: how do you build mutual trust and respect? Especially in Russia ( the audience is Russian, ed note) -- because Russia does not have a history of democracy. It was always a totalitarian system, and companies in Russia are run in a totalitarian way. So there is a cultural problem: We have to change the culture inside the company.\n\nHow?\n\nThe program is very systematic, with a program and manuals.... The results are exceptional. As I told you, companies grew from $12 million to $4 billion. But the program is not easy to apply. Changing the culture of a company is a very, very time-consuming and difficult job.\n\nIt is normal that people want change as long as they don't have to change. So in order for the program to work, in order for a company to succeed with the Adizes methodology, it requires commitment.\n\nMany times a president of a company has asked me, Dr. Adizes, have you ever failed? I say, Yes. Not every company succeeds.\n\nAnd they ask me, What is the difference?\n\nI look them in the eye and say, You.\n\nHow committed are you? Because people will complain: It takes too much time... it's too much work... we cannot do it... Are you going to hold the line? Or not?\n\nAdizes is not a consulting company. It's not a training company. We are like a coach. We will train you to be an Olympic champion but you have to work hard. You have to do it. And it's not going to be easy.\n\nWhat is going to be difficult?\n\nNumber one: The program takes time. You cannot hire somebody to do physical exercise for you. That is what is wrong with some big consulting firms: You hire them to do the work for you. You just need a report and the job is finished. Is it?\n\nTo be a champion you have to show up. But I don't have time, people complain. In that case forget Adizes. Try a consulting firm, and good luck.\n\nAdizes requires commitment -- at minimum one to two days a month. If you really don't have time, then you start the Adizes program at 1 o'clock in the afternoon to 10 o'clock at night twice a month.\n\nProblem number two: As a first-line supervisor, you tell people what to do. You listen, but not too much. Your mouth is big; your ears are small.\n\nAs you ascend the hierarchy to be the president of a company, your mouth should become small and your ears should become big. Small mouth and big ears. That's right: You have to listen what is going on.\n\nYou have to listen to the people, what is going on with them. You are now far from the action. They are on the fighting floor, so you have to listen to what is happening down there. That is where the roots of the tree are. Watch the roots, not just the leaves. Financial statements are important but remember they are the leaves not the roots of your success.\n\nThat means that you have to change your style. You have to sit in the room and listen to the people. Some people are difficult. You must learn how to lead people whose style is different from yours.\n\nAdizes is training you so you can handle change in the future without us. We are proud of every client we lose. Our job is to teach you the tools how to manage as a team, and then say goodbye, thank you very much. Finished. It's like psychotherapy, organizational therapy: You should not be dependent on your therapist for too long. A good therapist makes sure you are healthy and says goodbye, you are done with therapy. You are on your own. You can come to our conventions every year and learn what is new and update yourself so your company continues to grow.\n\nYou get 4 results from the program:\n\nYou solve problems.\n\nYou build a team.\n\nYou become better managers.\n\nAnd you enrich your managerial style.\n\nI can promise you one thing: If you do a diagnosis of your company, and you identify problems which are chronic -- they come back, and back, and back, and back--this is what is blocking your growth of the company -- this is what you lose sleep over at night -- I promise you--because we have the experience of 50 years, thousands of companies -- 40% of these chronic problems will disappear. Minimum. 40% will be better; 20% will not change; and the second year, what was better will disappear, what did not change will become better. In 3 years, all problems you have today should disappear. That is on average. Some companies do it faster. It all depends on how committed you, the CEO, are to give time and energy.\n\nIn 3 years, it does not mean that you will have no more problems. You will have bigger problems. Because you are as big as the problems you are dealing with. Today maybe you have problems of quality control, you have problems of marketing, and maybe you have problems of hiring the right people. In 3 years, you will have a big problem: how to become an international company. By solving the small problems you can address the bigger problems.\n\nOnce I sent a New Years card, with wishes for the new year to my clients: I wish you bigger problems next year than this year that you can solve. Tell me how big the problems you are dealing with are and I will tell you how big you are.\n\nThe Adizes Methodology does not only make the company bigger, it makes you -- you personally -- better. People say that it helps their marriage. Next year it's coming out, a new book of mine on how to apply Adizes in family life. And I just finished yesterday a new book on how to apply Adizes to personal life. So, this methodology is not a consulting methodology, it's a philosophy of life.\n\nI welcome you, I hope that you will enjoy the methodology, and I hope you will join us and many, many companies around the world and have a better company and a better quality of life.\n\nThank you .\n\nWatch the presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IIyJjSC5o8#action=share
Conservative attorney George Conway shared some fundamental tenets of U.S. constitutional law on Tuesday, following President Donald Trump's declaration that he could assert total authority over governors to lift coronavirus lockdown measures in their states should he wish to do so.\n\nIn an op-ed published in The Washington Post, Conway tore into Trump's obvious misapprehensions about the Constitution, which gives states, not the federal government, the power to enact policies to mitigate public health crises.\n\nTrump took a solemn oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. After his years in the job, he ought to know something about that document, Conway wrote.\n\nConway, who is a vocal Trump critic despite his marriage to senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, noted that Trump ought to understand the relationship between the federal government and the states set out in the 10th Amendment, a measure that conservatives have harped on the importance of for decades.\n\nIt's grade-school-level civics that the president carries out laws, not his whims or desires, however laudatory or popular they might be, Conway wrote.\n\nFaithfully executing the law means not only enforcing it but also abiding by it — including its limitations, he added.\n\nConway also pointed to the 1952 Supreme Court case Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer. The decision, in that case, reversed an instance of presidential overreach and affirmed that the president's power to issue orders must stem from the Constitution or an act of Congress.\n\nTrump doesn't seem to realize that he is no longer running the Trump Organization, Conway said, and that the office he holds doesn't belong to him or designate him with complete authority.\n\nTrump would do well to learn these basic tenets of American constitutional law, if only because it's his job to follow them, and because doing so would make him a more effective president, Conway wrote.\n\nRead the full editorial here.
PESI Publishing and Media/Magination Press Books for kids are a great resource to combat anxiety and worry.\n\nAnxiety and worry can creep up on your kids when you least suspect it. Luckily there's a solid stable of books that parents can turn to as they help their little ones better cope.\n\nAnd books can be especially useful for kids when talking about conditions like anxiety, said Natasha Daniels, child therapist and author of How To Parent Your Anxious Toddler and Anxiety Sucks! A Teen Survival Guide.\n\nI do think kids learn through stories so either if a child has a hard time talking about it or if we want to normalize it, it's super helpful to say, 'Look, it's in this book,' she told HuffPost. When we distance it and it's not about the child, it's just about this character in this book.\n\nCasey Strenski, a registered associate marriage and family therapist, is the clinical program director of Los Angeles' Mindful Heart Kids, which offers therapeutic programs for children. She echoed Daniels' idea and described children's books as a really good tool to help kids learn about their feelings, especially when they can turn to the visuals for added context.\n\nHuffPost put together a list of helpful titles, a mix of recommendations from therapists, counselors, psychologists and other mental health experts as well as some other notable books of the past few years.
The FBI is probing claims that allege musician Ryan Adams sent sexually explicit messages to an underage fan, The New York Times reported on Thursday.\n\nThe development comes just a day after the outlet published shocking allegations against the celebrated singer. Seven women described a long history of Adams' abusive behavior and manipulation, accusing him of sexual impropriety. In one of the more severe claims, a young girl only identified as Ava said she exchanged thousands of messages with Adams when she was between the ages of 14 and 16, some of which were sexually graphic in nature.\n\nAdams has denied the claims, painting the Times article as inaccurate and saying he would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage.\n\nI am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly. — Ryan Adams (@TheRyanAdams) February 13, 2019\n\nThe Times' report cited an unnamed law enforcement official with knowledge of the probe, saying the bureau has taken the first steps to open a criminal investigation following the newspaper's reporting. Investigators will likely move to speak with Ava and obtain any text messages she sent with Adams.\n\nAdams' attorney, Andrew Brettler, told HuffPost that his office had not been contacted by law enforcement, but said he couldn't provide any further statement. HuffPost has reached out to the FBI for comment.\n\nAva, who is now 20, told the Times through an attorney her family is still considering how to proceed after the media story. She has reportedly shared more than 3,200 text messages exchanged with Adams from when she was 15 and 16 with the outlet, including some in which Adams repeatedly asked Ava about her age. At one point, he said he would get in trouble if anyone found out about their communications.\n\nShe said that at the time she told Adams she was older than she was.\n\nThe Times' report also detailed claims that Adams was abusive and manipulative to aspiring female musicians. The singer Phoebe Bridgers accused the singer of encouraging her career, only to rescind the offer when they called off a brief relationship. She said he later invited her to open for him on tour, but exposed himself to her in his hotel room during the first day of the collaboration.\n\nAdams' ex-wife, the actress Mandy Moore, also claimed the musician was emotionally manipulative during their marriage, which ended in 2016.
PARK CITY, Utah ― Nearly 22 years ago, Hillary Rodham Clinton was blindsided when her husband, then President Bill Clinton, came into their room, sat down on the bed and confessed to having an affair with a 20-something White House intern named Monica Lewinsky ― a scandal that had been splashed across headlines for seven and a half months.\n\nI told her exactly what happened, when it happened, Bill Clinton says in the new Hulu four-part docuseries Hillary, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday and will be released on the site on March 6. I said, 'I have no defenses. This is inexcusable, what I did.'\n\nThis is by far the most open Bill and Hillary Clinton have been about the situation that nearly ended their 22-year marriage in August 1998. Hillary director Nanette Burstein told The Hollywood Reporter that the couple was willing to recount the experience in separate interviews, due to its significance in Hillary's personal life, which the docuseries explores in-depth.\n\nThe reason why the Monica story was important to me was not just for the sake of it being salaciously interesting to people, the filmmaker said, but because [Hillary's] always been judged by it.\n\nErik Voake via Getty Images Hillary Rodham Clinton onstage during the Hulu Panel at Winter TCA on Jan. 17 in Pasadena, California.\n\nHillary follows the 72-year-old's political trajectory, touching on everything from her rousing commencement speech at her graduation from Wellesley ― a breakout moment where she introduced her long-term goal of making what appears to be impossible possible ― to how she and her team dealt with the 2015 controversy over her use of a personal email server as secretary of state.\n\nIncluding interviews with friends, colleagues, campaign managers, reporters and political figures like her former opponent and subsequent boss President Barack Obama, the docuseries paints Hillary Clinton in an exceedingly favorable light as someone who would stop at nothing to pave a path for a woman to one day become president of the United States. As for the critique that she's inauthentic, Clinton concludes that it's been hard to be herself in a world where her trust has been exploited and double standards reign supreme.\n\nGoing through this gauntlet of unbelievable obstacles, yeah, you know, you get scarred up a little bit, she says in the opening moments of the series, before Take Back the Power by The Interrupters begins playing.\n\nIt's this type of moment Burstein excels at: taking footage of Hillary's presidential campaigns, her family life, her political mishaps, and weaving it all into a stunning story of feminism, failure and fight.\n\nOne of the more eye-opening moments of the series involves Hillary's heartbreak at the Lewinsky news. With pain in her eyes, she admits she was shocked by the extramarital relationship and says she was just devastated that Bill would lie to her. Colleagues who were interviewed also said that, despite reports claiming otherwise, Hillary did not know about the affair prior to Bill's confession. (While that may be true, one can't help but consider that she at least knew of Bill's inappropriate behavior, after Juanita Broaddrick's rape allegation, an alleged affair with Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones' sexual harassment accusations. Hillary mentions those incidents, but doesn't examine them with the same level of detail as, say, A&E's recent six-part docuseries, The Clinton Affair.)\n\nWhat viewers do learn is, despite her anger, Hillary sided with her husband during the impeachment process due to the fact that she didn't think [the affair] was an impeachable offense. The series presents this as evidence of her commitment to the Constitution, casting the choice as Hillary putting the well-being of Americans ahead of her own marriage.\n\nAs Cheryl Mills, who was deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration, explains, She chose to compartmentalize, to say, 'I might want to kill my husband, but I don't want the country to have to lose their president because I want to kill my husband.' Most people can't do that. I wouldn't.\n\nThrough it all, though, the couple says their main concern was their then-18-year-old daughter, Chelsea Clinton. Hillary reveals she commanded Bill to tell Chelsea about Lewinsky before he apologized to the nation about lying under oath and obstructing justice when he denied the relationship months prior. In the series, Bill holds back tears while recounting how awful it was to admit his behavior to his daughter. Still, both Bill and Hillary credit Chelsea with keeping them together in the days following Bill's grand jury testimony, referring to images that show Chelsea walking with the couple as they headed out for a post-confession trip to Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThat's just so strong and so … wise, Hillary says of Chelsea's act of love. Bill separately added, She was filling in our empty space there.\n\nNew York Daily News Archive via Getty Images President Bill Clinton leaving the White House for Martha's Vineyard with Hillary Clinton and their daughter Chelsea in August 1998.\n\nThe couple said they went to counseling and had many painful discussions about the state of their marriage before Hillary ultimately decided to stay with Bill, a choice she still faces judgement for today.\n\nI was so grateful that she thought we still had enough to stick it out. God knows the burden she paid for that, Bill states in the lead-in to the final episode, which details the backlash Hillary faced and how it played into her bids for president years later.\n\nWhen asked why he would ever take that risk and jeopardize his family's future, Bill explains he never thought of his extramarital relationship with Lewinsky in that way. Nobody sits down and thinks, 'I think I'll take a really irresponsible risk. It's bad for my family, bad for my country, bad for the people who work with me.' That's not what happens. It's you feel like you're staggering around, you've been in a 15-round prize fight that's been extended to 30 rounds and here's someone who will take your mind off it for a while.\n\nThe things I did to manage my anxieties for years ... I'm a totally different person than who I was [with] all that stuff 20 years ago, Bill adds. Maybe it was just getting older, but I hope it was also going through a lot of this.\n\nHe then shares his thoughts on what Lewinsky had to face in light of their relationship, saying he felt terrible about the unfair treatment she endured for years. Lewsinky herself wrote in The Hollywood Reporter in 2018, For two dec­ades, I have been working on myself, my trauma, and my healing. And, naturally, I have grappled with the rest of the world's interpretations and Bill Clinton's re-interpretations of what happened. But in truth, I have done this at arm's length. There have been so many barriers to this place of self-reckoning.\n\nBill's conclusion on the subject? I watched her try to get a normal life back again. But you have to decide how to define 'normal.'\n\nAs demonstrated by Hillary, life is anything but normal — or fair for that matter — in the world of politics. But if Hillary and Bill hoped the docuseries would put the scandal to rest, they're out of luck: With Ryan Murphy's American Crime Story: Impeachment now in the works, the Clintons and Lewinsky will soon again be primetime fodder.
Is marriage antiquated?\n\nThe idea of marriage is something that we have planted in our brains since we were kids. Somewhere, somehow we were taught about the white picket fence, finding the one, and finding the person you were going to spend the rest of your life with. Whether your parents were able to accomplish that or not, they wanted that story for you.\n\nThey wanted the story of boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, or girl falls in love with boy.\n\nIn a perfect, world you're going to meet somebody and have a family, and live happily ever after.\n\nOur childhood was full of stories about that. So when we head into adulthood, we've got this story based on what we've learned through Disney movies.\n\nAnd our families\n\nOur friends.\n\nThe books that we've read.\n\nRomantic comedies, etc.\n\nWe're under the illusion that marriage is something that means we're going to spend the rest of our lives with somebody.\n\nBut that is just an illusion.\n\nAll of you reading this right now are reading articles posted in the divorce section of Huffington Post.\n\nWhich means that the white picket fence and the illusion of marriage probably didn't work out for any of you.\n\nThe story that you created about marriage, which was really created for your parents, didn't seem to play out in your adult life, and you find yourself reading articles about divorce and how to negotiate the splitting of children and all these other wonderful things that divorce brings.\n\nLet's go deeper into this and let's go to the origins of marriage. Back in the 1400's when people were getting married, it was until death do you part. Because people would get married as teenagers and somebody would die in their 20's or early 30's. The life span was not 80 years.\n\nAs we grew as a society and medical care got better and better and we figured out how to get rid of things like the bubonic plague and gangrene, people are living a lot longer.\n\nAnd when they live a lot longer, they make many changes in their lives.\n\nPeople grow, people evolve, people become different things than they were when they were in their 20's or 30's or 40's. A lot of the times when some people are married, one partner grows and the other one stays stagnant.\n\nI know according to the church and the Bible and everything else, we're supposed to make that marriage work. But a lot of the times the marriage doesn't work because the people no longer work well together.\n\nSo the real question is: why are we expected to stay together and make each other miserable? That wasn't part of the story we were sold as kids. We were sold the story of the illusion of marriage. How beautiful it is love to somebody. You work on a marriage and you continue to grow and love each other.\n\nIn a perfect world, I understand that. But so many people pick the person that they marry without fully knowing or understanding their selves.\n\nSo many people marry somebody at the wrong time of their life. They were tired of being single, they met somebody when they were super young.\n\nThey got pregnant, they married that person.\n\nThey didn't know themselves yet. They got married at 22 and now they find themselves 40 years old wanting an entirely different life. Yet, are they expected to stay with that person? To be with a person that no longer works or serves them in what we call love?\n\nSo, marriage has become antiquated in the sense that we need to stay until death do us part.\n\nIt's not that I think marriage is an institution that doesn't work.\n\nI feel that marriage is something that needs to really be re-defined in today's modern society.\n\nPeople are still scorned upon when they say they're divorced. But if you think about it, when you go to check the box at the doctor's office or anywhere else and they ask you if you're single, married, or divorced, you almost hesitate to check the divorce box because you almost feel like you're going to be evaluated or judged in some way, shape, or form because your marriage and the perfect ideal of the marriage, or the illusion of the marriage, did not work out.\n\nBut the true reality is that marriage might just be antiquated the way it is.\n\nWhat's wrong with having five or six loving adult relationships through your life? Relationships that take you point A to point B.\n\nAnd the next relationship takes you from point C to point D.\n\nAnd the next one grows you from D to G.\n\nAnd the next one grows you from H to M.\n\nMaybe that's the new norm. Maybe that's exactly what our society is all about now. As we move faster through the world, things are changing. Relationships are changing, people are changing, we're evolving, we're growing.\n\nI know the story is great, but if you think about every story we've had since childhood, most of them never panned out the way they're supposed to pan out. The programming that we had as children tends to really destroy some of the things we need to do as an adult.\n\nWhat happens is that we actually work most of our adult life trying to get rid of the programming that we had as a child.\n\nSo I think it's time we redefined what married truly is. We need to redefine marriage. We need to redefine exactly what marriage is. You need to redefine exactly what type of marriage you want or what works for you.\n\nYou need to stand up for who you are. You shouldn't stay married to somebody you no longer love or no longer feel like you can grow with. If the marriage has hit the end, that's okay. There's probably another marriage or relationship out there to take you down the next road.\n\nLife is a series of choices, and I think modern society has changed so much that we need to redefine and get rid of 'til death torture us apart.\n\nI threw that in because most of us who are in bad marriages will realize it's pure torture. And if you think about it, we've been given a chance to live a life, a life that, well, we need to live, instead of just compromising.\n\nWe all know there's no perfect relationship out there, but if a marriage doesn't serve you anymore, what's the point of being in it? Because you took some vows that were created years and years ago when people were dying at young ages?\n\nIt's perfectly acceptable and okay to be in a relationship and leave it and go to the next one and grow and evolve.
Pop singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles can officially add waitress to her list of occupations. Also, Broadway actress.\n\nBareilles announced on Instagram today that she will join the cast of the musical Waitress in the starring role of Jenna Hunterson, a gifted pie maker and rampant daydreamer who questions her unhappy marriage after an unexpected pregnancy. The musical, based on a 2007 film by Adrienne Shelly, was described on Vulture as clearly, passionately, and for the most part delightfully a feminist musical.\n\nI'm just beside myself! she wrote on Instagram alongside her debut date and a joke: My first show is MARCH 31. Panic attacks available now.\n\nThe announcement marks Bareilles' Broadway debut, yet she's surely familiar with the show itself, given that she wrote the lyrics and composed the music.\n\nCBS Photo Archive via Getty Images Jessie Mueller and the cast of Waitress.\n\nBareilles will succeed Jessie Mueller, who has played Jenna since Waitress opened last spring, and was notably transcendent in the role. Bareilles has some big shoes to fill; she plans to work with an acting coach and hit the gym to increase her physical stamina in preparation.\n\nIt's something I've been quietly mulling over since the show began, Bareilles told The New York Times. So I'm making the big jump, and it feels like a completion of sorts, a coming full circle with this project ... To me this feels like a very holistic return to where I started, even though it's been a really long time.\n\nSugar, Butter, BROADWAY! I am thrilled to be joining the cast of @WaitressMusical on March 31 for 10 weeks only: https://t.co/msz42bU8me pic.twitter.com/9lbvXwmLaD — Sara Bareilles (@SaraBareilles) February 16, 2017\n\nGood luck, Sara, we want to see you be brave!\n\nBareilles will star as Jenna for 10 weeks from March 31 to June 11.

zoranm via Getty Images Couples who spend the time before bed glued to their phones or the TV miss out on an opportunity to connect with each other.\n\nTherapists get an up-close look at a wide array of romantic relationships: the healthy ones, the unhealthy ones and the somewhere-in-between ones.\n\nIn sessions with their coupled-up clients, certain negative patterns pop again and again. We asked therapists to reveal the bad relationship habits they commonly see and share some tips on how to work through them\n\n1. They spend all their time before bed watching TV.\n\nWatching a few episodes of Schitt's Creek together may be one of your favorite ways to unwind after a long day — and that's perfectly OK. But your Netflix habit becomes an issue when all of that sacred time before bed is spent zoning out in front of the TV (or staring at your smartphone), instead of doing something that allows you to actually be present and connect with each other.\n\nCouples will spend more time watching TV rather than having sex or spending quality time together while not distracted, said Los Angeles psy­chol­o­gist and sex ther­a­pist Shan­non Chavez. It leads to prioritizing TV rather than each other or sex.\n\nThe fix: I recommend that couples turn the TV off and replace it with listening to music, giving each other a massage or other forms of sensual touch, Chavez said. Both have better effects on stress and relaxation.\n\n2. They constantly interrupt each other.\n\nIn the heat of an argument or spirited conversation, you may end up talking over your partner from time to time. But if you're routinely cutting your partner off mid-sentence just to make your point, beware: A regular habit of this will leave your partner feeling unimportant, irrelevant and unloved, said Kurt Smith, a therapist in Roseville, California, who specializes in counseling men.\n\nThe fix: To break this pattern, bring more conscious awareness to your communication habits, Smith said. Practice letting your partner finish their thought before you jump in with your two cents.\n\nA good way to practice this is to begin to always wait until there is a pause before speaking, and then ask, 'Can I share what I'm thinking?' Smith added.\n\n3. They lose themselves in the relationship.\n\nIn the early days of a relationship, it feels good to dive in, even at the expense of individual hobbies, relationships and routines, said Nicole Saunders, a therapist in Charlotte, North Carolina. It's not uncommon for one or both partners to abandon too much of themselves early on.\n\nBut what happens once the honeymoon phase is over? While you were so preoccupied with the relationship, you ended up distancing yourself from your friends, falling behind on your work goals, losing interest in your hobbies and not making time for your own self-care.\n\nIt's a recipe for burnout and resentment, Saunders said.\n\nOftentimes we aren't taught that it's OK to even have a need, let alone voice it. It's vulnerable to share how you're feeling, to ask for help, or to say, 'I'm feeling down, can I have a hug?' - Lynsie Seely, marriage and family therapist\n\nThe fix: First, acknowledge that your priorities as a couple are out of whack and that you want to set some new boundaries.\n\nFrequent and clear communication is very important so that the reprioritization of time and energy doesn't come across as a loss of interest in the relationship, Saunders said. Initially, it may feel uncomfortable to invest less, which may create an insecurity spike, but using communication can be validating along with making the most of the time that is allocated to the relationship.\n\n4. They expect their partner to be a mind-reader.\n\nIt feels so good when our partners can anticipate our needs, said marriage and family therapist Lynsie Seely of Wellspace SF in San Francisco. Being seen, understood and met by others are basic human needs, and oftentimes it is our romantic partners who show up to offer that care.\n\nHowever, Seely noted that some clients place unfair expectations on their partners, expecting them to read their minds and magically know what they need or how they're feeling. When their partner is unable to do this, they start to draw their own conclusions.\n\nThey think, If my partner doesn't know what I need or show up in a particular way, it means XYZ — e.g. they don't care about me or I'm not important, Seely said. We fill in the gap with a negative assumption about our partner and how they feel about us. Over time, this can drive a wedge between the couple.\n\nThe fix: Instead of relying on your partner to decode your innermost thoughts, practice asking for what you need. And know that it might take some getting used to.\n\nWe live in a very independent-focused culture where oftentimes we aren't taught that it's OK to even have a need, let alone voice it, Seely said. It's vulnerable to share how you're feeling, to ask for help, or to say, 'I'm feeling down, can I have a hug?' If you're in a safe and trusting relationship, practicing opening up in this way builds connection, understanding and support.\n\n5. They're obsessed with being right.\n\nIt's difficult to have a productive argument when both partners are more concerned with winning than they are with resolving the problem at hand.\n\nCouples become gridlocked in issues because they feel the need to be right, said Jess Davis, an associate marriage and family therapist at WellSpace SF. Looking for a 'win' in an argument can feed a feeling of being stuck, and frustrations become hurdles. Understanding that you're a team and can work as a unit can allow the couple to tackle the problem and not each other.\n\nljubaphoto via Getty Images An obsession with being right is often a desire to be heard, said therapist Jess Davis.\n\nThe fix: Sometimes what appears to be a need to be right is really just a desire to be heard and understood, Davis noted. Practice active listening: Focus on what your partner is saying and then reflect back what you heard to show you see their position. If you're not sure, ask questions that demonstrate a desire to understand.\n\nWhen it's your turn to speak, try a soft startup like: I feel ______ about ______ , and I need ______ that keeps the focus on your feelings instead of accusing or criticizing your partner.\n\n6. They don't carve out we time.\n\nWith work, kids and other life obligations pulling us in a million different directions, it's hard for couples to find time to spend together by themselves.\n\nIt can be really hard to have the same kind of quality time together we had when first dating, Smith said.\n\nThe fix: If you're just waiting around for the perfect distraction-free window to arise, you could be waiting quite a while. The key is to be intentional about setting aside the time, even if it's just 10 minutes a day.\n\nIt can be as simple as taking a regular chore, such as walking the dog, and turning it also into an opportunity to also spend some time together as a couple connecting with each other, Smith said. This is one of the things my wife and I do.\n\n7. They avoid vulnerable conversations.\n\nIt feels easier to steer clear of certain subjects because we're scared of how our partner might react if we honestly express our feelings: Will we be judged? Hurt? Rejected?\n\nWhen couples don't choose to lean in to their vulnerability and have hard, emotional conversations early on, they fail to develop the communication skills that are necessary for building a secure and healthy relationship future, Saunders said.\n\nOne common example: One partner might be ready to get married or have kids. But since the couple has never talked about their future together, it seems too delicate a subject to broach.\n\nThe result is they bottle up their feelings and only ever bring up the topic after a night of drinks. The conversation always devolves into an argument, Saunders said. They wake up the next day anxious about the fight and that much more uncomfortable with the overall subject so they sweep it under the rug yet again.\n\nThe fix: Practice bringing up deeper topics in regular conversation. Start small and work your way up to the heavier stuff as you get more comfortable.
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia lawmakers passed comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation Thursday that advocates said makes the state the first in the South to enact such protections for LGBTQ people.\n\nThe measures advanced on bipartisan votes, 59-35 in the House and 30-9 in the Senate as newly empowered Democrats continued to advance bills that Republicans blocked for years. Each chamber still must take up the other's measure in procedural votes before the legislation can be sent to the governor, who supports it, for final approval.\n\nWhile opponents have raised concerns about impacts on religious freedom, advocates praised the passage of what they called urgently needed landmark human rights legislation.\n\nIt's important to know that discrimination is still happening in Virginia. It is time to drive it out, bill sponsor Sen. Adam Ebbin, who is openly gay, said at a press conference ahead of the votes.\n\nThe legislation prohibits discrimination in housing, public or private employment, public spaces and credit transactions on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It also lays out causes of action that would allow individuals or, in certain circumstances the attorney general, to sue over alleged discrimination.\n\nIt's past time we protected LGBTQ Virginians from discrimination under the law. This bill will make us stronger and more inclusive of all ― I'm proud to support it, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, said in a statement.\n\nThe legislation drew criticism from religious advocacy organizations that said it went too far and would effectively punish people who oppose gay marriage for faith-based reasons.\n\nMake no mistake, this bill is intended to dismantle religious freedom and to force the government to make everyone conform to its version of marriage and sexuality, Republican Del. David LaRock said in a speech opposing the measure.\n\nLaRock said the bill would punish religious people who decline work at gay weddings and would force employers and employees to use a transgender person's preferred pronoun, an assertion that drew applause from some in the room.\n\nSome of Virginia's largest employers, including Capital One, Dominion Energy and Verizon, backed the legislation.\n\nPassing a comprehensive nondiscrimination law isn't just the right thing to do – it's crucial to the state economy, those companies and more than two dozen others wrote in a letter to legislative leaders. Because many LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ workers prefer to live and work in communities with nondiscrimination protections, such a law will give Virginia's employers tangible advantages in recruitment and retention.\n\nThe legislation also extends protections on the basis of other characteristics, including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age and status as a veteran.\n\nThe measure would make Virginia the first state in the South to enact nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people, said Alphonso David, president of Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ rights organization.\n\nDemocrats retook control of the General Assembly in November for the first time in a generation and have begun enacting sweeping policy changes. Lawmakers noted that similar measures have been introduced in recent years but didn't survive in what was then a Republican-controlled body.\n\nGOP Sen. Jill Vogel said she thought provisions of the bill addressed concerns about religious liberty and that she was proud to vote for it.\n\nI can assure you that if we embrace equality and protect everybody equally under the law we will be a better community, she said on the floor.
There's a piece of junk mail lying in the middle of the floor in my kitchen. I'm doing an experiment to see how long it will take either my husband or 2 teenage sons to pick it up and throw it away.\n\n\n\nWe are on day 3\n\n\n\nCurrently taking bets.
Ariel Davis for HuffPost\n\nLong-distance relationships call for two partners who possess major stick-to-itiveness: Not everyone can endure the long stretches of times without seeing each other, the time differences, and the financial and logistical obstacles that come with visiting. (In 2021, there are COVID-19 travel restrictions to contend with, too.)\n\nBut as any formerly long-distance couple now living together can tell you, the hassles, the setbacks and the temporary lack of cuddles can be worth enduring. And in the thick of it ― when you're miles apart and missing each other something fierce ― there are usually signs that your relationship has sticking power.\n\nBelow, couples therapists share seven signs that your relationship will go the distance ... in spite of, well, the distance.\n\nYou're emotionally intimate\n\nWho's the first person you text or FaceTime when you receive good news? Who do you think to vent to when you've had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day at work? Your partner should definitely make the shortlist, if not hold the No. 1 slot. No matter the distance, a good partner is there to cheer you on through the good times and emotionally bolster you through the bad.\n\nWhen you're intimate with your partner on an emotional level, you feel their needs, fears, and desires as if they were your own, said Carmen Harra, a psychologist in Los Angeles. You're sensitive to their well-being and sometimes even know what your partner needs before they get a chance to ask.\n\nIt's important to note that emotional intimacy is a two-way street; your partner should be in sync with your feelings, too.\n\nWhen emotional intimacy exists, you share a certain synergy that's unshakable, Harra said. The distance between you is no match for the mental and spiritual connection you forge when you're emotionally intimate.\n\nThe geographic distance is only temporary\n\nUnless you've come to an agreement that some form of long distance is your ideal arrangement, you both probably need a target date for sunsetting your current situation. When you have hope of being together in the long term, you'll be able to ride out the rough moments when the distance seems unbearable.\n\nWhether it's months, weeks or years or after the pandemic is under control, there has to be an end to the distance at some point, said Becky Whetstone, a marriage and family therapist in Little Rock, Arkansas. At some point, you both probably want to live near one another.\n\nWhetstone speaks from experience. She and her husband lived 500 miles apart when they first started dating and spent the first 18 months of their relationship taking turns traveling back and forth every other week.\n\nWe stayed in regular touch throughout but after a year, we made our plan to be together, she said. We didn't know what life would be like when we were both in the same city, but our bond was solid thanks to our time investment and our mutual determination to be together, so our transition was smooth.\n\nGary John Norman via Getty Images You and your partner should have a game plan for when you'll physically be together for the long haul.\n\nYou still appreciate alone time\n\nSure, you may technically have a lot of alone time on your hands, but there's bound to be days ― or even a run of a few days ― when you need a little you time. Maybe after a long day in front of the computer screen at work, you simply don't have the mental energy for a Skype call. Whatever the case, your partner should respect that, said Gary Brown, a psychotherapist in Los Angeles.\n\nYou and your partner can genuinely miss each other and, at the same time, have an appreciation for some alone time, he said. This is a good sign because couples who seek balance between together and alone time generally have greater respect for each other's needs.\n\nBeing constantly joined at the hip isn't healthy for any couple. If you're in an LDR that's working in this area, you're ahead of the game, Brown said.\n\nOf course, at the same time, when you are apart, you genuinely love and miss each other, he said.\n\nYou've made an effort to spend more than a weekend or even a week in one person's location\n\nThe reality is, you're probably going to need more than one amazing, whirlwind week together on vacation to determine whether you're compatible, said Stephanie Buehler, a psychologist and sex therapist in Southern California.\n\nTry to squeeze in a few opportunities for the two of you to be together for extended periods of time ― or even better, do a few weeks straight and stay at each other's homes. Get a feel for what living together will really be like, warts and all.\n\nIt takes more time than one week to understand each other's habits and rhythms to see if you're compatible, or how the two of you go about solving differences, she said. It would be worth taking two to three weeks or even a month off to see what it's really like to live together under one roof.\n\nSpending a big chunk of time together is also a good opportunity for you to gauge your sexual compatibility, according to Buehler.\n\nToo many long distance couples enjoy ongoing 'honeymoon' type sex that comes with periods of longing, she said. What are you like when you aren't floating away in a sea of happy sex endorphins? A longer period together will determine that.\n\nYou hit all the big relationship milestones\n\nIf your relationship has remained strangely stagnant since you first met IRL or online, that's a problem, said Marie Land, a therapist in Washington, D.C.\n\nYou should be hitting all those tried-and-true relationship milestones together, no matter how far apart you are: The first I love you. The first big argument about a substantial relationship issue. The first time sharing your kinks or sexual fantasies. The first time you cry in front of each other. Even the first time you post about each other on Instagram, as silly as it sounds.\n\nIn a regular in-person relationship, you can look for signs of increased intimacy, trust, future planning ― even small things like plans for meeting family or going to a weekend cabin getaway, Land said. If the relationship looks exactly the same a year later, that might mean there's a level of stagnation, which would be something to work on, particularly in a long-distance relationship.\n\nCecilie_Arcurs via Getty Images A long-distance relationship is much more likely to prosper if both partners do what they say they'll do ― if they match intention with action, Carmen Harra said.\n\nYou've already met each other's family members and friends\n\nObviously, you shouldn't let others call the shots on your relationship, but it helps to know what your inner circle thinks about your new S.O. Try to find time when your friends and family can meet your partner, even if it just means hopping on the Houseparty app and playing Uno as a group. What you're trying to determine is, if I bring my partner into the mix, how do they act around each other? Buehler said. Do people seem uncomfortable with one another, and not just because it's someone new? Then, ask for honest impressions. (Your closest friends and family are no doubt going to have plenty of opinions, even without you grilling them.) The reason this is important is that when you're in a long-distance relationship, you really don't get a good understanding of whether a potential full-time partner is kind or brusque to others, she said. You'll get that here. You both keep your promises Promises feel much weightier in an LDR because, at times, all you really have is your word. So when you make plans to get together every Friday night, have every intention to stay true to you word. A long-distance relationship is much more likely to prosper if both partners do what they say they'll do ― if they match intention with action, Harra said. Keeping your promises ranges from something as simple as calling your significant other at the time you said you would call to remaining faithful to that person no matter what temptation you may encounter. Promises that are kept are the glue of all good relationships, especially ones that span many miles, she said.
If you're an avid Netflix user, you know there's only one way to watch: Put on your stretchy pants and plop on the couch with enough snacks to sustain you through several hours of viewing. And if you haven't already binged your way through Tidying Up with Marie Kondo on Netflix, add it to your watch list ASAP.\n\nFirst of all, the show is meme gold. But behind host Marie Kondo's coos, giggles and subtle shade are some truly valuable lessons that are bound to spark a bit of joy in your life. That's because she's the author of New York Time bestseller The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, creator of the KonMari Method and all-around tidying expert.\n\n#MarieKondo subtly shading someone with the biggest smile on her face is my mood in 2019#TUWMK #TidyingUp pic.twitter.com/yhEskPMpgl — offscreen babble podcast (@offscreenbabble) January 1, 2019\n\n1. Embrace change\n\nChange is scary and hard. But nothing worth changing is easy, so you might as well go about it with a positive attitude.\n\nKondo is unfazed by what would be anxiety-inducing piles of junk for most people. In fact, she's visibly elated by stacks of newspapers and rooms full of Christmas decorations, and that energy is infectious. By the end of each episode, participants who started off apprehensive or overwhelmed are equally excited about home organization.\n\n2. Clutter can affect your relationships more than you think\n\nSure it's just stuff, but letting clutter take over your home can have consequences that seep into your relationships, too. Depending on how you handle it, those consequences can be negative or positive.\n\nTake the Friend family from the first episode. Husband and father Kevin admitted that stressing over mess meant his family often got the worst side of him. That realization was clearly heartbreaking for him. Frank and Matt from Episode 5 felt like their junk was holding them back from maturing individually and as a couple that would make their respective parents proud.\n\nOn the other hand, Episode 2′s empty-nesters Wendy and Ron Akiyama, who were in a long-term marriage rut, reconnected and strengthened their relationship by working together to organize their home.\n\n3. Ditch what doesn't bring you joy\n\nWhen it comes to sorting through your belongings, you might evaluate whether each item is practical, useful or valuable. However, one of the key tenants of Kondo's KonMari method of tidying is first asking yourself whether an item brings you joy.\n\nHow refreshing is that? Instead of worrying about whether you might fit into those jeans again or if that pile of electrical cords could come in handy some day, just ask: Does this spark joy for me? If not, remove it from your life.\n\nNetflix\n\n4. Be grateful, even for your junk\n\nTidying up involves getting rid of a lot of stuff you don't need, and Kondo has a process for that too: Thank each item before putting it in the no pile.\n\nSure, the concept might seem a little strange (though not as strange as greeting each house), but the core of Kondo's process is about being appreciative of all you have. Gratitude is very important, she affirms. Though owning too much stuff can become stressful, Kondo reminds us that we shouldn't take our prosperity for granted.\n\nFirst blessing of 2019: watching Marie Kondo tenderly thanking and folding a SQUAD GOALS tank top — knox (@imtellingcaity) January 1, 2019\n\n5. It's OK to recognize the sentimental side of stuff\n\nMany organization gurus might tell you that junk is junk, and it's not worth holding onto items for sentimental reasons. But Kondo doesn't pass any judgment on what show participants decide to keep. In fact, she dedicates an entire step to tidying sentimental items, even breaking the rules in Episode 4 by allowing Margie to sort through her late husband's belongings ahead of schedule. Kondo shows that it's perfectly fine to hold onto these things, but in a way that brings you joy, of course.\n\n6. The amount of clothing we own is shocking\n\nThe first step in the KonMari method is taking all of the clothes you own and making one big pile to sort through. Only by creating one big pile are you able to see how much clothing you actually have. You will also be shocked by the amount of clothing you actually have, Kondo explains in Episode 2. From Wendy's towering mountain of clothing to Mario's collection of 150 sneakers, Tidying Up highlights the staggering amount of clothing most Americans own.\n\nUnfortunately, we end up throwing away about 70 pounds of clothing and textiles each year, which often ends up in landfills. If anything, Tidying Up should make you think twice about your purchases and maybe consider buying more sustainable fashion.\n\n7. Not all lessons have to be big to be life-changing\n\nIf you make it through the entire season of Tidying Up, you see that the daunting process of organizing a messy home has a transformational impact on the participants' lives. Relationships are strengthened, old wounds are healed and houses become homes.
CNN's Don Lemon chimed in Monday on Oprah Winfrey's explosive interview with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, commenting that he wasn't in the slightest bit surprised by the racism the couple had encountered from members of the royal family and the U.K. media.\n\nI don't think Oprah, I don't think anyone who watched it ― especially any person of color ― is surprised that there's racism in the British royal family, Lemon said. That is what the monarchy is based on - heredity, hierarchy, a caste system, bloodlines.\n\nLemon argued that the whole institution is built on a racist structure, and, considering such a systemically prejudiced system, it was no wonder that the royal family had been concerned about the potentially dark skin of Archie, the child of Meghan and Harry.\n\nThe couple told Winfrey that this, along with the bigoted U.K. press, had contributed to their decision to move to America, adding that Harry's family had thus far been unwilling to apologize for any role they had played in driving the pair overseas.\n\nHarpo Productions/Joe Pugliese via Getty Images Oprah Winfrey interviews Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on a CBS special that aired Sunday night.\n\nThere should not be a 'Oh, my God, the British family is racist' ― of course they're racist, Lemon sad. That's what the entire monarchy is built on ― the racism, the family that is supposed to be in that only by birth. And so far by birth, it's only been white royals on the British throne.\n\nThe CNN host added he was also unsurprised at Harry's statement that he had been unaware of the prejudices in his family until forced to confront them with his mixed-race wife.\n\nThat part was not surprising, because as we always say, that is what privilege is always about, Lemon said, adding, If you don't have to deal with it, then it doesn't exist for you. Lemon brought up his own marriage to Tim Malone, a white man from the east end of Long Island, pointing out that only through marrying a Black man from the South had he truly come to a reckoning regarding racism. Of course, I'm not surprised that Harry was introduced to racism through his wife and he felt it in a personal way, Lemon said. That's how it happens.... Harry has a Black child and a Black wife now, so it is personal. See Lemon's comments below.
A woman in Ventura, California, had reason to be feeling a little hot under the collar when her firefighter boyfriend proposed marriage.\n\nThat's because he faked a blaze at their house to set the scene.\n\nIt happened back in November just as the couple was preparing to host a holiday party at the home they shared.\n\nFor some reason, Zach Steele, 30, thought it would be funny ― unbeknownst to Maddison Ridgik, also 30 ― to plant six remote-operated smoke machines in their attic before supposedly going out to pick up last-minute groceries.\n\nOriginally I got one smoke machine, he told Inside Edition. I went to test it and there was barely any smoke. One was not going to work, so I had to get more smoke machines.\n\nHe ended up going overboard with six, which caused a lot of smoke to spew out of the house, sending Ridgik into a justified panic.\n\nHowever, her mom was in on the prank and faked a call to 911, which gave the signal to Steele ― and a few of his firefighter buddies ― to ride to the rescue in full gear, according to SWNS.com.\n\nRidgik wasn't sure what to think at first. I was so confused and I honestly could not sort through my emotions enough to really comprehend what was happening, she told the news agency.\n\nThen Steele whipped off his oxygen mask.\n\nI think she saw my face and calmed down, and realized what was going to happen, he said.\n\nThe pyromaniac proposal, captured on body camera footage shared by SWNS, did bring on the waterworks.\n\nWhen he got down on one knee, I was so emotional. I was still shaking and crying yet so excited, Ridgik told SWNS. It was truly the best, most indescribable moment of my life.\n\nSWNS.com Zach Steele pops the question to his surprised girlfriend, Maddison Ridgik.\n\nThe couple intends to make things official on March 30 in Ojai, according to their page on TheKnot.com.
When it was announced that Sandra Oh would be hosting the Golden Globe Awards alongside Andy Samberg this year, people were ... confused.\n\nSure, Oh is a beloved TV actor, known for her critically acclaimed run on Grey's Anatomy and now her role on the knob-chopping spy thriller Killing Eve. And Samberg, a quick-fire comedian with a seemingly inborn stage presence, successfully made the transition from Saturday Night Live cast member to bona fide sitcom lead.\n\nBut the two together? Why?\n\nThe question was on the tip of my tongue as I watched the very talented stars awkwardly rattle off jokes side-by-side Sunday evening. Maybe it was their lack of chemistry. Former Emmys host Samberg is a natural funnyman, kicked into gear by live TV king Lorne Michaels. Oh's humor is a little drier, sharper; a bit of Cristina Yang bled through her carefully timed delivery. Separately, their demeanors are fantastic. Forced together, one host always seemed to be chasing the other's lead.\n\nOr perhaps it was the kill them with kindness schtick that didn't quite land as the two tripped over their purposefully tame teleprompter lines. Or the odd transition from facetious hot potato to sincere monologue, when Oh, standing in front of a room full of mostly rich white people, began to explain how sincerely special it was for her, an Asian-Canadian actor, to be hosting the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's big night.\n\nI wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change, she began, as audience members continued to bleat out awkward laughs. I'm not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real, because I see you, and I see you. All of these faces of change. And now, so will everyone else.\n\nCelebrities at the Beverly Hilton, along with the ordinaries at home who've been trained to expect cheesy jokes and oddball stunts from their broadcast awards shows, seemed to miss the sentiment shift at first ― only noticing it when the tears started welling up in Oh's eyes.\n\nAnd then I realized: My problem with the hosts had little to do with them, their schtick or the audience's inability to appropriately digest Oh's impactful speech. The reality is simpler: There is no such thing as a good awards show host.\n\nThe thing is, the job of an awards show host ― in the age of real-time social media criticism, at least ― is a lose-lose gig, and the organizations who run those shows know it. Just ask Anne Hathaway. If you're cutesy, you're labeled a bore by the masses. If you're sarcastic, you're considered too snarky. If you stay silent on politics, you're unwoke. If you're Jimmy Kimmel, you're just doing it to promote your late-night show.\n\nNow, when Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph took the stage on Sunday, I wondered if those women ― two more of Michaels' protégés ― could carry a contemporary awards show with minimal criticism. Their timing, chemistry and delivery soared in the few minutes they were on camera. That, in part, had to do with their lack of dependency on the prompter, as they used most of their limited screen time to gaze into each other's eyes after a staged proposal. (A proposal that maybe mocked director Glenn Weiss' Emmys engagement?) But wouldn't watching Poehler and Rudolph perform standup for 60 minutes be 10 times better than watching them read off overly rehearsed lines to a room full of people who are high on Moët and their own egos?\n\nThat was the case with Poehler and Fey when they were given the chance to host the Golden Globes three years in a row, thanks to their near-perfect rapport. Their banter and charm was certainly a welcome distraction from the otherwise methodical format of awards shows, which is why people are campaigning for duos like John Mulaney and Nick Kroll to host. Except I'd rather just watch funny people perform their Netflix specials than schmooze through a set of overly vetted jokes performed in front of the crème de la crème of Tinseltown. Maybe awards show hosts were more popular in the 1980s and '90s because we had few opportunities otherwise to see comedians like Billy Crystal and Chris Rock live. Now, streaming platforms, social media and YouTube make it easy to get your fix.\n\nLet's be clear: Oh's monologue on Sunday was nothing short of refreshing, underscoring just how historic her stint as the first Asian host of the Golden Globes really was. As she said, things are changing in Hollywood; we can now demand more than the same people (historically, white men) tap dancing across the stages of celebrity soirees year after year.\n\nBut not even Oh could save the long beleaguered awards show hosting gig overall. Because it's a bad job. What we really want is to see her in more leading roles on television, maybe even film. Let her energy be focused on those important goals rather than a job that rarely receives praise. We put these hosts through the wringer, only to demand more from the next year's choice ― be funnier, be quicker, be more aggressive, but also relax. Why do they even bother?\n\nSo, Oscars producers licking their wounds after Kevin Hart stepped down from the job, listen up: Hire no one. You don't need a host. You only need presenters. Funny ones, yes. Maybe a handful of smartly matched, comedic pairings (Hollywood sweethearts, witty Brits, drunken castmates, whoever!) who can still deliver bits without carrying the burden of the whole show.\n\nI can suggest a few expected presenter pairs: Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski (bonus points for marriage!). Constance Wu and Randall Park. Some less expected: Melissa McCarthy and Michael B. Jordan. Lin-Manuel Miranda and Idris Elba. Ryan Reynolds and Tiffany Haddish. Write them some good jokes and we'll tune in.\n\nBut don't bait us with a host, or even two.\n\nBecause the role of awards show host is the most thankless job in entertainment, and we should stop commanding that our favorites even try. Rather than judge someone for all their inevitable mistakes, let's laugh at short bits between a few random A-listers. Guiding the ship, as Oh now knows, is a losing battle for the hosts and the audience at home, who are really just looking for a reason not to change the channel.
Khloe Kardashian opened up about the extent of Lamar Odom's infidelities on Wednesday's episode of The Howard Stern Show.\n\nAdmitting that love is blind, Kardashian told Stern that she was unaware of her estranged husband's infidelity for some time.\n\nNot that I don't think, 'Oh, this will never happen to me,' but Lamar was so great at making me feel like I was the only one and I'm this princess, I never speculated cheating, said the 31-year-old author and reality TV star. So I didn't know about cheating until ... before the DUI.\n\nOdom was arrested on suspicion of DUI in 2013. The two had been married since 2009. Kardashian told Stern that Odom cheated on her for the majority of the marriage, something he managed to keep secret with the help of an assistant.\n\nNothing was on his cell phone, said Kardashian on the radio show. He had an assistant -- they were all on his assistant's phone. He was really crafty ... It's disgusting.\n\nJason LaVeris via Getty Images\n\nKardashian and Odom's marriage was a main story line (and still is) on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Khloe's struggle to conceive also factored into the family's reality show quote often. But looking back, Kardashian says she realizes why she couldn't get pregnant. When you're high, you don't have strong swimmers, said the reality star of Odom's drug use.\n\nListen to more of Khloe Kardashian's interview on The Howard Stern Show below:\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nPHOTO GALLERY Khloe & Lamar
After 18 years of marriage and two kids, cartoonist Adrienne Hedger has accumulated plenty of fodder for her comic series, Hedger Humor.\n\nHedger Humor Adrienne Hedger is the artist behind the popular Hedger Humor Facebook page.\n\nI happened to marry someone who is my opposite in many ways, so it makes for a lot of humorous situations, she told HuffPost. Sometimes when these events play out, they aren't funny in the moment — but I know that they might make a good cartoon later.\n\nHedger constantly finds inspiration in everyday life with her husband and daughters, ages 12 and 14. Sometimes, she gets ideas from her married friends and family members. But either way, Hedger always jots them down immediately ― either in a notebook, in an email to herself or by recording a voice memo on her phone ― so she doesn't forget.\n\nMy husband now knows that when he sees me suddenly writing myself a note or sending myself an email, he may be featured in an upcoming cartoon, she told HuffPost.\n\nIn her work, she captures a variety of relatable moments that any married person can identify with.\n\nLike snoring:\n\nOr sneezing:\n\nHedger Humor You get two bless yous max.\n\nOr conflicting laundry styles:\n\nHedger Humor for Babble I'm a laundry rebel, baby!\n\nHedger hopes her cartoons serve as a reminder that no partner or relationship is perfect ― and that's just fine.\n\nI leave a cup on the counter, you sneeze too loudly, we can't agree on laundry protocol, she said. But we love each other. And somehow it all works.\n\nHedger Humor Every couple is familiar with The Cup.\n\nOne of the best parts of her job is seeing readers share her cartoons with their significant others.\n\nI feel like I've helped create a moment of connection there — like a couple is saying, 'This is so us,' and they are sharing a laugh about it, Hedger told HuffPost. Being in a relationship can be hard. We have to remember to step back and laugh at ourselves. I hope my cartoons bring that perspective to people.
Call her a girl interrupted inspired: Megan Fox is just one slightly concerning lip lock with a sibling from going full 2000s Angelina Jolie.\n\nThe Jennifer's Body star has been dating her twin flame (her words, not ours) Machine Gun Kelly for months now, following her separation from husband Brian Austin Green.\n\nAfter meeting last year on the set of the upcoming thriller Midnight in the Switchgrass and making things Instagram official over the summer, the two have turned the intensity dial up a few notches in recent months, likening their romance to being in love with a tsunami or a forest fire.\n\nSo, it really shouldn't come as a surprise that the pair did the absolute most for Valentine's Day over the weekend, with the rapper plainly stating in an Instagram caption I wear your blood around my neck alongside a knife and blood drop emoji.\n\nAnd, in case you needed a visual aid, Kelly shared a photo of the necklace, which apparently contains a drop of Fox's blood in an orb-like pendant.\n\nIn her own post, Fox didn't reveal if she's gone to the same lengths of devotion, but certainly matched Kelly's energy with an effusive caption.\n\nThere goes my heart manifest outside of my body draped in the towering silhouette of a most unusually handsome boy, she wrote alongside a series of photos of the couple, which included a pic of the rapper licking her face.\n\nMagical and haunted. Kinetic and tortured. Ethereal and dangerous. Cosmic. Lawless. Eternal. Creative genius, she continued. The journey will likely be perilous but there is no destination without him. Happy Valentine's day rehab barbie.\n\nFans were quick to point out that while Fox and Kelly's love might be in a league of their own, Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton did the whole blood necklace thing first.\n\nWhile the actors' headline-grabbing marriage fizzled out after a couple of years, the story of the vials of each other's blood they wore around their necks holds a special place in the annals of pop culture.\n\nThe necklaces were a very simple thing, Thornton said years ago about the matching accessories, which he explained were initially Jolie's idea. 'Hey, let's poke our finger with a pin and smear a little on there, and when we're away from each other, we'll wear the necklace.' That was that easy, but by the time it came out in the press, it sounded like we were wearing a bucket of blood around our necks.\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Jolie clarified that the necklace was never a vial anyway, but instead a kind of flower press.\n\nIt was like from a slight cut on your finger and you press your fingerprint in. It was kind of a sweet gesture, she told Entertainment Weekly. I thought it was kind of romantic! I still love him dearly and think the world of him, and I'm proud to have been his wife for a time.
In an era of ass-kicking women on TV (Supergirl, Blindspot's Jane Doe, Legends of Tomorrow's White Canary, Netflix's Jessica Jones), the Bella Twins are the real thing. Well, as real as anything gets on reality TV, anyway.\n\nIt's definitely 100 percent real, Nikki Bella, one-half of the WWE twin sister act with Brie Bella, vowed over the phone from Los Angles on Jan. 15, four days before tonight's Season 5 premiere of Total Divas (9 p.m. ET/PT) on the E! channel.\n\nBrie, who seems less demonstrative than Nikki (until she gets into Brie Mode, becoming the life of the party), joined her equally funny twinster on the speakerphone for an engaging, fast-paced tag-team conversation.\n\nRegarding the entertaining series that follows several female professional wrestlers and their significant others, Nikki added, The cameras catch everything going on in our lives from inside the ring to outside the ring.\n\nBrie agreed, saying: You obviously have these moments where you want to be alone but the cameras are there. ... And they're with you constantly. Not only out on the road but when we go home on our off days and have personal lives. But that's what we signed up for.\n\nGoing by their ring name, the Bella Twins were born Stephanie Nicole (older by 16 minutes) and Brianna Monique to Jon Garcia and Kathy Colace on Nov. 21, 1983, according to Wikipedia. On youth soccer clubs while growing up in Scottsdale, Ariz., they continued playing until graduating from Chaparral High School in 2002.\n\nNow they are two of the most popular and successful performers on the E! channel's hit series and among the WWE Divas. And it's easy to understand why -- both not only are stunning champions in the ring, but also show a lot of heart, spirit, charisma and character as their daily trials, tribulations and triumphs are played out on national television.\n\nWhen the Bellas were initially approached about the series, both had doubts.\n\nI know my first thought was, I don't know if I'm entertaining enough, Brie said. I know people will connect to me but I don't know if I'm that interesting. But I guess it seems like I am.\n\nAdded Nikki: For me it was a tough decision at first because my boyfriend John (Cena, a professional wrestler and actor) and I had a talk about it. And we were kind of like, 'Do we want put our private life out there?' John being so private, there was definitely discussion about that. At the end of the day, I know that people are gonna love me and they're gonna hate me but if women can relate to me and feel like they're not alone and learn from my mistakes then, to me, that's a reward, and I love what I do. But it wasn't like an immediate yes. It's definitely something I had to think about. And in the end, I feel I made the right decision and I have no regrets.\n\n\n\nThe Bella Twins -- Nikki (left) and Brie -- are gearing up for another\n\ndramatic season of Total Divas.\n\nAlong with divulging some of their aspirations once they finally step out of the ring, the Bellas discuss upcoming developments (so SPOILER ALERT!) on the show this season. The interview concludes with a fun lightning-round Q&A in which Brie and Nikki reveal a few likes and dislikes (watch your back, Renee Zellweger) following clips featuring each of them in the Season 5 opener.\n\nThe Jan. 19 premiere updates viewers on their current status with the loves of their lives. Brie, who has been married since 2014 to three-time WWE heavyweight champion Bryan Danielson (competing under the ring name Daniel Bryan) is developing a case of baby fever in the first episode while her husband recovers from a possible career-ending injury.\n\nWe've really been thinking about kids but when you have something happen like this, now I'm the one that's working and my husband's at home, Brie said. It makes you kind of readjust and look at your life and say, 'Are we really ready for kids right now? Or do we really have to look at the next chapter of our lives, and does that mean different careers?' So you see us go through that journey this season.\n\nNikki, in a long-term relationship with Cena, who underwent shoulder surgery Jan. 7, said she's stuck in a love triangle with another wrestler -- ex-boyfriend Dolph Ziggler -- during the season's first two episodes.\n\nOne thing I have wanted since I was a little girl is marriage and kids, she said, adding that Ziggler is ready to give her both.\n\nEspecially because we all work together, it's made it a very awkward situation. But here I thought I was protecting John by not telling him, and this season, you see his reaction when I do tell him. ... And it's definitely not the greatest situation but it's definitely one you want to tune in and see the decision I make and how, you know, I'm going to live the rest of my life with that.\n\n\n\nSo setting up the scenario like the seasoned pros that they are, the Bella Twins -- who profess their love for reality TV and would relish starring in a Divas spinoff -- also made other disclosures.\n\nThough she still has a real estate license, Nikki said selling homes is on the back burner because of their busy schedules.\n\nMy husband is trying to convince her to sell Earthship (Biotecture) homes, Brie said of Danielson, an affirmed environmentalist who also makes a surprise appearance later in this interview.\n\nAsked what gives her the most pleasure away from the ring, the quick-witted Brie said, Well, my husband ... just kidding. But, you know, honestly, my husband and I, we love gardening. We're really big into local food spots and farm-to-table spots and just kind of showcasing and using our platform to put local vendors on that.\n\nSaying she's not totally ready to give up the ring yet, Brie offered that she is figuring out things that I can do with a baby bump. ... You know I feel like we'll start trying for a family sooner than later.\n\nAs Nikki and Brie consider other future endeavors like an undergarment line for women, entrepreneur (and Shark Tank investor) Daymond John is scheduled to make a guest appearance on the show. Television journalist Maria Shriver, who as the ex-wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger is the former first lady of California, also offers Nikki some words of encouragement.\n\nI would love to be a motivational speaker, said Nikki, who made it clear she wants to remain part of the WWE family after her wrestling days are over. She's what inspires me to use my voice and motivate women and empower them and inspire young girls.\n\nNikki also has designs on becoming a television host after getting an enjoyable trial run on the E! After Party following NBC's Golden Globes telecast on Jan. 10. Sitting with a panel that included Ross Matthews, Zanna Roberts Rassi and NeNe Leakes, she said, I really had a lot of fun. ... It's definitely something I love and, if E! will have me, I definitely want to do more of it in the future, for sure.\n\nWhen it was suggested that E! should consider both for a twinning combination during its Academy Awards coverage, the Bellas sounded like superheroines eager to take on the most dangerous villain.\n\nThis will drop NeNe right off her seat, Brie said with a laugh.\n\nWith more than a month until the Oscars, let the smackdown countdown begin.\n\nNikki's clip\n\nBrie's clip\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND WITH THE BELLA TWINS\n\nFeel free if you want to argue or elaborate. Between you and your sister, tell me:\n\nWho was the smartest in school?\n\nBrie: Nikki was not.\n\nNikki: Or Brie. I would say we were equal.\n\nBryan Danielson: This is Brie's husband, Bryan. I can vouch for the fact that neither of them were good in school.\n\nBrie: Bryan!\n\nNikki: I got A's and B's, so I think that's pretty good in school.\n\nBrie: We were A's and B's students but neither one of us was better at one than the other. I feel like we were equal.\n\nWho's the toughest competitor?\n\nBrie: Uh, Nikki. I'll give that to Nikki. She's very competitive, she's very tough.\n\nWho's the most romantic?\n\nBrie: Nikki. Well, Bryan, Bryan ...\n\nBryan: I've never been in a relationship (with Nikki), but if it's between Brie and I, I am the more romantic of the two.\n\nBrie (laughing): So, yeah, I guess Nikki's more romantic. But I am a love bug. I'm very affectionate.\n\nWhat is the most surprising thing your sister has done?\n\nBrie: It surprised me when Nikki actually really wanted to become a motivational speaker and took all the steps in doing that. And then gave a motivational talk to 40 women. That surprised me. And I was really proud of her.\n\nNikki: Awww, thanks, Brie.\n\nBrie: You're welcome.\n\nNikki: I actually have to say Brie's Christmas gift to me this past year. I joined this women's network called Diamonds Unleashed. And they sell these diamond rings that represent women empowerment. And Brie knew that. I was telling her that, 'You know the one thing that sucks about not being married is that I don't wear a ring, so I get hit on a lot. ... I sometimes wish I had a ring so I wouldn't get hit on.' So literally for Christmas, Brie got me this ring so I could wear it out and not get hit on. And for some reason, I was surprised. And it was like very touching.\n\nYour favorite athlete outside pro wrestling?\n\nBrie: Mine would definitely be (Mixed Martial Artist) Ronda Rousey.\n\nNikki: That's a good one. Mine was (American soccer star) Mia Hamm but she's retired. I would think mine would be (Denver Broncos quarterback) Peyton Manning. I love Peyton Manning.\n\nYour favorite drama queen in TV or movies?\n\nNikki: You know I have to say, it's Emma Roberts' character from Scream Queens, Chanel Oberlin. She's amazing.\n\nBrie: Brie's would be Juliette Barnes in Nashville, who's played by Hayden Panettiere.\n\nWho is the biggest diva you've ever seen or come across?\n\nBrie: Uh, I think because we're professional wrestlers, no one's really a diva around us.\n\nNikki: Actually, the biggest diva I've come across is Rene Zellweger. She didn't want to meet the Divas when she came to Monday Night Raw. And didn't want them around her ex, Bradley Cooper. And what really grates me is (when) you come into our environment and then put rules on the Divas. It's like, 'I could like you but then don't come to our environment and do that.'  (laughs)\n\nWhat about you, Brie?\n\nBrie: No, I really haven't. It's crazy.\n\nNikki: Yeah, right. She's thinking like five in her head right now.\n\nBrie: No. Everyone's been so sweet to me. Maybe it's because I'm so sweet. I don't know.\n\nFictional or real-life villain you love to hate?\n\nNikki: I would say Cersei (Lannister) from Game of Thrones (played by Lena Headey).\n\nBrie: Gosh, that's a good one. I'm gonna have to agree with Nikki on that. Her character legit makes me want to turn it off.\n\nStrangest thing you've been asked to do in the series?\n\nNikki: They wanted me to ride a hot air balloon and I said, 'Absolutely not,' because I'm terrified of heights. I know that's not strange or weird but it was something I was asked to do and I said no.\n\nBrie: Gosh, I must be boring or something. I haven't been asked to do something strange or weird. I can't even think of anything.\n\nDo they want you to get into Brie Mode every episode?\n\nBrie (laughing): I think they pray for it. But they never push that on me. That's just something I like to do on my own time. You know, I was asked about the hot air balloon, too, and I was like, 'Absolutely no way.' \n\nSecret ambition?\n\nNikki: It would be motivational speaking and starting an undergarment line.\n\nBrie: Mine would be saving the planet, helping the environment and all the animals that can't have their voice be heard. And to kind of be their voice.\n\nSince it's the E! channel, who's your favorite Kardashian?\n\nNikki: Oooh, that's tough.\n\nBrie: There's a lot of them. Khloe is just hilarious. But I feel like I relate the most to Kourtney.\n\nNikki: I love Kim and Khloe. But mine would probably be Khloe. Khloe and I would have an amazing time going and having happy hour.\n\nAnd just one more: Growing up, which of you did Mom like best?\n\nNikki: Oh, Brie.\n\nBrie: Definitely Brie.\n\nWhy?\n\nBrie: Because I was just the better child. I listened to her ... \n\nNikki: That's not it at all. I think it was because she was the miracle baby.\n\nPhotos and clips courtesy of NBC Universal.
Ellen DeGeneres forgot to leave off Tatum when introducing newly single actress and dancer Jenna Dewan to her show on Wednesday, but the World of Dance judge and the talk show host handled it like pros.\n\nDewan recently split from her husband, Channing, after nearly nine years of marriage, and decided to drop the Tatum from her last name.\n\nDeGeneres apologized for the little flub before the segment ended.\n\nI have to say, before we go to break, I'm so sorry, she said. I introduced you and it was just such a habit, and I have to say the way that you and Channing are handling everything is beautiful for your daughter and the statements have been great. And I apologize. I just have known both of you for so long, and I'm so used to saying...\n\nDewan responded by assuring DeGeneres that she was fine and it was all love.\n\nI know, I know. Thank you, the 37-year-old said, before addressing the audience. Honestly, thank you and everybody for all the love and support. It's truly, so moving. It's all love.\n\nDewan and Tatum announced they were splitting in April. The two, who have a 4-year-old daughter named Everly together, put out a joint statement on social media about their breakup.\n\nWe have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together, they said.\n\nAbsolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it's time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.\n\nAccording to People magazine, the two are still on good terms with each other.\n\nThey get along. They spend some time together as a family, but mostly separately with Everly, a source said.

When it comes to culture, Americans are like baby birds -- we like our nutrition pre-chewed. About the last place I'd go to learn about Hadley Richardson, perhaps Ernest Hemingway's greatest love, is The Paris Wife. And if I wanted an accurate picture of the Lost Generation in 1920s Paris, I wouldn't source Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen's soufflé of a film. But there's always more gold in literary and cinematic tourism, so I didn't do cartwheels when I received a copy of Georgia, Dawn Tripp's novel of Georgia O'Keeffe.\n\nO'Keeffe was the most famous female American artist of the last century --- and the most written about. I'd read Karen Karbo's charming How Georgia Became O'Keeffe and Roxana Robinson's 675-page biography. I'd spent a day at O'Keeffe's home in Abiquiu, New Mexico interviewing her last assistant, Juan Hamilton, for a magazine profile. And like anyone who'd taken an art history course, I'd seen dozens of the 500 photographs that Alfred Stieglitz had taken of her and could write at least two paragraphs about vaginal imagery in her flower paintings.\n\nReally, what's left to know about Georgia O'Keeffe?\n\nThe good news: Georgia is a uniquely American chronicle -- told by O'Keeffe -- that starts with the importance of a good story and a killer bod. Does that sound uncannily like the techniques used to make careers for women a century later? Yes, and to degree that may shock purists, this is a book about branding and marketing, the first two commandments of success in the art world and our world. A book about you, perhaps, if you're female and have a man in your life who wants the best for you and knows how you can get it. And, in the end, a book about a talent so fierce it crushed pretty much everything in its path -- a rare story of artistic triumph.\n\nYou know the outlines. In 1915, when O'Keeffe was a 27-year-old art teacher in Texas, she sent some charcoal drawings to a friend in New York. The friend showed them to Stieglitz, who flipped for them and showed them in his gallery. His letters and that show lured O'Keeffe to New York.\n\nFrom the beginning, O'Keeffe had an exalted agenda: When someone looks at something I have painted, I want them to feel what moved me to paint it in the first place. I paint as I feel it. Light, sky, air. As I want it to be felt. But O'Keeffe wasn't just heralded for her drawings. She was also a model -- a nude model -- for her photographer lover. Which she liked. A lot: I've begun to crave the way his eyes rake over me, so I am only a body. No inhibition, no thought. Pure sensation. There is a strange freedom in that, and it begins to fuel my art.\n\nThese photographs were, for all Stieglitz's artistic cred, close to exploitation -- the male gaze at work. Critics are piano players in the whorehouse of media, and when they come to write about these nudes, they see tits-and-ass:\n\n\n\nThey describe my body in rudely intimate terms: the navel, the mons veneris, the armpits, the bones along the skin of the neck...the life of the pores, of the hairs along the shin-bone, of the veining of the pulse, and the liquid moisture on the upper lip... lucent unfathomable eyes, the gesture of chaste and impassioned surrender. It's the scandal that drew them. They're not after the art. I am his mistress. It's not a stranger's body they're describing, but mine. How could I not have seen this coming? I should have known. What was I thinking?\n\nWe know what. She and Stieglitz were in a deep conversation about art and truth. But this was a conversation between two people who didn't have equal power. Stieglitz was a god, O'Keeffe was a child. At the train station in New York, Stieglitz holds me tightly.... everything in me turns suddenly soft. Then there is his hand in the small of my back, my body against him. And in this way, as it has been since the beginning of time, she overcame her respect for Stieglitz's marriage.\n\nTripp expertly makes drama of two traditional themes in the O'Keeffe story -- the romance with Stieglitz and the development of her art -- but it's the track about her art and his management of it and her struggle not to be dominated by him that makes her novel compelling. It's a story of yes, but. Stieglitz may be the mastermind behind her career, but O'Keeffe's not a willing puppet. She's a one-man woman, but he strays, in at least one instance with a woman who works at the gallery and supports it. He needs O'Keeffe in residence, but she needs to work in the West.\n\nWhy didn't she break with Stieglitz? Well, he wrote thousands of letters to her, he was a wordsmith who addicted her to his words. And he adored her. And, though she wished it were different, the money.\n\nThese are important questions, but they don't present themselves as questions, the writing is too good for that. In most first-person novels, the character talks to you. Here, she recollects with you -- in her heart as well as her head. Which is to say that Dawn Tripp writes in much the same way as O'Keeffe painted: in vivid color and subtle shade. Reading her, I thought of Light Years and something James Salter said in describing it:\n\nThe book is the worn stones of conjugal life. All that is beautiful, all that is plain, everything that nourishes or causes to wither. It goes on for years, decades, and in the end seems to have passed like things glimpsed from the train -- a meadow here, a stand of trees, houses with lit windows in the dusk, darkened towns, stations flashing by -- everything that is not written down disappears except for certain imperishable moments, people, and scenes.\n\n\n\nAs O'Keeffe looks back on her life, those glimpses lead her to a question I've never seen asked before:\n\nIt occurs to me that perhaps Stieglitz is not my life, but a detour from it.\n\nDiscuss: Was Georgia O'Keeffe, popularly regarded as a feminist heroine, oppressed as a woman -- and what do she make of that?\n\n----\n\nDawn Tripp will be reading in Dallas, Scottsdale, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Decatur, Washington, Mystic Ct., Providence, Newton, Brookline and Westport.

loujainhathloul Fahad Albutairi (left) is a popular Saudi comedian. Loujain Hathloul (right) is a prominent women's rights activist in Saudi Arabia. Both have been harassed by the Saudi government.\n\nA TV producer's Twitter thread is going viral after he called on lawmakers to come to the aid of two well-known activist friends who have been arrested amid Saudi Arabia's ruthless crackdown on dissidents.\n\nKirk Rudell, whose producing credits include American Dad! and Will & Grace, drew attention to the plight of women's rights activist Loujain Hathloul and comedian Fahad Albutairi in a Twitter thread Wednesday. Both were reportedly arrested last year, and Hathloul remains in detention. Albutairi's status was not immediately known.\n\nRudell called on the U.S. government to stop accepting payoffs to look the other way at human rights atrocities committed by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThough Hathloul's detention has been widely reported for months, Rudell's disturbing Twitter thread ― an excerpt of which is included below ― propelled her story back into the spotlight this week. His post follows the high-profile killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who had criticized the country's royal family.\n\nRudell tweeted that he first met Albutairi, dubbed the Seinfeld of Saudi Arabia, and his then-wife Hathloul a couple years ago during a recording session for Fox's American Dad! Rudell is a co-executive producer and has written for the animated TV series. Albutairi voiced a minor character in a 2017 episode of the show, according to IMDb.\n\nHathloul, who rose to prominence for defying Saudi Arabia's ban on women drivers, and Albutairi continued to keep in touch with Rudell over the years, the TV writer said. But Rudell wrote that his communication with them ceased after they were allegedly detained by Saudi officials in March 2018.\n\nWhile Jared Kushner's buddy [Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman] was planning to murder Khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including Fahad and Loujain, Rudell tweeted.\n\nRudell urged high-profile figures like Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, as well as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and the newly Democratic-led House of Representatives, to focus on Albutairi and Hathloul.\n\nThey were just young, creative people, trying to make stuff, Rudell wrote.\n\nNeither Rudell nor a representative for the Saudi government immediately responded to HuffPost's requests for comment. HuffPost's email to Albutairi was not returned.\n\nWhile Jared Kushner's buddy MbS was planning to murder Khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including Fahad and Loujain.\n\n\n\nThey were just young, creative people, trying to make stuff. pic.twitter.com/V14KV8USHs — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nHathloul was jailed for 73 days in 2014 after driving her car from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, where she lived. She has been arrested several times since then for protesting Saudi Arabia's male guardianship laws and ban on women drivers.\n\nMohammed bin Salman became publicly associated with the government's decision to lift the ban by permitting women to apply for driver's licenses, which was announced just a few months after he gained new power by becoming crown prince in the summer of 2017.\n\nSome world leaders saw the move as a signal that the crown price would herald in a more progressive era for the Middle Eastern kingdom. But the infamous killing of Khashoggi, which the CIA concluded had been ordered by the crown prince, sent shockwaves through the region.\n\nHathloul and Albutair were reportedly detained by the Saudi government in March 2018. She was released, but ultimately detained again in May 2018, along with several other Saudi women's rights activists.\n\nShe is being held in the country's notorious maximum-security Dhahban Prison, according to Amnesty International. She has not been formally charged.\n\n[Hathloul] appears to have been targeted as punishment for standing up for women's rights in Saudi Arabia, Sara Hashash, Amnesty International's media manager for the Middle East and North Africa, told HuffPost in a statement.\n\nInstead of detaining her for months without charge the Saudi Arabian authorities should release her and all other women human rights defenders detained in connection with their peaceful activism immediately and unconditionally, she added.\n\nAmnesty International reported in November 2018 that activists detained at Dhahban Prison had been subjected to torture and sexual harassment.\n\nAlbutairi was reportedly arrested in March 2018 while working on an acting project in Jordan. He was handcuffed, blindfolded and flown to Saudi Arabia, The New York Times reported. It's unclear if he has been released. His Twitter and Instagram pages have been deleted.\n\nThe Times reported in October that Hathloul and Albutairi's marriage had ended, though it's unclear why or when this happened.\n\nSome Twitter users warned that Rudell's decision to include screenshots of alleged conversations he had with Hathloul could pose a risk to the jailed activist.\n\nI question how wise it is to display what are obviously private screenshots from someone who is currently being detained, tweeted H.A. Hellyer, a Middle Eastern policy and security expert. Surely these could be very easily used against the detainee?\n\nUnpopular opinion: this thread is mostly good, but maybe, just maybe, there was no reason to share screenshots of texts from a now-jailed activist. What purpose does showing Lujain asking for help/feedback serve? 🤔 https://t.co/EnCB0UOcXQ — مريم (@MaryamSaleh) January 3, 2019\n\nI understand what @krudell is trying to accomplish here. But, like @MaryamSaleh, I question how wise it is to display what are obviously private screenshots from someone who is currently being detained. Surely these could be very easily used against the detainee? https://t.co/mEnftJvcmJ — Dr H.A. Hellyer (@hahellyer) January 3, 2019\n\nRead an excerpt of Rudell's Twitter thread below:\n\nA couple years ago, when I was writing for American Dad!, I needed an Arabic speaker for a small part. Our casting director recommended a Saudi comedian, who happened to be in LA for a couple months shooting a tv show. His name is Fahad Albutairi. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI looked him up. He was the first Saudi stand-up comedian to appear on stage professionally in the Kingdom, the Jerry Seinfeld of Saudi Arabia. He had a couple million Twitter followers. (He has none now; I'll get to that.) He was, frankly, more interesting than the part. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThe day of the recording, I walked to the booth to meet Fahad and direct his session – it was just a couple lines; I'd say hi, run it a few times, and we'd both be on our way.\n\n\n\nFahad was standing with a woman, who he introduced as his wife, @LoujainHathloul. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nLoujain didn't know anyone in LA, so she was tagging along with Fahad for the day. They were young, cool, cosmopolitan, and incredibly nice. I liked them right away. We chatted. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI asked Fahad about being a Saudi comedian – about doing something that didn't exist before in his country. I had recently had breakfast with Trevor Noah to talk about a project, and it seemed like he was coming from a similar place... — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\n...growing up without hearing other stand-ups and being unfamiliar with the standard rhythms. So Trevor had to create his own. Fahad was fascinated. Yes, he had had a similar experience. But his voice was also shaped by the fact that comedy in the Kingdom was...dangerous. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nSo now we dipped into politics.\n\n\n\nI mentioned the young, progressive Prince Mohammed bin Salman. All the press in the US seemed pretty positive about the guy. He was meeting people in Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Were they feeling optimistic about the future of Saudi Arabia? — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThey were hopeful but warned there was still a long way to go on human rights. Which is why they'd moved to the UAE.\n\n\n\nHuh. At least you're safe, I said. With millions of fans, he was too high profile to mess with. I looked at Loujain. And his fame covers both of you, right? — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThey looked at each other. She's much more famous than me in the Middle East, he said. And then I realized who she was... one of the women's rights activists who had been arrested for driving. https://t.co/iCbPte9cwe — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI felt like an idiot. I had assumed she was the sidekick when she had already, by her mid-20s, done more for human rights than I ever will. https://t.co/CBGPYzdJJT — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nWe talked about her arrests. The toll it had taken when, just after their wedding, she had been picked up again and disappeared for a few days. They felt somewhat protected by their fame, but still... the Kingdom wasn't safe. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThey were a window into a world I only knew through small articles in the Times, and I could've talked to them all afternoon, but we had to do the record and get on with our days.\n\n\n\nWe exchanged info. We made plans to have dinner while they were in town. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nFahad and I sent each other links to work we were doing...trying to make the gulf between our worlds a little bit smaller. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nIn 2017 I read that Loujain was arrested and reached out to Fahad to see if she was okay. He answered that she was already being released. It was scary but fine.\n\n\n\nAnd then, last spring, they were both grabbed, blindfolded, and taken to Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/PWvLLFW5HD — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nWhile Jared Kushner's buddy MbS was planning to murder Khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including Fahad and Loujain.\n\n\n\nThey were just young, creative people, trying to make stuff. pic.twitter.com/V14KV8USHs — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nNine months later, Loujain is still in jail. I don't know where Fahad is. He deactivated his Twitter.\n\n\n\nI read that they are no longer married. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI'd like to see what they could do in this world, if they were given the chance.\n\n\n\nI'd like the government of my country to not take payoffs to look the other way at human rights atrocities.\n\n\n\nI'd like to have that dinner with them some day. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nAs the Democrats take control of the House, I'd like my fantastic @RepAdamSchiff to have Fahad and Loujain in his thoughts.\n\n\n\nMaybe @Trevornoah can give them some of his attention, too – I know they admired him. — Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nAkbar Shahid Ahmed contributed reporting.
Juan Carlos Ulate / Reuters Roberth Castillo and Mario Arias speak after a news conference to announce the suspension of their wedding scheduled for Saturday, Jan. 20.\n\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rica's first same-sex wedding has been blocked by notaries who are refusing to recognize it until laws forbidding gay marriage are changed, setting them at odds with the president.\n\nThe marriage between two men was set for this Saturday after a top Latin American human rights court earlier this month ruled that countries in the region should legalize same-sex unions, pushing back against opposition from the Roman Catholic church.\n\nThe Inter-American Court, based in Costa Rica's capital San Jose, recommended that those rights be upheld via temporary decrees while governments pursue permanent laws.\n\nCosta Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis then directed government agencies to apply the ruling until lawmakers or the constitutional court formally adopt new laws.\n\nHowever, the notary council of the Central American country said on Friday it would only authorize such unions if the local legislature or the court annul laws outlawing gay marriage.\n\nJuan Carlos Ulate / Reuters There's nothing stopping the road to equality, but the truth is we don't know how long it will take to get there, Castillo and Arias' attorney said.\n\nThe rules that regulate marriage in Costa Rica ... remain in force, the council said, telling notaries to abide by them.\n\nThe court's decision has triggered debate ahead of Costa Rica's presidential election on Feb. 4, with some candidates vowing to fight it.\n\nSolis is barred by law from seeking a second consecutive term.\n\nSeveral Latin American countries, including predominantly Roman Catholic Costa Rica, still do not allow same-sex marriage.\n\nHowever, that is changing, and in recent years same-sex couples have been allowed to marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and some parts of Mexico.\n\nThere's nothing stopping the road to equality, but the truth is we don't know how long it will take to get there, said Larissa Arroyo, an attorney representing the couple in Costa Rica who planned to marry on Saturday.\n\nThe country's Justice Minister Marco Feoli said in a statement that the notary council's stance went against both the executive branch and the Inter-American Court.
South_agency via Getty Images Living together isn't the best decision for all longtime couples, therapists say.\n\nMoving in together is an obvious next step when you've been dating for a while. Cohabitation saves you money and for many couples, it's a great testing ground for marriage: If you get along living together, why not take the big marriage leap?\n\nBut sometimes, merging your lives and stuff makes you realize that maybe you were better off when you lived in separate spaces. In that case, un-moving in together might be the answer.\n\nWhen you un-move in with your partner, you stay together ― you don't want to break up! ― but recognize that, for the time being at least, returning to the previous arrangement of living apart is best for both of you.\n\nI think many couples realize that they are constantly fighting because of differences in cleanliness, daily habits and other unexpected behaviors, said Amy Rollo, a psychotherapist in Houston Heights, Texas. In times like this, moving out can help the couple stay together while alleviating the stress.\n\nAn un-move may mean a temporary living arrangement. Or you might find that separate spaces make sense in the long-term. This all might sound a tad unconventional, but who said your relationship needs to follow charted territory?\n\nThere is no rulebook to a relationship, Rollo said. You know what you are wanting more than any expert out there. Don't be afraid to advocate for your needs.\n\nIntrigued by the prospect of un-moving in together? Below, Rollo and other therapists share a handful of signs that you'd be better off alone, together.\n\nYou moved in because it made financial sense.\n\nMany city-dwelling couples slide into cohabitation because rent prices are through the roof, said Alena Gerst, a psychotherapist in New York City.\n\nWhere I live, I have seen countless patients and personal friends move in before they're ready because someone's lease was up and it just made more financial sense, Gerst said.\n\nThe arrangement might be good for your wallet but bad for your relationship or individual baseline happiness, said Caroline Madden, a marriage and family therapist in Burbank, California.\n\nIt makes sense: Couples can't get get enough of each other at first, Madden said. They figure that they are at each other's place so much it's like they are living together. Then someone has a fight with their roommate or their lease is up so then they move in together. Then the honeymoon is over. The fights start regarding household chores and bill paying.\n\nIn situations like this, you might want to consider moving out after your lease is up.\n\nJustin Lambert via Getty Images Living apart might be a smart choice if your relationship was stronger before living together.\n\nYou were happier in your relationship before the move.\n\nThis one seems obvious, but it's the sign that's most telling: Think back on your lives prior to moving in together. Were you happier and more satisfied with your relationship? Was consolidating your space your undoing? If so, un-moving in can be a smart move, said Karla Ivankovich, a counselor in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nLiving separately again might give you the chance to work on these issues, she said. See if your partner feels the same way: Stress the importance of the relationship but address the flaws not previously part of the relationship, until you moved in together. But also make sure you stress your commitment and that you want to rework from the ground up.\n\nIf this sign is present in your relationship, you also might want to try couples' counseling.\n\nMoving out might solve the thing that showed the relationship difficulties, but it doesn't fix the underlying issues, Rollo said. This is also a time a couple needs to have a talk to determine what their goals for the relationship are. Maybe they want to marry one day, or maybe it's time to talk about making things more casual.\n\nYou have kids and living separately again would benefit them.\n\nUn-moving in might make the most sense for couples where one or both partners have children from previous relationships. Sometimes maintaining separate residences until the kids are out of the house is ultimately best for all parties.\n\nSometimes the parent wants the non-parent to help out more, sometimes less. Sometimes it is too much change for the kids, Madden said. I think some couples get caught up in how happy and in love they are and rush to move in, forgetting that the kids have had their whole world blow up with their parents getting divorced. The kids might not be ready to deal with a new adult in their lives at home.\n\nYour schedules and social needs don't mesh.\n\nYour move-in may have made you realize your lifestyles are incompatible, Gerst said. Living separate, complementary lives means you never have to deal with your partner's weird work schedule or nocturnal ways.\n\nIf one of you is a night owl or works third shift, and the other partner works from home or has a 9-to-5 job, it may be better for everyone's sleep and sanity to keep separate homes, she said.\n\nMaybe your social schedules are wholly at odds, too, Gerst said.\n\nIf one of you is an extrovert and enjoys hosting parties and going out, while the other one of you really needs quiet time and solitude, but your love trumps these differences, then each of you having your own home could be a wise solution, she said.\n\nPortra via Getty Images If you bring up un-moving with your partner, do so sensitively.\n\nHow to talk about it:\n\nIf you want to float this idea with your partner, do so sensitively. Lead with the fact that you don't want to break up, or even take a break, you just need some physical space, Rollo said.\n\nThe way a conversation starts determines how it will end the majority of the time, she said. Let them know you love them and want to continue in the relationship. Then start with an 'I' statement (a statement that starts with 'I feel ... '). 'I' statements help the person receive the information better without getting defensive.\n\nThen, try the positive sandwich method of bringing up a touchy subject, Gerst said.\n\nStart by genuinely expressing your love for your partner, and your devotion to the relationship, she said. Then you can broach the news that you think you should un-move and why.\n\nYour boundaries ― and your partner's ― need to be clearly defined at this point, too.\n\nYou are living apart, that doesn't mean you're free to flirt with other people, Madden said.\n\nLastly remind your S.O. again how much you love them and your hope that this new arrangement will bring you closer and still allow you each to be yourselves, Gerst said.
Katherine Waterston is a true chameleon.\n\nThe daughter of veteran actor Sam Waterston, she has been gracing the stage and screen for 15 years, making her feature debut in 2007′s Michael Clayton before appearing in Taking Woodstock, The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby and the HBO series Boardwalk Empire. However, it wasn't until her memorable turn as Joaquin Phoenix's ex-girlfriend in Paul Thomas Anderson's loopy comedy Inherent Vice that she merited attention.\n\nAs of late, Waterston has starred in projects ranging from the HBO miniseries The Third Day to the film Alien: Covenant and the Fantastic Beasts franchise ― embracing the craft she loves.\n\nNow she's in Mona Fastvold's The World to Come, currently in theaters and on demand March 2, that Waterston has found another layer to shed.\n\nThe movie, shot on 16mm film in wintry Romania, follows 19th-century woman Abigail (Waterston), a grieving mother isolated on an upstate New York farm with her withdrawn husband Dyer (Casey Affleck). Just as she's craving connection, new neighbors Tallie (Vanessa Kirby) and Finney (Christopher Abbott) arrive and the women strike up a friendship that soon turns romantic. With breathtaking cinematography by Andre Chemetoff and poetic narration by Waterston, The World to Come is a rumination on hardship, loneliness and female desire.\n\nWaterston was drawn to Abigail the minute she read the first page of Jim Shepard and Ron Hansen's script, based on Shepard's short story of the same name.\n\nI was so struck by the density of the script and the efficiency of the writing, Waterston told HuffPost in a phone call this week. One of the very first lines of voiceover, which didn't make it into the film, was, 'At night I often wonder if those who have been my intimates have found me to be a steep hill whose view does not repay the ascent.' And it told me so much about Abigail. Here's a woman who clearly was of very limited means and is kept up at night not by what she hasn't gotten from life but questioning what she has given. When I carried that notion through that first read, I was completely devastated.\n\nAbigail is immediately described as an asset to Dyer, which Waterston found interesting considering the negative connotations of that word when compounded with marriage. But the chance to play around with the space in each scene and the mystery of the relational dynamics excited her. It's an ensemble piece that provides specificity for each character, allowing nuance to seep into every frame.\n\nAndre Chemetoff/Bleecker Street Vanessa Kirby with Waterston in The World to Come.\n\nAfter the death of their young daughter, Abigail and Dyer are struggling to connect as they go about their day-to-day duties. They seem to be making progress until free-spirited Tallie captures Abigail's attention. The women begin spending time together, finishing chores while discussing the pressure of motherhood and their desire for education, among other matters. Eventually, they can no longer resist the urge for something deeper.\n\nDyer recognizes the spark between them, but Tallie's unhinged husband Finney is far less amused, becoming a danger to their blossoming love.\n\nMany queer period pieces have hit the cinema recently (The Favourite, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Ammonite), but The World to Come seems to address the fear of being found out more potently. It wasn't uncommon for women to be reprimanded, raped or even killed for disobeying their husband's wishes in the 1800s, as Waterston noted is referenced in Heidi Schreck's play What the Constitution Means to Me.\n\nShe appreciated that, despite the lack of knowledge around the marital experiences of working-class women farmers during this time, the film presented a varied perspective on acceptance.\n\nIt is an interesting study of two very different men's responses to a system that's designed to serve them, Waterston said. Without a doubt, both the men in the story are in the privileged position of being able to have the final word, be the decision-makers in control of their partners, make each and every final decision on any matter regarding the home or other desires. Obviously the whole thing is an imagined history, but I was moved by (the scriptwriters') choice to present one person who would've been permitted to be a much lousier husband [be more accepting]. The writers chose to go, sorry, there has always been a broad range of individuals and the individual does have the choice, regardless of how the system is set up. Dyer is flawed and doesn't have the tools to communicate well, but he does respect his partner. \n\nAffleck, who also produced the film, plays the quiet Dyer with vulnerability, once again giving a powerful, grief-stricken performance. Abbott nails the villainous Finney and Kirby is radiant as fiery Tallie, who entrances Abigail with every glance. Waterston said that although her chemistry with Kirby was instantaneous, it was brought to life by the dialogue.\n\nI'm sort of toying with the theory that chemistry is bullshit or it's not what we think it is, Waterston said. When a script is really well-written and there's tension built in the structure of a scene, it creates the electricity that we feel when we watch two people on screen.\n\nVanessa thinks we can take credit for it, but I'm not so sure if we can, she added with a laugh.\n\nWaterston did admit that all four cast members shared a similar passion and work ethic, which made the production experience a memorable one.\n\nWe were immediately talking about what other projects we could do together because we all really did click and just had the best time working together, she said. I think we all are pretty obsessive and hold ourselves to a high standard, so when you get with other people like that it's kind of a relief. It's a group of quite nerdy actors who really love to work at the scenes, so you don't feel like you're dragging someone to a Sunday rehearsal that they don't want to be at.\n\nThe World to Come is now in theaters and will be on demand March 2.
Clueless star Alicia Silverstone and husband Christopher Jarecki have split, apparently ending their nearly 13-year marriage and decades-long relationship, People reported Monday. They share a 6-year-old son Bear Blu.\n\nThey still deeply love and respect each other and remain very close friends but have mutually decided to separate after being together for 20 years, Silverstone's rep told news outlets. They have a son together who they will continue to co-parent.\n\nSilverstone and musician-actor Jarecki, both 41, wed in June 2005 at Lake Tahoe, California.\n\nUSA Today noted that the pair went vegan together, helping to spawn Silverstone's second act as the cookbook author of The Kind Diet in 2009 and The Kind Mama in 2014.\n\nSilverstone, who has a leading role in the Paramount Network's American Woman, also has campaigned for animal rights. She appeared nude for a 2016 PETA billboard ad in which she declared, I'd rather go naked than wear wool.\n\nSilverstone in recent days has been tweeting about a Hawaiian vacation with her son, without mentioning Jarecki or her split with him.\n\nBear and I on our Hawaiian adventure.

Marc Piasecki via Getty Images Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner seen out and about in Paris on March 5.\n\nSophie Turner and Joe Jonas got engaged last year, after a little more than a year of dating.\n\nThough the Games of Thrones actress is very excited about her upcoming nuptials, she recently told Marie Claire why she doesn't like to think of marriage as an accomplishment.\n\nThere's this weird misconception that being married is the greatest thing that'll ever happen to you, Turner said. But I've always found that my career is something I work for, and when I achieve something, there's a sense that this is the greatest thing I'll do in my life.\n\nShe added: It's lovely to be engaged. Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I'd find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There's a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there's a drive that comes with your career.\n\nTurner and Jonas announced their engagement in October with matching Instagram photos of the GOT actress wearing a gorgeous ring on finger. I said yes, Turner wrote in the caption on her page. Jonas, a musician, captioned his version of the picture: She said yes.\n\nA post shared by Sophie Turner (@sophiet) on Oct 15, 2017 at 10:39am PDT\n\nThe two keep their romance relatively private. They often avoid red carpet appearances together and gushy social media posts.\n\nYou do feel like you're living in a fishbowl, Turner told Marie Claire last year. It's frustrating [that] it's the most mundane things that make the news ― how boring! There are really no other headlines?'
There were several shocking revelations during Sunday night's two-hour tea session with Meghan Markle, perhaps the biggest being the fact that she was allegedly refused medical support after she had suicidal thoughts during her time as a working member of the British royal family. While the CBS interview with Oprah Winfrey was intended to humanize Meghan and set the record straight, perhaps the most revealing thing about the interview was all that went unsaid.\n\nA few things I found interesting: The word race came up several times during the interview, but the more explicit, straight-to-the-point word racist was uttered only once or twice by Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry. The entire conversation obviously hinged on the fact that a large reason why they left the U.K. was due to the out-and-out racism Meghan experienced at the hands of the British press and the royal institution. There was discussion about the numerous double standards she experienced due to race, including how U.K. tabloids covered her as opposed to her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton.\n\nFor instance, where Kate cradling her baby bump received positive coverage, Meghan making the same mundane gesture was described as one of pride and vanity. This kind of coverage started almost immediately after it was revealed that Meghan and Prince Harry were an item, and most of it played into racist stereotypes specifically about Black women. Reports that Meghan made Kate cry, or that she was too demanding and aggressive of palace staff, all contributed to the idea of a difficult, angry Black woman.\n\nIn the interview, Meghan never used the word Black to describe herself in any capacity, referring to herself numerous times as mixed race or a woman of color. It's her prerogative to identify as she chooses, but her omission of that word in a conversation that hinged largely on Buckingham Palace discriminating against her was striking.\n\nThis constant back-and-forth between calling out 'the firm' and yet not naming names for fear of damaging reputations was simultaneously understandable and incredibly frustrating.\n\nAnd then there were all the beautifully messy contradictions that came up when Prince Harry joined Winfrey and his wife. While Meghan dropped the bombshell that someone high up in the royal family apparently had concerns about how dark her child's skin would be, Harry refused to name who in the institution had made these comments. This constant back-and-forth between calling out the firm and yet not naming names for fear of damaging reputations was simultaneously understandable and incredibly frustrating.\n\nPerhaps the closest the interview came to really divulging the desperate mess that is the royal family was when Prince Harry explained the symbiotic relationship that exists between the royals and the press, the invisible contract that dictates that as long as the family gives the media access, they will be largely unscathed. Control by fear, Prince Harry called it. If only he and Meghan had been able to delve further into that fear, a fear that has existed within the Windsor family probably since the abdication, when Harry's great-granduncle Edward stepped down from the throne in order to marry a stylish American woman and threw the family into tumult.\n\nThe Windsors are obsessed with the survival of the monarchy, largely because generation after generation, the existence of a monarchy built on colonization and conquest becomes more and more tenuous. And yet, rather than adapting, changing, perhaps even holding themselves accountable as an institution, the royal family remains under the impression that maintaining a good relationship with the media (and the public) is more important than its individual members' happiness and certainly more important than meaningful change in regards to rectifying the harm the family as an institution has made, particularly to its so-called commonwealth.\n\nHandout via Getty Images Oprah Winfrey interviews Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nAll this to say: There is absolutely nothing surprising about an institution that has amassed its wealth and privilege through colonization and exclusion being unsupportive of a mixed-race Black woman. Because the institution was not designed with someone like her in mind, no matter how much proximity to whiteness she may have. Meghan, regardless of her light complexion, white husband and royal children, was always going to be seen as an outsider and a potential threat to the status quo. And, as Princess Diana suggested in her own infamous interview in 1995 after leaving the royal family, anyone who is considered an outsider to the institution is seen as a problem. Full stop. 'What do we do with her?'\n\nToward the end of the interview, Meghan said, My regret was believing that I would be protected.\n\nHer words reminded me of this quote from author Neely Fuller Jr.'s book The Compensatory Code: If you do not understand white supremacy — what it is, and how it works — everything else that you understand, will only confuse you.\n\nIt seems Meghan was, at least initially, confused by how she could be disregarded and maligned by the royal institution. Perhaps on a certain level she and her husband did not (and maybe still do not) understand that it is an institution whose only goal is to protect the white privilege of those who exist within its system. Meghan herself admitted that she was very naive going into her relationship and subsequent marriage with Prince Harry, and that naivety wasn't just in regards to understanding the day-to-day life of a working royal, protocols and the proper way to curtsy. She and her husband were also incredibly naive about the reality of what it meant to introduce an American, divorced, half-Black woman into the royal family. Race was always going to be an issue in an institution that has largely excluded, exploited, ignored and even contributed to the plight of people of color all over the world.\n\nThere's an overwhelming desire to root for Meghan and Harry because they've clearly been through a lot, and yet, there's an equally overwhelming desire for them to dig deeper. Prince Harry talked about having done the work of understanding race (only after dating Meghan, apparently) and yet one can't help but wish that instead of just talking about unconscious bias he would say more, do more. Call out the fact that the monarchy is an obsolete and racist institution that he and his family have been complicit in.\n\nOf course, these desires for Meghan and Harry to more explicitly call out the monarchy for what it is are entirely unrealistic, based more obviously on my own politics and opinions than theirs. And that's what this interview was, a canvas on to which we can all project our own biases. I left the interview having learned nothing that I did not already know or at least suspect.\n\nThere are people who will watch the interview, listen to Meghan's experience and her struggles, and still find ways to distort her reality into something that fits into a narrative of who they believe she is. This is what happens when people's lives become hypothetical and abstract, crunched down to tabloid headlines and two-hour tell-all specials that generate snappy tweets and think pieces but, ultimately, do little to heal the real-life struggles of the people baring all.
Illustration: Alexandra Bowman for HuffPost; Photo: Getty\n\nA year into the COVID-19 pandemic, caring for our mental health remains as important as ever.\n\nWhile we've adjusted our lives in many ways to adapt to our new normal, it's normal to still be having a hard time with the stress and uncertainty of this challenging time. If you're dealing with depression, anxiety or other mental health issues at this point in the pandemic, you're not alone, and there are many ways to seek help.\n\nWe asked therapists to recommend their favorite mental health resources for people struggling amid the pandemic.\n\nTeletherapy\n\nKnow that it's OK to ask for help, said Zainab Delawalla, a licensed clinical psychologist in Atlanta. For many, underlying vulnerabilities in relationships have been forced to the surface, and their typical coping strategies are no longer working. It's OK to ask for help and reach out to a professional who can help you process difficult emotions and learn new coping skills.\n\nMany employers offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) and other mental support resources during the pandemic. You can also consult with your insurance company to find an in-network provider or learn about your out-of-network coverage if you choose to look elsewhere.\n\nOnline therapy services like BetterHelp and Talkspace can provide more affordable options and may even offer financial aid or other payment plans.\n\nThose who may struggle to pay for mental health care can find success through pro bono counseling services, community mental health centers, local churches or affiliation groups, or nonprofit organizations, such as The Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation that provides funding for mental health services, Graham added. Some colleges and universities provide mental health services to the public and sometimes at reduced rates.\n\nShe also pointed to local chapters of national mental health organizations like as NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness).\n\nMeditation\n\nIntegrate some meditation into your life, suggested Rachel Thomasian, a licensed marriage and family therapist and owner of Playa Vista Counseling in Los Angeles. There's been so much going on and so much noise all around, it's important to let your mind be still for a few minutes a day.\n\nMeditation apps like Headspace, Calm and Insight Timer can help you ease into the practice of meditation and offer free content or trials. You may also be able to find some instructional videos online on places like YouTube. Research shows that even just a few minutes of meditation can help relieve stress, improve sleep and more.\n\nMental Health Instagrams\n\nMany therapists, artists and more have Instagram accounts offering helpful messages, self-care tips, guided meditations and other mental health content.\n\nMeg Gitlin, a New York-based psychotherapist who runs the account @citytherapist, recommends @newhappyco for tools for living a more meaningful and engaged life, @sitwithwhit for really great perspectives on mental health, @ejltherapy for addiction resources, and @marcellakelson for parenting guidance.\n\nSocial media has two sides, so go to the side of inspiration, support and help rather than the one of ridicule, stress and fighting, added Bethany Cook, a clinical psychologist in Chicago who shares parenting humor and insights on her Instagram and runs an interactive Facebook group. Many creative, brave and inspiring individuals are sharing their survival stories on social media as well as some motivational stories about overcoming adversity. Find a few to follow that inspire you.\n\nMental health is also a popular topic on TikTok.\n\nHelplines\n\nMobile crisis units can be a particularly important resource for those experiencing a mental health emergency, as are the Crisis Text Line (text Home to 741741) and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255), Graham said.\n\nOther useful lines include the Disaster Distress Helpline (1-800-985-5990), which helps those experiencing emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters, The Trevor Project (1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678678), which is a suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth, and Trans Lifeline's Hotline (877-565-8860), a peer support service for people who are trans or questioning.\n\nBooks\n\nGitlin recommended seeking out top books about the mental health issues you're experiencing.\n\nFor example, if someone told me they were struggling with anxiety, I would tell them to check out 'The Anxiety Handbook' by Edmund J. Borne, which has 1 million copies in print, she said. Knowledge is power, especially because mental illness in particular can be so isolating.\n\nBreathing Exercises\n\nReena B. Patel, a licensed educational psychologist in San Diego and author of Winnie & Her Worries suggested trying the 4-7-8 breathing method.\n\nPart your lips slightly and exhale with a whooshing sound through your mouth. Close your lips and inhale silently through your nose. Count to four in your head. Hold your breath for seven seconds. Exhale (with a whoosh sound) for eight seconds, she said. Practice this mindlessly to let your brain relax. Complete this cycle for four full breaths.\n\nBreathing exercises are another free, non-time consuming way to relax in moments of stress. There are many guided breathing videos on YouTube and other resources to help you practice.\n\nI discovered Soma breathwork founded by an inspiring individual and entrepreneur Niraj Naik, said London-based clinical psychologist Genevieve von Lob. Having a daily practice of breathwork has helped me to release stress and feel far more calm, present and connected for myself, my family and my clients.\n\nVirtual Workouts\n\nI think it's so important to move and exercise and it's been easy to stay stagnant while quarantining, Thomasian said. It doesn't take more than a 20 minute commitment and there are so many streaming workouts, there's something for everyone.\n\nThere are lots of ways to exercise at home, from Instagram workouts to fitness apps to self-guided HIIT routines. Yoga can be an especially good exercise for mental health.\n\nWorkshops\n\nI would recommend virtual workshops that support mental health, said Nicole M. Ward, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Zoom age has brought lots of live streaming workshops, panels and even interactive events that address the psychological challenges people are facing amid the pandemic.\n\nThe Center for Network Therapy started a live Facebook event every week open to the public, 'Ask Dr. C,' featuring community leaders, recovery specialists, law enforcement, psychiatrists, addiction treatment professionals, etc., so that people in the community could have a virtual support platform to answer their questions and address their concerns, said New Jersey-based psychiatrist Indra Cidambi. Topics addressed included stress related to working from home, psychological impact of weight gain, excessive alcohol consumption, planning medication refills, accessing online self-help groups, etc.\n\nMental health podcasts and apps like MindShift and What's Up? provide helpful tips for coping during this time too. It's important to note that none of these are a replacement for talk therapy, but can be great supplements. When looking for mental health guidance, seek out sources you trust.\n\nI would just be thoughtful and research where you are getting your information and not to take anything at face value, Gitlin said.\n\nThe Great Outdoors\n\nI encourage everyone to get some outdoor time each day, Thomasian said. Being indoors all day, every day is contra-indicative for mental health. Go to the beach, walk on some grass or just walk down the street. Whatever is available to you, make the most of it.\n\nSpending time in nature is restorative and free. There are also great apps with hiking options, guided walks, information about the natural world and more.\n\nGratitude Journals\n\nFocus on the positive may seem like trite advice right now, but there is power in gratitude.\n\nPracticing gratitude and acknowledging what has gone well today (however small it may seem) can really boost your mood over time, von Lob said. If you are someone who tends to focus on the negatives of the day, then try to become aware of this by taking a pause, acknowledge the thoughts that are in your mind (you can say to yourself 'thinking' or 'noticing worry' or 'there's anger again') and then refocus on a positive or more helpful thought.\n\nTry writing down things you're grateful for in a special journal or even typing it in your notes app or a gratitude-specific app. You may see a mood and mindset shift over time.\n\nCreate a gratitude list, Patel advised. For every challenge or negative point you write, next to it write two things you are grateful for. You will see that you have more things to be happy about.\n\nInterior Design\n\nAnother thing I would suggest is to ensure that your environment cultivates a positive mood, said Saniyyah Mayo, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles. Our homes and work are usually where we spend most of our time so ensure that it exudes happiness and positivity.\n\nThere are lots of apps that can help you redesign your space. Following home decor-related Instagram accounts like @apartmenttherapy and @thishouse5000 can also be soothing and provide inspiration.
The holidays are over. The New Year is here and with it comes new hopes and dreams.\n\nWhether you make New Year's Resolutions or not, now is a good time to improve your life – and your marriage/relationship.\n\n3 Simple & Effective Ways to Make Your Marriage More Loving\n\nFollowing are 3 simple & effective ways to stop fighting & increase romance and happiness in your relationship in the New Year.\n\n1. Look in the Mirror - because all change begins with you!\n\nIf you want your partner to be more loving, then you need to be more loving. If you want your partner to be more forgiving, then you need to be more forgiving. If you want your partner to be more patient, then act more patiently towards him/her.\n\nIn other words, demonstrate the behavior you want your partner to show you.\n\nIf you want your marriage to change for the better – improve your own behavior towards your partner.\n\nRemember, all change does, in fact, begin with you!\n\n2. Ask for what you want & need. Your partner is not a mind reader. If you want or need something from them – tell them.\n\nIt's amazing how many times people tell me they shouldn't have to ask their partner for what they want and/or need from them – their partner should just somehow magically know.\n\nWhen I ask these same people if their partner will give them what they want if they ask for it – many of them immediately say yes!\n\nSO what the heck?!?!? Then ASK!!\n\nRefusing to ask for what you want and need from your partner almost guarantees you won't get it (not always, but usually).\n\nNot getting what you need will leave you feeling empty, unfulfilled and eventually angry. Over time, this anger will turn into resentment.\n\nAnd resentment is the kiss of death for any relationship.\n\nIt's your responsibility to speak up and ask for what you want and/or need from your partner!\n\nYour partner doesn't have a crystal ball!\n\n3. Forgive, Let Go & Move On! Holding onto slights and hurts will only damage your relationship.\n\nAny one in a long-term intimate relationship can attest to the value & absolute necessity of forgiving, letting go of anger & moving on when your partner hurts you.\n\nAs long as your partner is truly sorry for having wronged (or hurt) you - it is essential you move on!\n\nDon't just give lip service to moving forward; truly and sincerely let it go!\n\nAs mentioned in tip #2, holding onto anger over time creates resentment. Resentment is the key ingredient that destroys intimacy and happiness in any relationship.\n\nIF you've been hurt by your partner (and who hasn't?) as long as your partner is sincerely sorry for the pain they caused, you must forgive, move on and just let it go!\n\nLetting go of slights is the only way to let your love grow!\n\nConclusion\n\nAs hard as we might try, we cannot really change anyone but ourselves.\n\nLoving thoughts and behaviors towards your partner will promote loving thoughts and behaviors from your partner.\n\nChanging yourself and how you treat and react to your partner will directly impact how your partner treats and reacts to you!\n\n#911MarriageHelp #MarriageExpert #CommunicationExpert\n\nTo learn more about Dr. Patty Ann visit:
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The political crisis in Virginia spun out of control Wednesday when the state's attorney general confessed to putting on blackface in the 1980s and a woman went public with detailed allegations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor.\n\nWith Gov. Ralph Northam's career already hanging by a thread over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook, the day's developments threatened to take down all three of Virginia's top elected officials, all of them Democrats.\n\nThe twin blows began with Attorney General Mark Herring issuing a statement acknowledging he wore brown makeup and a wig in 1980 to look like a rapper during a party when he was a 19-year-old student at the University of Virginia.\n\nHerring — who had previously called on Northam to resign and was planning to run for governor himself in 2021 — apologized for his callous behavior and said that the days ahead will make it clear whether I can or should continue to serve.\n\nThe 57-year-old Herring came clean after rumors about the existence of a blackface photo of him began circulating at the Capitol, though he made no mention of a picture Wednesday.\n\nAP Photo/Steve Helber In this Saturday, Jan. 13, 2018 file photo, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring takes the oath of office during inaugural ceremonies at the Capitol in Richmond, Va. Herring, admitted Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2019, to putting on blackface in the 1980s, when he was a college student.\n\nThen, within hours, Vanessa Tyson, the California woman whose sexual assault allegations against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax surfaced earlier this week, put out a detailed statement saying Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room in 2004 during the Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n\nThe Associated Press typically does not identify those who say they were sexually assaulted, but Tyson issued the statement in her name.\n\nTyson, a 42-year-old political scientist who is on a fellowship at Stanford University and specializes in the political discourse of sexual assault, said, I have no political motive. I am a proud Democrat.\n\nMr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience, in service to his political ambitions, and has threatened litigation, she said. Given his false assertions, I'm compelled to make clear what happened.\n\nFairfax — who is in line to become governor if Northam resigns — has repeatedly denied her allegations, saying that the encounter was consensual and that he is the victim of a strategically timed political smear.\n\nAt no time did she express to me any discomfort or concern about our interactions, neither during that encounter, nor during the months following it, when she stayed in touch with me, nor the past 15 years, he said in a statement.\n\nTyson said she suffered deep humiliation and shame and stayed quiet about the allegations as she pursued her career, but by late 2017, as the #MeToo movement took shape and after she saw an article about Fairfax's campaign, she took her story to The Washington Post, which decided months later not to publish a story.\n\nThe National Organization for Women immediately called on Fairfax to resign, saying, Her story is horrifying, compelling and clear as day — and we believe her.\n\nLOGAN CYRUS via Getty Images Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax addresses the media about a sexual assault allegation from 2004 outside of the capital building in Richmond, Feb. 4, 2019.\n\nThe string of scandals that began when the yearbook picture came to light last Friday could have a domino effect on Virginia state government: If Northam and Fairfax fall, Herring would be next in line to become governor. After Herring comes House Speaker Kirk Cox, a conservative Republican.\n\nAt the Capitol, lawmakers were dumbstruck over the day's fast-breaking developments, with Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola saying, I have to take a breath and think about this. This is moving way too quickly. GOP House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert said it would be reckless to comment. There's just too much flying around, he said.\n\nThe chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, Del. Lamont Bagby, said, We've got a lot to digest.\n\nCox issued a statement late Wednesday calling the allegations against Fairfax extremely serious and said they need a full airing of facts. Cox also urged Herring to adhere to the standard he has set for others, a nod to Herring's previous call that Northam resign.\n\nDemocrats have expressed fear that the uproar over the governor could jeopardize their chances of taking control of the GOP-dominated Virginia legislature this year. The party made big gains in 2017, in part because of a backlash against President Donald Trump, and has moved to within striking distance of a majority in both houses.\n\nAt the same time, the Democrats nationally have taken a hard line against misconduct in their ranks because women and minorities are a vital part of their base and they want to be able to criticize Trump's behavior without looking hypocritical.\n\nNortham has come under pressure from nearly the entire Democratic establishment to resign after the discovery of a photo on his profile page in the Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook of someone in blackface standing next to a person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gives a news conference in the Governors Mansion at the Capitol in Richmond, Va., on Feb. 2, 2019.\n\nThe governor initially admitted he was in the photo without saying which costume he was wearing, then denied it a day later. But he acknowledged he once used shoe polish to blacken his face and look like Michael Jackson at a dance contest in Texas in 1984, when he was in the Army.\n\nHerring came down hard on Northam when the yearbook photo surfaced, condemning it as indefensible, and profoundly offensive. He said it was no longer possible for Northam to lead the state.\n\nOn Wednesday, though, Herring confessed that he and two friends dressed up to look like rappers, admitting: It sounds ridiculous even now writing it.\n\nThat conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others, he said. But he added: This conduct is in no way reflective of the man I have become in the nearly 40 years since.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Louise Lucas said several people were crying, including men, as Herring apologized to black lawmakers Wednesday morning before issuing his public statement.\n\nHe said he was very sorry, Lucas said.\n\nLucas said the black lawmakers told Herring they needed to discuss their next steps among themselves.\n\nHerring, who was elected to his second four-year term in 2017, made a name for himself nationally by playing a central role in bringing gay marriage to Virginia.\n\nWhen he first took office, he announced he would no longer defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nA federal judge overturned the ban, citing Herring's opposition, and Virginia began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2014, nearly a full year before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Barakat contributed to this report.

And she said, 'Just trust me. Just trust me.' You know, she wanted me to just kind of go into it, and she said, 'Don't Google him.' [But] I did! — Harris\n\nOn Pursuing Her After The First Date\n\nI didn't want it to end. And so the next morning, I pulled the move of emailing her with my availabilities for the next four months, including long weekends. And I said something like, 'I'm too old to hide the ball. You're great. I want to see if we can make this work. Here's when I'm available next.' And I guess it worked. — Emhoff\n\nOn Leaving His Career As A Lawyer\n\nThough I had always admired and supported her work, until recently, our professional lives had remained separate worlds. That changed the day Joe Biden called and asked her to join the ticket as his running mate. On that day it quickly became clear that this wasn't just about my love for my wife, but also about my love for this country. Stepping back from my career as an entertainment lawyer was a decision that we made together — this was about something bigger than either of us. — Emhoff\n\nOn Her Dropping Out Of The Presidential Primary\n\nShe made that decision, and I would have supported whatever she decided. But I'm not her political adviser. I'm her husband. And so my role was to be there for her, to love her, to have her back, to talk it through, to help her. — Emhoff\n\nOn Supporting Her Career\n\nOur relationship and the way I roll, my whole life has just been to support the people I love unequivocally, and they support me. The whole thing has been based on parity and mutual respect. — Emhoff\n\nOn Watching Her Work\n\nImagine working from home with Kamala Harris, during a pandemic and all the other issues going on. She just works hard, and she's relentless. ... It's just incredible how much she does. And I'm looking over and she's looking [back] and she goes, 'What are you doing, Dougie? You working?' And I say, 'Yep! Yes, honey.' — Emhoff\n\nOn Her Stepkids\n\nThey are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in. — Harris\n\nOn Her Relationship With His Ex-Wife\n\nTo know Cole and Ella is to know that their mother, Kerstin, is an incredible mother. Kerstin and I hit it off ourselves and are dear friends. She and I became a duo of cheerleaders in the bleachers at Ella's swim meets and basketball games, often to Ella's embarrassment. We sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional. — Harris\n\nOn How They Manage Stress\n\nOne of the things that really allows us to get through these moments that are obviously very stressful — we're talking about the future of the free world — it's important to be able to laugh at yourself and each other. We do a healthy amount of both of that. We don't take ourselves too seriously in the context of our relationship. You can't. You just have to flow and know what's really important. — Harris\n\nOn How They Connect When They're Busy
d3sign via Getty Images One of the first things James told me when we finally talked was, 'James will no longer be here at some point this coming spring.'\n\nNote: The following essay contains mentions of suicide. Names and some identifying characteristics have been changed. Because every transgender person approaches their identity, transition and the elements related to both in their own personal way, no two approaches will be the same. In accordance with Tracy's wishes, male pronouns and the name she was given at birth are used for the first half of the essay and female pronouns and her new name appear in the second half.\n\nMy friend Tracy and I have started trading tips on the best way to paint nails in order to avoid bubbling. I advise her on quick-dry topcoats, toe separators ― things she's never heard of. Tracy, like roughly 1.4 million other adults in the United States, is transgender. Tracy is also my ex-fiancé. Six months ago, over 20 years after our painful breakup in 1999 and two subsequent decades without any communication, she decided to contact me and come out.\n\nUntil recently, I knew Tracy as James. We dated for over four years after we graduated high school. We lived together that last year, got engaged, and broke up a few weeks later. The person I knew then was the boy who brought me M&M cookies while I was at work in the mall. We had known each other since we were in preschool and lived in the same neighborhood in our small Southeast Texas oil refinery town. Our community was insular, extremely conservative, and there were at least two churches per neighborhood.\n\nWhen we began dating, we did what most 18-year-olds do when they're in love ― go to movies and concerts, make out, and laugh during cheap dinners. James changed the oil in my car, hung a shelf in my room, took me shopping, sat on my bed flipping through my stacks of Marie Claire and Glamour while I put on my makeup.\n\nI thought he was sweet and in touch with his sensitive side in a way other guys I had dated weren't. We both had a total of two gay friends and had gone with one of them to a gay club, but we didn't know much about the LGBTQ community then. Transgender wasn't a word that was even in either of our vocabularies. A few times after being intimate, James told me, I feel like a lesbian trapped in a man's body. I laughed, having no reason at that time to think his comment was anything other than a joke.\n\nA year later, everything began to change.\n\nJames attempted suicide twice. He called me after the second attempt (I did not learn about the first attempt until recently) and told me what he'd done. I wanted to save him in any way I could, even if that meant just sitting with him in the campus psychologist's office and holding his hand, walking him to the registrar's office to get his medical withdrawal from school, or helping to pack his belongings to move back home.\n\nWe were essentially babies when it came to relationships. We didn't know what we didn't know about ourselves, each other, the world around us or love.\n\nI didn't understand his depression or his wanting to die. I wondered if I was in any way to blame, but we continued our relationship. We struggled, broke up, got back together, had terrible fights and broke up again. One of us would always return with some grand gesture — quoting love songs, makeup sex, tears, and then finally, laughter ― and things would be OK again for a while. It was volatile, but we were 19, 20, 21 years old. We were essentially babies when it came to relationships. We didn't know what we didn't know about ourselves, each other, the world around us, or love.\n\nIn the last year of our relationship, we transferred to a new university in another part of the state and lived together in a cheap apartment. Things were still volatile and became even worse as the months progressed. We decided to get engaged in hopes that it might stabilize and save our relationship. My parents put an announcement in the local paper and threw a party. No one knew that by that point we were sleeping in separate bedrooms. I had also begun to notice James was spending a lot of time in dissociative states. When he would disassociate, it was like he wasn't there — he would stare blankly into the distance and often seemed to be frozen in some thought I couldn't see or hear. I would curl into him, my head on his shoulder, trying to reach him, to bring him back, to save him ― and us ― again.\n\nThe morning after the longest dissociative state that I witnessed, he made breakfast and then went for a walk. He returned with his friend Adam, who sat in one of our chairs by the front door. James called me into the bedroom.\n\nI think you know what I'm going to say, he said, looking down at me on the bed. I said I didn't.\n\nAs of right now, our relationship is over and one of us needs to move out.\n\nI asked him if he was kidding. He was not. I yelled as he and Adam packed a few of his things. I called friends for support and found out that he had told everyone his plan the night before — including my mother.\n\nI dropped out of college and moved back home. He sent me and our friends insulting emails in which he blamed me for all of his problems. I cried and refused to eat for so many days that my mother took me to our family doctor and asked him to give me something to take the edge off. It didn't work.\n\nEventually I rebuilt my life, got a job, graduated college and graduate school, wrote books and married a wonderful man. However, I still carried the trauma of my relationship and subsequent breakup with James with me wherever I went. I always wondered what was so wrong with me that I had caused him so much anger and grief. I often wondered if he showed up at my door, would I slam it in his face or begin weeping and hug him to me, never wanting to let go?\n\nA few months ago, I got my answer in the form of a response to one of my tweets about a book I was reading.\n\nI often wondered if he showed up at my door, would I slam it in his face or begin weeping and hug him to me, never wanting to let go.\n\nI was sitting on the couch with my husband when a reply popped up: What a coincidence! I just finished that book. I saw the name on the Twitter account, gasped and threw my phone onto the couch. I checked the profile several times ― in shock to hear from James in this way after all of these years ― and I wondered what he wanted.\n\nA few minutes later, he sent me a direct message asking if I'd read the email he sent me. I hadn't — it went to my junk folder as my email didn't recognize his address, which seemed fitting. I retrieved his email and wept while I read his apology for his behavior toward me and for the ugliness of our breakup. I feel that I brought a lot of darkness into your life and turned what should have been exciting years finding our places in this world into a severe struggle just to breathe, he wrote.\n\nI sat with the email for a while, shaking as I reading it over and over again. I appreciated his apology, but I was still angry so many years later and having a difficult time with our past suddenly being dredged up. My thoughts raced out of control as I tried to guess what caused him to reach out and apologize to me now, 20 years later. I wondered if he was in a recovery program and this was part of journey to heal or if he had recently been divorced and now wanted another chance at a relationship with me. I decided to reach out, gave him my number, and we began the long climb toward a much overdue reckoning.\n\nOne of the first things James told me when we finally talked was, James will no longer be here at some point this coming spring. I was worried he was dying of cancer or some other terrible disease.\n\nNo, he assured me with a laugh. I'm transgender. I'm about to begin the process of transitioning to present and live as a woman. I'm also a lesbian.\n\nI took a breath and listened. James, who had not yet changed her name at that point, told me of her struggle — her lifelong feeling of being different, of not being comfortable in her own skin, of feeling broken even when she was a child, and how that sense of brokenness never left her until she came out.\n\nI began to understand the emotional isolation she endured — even while we were together — because she constantly felt as though she didn't fit into the world. She talked about gender dysphoria, her emotional dysfunction and how not being able to live the life she was so desperate ― and meant ― to live led to deep mental health struggles and emergencies. We talked about her suicide attempts and how surviving them merely set her on autopilot throughout not only the remainder of our relationship, but for a great part of her other subsequent relationships and eventual marriage.\n\nI wanted to understand all of it. I wanted to be kind and supportive but I was also struggling with my own confusion, my own doubts, my own worries that I had hurt her or, perhaps selfishly, that she never loved me or that when we had been intimate, those moments were something else to her — an escape? A way to try and affirm the masculinity that had been assumed and demanded of her for her entire life? She listened to everything I had to say and then told me that her love for me had always been true and deep — the shaking in your bones kind of love.\n\nShe also admitted that the reason she ended our engagement was, in large part, because she didn't know what to do with her gender identity, which kept trying to rise to the surface. She hated that self then ― she didn't understand it, still didn't have a word for who she was, but she knew at some point it would destroy the self she currently presented to the world.\n\nThe more I listened, the more I began to heal. I started looking at myself more positively, understanding that I was not a terrible person, a bad partner, a breaker of people and relationships. It was as if by learning about James' transformation, I was experiencing my own kind of transformation. I forgave her for her anger, her abusive behavior and all of the trauma that I had experienced when she left me.\n\nThe more I listened, the more I began to heal. I started looking at myself more positively, understanding that I was not a terrible person, a bad partner, a breaker of people and relationships. It was as if by learning about James' transformation, I was experiencing my own kind of transformation.\n\nJames and I began a new friendship. I still struggle with this change, but I am proud of her, who she is becoming, the hard work she is doing to become her truest self. I realized I held on to the pain of the past for too long. Because I had no way to explain why our relationship ended the way it ended, I never considered what she might be going through or the profound trauma she was experiencing at that time. I was too caught up in what I was going through ― I could only see the negative emotions that were coming at me and that I assumed were the result of my shortcomings and inadequacies. Because I had been left without any answers for 20 years, I spent those years focused on me and what I could have done wrong instead of focusing on James and what she could have been going through.\n\nJames is Tracy now, some six months after coming out, and fully identifies as female to family and friends. She's been taking hormone replacement therapy and I hope it helps her healing and that she finds the emotional stability she deserves. She's also been doing extremely painful laser hair removal treatments on her face, for which she has to take several strong painkillers per session. I listen to her discoveries and struggles — fears over public bathrooms, work concerns, worse. I both worry about her and celebrate her transition and want her to be safe, finally proud of who she is becoming.\n\nThe physical changes have been remarkable — her skin is smooth and bright due to the hormones and I'm incredibly jealous of her gorgeous hands and fingernails. We've been having fun playing around with gender swap photo apps — I would make a terrible-looking man — and talking about makeup.\n\nNot everyone who is transgender transitions medically. Some trans people may not undergo any kind of physically transition and may not move from one end of the gender binary to the other. Everyone is different, but for Tracy, these are decisions and steps that have made her feel the best about who she is ― who she truly is ― and I support her. She is fully aware that I wrote this essay, saw it before it was published and is as hopeful as I am that sharing our stories might make a difference.\n\nI have a new friend. A friend that is different from the one I grew up with, dated and almost married, but this friend wears pink cat ear headphones and watches YouTube videos on how to do at-home manicures. My own world has been widened with this new understanding, and there is tremendous healing that comes with forgiveness — both of another and the self. I'm glad our paths crossed again in this way. Coming out as transgender, I realize, isn't a death, but a new birth, a journey that isn't the same for everyone, but one filled with hope, with beauty and promise. And for me and Tracy, recovery.\n\nAmanda Auchter is the author of The Wishing Tomb, winner of the 2013 PEN Center USA Literary Award for Poetry and the 2012 Perugia Press Book Award, and The Glass Crib, winner of the 2010 Zone 3 Press First Book Award for Poetry.

In a healthy relationship, people tend to give love and support freely and frequently. They don't wait for a special occasion to show their appreciation. They genuinely enjoy doing nice things for one another just because ― no prompting necessary.\n\nWe asked relationship experts to tell us what kinds of things, both big and small, happy couples do for each other without being asked. Here's what they had to say:\n\n1. They check in with each other.\n\nWhether it's a 'hello' text or call to ask, 'How did it go?' the happiest couples reach out. They call to say, 'I'm running late,' or 'We just landed,' or 'Do you need me to stop at the store on my way home?' The message: I'm thinking of you. The result: A feeling of being connected, being a key part of each other's lives. ― Winifred M. Reilly, marriage and family therapist and author of It Takes One to Tango\n\n2. They give each other compliments.\n\nThis doesn't have to be a lovey-dovey compliment about being the best wife in the world, but even an offhand remark recognizing someone's contribution, like 'great dinner!' Although some couples do well without positive feedback, the majority of people like at least a little bit of verbal recognition for their contribution, and happy couples are free with positive feedback. ― Samantha Rodman, psychologist and dating coach\n\n3. They surprise each other with a card, just because.\n\nGiving your partner a card that says 'Thinking of you' or 'Thank you for all you do' is such a sweet gesture. It will make him or her feel special and it's a great reminder to you as well of all you have to be grateful for. An added fun touch would be to leave the card somewhere your loved one will happen on it. My husband loves to leave cards for me in the refrigerator. I often leave his cards under his pillow. ― Susan Pease Gadoua, marriage therapist and the co-author of The New I Do: Reshaping Marriage for Skeptics, Realists and Rebels\n\n4. They act generously, instead of keeping score.\n\nGenerosity is something freely given as a gift, with nothing expected in return. When a relationship feels secure, it is easy to want to offer more than your fair share of tasks or thoughtful gestures to show your love for your partner. Whether moving their clothes to the dryer for them or going on their favorite hike again, highly fulfilled couples tend to maintain great satisfaction from being thoughtful and generous toward their partner rather than scorekeeping. ― Kari Carroll, couples therapist\n\n5. They speak openly about their thoughts and feelings.\n\nWhen partners feel that it's like pulling teeth to get each other to divulge any thoughts or feelings, a relationship can feel very lonely. Happy couples may not communicate constantly on a deep level, but they do it frequently enough to feel that they really know one another. ― Samantha Rodman\n\n6. They surprise their partner with their favorite food.\n\nWe all know that food is nurturing and helps people feel connected. But when you go out of your way to bring home a special food you know they will love, it's a wonderful way to put 'I love you' into action. If the favorite food is a meal that you make — rather than, say, a pint of Haagen Dazs — you'll undoubtedly get even more points. ― Susan Pease Gadoua\n\n7. Or with a freshly washed car.\n\nRegardless of whether you do the washing yourself or take the car to a car wash, when your partner sees their squeaky clean wheels on the street or in the driveway, he or she will likely be very grateful. ― Susan Pease Gadoua\n\n8. They're in the habit of saying 'thank you.'\n\nDespite the mundanity and complacency that can develop within a long-term partnership, a sure way to keep the fire alive and burning brightly is to watch your partner beam when you regularly notice and point out their contributions to your life. People want to be reminded they are of value to you, and secure couples understand that this should be frequent. Although you may assume your love to be understood, in reality, acknowledging your partner's efforts and contributions consistently builds an even deeper connection. ― Kari Carroll
Last week, Mary Tyler Moore passed away at the age of 80. Moore made history in 1970 when she portrayed, for the first time in television history, a single professional working woman. In doing so, Moore immediately became the epitome of a modern-day feminist and brilliantly maintained that moniker for nearly 50 years. Today, it's almost impossible to imagine television without strong single professional women (where would we be without Olivia Pope and Carrie Mathison?!) and recall that there was a time when women were portrayed only as homemakers. It deserves a place in the used to be's list -- there used to be no cable television, no cell phones, no internet and no strong female characters on TV! Who can imagine?!\n\nUnlike advances in technology and the proliferation of sassy single professional women on television, real-life single professional women haven't quite made the leaps and bounds of forward progress.\n\nMoments after learning that Moore passed away, I was checking my Twitter feed and saw an unrelated article in the Wall Street Journal, Why Young Women Play Down Their Career Goals Around Men, by Lauren Weber. The article discusses a January 2017 study by Amanda Pallais (Harvard University), Leonardo Bursztyn (the University of Chicago) and Thomas Fujiwara (Princeton University), which concludes that young, professional women feel compelled to minimize their accomplishments and ambitions, but only if they're single.\n\n\n\nThe study opens with the following established facts:\n\n~ Men prefer female partners who are less professionally ambitious than they are.\n\n~ Men tend to avoid female partners with characteristics usually associated with professional ambition, such as high levels of education.\n\n~ It is relatively unlikely that a woman will earn more than her husband, and when she does, marital satisfaction is lower and divorce is more likely.\n\n~ Promotions increase the chance of divorce for women, but not for men.\n\nSo, if all of this is true, what's a young single professional women to do if she wants to get married? Apparently, she lies -- or more nicely said, she significantly downplays her career success in the hopes that a man will find her worthy enough to marry.\n\nHow depressing. So this is where we find ourselves a half-century after Mary Tyler Moore twirled and triumphantly threw her beret into the air?\n\nHere's what I have to say to the amazing young professional women out there -- if a man doesn't want to marry you because you're smart, accomplished and successful, you should think long and hard about whether you want to marry him. Marriage is (hopefully) a life-long partnership, with someone who you greatly respect, and equally important, who greatly respects you. Trust me, being a women in corporate America is simply too hard to not have your life partner in your corner.\n\nAnd for those of us who are further along in our careers, it's equally important that we don't downplay our successes but instead be proud of working outside the home. Not only are we role models for young professional women, we are the role models for our sons and daughters. In a 2015 study by Kathleen L. McGinn, the Cahners-Rabb Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, McGinn found that women whose moms worked outside the home are more likely to have jobs themselves, are more likely to hold supervisory responsibility at those jobs, and earn higher wages than women whose mothers stayed home full time. Men raised by working mothers are more likely to contribute to household chores and spend more time caring for family members. And, the findings hold true across 24 countries. There are very few things, that we know of, that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother, says McGinn.\n\nSo, whether you're early in your career or a little further along, we must not dilute our career successes for the sake of making a man happy. A close friend made a sign for the recent Women's March in New York City that said, Men of Quality Do Not Fear Equality. I couldn't agree more.\n\nFollow me on Twitter and Instagram!
Weddings among the super rich reinforce conservative values among the Indian elites. Yogita/Wikipedia, CC BY-NC\n\nIndian weddings are most famously imagined as enormous spectacles. This image is surely real, though representative of a small segment of the Indian population, and realised only in the world of the super-rich. Some reports have estimated the super-rich to constitute 1% of the total population, which contributes to 22% of Indian GDP.\n\nSociologist Patricia Uberoi writes that in South Asia, weddings are the most visible site of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste.\n\nBut my ongoing research, on the elites reveals that their weddings are more than about conspicuous consumption or celebrations of new kinship bonds. They are a show of strength, a glamorised return to tradition, and a celebration of social conservatism.\n\nThe glamour of traditions\n\nThe most luring aspect of an elite Indian wedding is its claim to a global yet Indian sensibility, bringing together the western and the Indian into the wedding experience.\n\nConsequently, the line-up of the wedding events includes traditional ceremonies associated with community-specific wedding rituals like dholki - a Punjabi ceremony of singing and dancing to the beats of a drum (dholak) - as well as westernised events such as cocktail parties, bachelorette parties, and grand receptions with multi-tiered cakes.\n\nThis Indo-western fusion is best exemplified in gastronomical selections that invariably include Chinese, Lebanese, Italian, Japanese, North Indian and South Indian cuisines all reaching the humble palate of their guests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChefs at work at the Wedding of the son of the imam of Delhi India with soldiers and 2000 guests, in 2005.\n\nJorge Royan, CC BY-ND\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most popular appropriation of a globalised culture is the hiring of professionals to oversee the wedding preparations. In Indian weddings, the uncles, aunts, and cousins usually perform organisational tasks, often at the directions of the family priest (pandit for Hindus). However, the elites have set the trend of hiring a wedding planner who has most conspicuously displaced the pandit, and taken on the roles of the extended kin who have little more duties than to look their very best.\n\nIn this professionalised approach to wedding planning, elites have begun the trend of celebrating some of the most traditionally muted rituals with much glam and glitz, which would otherwise be celebrated with austerity especially in a middle class setting. For example, at the elite weddings I attended, for the small ceremonies of haldi (smearing the bride and groom's body with turmeric powder) and gharcholi (bathing the bride and groom with holy water), a troupe of singers was invited and silver coins were given to the attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Haldi ceremony is common across India and has now become a fancy affair.\n\nathreya_krishna, CC BY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice of giving a dowry is also modified. At one elite wedding I studied, the groom was given an Audemars Piguet watch costing approximately £10,000, a BMW 7 series car, and £50,000 in cash. There is an insistence, especially by the father of the bride, to treat this not as dowry, but only as a gift, as the bride-to-be too, it is argued, is gifted expensive jewellery and clothes by her in-laws.\n\nDowry then, assumes a muted presence, shrouded in the ostentatious display of wealth and generosity of gift-giving.\n\nAs the elites flirt with western lifestyle trends, they often still remain married to a strict social conservatism, specifically of marrying within caste and class (endogamous marriage). Often introduced by marriage brokers, who charge anywhere between £1,500 to £10,000 for their services, or through networks of family, young elites marry someone with a similar social, caste, and financial status, thereby ensuring that the exclusionary boundaries of their communities are well maintained.\n\nCreating a phenomenon\n\nThe elite weddings can be seen not simply as series of ostentatious events but a phenomenon for much effort and money is put into creating an experience.\n\nThe journey begins right from the wedding invitations, where simple paper invitations are giving way to outrageously luxurious ones: the most recent being a box inlaid with LCD screens, playing a Bollywood-style video message.\n\nThe next step is to choose a destination away from home to perform the wedding ceremonies. Elite families compete most conspicuously on this decision, as they jostle to hire the most expensive heritage hotel or palace in India, popularly in the cities of Udaipur and Jodhpur. Some claim the highest bid by choosing an international exotic destination, such as Vienna.\n\nIt is not that the Indian super-rich do not marry in Delhi, however. I noted that the invitations to the in-house weddings often took an apologetic tone. The son of a leading businessman in Delhi, at no probing on my part, followed up his wedding invitation with an explanation of why he was not organising a destination wedding. He said:\n\nEverything was decided so quickly [referring to his arranged marriage] and the auspicious dates are only five months away. So we couldn't plan a destination wedding this soon. We are keeping it at the Marriott in Delhi.\n\nThe other important aspect of the spectacle of the wedding is the bridal wear and trousseau. The ever-increasing bridal magazines and websites and the rise of the domestic fashion industry has propelled the Indian bride to forsake dresses handed down by mothers and grandmothers in favour of high-end designer clothes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSabyasachi is one of the most sought after Indian designers for bridal attire.\n\nParekh cards/flickr, CC BY\n\n\n\n\n\nA bridal lehenga (skirt and blouse with a drape), at some of India's top designers, are priced from £4,000 to £40,000.\n\nG Janardhan Reddy, a mining baron from the Indian state of Karnataka, of the LCD wedding invitations fame, yet again stole the show in the fashion department. His daughter wore a sari bejewelled in diamonds costing approximately £2 million. Together with jewellery, her bridal wear was estimated to cost a whopping £10.5 million.\n\nThe main show of strength of any elite weddings is in its guest list. Attendees reflect the power and position of the host. It is mandatory for top-level politicians, senior bureaucrats, and successful businessmen to attend such weddings, even if they are not personally known to the hosts.\n\nIn fact, it is a fairly common site for the hosts to extend invitations to the powerful friends of their extended family members to ensure the who's who of the country attend their spectacle. These weddings then also serve as informal sites of brokering among political and business elites.\n\nAs a prominent fixer, a middleman of sorts for the political and social honchos, whose job it is to introduce influential figures to one another to expand their networks, told me, The most effective meetings are outside the meeting rooms. At one wedding, on citing the presence of a senior politican, the fixer said to me, This indicates that he [the politican] is willing to negotiate the business deal or else he would not have attended the wedding.\n\nAttendance at weddings is not only a matter of prestige and power for the host but also for the guests, and a snub of non-invitation may transform into an open feud lasting many years.\n\nIn one such incident, a leading exporter forgot to invite a real estate baron to the marriage of his son, straining not only their social and business ties but also of their networks. It took more than a decade and multiple attempts by common friends to restore their relationship. The politics of invitation most certainly resonates with the politics of businesses and survival.\n\nThe elite Indian wedding, therefore, is not simply an ostentatious celebration involving an unabashed display of money and taste. It is about competition, conservatism, and assertion of power. It is nothing less than the coronation ceremony of an elite status.
Oprah has announced her latest pick for Oprah's Book Club, selecting An American Marriage, the fourth novel written by author Tayari Jones.\n\nThe novel redefines the traditional American love story ― it's really a love triangle ― and places it inside a world that a lot of people don't know about, but impacts all of us in really big ways, Oprah says.\n\nThat world is the criminal justice system. Careful not to spoil the plot of the book, Oprah writes in the latest issue of O, the Oprah Magazine that a wrongful arrest and conviction shatter the lives of the couple at its center. As characters Roy and Celestial try to cope with Roy's incarceration, cracks in the foundation of their relationship are exposed ― and new ones emerge where none existed before.\n\nWhile romance is prevalent in the story (It's so juicy, Oprah says), what's particularly profound is the nuanced exploration of mass incarceration and how it impacts the heads and hearts of those touched by it. Jones tells the story through the perspectives of three alternating narrators, diving into the messy gray areas and complexities of love with full force.\n\nI think you'll come away with greater empathy and understanding, but even if you don't, it's just a great read! Oprah says. I'm telling you: It's one of those books I could not put down.\n\nOrder your copy of An American Marriage online or pick it up at your local bookstore or library.\n\nVisit Oprah.com/BookClub to learn more about the book and check out the FAQ page to get info on how to participate
CHAIDEER MAHYUDDIN via Getty Images Vigilantes and religious police in Aceh often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.\n\nBANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rights activists called on Tuesday for Indonesia's Aceh province to release four people detained on suspicion of having homosexual sex, amid concerns over the persecution of the LGBT community in the world's third-largest democracy.\n\nSecular Indonesia is predominantly Muslim but ultra-conservative Aceh is the only province to follow sharia, or Islamic law, and criminalize gay sex.\n\nIndonesia's parliament is currently debating revisions to the national criminal code that could criminalize all sex outside marriage, including same-sex relations. Many believe the new rules could be used to unfairly target the LGBT community and other minority groups.\n\nAuthorities said the four suspects were rounded up by vigilantes and police and, if convicted, could face up to 100 lashes in public.\n\nWe are completing their files and will soon hand over to prosecutors, said Marzuki, head of sharia police investigations in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said the punishment constitutes torture under international human rights law.\n\nAcehnese authorities should release the four and protect the public from marauding vigilantes who target vulnerable minorities, said Graeme Reid, director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights program at Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe provincial and central governments drew international condemnation last year when, for the first time, Aceh authorities publicly caned two men who were convicted under the province's anti-homosexuality laws, which were introduced in 2014.\n\nVigilantes and religious police in Aceh often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.\n\nAceh police detained 12 transgender women earlier this year and publicly shamed them by forcing them to cut their hair and dress in masculine clothing.\n\nThey were later released without charge, but activists say many have since gone into hiding for fear of further raids.\n\nReporting by Reuters stringer in BANDA ACEH; Additional reporting and writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Paul Tait
Reader With Cheapskate writes,\n\nI have been dating a man for the past 7 months and have recently moved in with him. We are blending our families (his two sons aged 11 and 7) whom he has 50% of the time and my two children (aged 4 and 8) whom I have full time. Both of our prior relationships with our children's parents were very dysfunctional and we are both trying very hard to proceed in this relationship being careful not to repeat past mistakes.\n\nOur primary issue seems to be money. Originally when I moved into his house, I agreed to pay $700 all inclusive plus we would alternate weeks for groceries. Because he had been burned in the past by his children's mother who defrauded him out of thousands of dollars, his family, whom I love dearly and are very level headed people, encouraged us to sign a cohabitation agreement which protects his interests in his home in the event that we ever separate. Being a good sport, I signed this agreement even though I personally though it unnecessary. I told him because of this I would not pay any money toward his mortgage or renovations to the house, considering I would reap none of the financial reward. We do not have a joint bank account.\n\nThe problem is that I am in the negative every month with this arrangement. Originally he said $600/month for rent. Then we agreed to increase to $700 because winters are horrible and long and heating costs are high.\n\nHe encourages me to fix up the house and make it a home for us and I am eager to do that. Originally I would buy the items and we would split the costs... but when I asked for his half of the money he never had it, or would give it to me later. It would turn in to a scenario where I would have to start asking repeatedly, which I am very uncomfortable doing and is a major trigger for me from my past relationship (which he knows), and basically I would never get the money. So I stopped. I ask him for the money in advance. The problem is that he keeps saying he has no money and refuses to give me any. Or he argues about the necessity of what I am doing (coat racks for all the winter gear for 6 people so it's not flung all over the living room!).\n\nHe works a fulltime job plus odd jobs, so he has a lot of extra income plus my rent, and yet he still claims to have no money. My expenses have increased since moving in with him. For example, now that I live out of town, driving to work is extra gas. My family is not here to babysit, so now I have to pay a sitter. When it's my turn to buy groceries, I am feeding his children and him.....\n\nThis month, I showed him my bank statements. Due to some unexpected expenses, I have $5.88 in my bank account till next Thursday, and about $45.00 on my credit card. We are squabbling over $5 that he owes me when I had to buy elf on the shelves for his kids and he didn't give me enough money and I had to put it on my credit card. He has owed me the difference for about three days and I am getting very angry. He has spent over $500 on his children for Christmas (using my rent money) while I will only be able to afford $100 for each of my children.\n\nI love this man. Other than this issue, he is wonderful and our families are blending very nicely and I am very happy. But this issue with money is reminding me of my ex (whom made a lot of money and I had to file for bankruptcy while living with him because he would not share or offer to cover expenses, while I was off on maternity leave with the kids). This makes me feel resentful and brings up trust issues, because if I can't trust him to pay me back $5, what does that say about things?\n\nDear WC,\n\nAs I discuss here, there is a lot to be concerned about when a partner is cheap, and particularly when they renege upon financial agreements. This man doesn't sound like he wants to split money evenly. He is generous with his own kids, providing them with a lot of Christmas gifts, but with you, he is far from generous with you, financially or emotionally. He is dismissing your anger and sense of injustice about finances, which is emotionally hurtful.\n\nFinancial withholding is on the same plane as emotional withholding. I would imagine that even further back than your ex, you experienced emotional withholding from a parent, which made this dynamic with two consecutive financially withholding men seem familiar on a deep level. I believe that you are so desperate for this relationship to work out, especially since your kids are involved, that you are ignoring the signs that your boyfriend may not be fully able or willing to merge your lives. First there's the pre-nup, then there's his baggage from his ex, then there's the lack of a joint account, even for big line items like rent. It is possible that your boyfriend is keeping his guard up, and may not trust women because of his marriage. He may subconsciously believe that all women are out to get his money, which some guys believe. On your end, you are enabling his self-centered behavior by continuing to spend money on him and on your home even though he's not reimbursing you. You likely need to explore your tendencies toward codependency.\n\nI recommend that you two see a couples counselor as well as a financial planner. A therapist can help with the resentment that is creeping up on both sides, and explore how financial issues lead to emotional disconnect. A therapist can also help you explore how each of you grew up financially, which may be impacting your different ideas about how much money should be spent on the kids and the home. A financial planner can help you figure out what exactly you need to spend and to save, as well as how to budget. (For instance, buying multiple elves on shelves may not be the most financially sound choice when you have less than $5 in your bank account. One elf can do the job.)\n\nThanks for writing in, and I hope he gives you the $5. Till we meet again, I remain, The Blogapist Who Says, Stay Away From Withholding People.
As a mother of three daughters, I frequently find myself singing along to the catchy tunes of Taylor Swift. Singer, songwriter, and overall superstar Taylor Swift is famous for penning undeniably captivating love songs. She is popular not only because she has the voice of an angel, a cutting edge look, and a fierce attitude, but also because she is honest and real. Taylor has an uncanny ability to put raw emotion into poetic words. Her lyrics are universally relatable. Young adults can hear a Taylor Swift song, pull out favorite quotes, and better reconcile their own feelings.\n\nPhoto Credit: Sarah Brown\n\nMany of the adolescent patients I treat as a psychiatrist are navigating first love and difficult breakups. Young adults often possess a deep yearning to find love. Early romantic love typically occurs suddenly and powerfully. Unfortunately, relationships, which begin quickly, can also easily fizzle out. With minimal experience, young adults working through romantic relationships are susceptible to intense heartache during breakups.\n\nI recently brought two of my daughters to a Taylor Swift concert. Throughout the show, I overheard snippets of conversations. Parents and children were all discussing romance, breakups, and if love can ever truly stand the test of time. Many of my teenage and college-age patients often turn to Taylor Swift's lyrics to understand and explain their feelings.\n\nPhoto Credit: Sarah Brown\n\nUnfortunately, romantic relationships do not get easier with age. Teenagers are not alone in their quest to discover what it means to truly be in love. Adults also visit my office to work through issues pertaining to relationships, marriage and divorce.\n\nAs a practicing psychiatrist as well as a spouse of nearly two and a half decades, I am able to provide patients with guidance to navigate relationships. I accept love as an enormous, complicated tapestry. The tapestry of love is a mix of friendship, humor, support, and understanding. Challenges, compromise, and acceptance do not destroy the tapestry, but instead are interwoven into the fabric to make it stronger and richer. With my own 25th wedding anniversary just around the corner, I feel inspired to share some lessons I learned along the way.\n\nPhoto Credit: Sangeeta Tyerech\n\nTOP 5 TIPS FOR LOVE: TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A HEALTHY LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP\n\n1. Understand the concept of forever. The falling in love stage is unparalleled in its magic. Know and accept that the infatuation stage will not last forever. Fortunately, the relationship and the love still can! Love is a reciprocal act of will. Authentic, committed love will prevail if you and your partner consistently make conscious choices to do what is best for each other. View your partner or spouse as a best friend to support, cherish, and love.\n\n2. Respect your individual and shared values. In long-term relationships and marriages, it is crucial to display unwavering respect for each other as well as your shared and individual core values. Approach your partner from a position of character. Trust, honesty, and empathy are action words. By placing the same level of sensitivity on issues important to your significant other, you are demonstrating how much you value the one that you love. In addition, the three words I am sorry can be more powerful than I love you.\n\n3. Maintain your intimate connection. There are countless ways to develop and foster intimacy with your partner. Holding hands, kissing hello, having deep conversations, incorporating humor, and making eye contact will show your significant other that he or she has your undivided attention as well as your interest. It is important to communicate openly, argue constructively, know when to compromise, and resolve conflict respectfully. Never embarrass or put your significant other down in front of others. When addressing issues, watch your tone and use I statements to make your point. By being aware, informed, and tolerant of your partner's interests, dislikes, and vulnerability, you are steadfast in supporting, protecting, and honoring him or her.\n\n4. Strengthen your social network. It is of the utmost importance to have a life outside of your relationship. Building your life together as a couple is exciting, but it is also crucial to have your own unique hobbies, friends, and interests. You cannot rely on one person to support all of your emotional needs. Understand where and to whom you can go for each of your needs.\n\n5. Enjoy the freedom of being yourself. There is a misperception that long-term relationships bring with them a loss of freedom. In reality, a strong committed relationship provides the emotional support and space for you to be who you truly are. A healthy relationship is a sanctuary- a place to come home and let loose. A coveted marriage or relationship is an unconditional, reciprocal love that knows no bounds. Relationships are not easy. They are, however, worth it.
You might be surprised to learn that stubbornness in marriage is a good thing.\n\nSome spouses try to create a happy marriage through grand romantic gestures like sending flowers, planning romantic dinners, or wearing sexy lingerie. While that is a pretty good plan for creating a Happy Valentine's Day or Happy Anniversary, it is a woefully inadequate plan for sustaining a happy marriage.\n\nOther, more enlightened spouses realize that love is an action word.\n\n\n\nThey know that to sustain a happy marriage over long term they must (1) act like (not just say) they are best friends with their spouse; (2) show physical affection and passion toward each other; and (3) demonstrate commitment to each other and their relationship. These spouses understand that it takes all three sides of the Love Triangle to sustain a happy marriage.\n\nIn fact, they make it look easy.\n\nClearly, this kind of an approach to marriage, does make day-to-day life easier and more pleasant, in part, because relationship intimacy, commitment and passion fuse together to create a Teflon-type protection against routine ups and downs.\n\nBut, when real challenges enter a marriage, spouses need to show commitment on steroids! To sustain a marriage through life's big challenges, couples need to be stubbornly persistent.\n\nSome big challenges are invited, like raising children and building a career. Others are unwanted, like illness, job loss, alcoholism, or a big mistake.\n\nBut, what it takes to sustain a happy marriage through both invited and unwanted marital challenges is, good old-fashion stubbornness. That is, couples have to want to stay together and to be unwilling to accept any other outcome.\n\nJudy C. Pearson author of Lasting Love: What Keeps Couples Together, included in her book an explanation of the value of stubbornness provided to her by Larry Constantine, who at the time was the editor of Lifestyle and a professor of family studies.\n\nMr. Constantine explained that in this context,\n\nStubbornness is a quality which keeps people hanging in there when problems seem to defy solution, when logic or fear or pain might otherwise lead them to quit.\n\n\n\nRelationship professionals like me often talk and write about the value of commitment in a lasting relationship. But, I think Constantine was on to something when he said that the important, but complex concept of commitment pales beside the adrenaline of real stubbornness when it comes to sustaining a vital relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this year on Valentine's Day go ahead and display a grand romantic gesture, as it will create a happy memory and en you some relationship points. Go ahead and profess that your spouse is your best friend, your lover, and your soul mate all wrapped up in one. But, if you really want your spouse to feel the love, repeat the promises you made on your wedding day.\n\nOr you could channel Colbie Caillat and sing I'm never gonna walk away....always gonna have your back. (Or maybe you might just want to have this cued up on your I-Pod. )
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Brigham Young University in Utah reiterated Wednesday that same-sex romantic behavior is not allowed on campus — dashing the hopes of LGTBTQ students who thought they could be more open after the college previously revised its code of conduct.\n\nThe university owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints posted a letter online, saying it was clarifying a misinterpretation after it dropped a section of the code banning behavior that reflected homosexual feelings.\n\nA college administrator wrote that the recent revision doesn't change the moral standards of the church or the faith's opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe letter and an accompanying Q&A posted online don't provide details about what romantic behaviors are and aren't allowed, but seem to shut the door on the notion that gay and lesbian couples will be allowed to kiss and hold hands on campus like their heterosexual classmates.\n\nSame-sex romantic behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the honor code, wrote Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the church education system.\n\nBYU officials said on Feb. 19 that questions about permitted behaviors by same-sex couples would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but the issue hadn't been addressed again until the letter was released Wednesday.\n\nThe clarification letter caused fury and heartbreak among LGBTQ students and allies, said former BYU student Addison Jenkins, a past president of a campus support group for gay and lesbian students. He called it cruel to dash the hopes of LGBTQ students who felt the campus climate would become more welcoming, and then two weeks later issue this new letter that shows anti-queer rules remain.\n\nThis says: We do not care and we are no longer embarrassed about not caring about queer people, Jenkins said.\n\nNathan Cazmersen, a 25-year-old neuroscience major, said he objects to changes that don't feel like they reflect the Christ-like behavior that church leaders encourage. Cazmersen is straight and considers himself an ally for LGBTQ friends. Some of them came out for the first time after the changes were made to the honor code, thinking it was safe, he said.\n\nHe called it particularly difficult to accept the letter a day after high-ranking church leader M. Russell Ballard said in a speech on campus that it is evil and horrifying to marginalize people based on gender, religious preference or sexual orientation.\n\nI feel like it empowers homophobic rhetoric on campus, said Cazmersen of Seattle.\n\nWhen asked what the changes meant, BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins referred The Associated Press to a Q&A posted Wednesday by Kevin Utt, director of the honor code office. In a section about whether same-sex couples can hold hands and kiss, it refers to an aforementioned line from Johnson and says, Any same-sex romantic behavior is a violation of the principles of the honor code.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church, teaches its members that being gay isn't a sin but engaging in same-sex intimacy is. The faith has tried to be more welcoming toward LGBTQ people over the past decade, while adhering to its doctrinal belief that marriage is reserved only for heterosexual couples.\n\nAn entire section in the BYU code that was dedicated to homosexual behavior was removed last month. The clause that upset people said, All forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings are prohibited. Students complained that it was interpreted to be a ban on gay couples holding hands or kissing. Those behaviors are allowed for heterosexual couples, though premarital sex is banned.\n\nBYU's honor code bans other things that are common at other colleges, including drinking, beards and piercings. Students who attend the university in Provo, south of Salt Lake City, agree to adhere to the code, and nearly all are members of the church. Punishments for violations range from discipline to suspension and expulsion.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Jay Sekulow, one of President Donald Trump's lead attorneys during the impeachment trial, is being paid for his legal work through a rented $80-a-month mailbox a block away from the White House.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue box appears to be the sole physical location of the Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group, a for-profit corporation co-owned by Sekulow. The firm has no website and is not listed in national legal directories. The District of Columbia Bar has no record of it, and no attorneys list it as their employer.\n\nBut Sekulow, 63, is registered as chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, a non-profit Christian legal advocacy group based in an expansive Capitol Hill row house a short walk from the Senate chamber.\n\nIncluding Sekulow, a half dozen lawyers employed by the non-profit ACLJ are named in recent Senate legal briefs as members of Trump's defense team — including one of Sekulow's sons. The ACLJ, as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, is barred under IRS rules from engaging in partisan political activities.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has paid more than $250,000 to Sekulow's for-profit CLA Group since 2017, when he was first named to Trump's legal team as special counsel Robert Mueller was leading the Russia investigation, according to campaign disclosures.\n\nSekulow has been one of Trump's most visible defenders, enduring as a trusted attorney for the president even as other of his lawyers have been sidelined or entangled in controversy.\n\nU.S. Senate TV/Handout via Reuters President Donald Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow speaks during Trump's Senate impeachment trial at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., January 27, 2020.\n\nIn the impeachment trial, he has sought to present Trump as unfairly hounded by investigations, seizing on surveillance errors the FBI acknowledged making in the Russia probe and accusing Democrats of investigating the president over Ukraine simply because they couldn't bring him down after the Mueller investigation.\n\nCharity watchdogs for years have raised concerns about the blurred lines between for-profit businesses tied to Sekulow and the complex web of non-profit entities he and his family control.\n\nThe Associated Press reviewed 10 years of tax returns for the ACLJ and other charities tied to Sekulow, which are released to the public under federal law. The records from 2008 to 2017, the most recent year available, show that more than $65 million in charitable funds were paid to Sekulow, his wife, his sons, his brother, his sister-in-law, his nephew and corporations they own.\n\nDaniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, said Sekulow appears to be mixing his defense of Trump with his charitable endeavors. The group has issued a Donor Alert about ACLJ on its CharityWatch website.\n\nCharities are not supposed to be taking sides in partisan political activities, such as providing legal services to benefit a politician in an impeachment trial, Borochoff said. Regulators should investigate whether or not charitable resources, such as office, labor, equipment, etc., are being wrongly utilized to benefit Sekulow's for-profit law firm.\n\nThe address for CLA Group listed in recent court filings matches Carr Workplaces, a flex-space provider that rents out mini offices, individual desks and conference rooms for periods as brief as one hour. According to its website, the company also offers its customers virtual offices that include a mailbox and mail forwarding.\n\nA receptionist at the Carr Workplaces office confirmed the law firm's mail is delivered to a mail slot in a secure room before being forwarded to another location, which she declined to disclose.\n\nA call to Carr last week asking to be connected to CLA Group was forwarded. After a few rings, the call was answered by a receptionist at the non-profit ACLJ.\n\nInquiries about Sekulow's for-profit law firm were referred to Gene Kapp, a Virginia public relations contractor paid through the charity.\n\nJay Sekulow is serving as a member of the President's legal team in his personal capacity, Kapp said in an email. His work with the President is separate and distinct and is not connected with his work as Chief Counsel of the ACLJ. The ACLJ's work is separate and distinct from the legal work being done for the President.\n\nKapp declined to say whether CLA Group has any support staff or whether Sekulow was doing his legal work for Trump in the non-profit group's office. Kapp would also not comment on whether CLA Group was reimbursing ACLJ for any resources being utilized for Trump's legal defense.\n\nDrew Angerer via Getty Images President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow (left) and his son Jordan Sekulow arrive at the Senate chamber as the Senate impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump continues at the U.S. Capitol on January 30, 2020 in Washington, DC.\n\nA 2005 investigation by the publication Legal Times reported about questionable spending at ACLJ, quoting former employees describing millions in charity funds being spent to support the Sekulows' lavish lifestyle, which included multiple homes, golf junkets, chauffeur-driven cars and a private jet used to ferry then-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The Guardian and The Washington Post reported additional details in 2017, shortly after Sekulow was named as Trump's lawyer.\n\nOver the 10-year-period examined by AP, the tax returns show nearly $37 million in charitable funds were paid by ACLJ to the CLA Group, the phantom law firm listed on court filings as defending Trump.\n\nIncorporation filings and tax records show Sekulow co-owns CLA Group with his law school classmate and longtime business partner Stuart J. Roth. Roth is also listed as senior counsel at ACLJ and named in recent legal briefs as one of Trump's defense lawyers.\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, is investigating the potential abuse of charitable funds raised by the organizations tied to Sekulow. Spokeswoman Laura Brewer said it was unclear when that probe, begun in 2017, would be complete.\n\nTrump, Sekulow's star client, has faced similar legal questions. Trump agreed to pay $2 million as part of a settlement with the state of New York in which he was forced to admit he misused charitable funds from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to promote his 2016 presidential campaign, pay off business debts and buy a $10,000 portrait of himself hung at one of his Florida resorts. Trump's charity also cut an illegal $25,000 check to support the reelection of then-Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who now works with Sekulow as a member of the president's defense team.\n\nMANDEL NGAN via Getty Images Jay Sekulow speaks to the press during a recess in the impeachment trial at the US Capitol on January 24, 2020 in Washington, DC.\n\nA Brooklyn native, Sekulow graduated from Mercer Law School in Georgia and briefly worked for the Internal Revenue Service before going into private practice in Atlanta with his former classmate Roth in the early 1980s. The pair specialized in buying and selling historic properties as tax shelters, but the business collapsed after disgruntled investors sued them over alleged fraud and securities violations. Court records show both Sekulow and Roth filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1987.\n\nSekulow quickly remade himself as general counsel for the group Jews for Jesus. A self-described Messianic Jew, Sekulow won a religious liberties case before the U.S. Supreme Court after members of the group were barred from passing out pamphlets at the Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nThe following year, records show Sekulow founded the non-profit Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism (CASE), a charity dedicated to the ideal that religious freedom and freedom of speech are inalienable, god given rights.\n\nIn 1992, he was named chief counsel at the ACLJ, which was founded by televangelist Pat Robertson as a conservative counterweight to the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union. It is affiliated with the law school at Regent University, the Christian college founded by Robertson and located next to the studios of his Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nTax records show ACLJ now receives the bulk of its $23 million annual budget from CASE. All six of the charity's paid board members share the last name Sekulow, including Jay's wife, Pam, and their sons, Jordon and Logan.\n\nThat tight-knit family control runs afoul of standards issued by multiple watchdog groups to help stem the likelihood of self-dealing and graft.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance recommends at least five independent board members and not more than one who receives direct financial benefits. Bennett Weiner, who heads the BBB alliance, said it issued an advisory about ACLJ after the organization didn't respond to requests for more information about its finances.\n\nThe Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, founded 40 years ago by Billy Graham and other evangelical leaders to accredit Christian non-profits, requires independent boards of directors made up of people not related by blood or marriage to staff members. CASE and ACLJ are not listed among the council's 2,400 members.\n\nSamuel Corum via Getty Images From left to right, Eric Herschmann, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, and Jay Sekulow, all members of President Donald Trumps defense team, leave the U.S. Capitol after defending the President in the Senate impeachment trial on January 27, 2020 in Washington, DC.\n\nAs Sekulow has positioned himself among Trump's chief defenders in both the courtroom and as a legal analyst on Fox News, CASE has continued to raise more than $50 million annually through an aggressive mix of telemarketing and direct mail soliciting the conservative faithful to support ACLJ's courtroom advocacy.\n\nBut tax records show much of that money is routed to Sekulow and his family. Over the 10-year period examined by AP, more than $12 million was paid in direct salary and benefits to Sekulow and his family members.\n\nGary Sekulow, Jay's 61-year-old brother, was paid a total of $985,947 in salary and benefits in 2017 as the chief operating and financial officer at both ACLJ and CASE — two full-time positions that tax documents indicate would require him to work 80 hours each week.\n\nAdam Sekulow, Gary's 31-year-old son, was paid $229,227 as the director of development at CASE and $65,052 as the director of major donors at ACLJ the same year.\n\nRecords show millions more each year going to for-profit companies controlled by the family. In addition to the $5.8 million ACLJ paid to CLA Group in 2017, $1.4 million was paid to Regency Productions, a company owned by Jay Sekulow that receives his fees for appearing on the radio show Jay Sekulow Live! and his television show ACLJ This Week with Jay Sekulow, which airs on the same Christian network as Pat Robertson's The 700 Club.\n\nOver the 10-year period reviewed by AP, CLA Group and Regency were paid a combined $46 million in charitable funds by ACLJ and CASE. Millions more were paid by the charities for airtime, though the recipients of that money were not detailed in the tax records.\n\nSekulow's show is often recorded at a studio located at the Washington, D.C., headquarters of ACLJ. Tax records show the office building, with a current assessed value of $3.8 million, is owned by CASE. The charity controlled by the Sekulow family also owns the spacious four-bedroom, four-bath rowhouse next door, which has a current assessed value of $1.8 million.\n\nThis week, an AP photographer saw Jay's son Jordan Sekulow, 37, entering the residence. A graduate of Regent law school, Jordan Sekulow is the executive director of ACLJ, a member of Trump's defense team, and also hosts his father's radio show. ACLJ's website and affiliated YouTube channel have been posting daily updates about the impeachment trial, reiterating GOP arguments and hammering Democratic House managers.\n\nJordan's wife, Anna Sekulow , 36, also works at the charity as a digital media adviser, according to its website. The public tax records do not indicate how much they are paid.\n\nAbout $6.8 million went to the company PFMS of Georgia for producing Sekulow's shows. That company's website lists Gary Sekulow's wife, Kimberly Sekulow , 60, as president and CEO. The address for that business is in the same suburban Atlanta building listed on tax returns as the offices for CASE, the charity that pays it.\n\nIn addition to his two paid jobs at the non-profits, the couple's son Adam Sekulow is listed as the acquisition manager at PFMS. His sister Jennifer Sekulow , 27, is the head of market research.\n\nThe records show at least $1.2 million was spent by the charities on private jets, including an unusual arrangement where CASE was paying to lease a plane co-owned by the for-profit companies controlled by Jay Sekulow and his sister-in-law.\n\nThe tax records show millions more were routed into numerous non-profit and for-profit entities, which makes it challenging to determine who is really getting the money.\n\nFor example, ACLJ and CASE made payments to the Law & Justice Institute, a non-profit entity created by Sekulow and Roth. Tax records show that charity's only activity was to make annual payments to two for-profit companies, Advocacy Services Inc. and Educational Resources Associates.\n\nVirginia incorporation records list M.G.

Bush. That company got $2.2 million in consulting fees from the charitable Law & Justice Institute. Ashcroft , 77, is listed as a distinguished professor at Regent University and has appeared with Sekulow at ACLJ events.\n\nMarc Owens, who served for 10 years as the director of the Exempt Organizations Division of the Internal Revenue Service, said the structure of the charities and corporations controlled by the Sekulow family appeared designed to obscure just who is getting paid and how much.\n\nFederal law forbids charities from excessively benefiting those who have substantial influence over the organization. Owens said both the IRS and state attorneys general should investigate.\n\nThis is an apparent web of organizations that seem to exist to pay compensation to Sekulow and his family members, said Owens, who is now in private practice. That pattern clearly raises questions for those entities that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) as to whether they're operating for a public benefit or the private benefit of Jay Sekulow and his family members.\n\nSekulow's spokesman denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe financial arrangements between ACLJ, CASE and other entities have been reviewed by outside independent experts and are in compliance with all tax laws, Kapp said.\n\nAsked who those outside experts are and whether AP could speak with them, Kapp responded that he didn't have anything to add.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Ashraf Khalil contributed to this report.
Vice President Mike Pence's incoming chief of staff has apologized for writing a column for his college newspaper that blamed gay people's perverted homosexual lifestyles for the AIDS crisis of the early 1990s.\n\nMarc Short, who previously served as White House director of legislative affairs from January 2017 to July 2018, told The Daily Beast that the language he used as an undergraduate college student does not reflect the respect I try to show others today.\n\nWe have all learned a lot about AIDS over the past 30 years and my heart goes out to all the victims of this terrible disease, Short said a statement Tuesday.\n\nIn an essay he wrote for Washington & Lee University's conservative publication The Spectator in 1992, Short criticized the propaganda campaign ignited by gay activists and carelessly perpetuated by journalists whose intent is to scare all heterosexuals into believing they are prime targets for contraction of the disease.\n\nHe lamented the perverted lifestyles homosexuals pursue and warned against glorifying homosexuals' repugnant practices of frequent anal intercourse.\n\nHomosexuals who pursue unhealthy lifestyles and engage in high risk sexual behavior, specifically anal intercourse, may very well end up like Mr. Wright, Short wrote, referring to Edwin Wright, a W&L alumnus who had been diagnosed with HIV.\n\nPence's office did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment. The vice president has come under fire over his views on same-sex marriage, transgender rights and conversion therapy. His wife, Karen Pence, announced in January that she had taken a job teaching art at a school that bans LGBTQ employees and students.\n\nShort left his role as White House legislative affairs director in July 2018, citing diminishing returns in advancing Trump's agenda. He is expected to assume the role of Pence's chief of staff in March after Nick Ayers stepped down in January.\n\nHead over to The Daily Beast to read the full report.
Does the mere thought of a public marriage proposal make your cheeks turn red and leave your stomach kind of queasy?\n\nUnderstandably, having a bunch of strangers' eyes on you during such an emotional and personal moment can be petrifying ― especially if you identify as an introvert. Many people find these big public displays of affection romantic, but others would much prefer something low-key and intimate, like getting engaged at home.\n\nAlyssa Marie Photography What could be cozier than an at-home engagement?\n\nKelsey Vick, who got engaged at her family's barn in Flower Mound, Texas, in 2015, said it was the perfect choice for her and her now-husband Ryan.\n\nRyan and I got to be alone and have our time to soak in the moment, laugh, cry and for me to process through the shock! she told HuffPost in an email. If we were in public, I probably wouldn't have felt as comfortable if people were around or watching.\n\nEmily Nicole Photo Ryan and Kelsey Vick were all smiles after their at-home proposal.\n\nEmily Nicole Photo It's a special place because I grew up spending time there and we have had many special memories and parties in the barn, Vick told HuffPost.\n\nAnother advantage of an at-home proposal? The element of surprise is heightened because the location is unassuming. With a grand proposal, you might be tipped off by the out-of-the-ordinary circumstances.\n\nIt was completely unexpected and organic! I wasn't anxiously wondering if this was 'the moment,' Alyssa Marie Long, who got engaged in her living room in 2016, told HuffPost. I just thought it was another date night at home!\n\nInitially, Long, a wedding photographer in Southern California, had thought she wanted a big, public proposal. But after getting engaged in her living room, she says she wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nHaving that moment to focus on each other without any distractions was a moment we will cherish forever, Long told HuffPost. There's something special about making a huge commitment in the space where you have been growing together for years. There's no place better than home, right?
simonkr via Getty Images\n\nWedding photographers spend a lot of time with their clients, from the initial meeting and engagement photo session to the actual wedding. Given all the time they've put in with the couples, they usually have a pretty keen eye for signs a new marriage isn't going to last.\n\nBelow, professional wedding photographers share eight red flags a couple may be headed for a divorce.\n\n1. One of the partners is completely uninterested in photographs.\n\nNot everyone is interested in photography. In fact, I sometimes meet clients whose fiancés are interested in everything except being photographed on their wedding day. Luckily, most reluctant subjects know that photography is important to their partner and so they participate willingly. But that's not always the case. Early in my career, a groom hired me by phone. When I arrived at the wedding and introduced myself to the bride, she gestured toward my camera and said, 'Don't point that f**king thing at me today!' That made it a pretty rough day. They divorced three months later. I think that a willingness to happily consider the needs of your partner is key to a fulfilling, long-term relationship. And that includes embracing photography even if being photographed isn't your favorite thing. ― Rob Greer, a wedding photographer in Los Angeles, California\n\n2. The couple has more than a 20 percent rejection rate on their RSVPs.\n\nIt is very common to have about 10-15 percent of your guests unable to attend a wedding, but when you get above 20-25 percent, you should start looking deeper. It's a telltale sign that your friends and family know that the couple is never going to work out! It's sad, but so unbelievably true. The outside perspective is the tell-all about your relationship. I was photographing a wedding where the couple invited 250 guests, paid the venue minimum of 200 plates and only 60 people showed up! That same couple came up to me and asked me if I wanted to invite my wife and kids to the reception because they paid for all these dinners and no one came! I just recently found out that the couple has since been separated. ― Brian Delia, owner of Brian Delia Photography in Clifton, New Jersey\n\n3. The chemistry feels forced.\n\nIt's a bad sign when I'm photographing the couple and one of them overcompensates for the lack of interest from the other person. Maybe they have looked through hundreds of online photos and want their wedding images to look exactly like their Pinterest boards. Unfortunately, they didn't consider their relationship dynamics in their 'vision.' Sometimes, they just lack the natural chemistry and emotional connection. Too often, the focus is on having a great image to share on social media. The couples are less concerned with letting the photographer capture the love that's naturally there. It's tough to see a couple so obviously disconnected. ― Gretchen Wakeman, a wedding photographer in Scottsdale, Arizona\n\n4. There's infighting among the bridal party.\n\nIt's a very bad sign when there's relentless fighting and drama between the bridal party. Here's an example: On the way to one wedding, less than 10 minutes from arrival, my team received a phone call. It was the bride telling us that the wedding was canceled. She was bitter and telling us that they were just not getting along and there was fighting among the bridal parties and between longtime friends. She mentioned that the best man had sex with a maid of honor who was really a matron of honor, since she was married. There was a brawl between the guys and it was a total chaos situation. We don't know if they are still together, but I imagine not. ― Matt Adcock, co-founder of Del Sol Photography based in Playa del Carmen, Mexico\n\n5. The couple isn't on the same page about finances.\n\nI'll call this couple T & M, so we don't mention their names. As they walked into my studio for me to present my pitch for why they should choose me as their photographer, T asks for a bathroom break. As she walks away, M says to me, 'This wedding is taking me to the cleaners. Our budget is double what it was at the beginning.' Money is an important factor in all marriages and often plays a part in why they fail. It was definitely true for this couple. Six months after their fabulous wedding with over 150 guests, they separated. ― Carlos G. Osorio, owner of Miami Photo in Miami, Florida\n\n6. The couple makes sarcastic digs at each other while taking photos.\n\nI have captured well over 1000 weddings in my career and I know when I see a couple fighting or bickering throughout the day, it will only get worse and most likely lead to a split. Some couples say they're just joking with each other but there's usually some truth behind each dig or joking statement. The worst I have seen was a bride telling my staff, 'I'm done kissing him.' So subtle, but very deep and meditated. The groom didn't say a word and I thought, 'Wow, it's already the beginning of the end.' ― Brian Delia\n\n7. The relationship seems built on physical attraction alone.\n\nWe have seen couples who are really affectionate and really on each other all night ― and now they're divorced. I remember a specific wedding where I was with this super young, super fit couple. They had a very physical relationship and it was interesting to watch their body language and how they communicated with each other. At the end of the wedding, they invited me to photograph them in a private room for intimate and sexy photos. By the way they asked me, I wasn't sure if they wanted me to photograph them or join them. It was an odd feeling and I politely declined, finished my evening and went home. One year after the wedding, they were separated. ― Sol Tamargo, co-founder of Del Sol Photography based in Playa del Carmen, Mexico\n\n8. The couple hardly spends any time together at the reception.\n\nAfter the wedding ceremony, most couples are excited about the reception. The stress of the wedding day is behind them and it's time to have fun and relax. Couples normally spend the evening greeting guests, dancing the night away, and celebrating their new marital status. When a couple separates to talk to guests or leaves the other alone on the dance floor for hours at a time, it always raises concerns. I have photographed an entire reception and only captured a handful of images of the the couple together ― that's a very bad sign. ― Gretchen Wakeman

Former Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) opened up about his sexuality on Instagram Thursday, confirming in a lengthy post that he is gay.\n\nSchock, who resigned from Congress in 2015 amid claims he misused taxpayer funds, said the news would come as no surprise to his family, friends and associates. Still, he said he felt compelled to make a public announcement to remove any doubt and to finally validate who I am as a person.\n\nI can live openly now as a gay man because of the extraordinary, brave people who had the courage to fight for our rights when I did not: community activists, leaders, and ordinary LGBT folks, the 38-year-old wrote in the post, which also touched on his Christian upbringing and ascent into the political sphere. I recognize this even in the face of the intense and sometimes vicious criticism that I've received from these same people.\n\nDuring his time in office, Schock opposed marriage equality and the 2011 repeal of don't ask, don't tell, which prohibited gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the U.S. military. He also voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded the 1969 federal hate crime law to include victims targeted because of their sexuality and gender identity and was signed into law in 2009.\n\nThough Schock said via his Instagram post that he'd support LGBTQ rights in every way I could if he were active in Congress today, he didn't formally rescind any of his previous stances on queer issues.\n\nI realize that some of my political positions run very much counter to the mainstream of the LGBTQ movement, and I respect them for those differences, Schock wrote Thursday. I hope people will allow for me the same.\n\nThis journey has taught me a valuable lesson: that, whether you are gay or straight, it's never too late to be authentic and true to yourself, he added, noting also that it has not been a case of instant acceptance and understanding among family members.\n\nSchock, who posed shirtless for a 2011 Men's Health feature in which he was proclaimed America's fittest congressman, had been dogged with questions about his sexuality for years.\n\nIn 2009, he told Details magazine that he was not gay, and doubled down on that stance in a 2012 interview with HuffPost.\n\nThose questions are completely ridiculous and inappropriate, he said at the time. I've said that before and I don't think it's worthy of further response. I think you can look it up.\n\nSchock had been largely absent from the public eye since last year, when federal charges he'd misspent government and campaign funds were dropped. To avoid standing trial, he struck a deal with prosecutors by agreeing to pay back taxes and reimburse his campaign.\n\nSpeculation over his private life had been ramping up once again as of late, after snapshots and cellphone videos that appeared to show him partying with gay men at Coachella and in Brazil appeared in a number of LGBTQ outlets.
Hollywood still loves Brad Pitt, in case you were wondering.\n\nThe actor made a surprise appearance Sunday night at the Golden Globe awards, where he introduced the movie Moonlight, which was up for and won Best Motion Picture, Drama.\n\nWhen Pitt took the stage, the crowd erupted in applause ― and we can't help but feel it had something to do with the fact that he's going through one hell of a dramatic public divorce with Angelina Jolie. Just listen to those cheers:\n\nThe Globes marked the first major appearance for Pitt since Jolie filed to end their marriage in September. He previously turned up at a November screening of Moonlight, which he produced, alongside good friend Julia Roberts.\n\nPitt and Jolie's divorce has become a tabloid spectacle due to their ongoing custody case. Pitt was cleared of any allegations of child abuse by both the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services in November; since then the drama has played out in court.\n\nMost recently, Pitt requested that the couple's custody documents be sealed and accused Jolie of having no self-regulating mechanism to preclude sensitive information from being placed in the public record, or she has other motives. In turn, Jolie's lawyers filed documents agreeing to keep the case private but responded stating Pitt was terrified that the public will learn the truth.
LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry on Monday accepted an apology and damages from the publisher of British tabloid The Mail on Sunday and its online version, MailOnline, in a libel lawsuit relating to articles about his relationship with the British armed forces.\n\nHarry sued Associated Newspapers for libel over two articles published in October which claimed he had snubbed the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.\n\nThe articles claimed that Harry had not been in touch with the force since his last appearance as an honorary Marine in March, and that military leaders were considering replacing him as Captain General of the Royal Marines.\n\nHarry and his wife, Meghan, stepped down as working royals and moved to the U.S. in early 2019. His honorary military titles were put on hold, and they were due to be reviewed in March as part of the monarchy's review of the couple's departure arrangements.\n\nHarry had served for a decade in the British army, and his lawyers said the articles caused considerable damage to his reputation and credibility with veterans.\n\nMax Mumby/Indigo via Getty Images Prince Harry attends an event to mark the expansion of the Coach Core sports coaching apprenticeship programme at Lord's cricket ground on October 7, 2016 in London.\n\nLawyer Jenny Afia, representing Harry, said the publisher has accepted that allegations that he had turned his back on the force were false.\n\nThe articles constituted not only a personal attack upon the Duke's character but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country, Afia said.\n\nShe said Harry was proud to have served in the British armed forces for 10 years in Her Majesty's name and has maintained active links with those forces ever since and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nHarry will donate the damages to the Invictus Games Foundation, a charity for wounded or sick servicemen and women that he founded, she added. The amount of the damages was not disclosed.\n\nSeparately, Meghan is also suing Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over articles that published portions of a letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle, after her marriage to Harry in 2018.
You are going to die.\n\nThe people you love are going to die also.\n\nThose two statements may be the biggest white elephant in every room. Death is unavoidable, uncertain and unwelcome. Culturally we aren't taught how to grieve, how to process death or how to accept our mortality. Nobody takes the time to teach us how to die so in many respects we never actually learn how to live.\n\nThe death of someone you can't live without changes the course of your life from that point forward. You can't be the same, and your view of life beyond loss morphs you into a human being, that in many respects, you wish you could have been sooner. You become a human with superpowers of love, emotional depth and an awareness of life and it's cruel brevity of existence.\n\nWhen death knocked on the door of the man who slept by my side every night for fifteen years, it didn't come as a quiet and long knock. Instead, it came as a loud and abrupt jolt that beat down our door and left me standing on the other side of the threshold exposed to the elements and the vast, cold abyss.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, he was gone forever, and my life and the life of our two young children morphed into something I didn't recognize or think was possible.\n\nAs I sat in our lonely and empty bed that night, I took a mental inventory of everything we owned. The big house with the pool, the two cars, the beautiful furniture and the endless purchases from a life of consumption. I got up and walked around the house and continued to tally all the material objects that didn't bring him back. The more I saw, the lonelier I felt, realizing that no amount of stuff we had collectively owned brought me comfort in this new life of anguish.\n\nI returned to our bed and sat in my sorrow. I noticed my heart racing as if I'd just run a marathon, without moving a muscle from my bed. The stillness of the night contrasted with the sharp rhythm of my heart, and the pain that enveloped my being was a grief I didn't believe possible for any human to survive. My mind wandered to happier times as I recalled white water rafting the Grand Canyon, kayaking a volcanic shelf in the Caribbean and hiking in Kauai. In my moment of despair, my darkest hour, I realized that during our many years of togetherness we had lived more than most people would do in a lifetime. We had traveled, explored, we lived with less so we could live for more and made choices to consume life instead of just consuming stuff. In the recent years of our marriage, and with young children, we had started to shift towards how society suggests that we all live and consume. We had begun to buy into a life of quick and needless purchases which limited our ability to go out and create memories and experiences through action.\n\nHis death brought me full circle to his life.\n\nA life that never cared about status symbols impressing the neighbors or living for job titles. The stuff we had accumulated was my idea, never his. In all honesty, I was the one buying into societies view of success and happiness. Turns out death teaches you the value and real meaning of life. Death teaches you that how society tells you to live is a set of rules you don't have to conform to or accept. Death teaches you that memories and experiences are real wealth for those of us who are left behind to make sense of life after loss. Death teaches you to live fully, bravely and honestly without the consumption of stuff as a means of artificial happiness.\n\nThe stuff you buy won't ever quench your thirst for happiness or meaning in this life.\n\nConsumption is a trap of instant gratification and temporary stimulus. The feeling of satisfaction quickly fades and must be replaced with more material objects, bigger, better and more elusive. Suddenly your life mirrors that of a hamster on its wheel. You run as fast as you can in the same direction, never getting anywhere new or worth going.\n\nYou are going to die.\n\nThe people you love are going to die.\n\nThat fact is unavoidable, and while unacceptable allow it to be a lesson for you now on your view of human consumption. You can make a choice to continue a life of stuff that won't sustain you on your darkest day or you can make a decision to skip the stuff and consume LIFE instead.\n\nMemories are free and experiences await right outside your door. Your happiest day ever might involve a close friend, a sunny trail and a mountain peak. The memories that stick to your heart long after life hands us our toughest blows are the memories of laughter, love, and LIVING.\n\nDon't wait for the knock on your door to start living this life. Get off the hamster wheel and consume nothing but a great life.
The off-Broadway comedy Happy Birthday Doug is billed as a solo engagement for Drew Droege. By curtain call, however, the actor will inhabit a total of nine individual roles.\n\nThe characters in the show, all of whom are gay men, are attending a 41st birthday party at a bar in Los Angeles. Some are deliberate clichés: a pair of smug husbands, a woke millennial, a bed-hopping clubgoer, the birthday boy's bitter ex-lover. Others, such as an older man who witnessed the HIV/AIDS crisis firsthand and the ghost of Oscar Wilde himself, offer moments of welcome melancholy.\n\nIn many respects, Happy Birthday Doug is a postscript to Droege's 2016 hit, Bright Colors and Bold Patterns, in which he played a Palm Springs wedding guest who offered biting commentary on the future of queer identity in the marriage equality era. The show also winks at 1968's The Boys in the Band, which depicted queer life before the Stonewall uprising and took place at a birthday party.\n\nLike those earlier shows did for the times in which they were produced, Happy Birthday Doug ― now playing at New York's SoHo Playhouse through March 29 ― offers a snapshot of what it's like to be a gay man, flaws and all, in 2020.\n\nRuss Rowland We need to show LGBTQ people as human beings who aren't perfect, Droege said. Why do we have to be likable? Likable's so boring.\n\nI've been criticized for playing unlikable gay people, and I'll own that, Droege told HuffPost. We need to show LGBTQ people as human beings who aren't perfect. You get all these different perspectives and points of view, but not all of my characters are redeemable. Why do we have to be likable? Likable's so boring.\n\nWhile Happy Birthday Doug mines the varying ages of its characters for laughs, Droege also saw the play as an opportunity to stress the significance of intergenerational friendships in the LGBTQ community.\n\nIt's really a play about holding on to the people who matter to you in your life, he said. I think we have so much to learn from the generation coming up behind us and, of course, the generation ahead of us.\n\nHappy Birthday Doug harkens back to Droege's roots in sketch and improvisational comedy. Still, the show arrives at a time when the actor ― who, until recently, was best known for his viral impressions of actress Chloë Sevigny ― has seen his Hollywood career hit a new stride.\n\nDaniel Zuchnik via Getty Images Droege (right) with longtime collaborator Michael Urie, who co-produced Happy Birthday Doug.\n\nHe'll appear in Charlie Day's big-screen comedy El Tonto, starring Kate Beckinsale, John Malkovich and Jason Sudeikis. Later this year, he'll try a darker brand of comedy on for size with an arc on Search Party, which moves from TBS to HBO Max for Season 3.\n\nBehind the cameras, he wrote an episode of Netflix's AJ and the Queen, starring and co-created by RuPaul.\n\nAfter Happy Birthday Doug concludes its New York run next month, Droege is hoping to take the show on the road, possibly internationally. Given that both Bright Colors and Bold Patterns and Happy Birthday Doug both focused on the lives of queer Angelenos, he's considering mixing things up ― at least in terms of location ― with his next theatrical project.\n\nI've done a wedding in Palm Springs and a birthday party in LA, he quipped. Maybe my next play will be a funeral in New York.
...Or can it be both? For me, so many years ago, my divorce was exactly that. An ending to a not-so-great marriage but simultaneously was a beginning -- a fresh start -- to creating the kind of life that I really wanted to have for myself. I could finally live my life on my own terms.\n\nWhen people consider this question, I believe it depends on where they are and how they feel about their impending divorce. For many people, it's the end of a dream and a future with someone that they wholeheartedly believed they would grow old together with. And, for many people, the new beginning part doesn't come until a significant amount of time has passed.\n\nOne way to look at it? Although it is the ending of your marriage, it is not the ending of everything. A divorce does not have to define you (and shouldn't) and limit you to the person that you think you are unless you allow it to. By focusing on you, what you need, and what your family needs, you will be able to get through your divorce and end up on the other side. Often there are nuggets of opportunity that are hiding in plain sight if we just take a step back and refocus.\n\nHow can you let it be a new beginning?\n\nFind peace. This takes time and often begins with the acknowledgement of what has happened -- to you and your family -- along with the ultimate ripple effects that divorce has on your life. Listen to your intuition.\n\nDiscover new dreams. So often we discover that, while divorcing, you may actually find that the dreams you had about your future as your younger self are not as bound up with, or dependent upon, your being in a marriage or relationship as you first thought. You'll discover a new set of dreams that have been gathering in the background of your life but haven't had a chance to come into focus because your attention has been focused elsewhere.\n\nA fresh start. A fresh start can mean many things. New goals, unbound freedom, room to explore. Despite the difficult path that divorce takes you down, your personal journey through self-rediscovery can be both painful and promising.\n\nCreate a new future. Yours, by design. How will you visualize your new future? Will you stay wedded to your past or will you - after some time and introspection - create a different future for yourself? You can build your future in whatever way you want, without anyone telling you what you have to do. The world is at your fingertips.\n\nA temporary sideline. In the end, don't let your divorce hold you back from living the life that you had envisioned for yourself. Yes, divorce can sideline you for a bit, but eventually you have to get back up and start moving in a positive direction. Have a little faith in yourself!\n\nHow you view your divorce is instrumental for your future. With a positive and realistic outlook knowing that it will be a roller coaster ride for some time, it provides an opportunity to start over. You might think it's about your ex and the dreams that you lost -- but, in truth, working through your divorce is really about you and all that you have to offer. Yes, divorce can and often is a long process and requires effort and energy -- but, in doing that, you'll make it to the other side of divorce.\n\nFocusing on your future and your new life will help you see things differently. The changes that take place will be viewed as positive, even if they come with a lot of hard work. The hard work will result in YOU creating a better life for yourself - one that you never imagined possible! Don't let your divorce hold you back from living the life that you had envisioned for yourself. Keep moving forward.
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The first North Carolina municipalities are acting to expand LGBT rights again a month since the expiration of a moratorium on nondiscrimination ordinances agreed to years ago as a compromise to do away with the state's bathroom bill.\n\nThe governing board of Hillsborough, a town of 7,000 about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Raleigh, voted unanimously this week to approve new protections for people on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and other differences.\n\nThose rules make it unlawful — punishable by a misdemeanor and $500 fines — for businesses of other entities within the town limits to discriminate on these and other characteristics in employment and in offering goods and services to the public, including lodging and dining. Hillsborough's ordinance marks the first by a North Carolina town or city since the 3 1/2-year ban expired Dec. 1.\n\nThis is a step in the right direction, Hillsborough board member Matt Hughes, who is openly gay, said during Monday's board meeting. In so many places across the country, just not in the Southeast but really everywhere, people can marry the love of their life on a Saturday and get fired Monday when they show up at work.\n\nTwo other towns in Orange County planned discussions on largely similar ordinances starting Tuesday in Carrboro and Wednesday in Chapel Hill, which is home of the University of North Carolina's flagship campus. The city of Durham, with 275,000 people, will consider such protections next week, according to gay-rights groups.\n\nIt's a new day for LGBTQ North Carolinians, who for too long have lived under the legacy of discrimination in this state, Equality North Carolina executive director Kendra Johnson said in a news release. Her group and others started a campaign in the fall to urge cities and towns to act.\n\nJohnson cited the painful legacy of House Bill 2, which the Republican-dominated legislature approved and then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory signed into law in March 2016. The measure, which was a response to action by the Charlotte City Council, barred additional non-discrimination ordinances by towns and cities.\n\nA key disputed section of HB2 required transgender people to use restrooms in many public buildings that corresponded to their sex at birth. It drew national condemnation and prompted several large corporations and sports teams to relocate events to other states or reconsider expanding in North Carolina.\n\nIn early 2017, the newly elected Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and GOP legislative leaders approved a replacement law that prohibited local governments from enacting new nondiscrimination ordinances for workplaces, hotels and restaurants until December 2020.\n\nState lawmakers still control rules involving public bathrooms. GOP lawmakers have shown little interest in approving statewide LGBT protections, which Cooper and other Democrats seek. Hughes said the lack of comprehensive anti-bias laws from the legislature or Congress makes it incumbent upon local governments to act.\n\nSome social conservatives said broad LGBT non-discrimination ordinances will violate the constitutionally protected free speech and religious liberties of non-profit and business owners who hold sincerely held beliefs in opposition to gay marriage. Court cases elsewhere have involved bakers or florists cited for refusing to provide goods for a same-sex wedding.\n\nWhile all citizens should be treated with dignity and respect, Hillsborough leaders are attempting to punish people and businesses that don't hold to their government view of sexuality, said Tami Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition. Fitzgerald urged the board Monday not to approve the ordinance.\n\nOne board member, Kathleen Ferguson, said she respects differences on these issues but that she'll always side with policies that favor inclusivity. Mayor Pro Tempore Mark Bell, who said he has a transgender child, was more direct.\n\nThe thought of my kid in the future losing employment or health care or being discriminated against, especially on the grounds of someone's religion — it's offensive, Bell said.\n\nFitzgerald said her group would consider legal challenges and ask the General Assembly to intervene. Republicans lack veto-proof majorities and have limited options to cancel local ordinances. The offices of House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger did not immediately respond Tuesday to email requests for comment on the approved ordinance. The North Carolina General Assembly convenes its two-year session Wednesday.
Long-distance partners often have to work harder at their relationships than couples who live together or close to one another.\n\nAnd though this arrangement can be a struggle at times, putting in that extra effort can really pay off in the long run.\n\nSo what can you do to a better partner in a LDR? We asked couples and therapists alike what actions or habits make a big difference in the relationship. Here's what they told us.\n\n1. Communicate consistently, but at a cadence that works for both of you.\n\nFor some couples, that might be scheduling set times to talk twice a day, once before bed, or a few nights per week. Others might prefer a looser structure for their check-ins. Figure out a rhythm that makes you both feel secure in the relationship but also leaves time for the other important parts of your life, like family, friends, work, hobbies and downtime. Then try to stick to whatever you decide.\n\nEvery couple is different — some find it helpful to have set times to talk while others may feel this is too controlling, psychologist Rebecca Leslie of Living Fully Psychological Services, who was in an LDR before she got married, told HuffPost. It is important you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to communication. Have an open and honest conversation about what works for you and why it works for you.\n\nCapuski via Getty Images Partners in LDRs should have conversations about how they want to communicate, said psychologist Rebecca Leslie.\n\nAnd don't feel like you have to keep a text conversation going all day long just for the sake of talking; for some couples, that much communication might be overkill.\n\nKeep in touch often but don't overdo it, said Simone Ferriero, an illustrator and comic book artist who is in an LDR. Everyone needs personal alone space to recharge or do the things that they love. Being constantly in contact with your partner can be a mistake and it could drain the relationship in the long run.\n\n2. Be honest with your partner when you're not up for talking.\n\nSome days you might be too drained, distracted or overbooked to make it to your hour-long nightly Skype sesh — and that's OK, too. Just be upfront with your partner about what's going on so they don't take it personally when you ask to cut the call short or reschedule.\n\nIf you're not going to be present and intentional when you're on a call together, it's best to avoid it altogether, said clinical psychologist Therese Mascardo, founder of Exploring Therapy. Otherwise, you can unintentionally hurt your partner's feelings and make them feel disrespected.\n\nWhen you're not physically together, what you say during these calls (and how you say it) holds extra weight — for better or worse.\n\nWords have power, said Stephen Maraffino, who is currently in a long-distance marriage with his husband. The way you speak to each other can have a major impact on each other's day.\n\n3. When your partner misses a call or doesn't text you back right away, give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nEven the most reliable partners among us drop the ball sometimes. When they do, remember it was most likely an honest mistake and give your partner some grace.\n\nThere will be times when your partner's phone runs out of battery or they fall asleep and forget to respond to a text, Leslie said. Trusting your partner is key to long-distance relationships. Without trust, your brain will likely go to a lot of 'what if' questions. Trust leads to feeling more at peace in a long-distance relationship.\n\n4. Always have your next visit on the books.\n\nCOVID-19 travel restrictions and changing public health guidelines make it tricky to plan much of anything for the future. The good news is that many airlines are offering flexible cancellation and rebooking policies at this time. Planning your next trip together — and being able to count down until the next time you'll (hopefully!) be able to see each other — should make the distance easier to bear.\n\nThis will allow both of you to plan and have something to look forward to, said marriage and family therapist Anabel Basulto, who is currently in a long-distance relationship. You can plan and budget expenses for travel. The fun part is to anticipate the next meet-up.\n\n5. Come up with fun activities you can do together from afar.\n\nSupplement your usual calls and video chats with bonding activities you can enjoy together.\n\nOne thing that really surprised me was how fun it was to do things together, separately, said Missy Eames, who was in a long-distance relationship with her now-husband for more than two years. We would enjoy watching the same TV series or movies and then discussing them after.\n\nBeing constantly in contact with your partner can be a mistake and it could drain the relationship in the long run. - Simone Ferriero, illustrator and comic book artist\n\nIn addition to Netflix nights, consider sprinkling in some other activities like preparing the same meal together, baking your favorite treats or playing board games online, said therapist Juan Olmedo of Avanza Therapy Practice.\n\n6. Learn to speak your partner's love language from a distance.\n\nIs your partner's love language quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch, acts of service or receiving gifts? If you don't know the answer, direct them to the online quiz. Then ask them which specific gestures would make them feel the most cared for.\n\nBecause you're not living under the same roof, you may need to get a little creative. Mascardo offered some ideas for each love language to get you started.\n\nQuality time : Plan a thoughtful Zoom date with your partner, she said. Send them Uber Eats, and be intentional about making the time special and different from your everyday calls.\n\nWords of affirmation : Shoot them an encouraging email reminding them how smart and capable they are before a big presentation at work. Or comment on how good their hair looks or how cute their smile is when they send you a selfie. Be as specific as possible, Mascardo said. Try to say in detail what you love and appreciate about them. For example, instead of saying, 'You're so kind,' say, 'I love the way you always smile and say hello to people when they pass you on the street.'\n\nPhysical touch : This one can be challenging from a distance. Since you can't actually give them a hug, hold their hand or give them a back rub, send them something for physical comfort when you can't be there — such as a gravity blanket, stress ball or a fuzzy pillow, Mascardo suggested.\n\nActs of service : Figure out a way you can lighten their load or shorten their to-do list. This might take a little more research when you're not in the same city, Mascardo said. For example, you could offer to schedule their laundry to be picked up for cleaning.\n\nReceiving gifts: Send your partner a thoughtful gift in the mail — whether it's for a birthday, holiday, anniversary or just because. And remember that the care and effort that goes into picking the item for them is more important than its price tag. It doesn't need to be fancy or expensive to count, Mascardo said. It could be a book or a candle that you think they will enjoy. Show that you pay attention to their interests and preferences.\n\n7. Before trying to fix their problems, ask if they're looking for solutions or if they just want to vent.\n\nWhen your partner is telling you about an issue they're having with a friend, co-worker or relative, your well-intentioned instinct might be to rattle off suggestions about how they could handle the situation. But if your partner just wants you to listen and validate their feelings, your input could backfire. Instead, ask upfront what they need from you.\n\nThis can be an issue in relationships when one partner wants to 'fix it' or solve the problem but the other is looking to understand it better or simply to vent, Olmedo said. In other words, get in sync with what your partner is needing in the moment.\n\n8. Use technology to connect in unconventional ways.\n\nWhen lifestyle blogger Torera George was in an LDR with her now-husband for four years, their app of choice was called Couple. It had a feature that allowed two people to touch their screens at the same time and do thumb kisses.\n\nWhen our thumbs landed on the same spot, we would both get a vibration, George said. It made me so happy and I looked forward to this cheesy thumb play. Taking advantage of technology in some way can definitely bring you closer.\n\n9. Try to figure out an end date for the long-distance part of the relationship.\n\nCome up with a plan for when and how you'll go from long distance to living together — or at least closer to one another. Though the plan might change over time, knowing you have a shared goal will give you both some peace of mind.\n\nHaving an end date gives you something to look forward to and work towards, Leslie said. It also makes the challenges of long distance feel a bit more bearable because you know it is time-limited.
For the third year in a row, the world's 10 happiest nations remain the same. Nordic countries have consistently landed atop the Happiness Index in recent history, with Finland snagging the top prize for 2018.\n\nThe World Happiness Report, an annual publication of the United Nations, is based on the Gallup World Poll that asks people in more than 150 countries to rate the quality of their lives on a scale of zero to 10.\n\nHowever, Nordic countries don't just top the happiness charts; depression rates in these countries are also high. The latest estimates out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development include Finland, Iceland and Sweden among the seven most depressed of its member states.\n\nWhy the dissonance?\n\nSome of the usual suspects cited in the string of counter articles disputing the Nordic happiness claim include cold winters, sparse sunlight and socialism.\n\nAs a Swede, I agree our winters are dreary, and tax days can be pretty bitter. But to solve this, we need to dig deeper than that.\n\nI grew up in a country where very few people had to worry about everyday violence, or if they'd be able to put food on the table that day, or if they'd end up on the street after losing their jobs.\n\nThat said, Sweden is also a place where bookstores are filled with self-help manuals and where we manically renovate our kitchens but rarely cook; where every fridge is plastered with colorful sticky notes telling us to Wake up with a smile! and No carbs after 6 p.m.\n\nWe've been promised unconditional happiness since we were kids, so we go looking for it: in the self-help corner or in IKEA's kitchen department.\n\nThese aspects of Swedish culture are perfect examples of the quick-fix approach to happiness that has become the norm in Nordic countries, the United States and the rest of the world's happiest nations. Yes, the absence of acute threats to our well-being (which is a more accurate definition of what the Happiness Index is actually meant to measure) has likely helped make us happier. However, we've also consistently raised the bar of our expectations, resulting in the illusion that we can – and should! – be euphorically happy all the time.\n\nIt starts early. Children are sheltered from negative feelings as if unhappiness is an illness they won't be able to shake. Instead of teaching kids how to deal with the full range of their emotions, we treat them like they're fragile and incapable of navigating their way through uncomfortable feelings.\n\nIn the last couple of decades, childhood has transformed from a time when kids develop backbones and learn self-sufficiency into a sort of clinical microcosm of Ibuprofen, antibacterial cream and padded surfaces in which they are fed a diet of exceptionalism and an entitlement to happiness.\n\nAs a result, we've inevitably developed an intolerance to discomfort and perceive all suffering as unneeded ― or even as indisputable proof of mental defectives.\n\nI remember when my first real relationship ended and I, predictably upset, bought my first self-help book. Like most books in the shop's self-help section (euphemistically categorized as Non-Fiction: Life), this one had a 30-something person on the cover with a seamless smile, a just-enough sunburn and a playfully unkempt haircut that gave him a neighborly aura.\n\nTakeaways from that book? Wake up with a smile! Pay attention to people around you. Practice diaphragmatic breathing (deep breathing) to lower your pulse.\n\nI invite you to imagine what I must have looked like the following day as I roamed the streets of Stockholm, convulsively smiling, deep breathing like an overworked draught horse and eyeballing people - all while keeping my index finger glued to my carotid artery.\n\nNordic countries don't just top the happiness charts; depression rates in these countries are also high.\n\nAnd of course, afterward, I still felt like shit ― because I was supposed to feel like shit. I'd lost someone who was important to me. It was natural to grieve.\n\nWhile helicopter parenting and self-help mania seem to be as widespread in the U.S. as in Sweden, its negative effects are enhanced by Swedes' deep-seated wish to fit into a culture of agreeableness. We try to achieve this by pleasing others.\n\nMy former college roommate ― who came from Dallas, Texas ― used to make fun of the way I interacted with Swedish friends, imitating with precision the way we frantically nod our heads in affirmation, interspersing a pendulum of singing sounds with bursts of ja ja ja (yes). The sole purpose of our conversations is unequivocal agreement, so they typically consist of vague and unfocused remarks so that they can always be given an accommodating turn if we sense an impending disagreement. Otherwise, we refer to a reservoir of frivolous statements to fill any space that risks being taken for a pointed silence.\n\nImagine how diabolically opposed this quest for acceptance is to what we actually need from each other, and how it makes us even more receptive to the notion that happiness is a currency ― one that prospers independent of meaningful conversations, close relationships or a sense of purpose or engagement. Believing our well-being is defined in the eyes of others, we keep renovating our already renovated kitchens to prove that we have our shit together, and when we still feel like crap, we make sure to wake up with a smile and stop eating carbs after 6 p.m.\n\nWe've consistently raised the bar of our expectations, resulting in the illusion that we can – and should! – be euphorically happy all the time.\n\nAnd you can't really blame us. We've been promised unconditional happiness since we were kids, so we go looking for it: in the self-help corner or in IKEA's kitchen department.\n\nAnd we look for happiness in our partners, hoping they will embody all the things that are missing from our lives. I remember my disappointment when asking my grandma why she married my grandpa, and she said, Well, he had money and he was very good at his job, and resumed her crossword puzzle.\n\nNot exactly a Disney love story, but having grown up during the Second World War, she had different expectations for her life. Stability and security were happiness to her, and although the marriage wasn't perfect, they didn't get divorced like 50 percent of Swedes currently do, and she didn't scarf down psychotropic drugs like 20 percent of us do now.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't times when medication is necessary, and surely self-help books have been of use to many people. However, we were never meant to go running after happiness in the first place. Such a pursuit happens at the expense of all the things that already produce happiness as a byproduct. What we should ask for is meaning, and we can find that even in the tedious, sad and harsh episodes of life.\n\nCarl-Johan Karlsson is a freelance writer based in New York focusing on politics and culture.

Divorce is a bad word in my household. Divorce in our society is often attributed to failure. Failure in marriage. Failure in relationships. Even failure in parenting. But this is not my case. In my marriage, there was no failure — just a stark realization that people grow and love comes and goes and that is OK.\n\nI don't know how it happened and I don't know why it happened. I could say that we married young and only after dating six months we moved in together and married a month later. I could also say that being two complete opposites was the root cause ― different taste in music, food, vacation spots. I could also say that he is a total introvert and I am a total extrovert. Or that we are from two very different cultures. But I really don't know what happened. All I know is that one day I realized that I was not in love with this man anymore and didn't want to be in a loveless marriage.\n\nSo we grew apart. Our careers took different directions, our values evolved and 13 years after getting married, we were two completely different people. Our relationship became convenient, and day by day it felt more like we were college roommates. I know relationships have their ups and downs, but for me it just felt flat. We could share a meal and talk, but our talks were shallow and they just covered the day-to-day basics of living together and sharing a child. There was no romance involved, and there hadn't been for years. What summer camps will she go to this year? What will she do for her birthday? Did I pay the car insurance, garbage, phone, bills, etc.?\n\nWhen we finally broached the topic of divorce, my then-husband was scared and had no idea what divorce would look like for us. He was afraid it would devastate our families, based off of his own personal experience of being an 8-year-old when his parents divorced.\n\nOne day I realized that I was not in love with this man anymore and didn't want to be in a loveless marriage.\n\nIt was important to both of us that we were equally present parents and stayed in a positive relationship that would only benefit our daughter, but it was obvious that our relationship had reached an end. While he felt it was depressing, I felt it was liberating. He didn't want to get a divorce, so I told him about conscious uncoupling. We were a family and always will be. He will always be the father of my daughter. I will always be the mother of his daughter. We still respected each other as adults and parents but didn't want to be married anymore.\n\nAnd that is what we decided to tell our 7-year-old daughter when we explained our transition. We were intentional in not using the word divorce or separation, and instead we told her we were uncoupling. We told her he was moving downstairs (the beauty of multi-leveled homes in California) and I was going to sleep alone in the master bedroom. Other than that, nothing else was going to change. We continued our family outings to the park on weekends. We continued having family dinners on Friday nights at our favorite restaurants. We shared our house and our time with her.\n\nSharing and keeping the house made financial sense for the two of us, but I knew there were going to be awkward moments. The day did come when we had to have a conversation about overnight visitors and set some boundaries. It was a weird conversation to be having with someone I had been committed and loyal to for 13 years, but in reality we both just wanted to keep things civil and respectful. Our compromise was to become more private with our lives (something that wasn't that hard since we'd led independent lives as roommates for years at this point) and only introduce new people to the family if they were totally and completely serious.\n\nCommunication with our daughter became a top priority, especially because soon both of her parents would start seeing other people. So my daughter and I started having weekly meetings. We would go to her favorite pastry shop, and she would have her notebook and I would have my notebook and we would both design an agenda. We talked about mundane things like school, what she wanted for lunch for the week, my work schedule, school pickup and nights at grandma's place.\n\nBut we also always talked about family. My daughter had friends whose parents were divorced and the family dynamic had become toxic and angry. She was worried this would happen to our family, so it was important that we did our best to make it so that the relationship would be healthy and loving for our sweet daughter.\n\nThis was her modern family now. My actual family was a different story. My family is a very traditional, conservative Mexican family, and they were having a really hard time understanding the situation. My parents were married till death did them apart. My father passed away after being married to my mother for 48 years. Before, when we shared our decision to consciously uncouple, they were puzzled and upset. How would we make this living situation work? Why would we want to continue to live together? This was crazy! Think about your daughter!\n\nIn reality, living with my ex-husband was not hard at all. We respected each other tremendously and shared the house responsibilities as well as parenting duties. Our friendship and trust grew each day, and it honestly has been great to have the co-parenting support in the house without the expectation of having to make an unhappy marriage work just for the sake of it.\n\nOur friendship and trust grew each day, and it honestly has been great to have the co-parenting support in the house without the expectation of having to make an unhappy marriage work just for the sake of it.\n\nAlmost three years ago, only a year after our divorce, my ex-husband started dating someone and fell in love. I wasn't jealous or worried. The reality is, I had been out of love with my husband for a while, and now we were both able to find the love we deserved elsewhere. I was happy that he was doing that. Last year, they got married. And yes, we all live together and get along just fine. A happy man is a good father, and I can see that his new wife brings out the best in him. It's nice to see, but I am also very aware of the fact that we will all have separate lives at some point. Our commitment is to stay together ― in the same house or close to each other ― not till death do us apart but only till our daughter goes off to college.\n\nI think his new wife was probably shocked when she first met me. In the beginning, I tried my best to make sure she knew that I was absolutely and completely not interested in ever getting back together with my ex-husband and that our relationship was just as co-parents. I am sure she needed time to process and adjust, but in my opinion she has done a great job. What I appreciate the most about her is the fact that she loves my daughter and it shows. Even my mother sees and appreciates it, too. Family dinners are now real family dinners where we all get together ― us and my very conservative family.\n\nMy dating life, on the other hand, is more complicated. Dating a single mother who co-parents and lives with her ex-husband and his wife is quite unusual — not really an attractive headline in an dating app. I can't lie, it has been very lonely at times.\n\nI know one day I'll meet someone who can understand why we've created this living arrangement. Marriage can be the pillar of a strong family, but it can also end without breaking the family apart. Marriage can end amicably and respectfully, and I know that I will only live this life once and I want to be happy and in a relationship full of love. My first marriage was not that, but I am hopeful my next marriage will be. Ending a marriage is not failure. It is a sign of maturity and responsibility, when people are ready for it of course.\n\nTruthfully, my ex-husband and I were able to reconcile the love from our relationship before things got toxic. By getting divorced and consciously uncoupling, my ex and I have been able to maintain our family unit and allow it to grow in ways that are best for each of us and our daughter. We're still partners in life, but we're just not romantically or legally married to each other anymore. It works for us, and I feel lucky.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story or experience you want to share? Send your story description to pitch@huffpost.com.
Nadia Vulvokov is gazing at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. It's her 36th birthday party, and the celebration is bittersweet, in part because her mother never made it to that age. Unfortunately for Nadia, she hardly gets to experience it either. Later that night while roaming the streets for her cat Oatmeal, she's hit by a car and dies.\n\nNadia Vulvokov is gazing at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. She's back at her 36th birthday and feeling very WTF, having just died and come back to life and all. Her efforts to unravel what exactly is going on are thwarted, however, when she falls into the East River and drowns.\n\nNadia Vulvokov is ― you get the picture. This is Russian Doll, the new, mind-bending Netflix series from Natasha Lyonne, Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland. We follow Nadia (Lyonne) on her quest to escape her pesky loop of death, the situation growing weirder and more dire by the reboot.\n\nShould you watch Russian Doll? Let's just answer that right now: Yes, you should watch it. Go watch it right now. What makes the show so compelling? HuffPost writers Claire Fallon and Priscilla Frank, fans of the uncanny and the comedic alike, sat down after their Russian Doll binges to unpack this matryoshka-like treasure.\n\nNetflix Nadia (Natasha Lyonne) and Alan (Charlie Barnett) being very chill about almost dying in Russian Doll.\n\nClaire: Despite all the comparisons Russian Doll inevitably evokes, I have to say it's like nothing I've ever seen before. The title suggested a Cold War-era spy thriller starring Natalie Portman; the premise is reminiscent of Groundhog Day, Happy Deathday or, unfortunately, the Netflix rom-com When We First Met. Instead, it was a mesmerizingly original dramedy with a digital steampunk flavor and a warm heart. I'm still processing it!\n\nPriscilla, I must note that you have curls just as luscious and buoyant as Natasha Lyonne's character Nadia Vulvokov ― but did your affinity for the show go any deeper than hair-level?\n\nPriscilla: Wow, thank you so much. This chat is off to a great start. Yes, I loved the show. As someone who has trouble making tangible changes in her life and loathes birthdays, I found it pretty easy to identify with Nadia even without the experience of being trapped in an existential death loop. I mean, who among us hasn't stared desolately into the mirror at their birthday party like, oy, this again. Another year, still myself. Actually, I do not know if this is something other people do. Do you feel that way?\n\nClaire: The birthday, being a day that many of us use to check in on our progress and panic about our ever-approaching mortality, is a relatable peg in that way. I like to think of myself as quite devil-may-care about aging ― and so does Nadia, who insists to her friends that she wasn't freaked out about this birthday, her 36th, which will make her older than her late mother ever lived to be ― but I am full of it, and so is Nadia. She's not at peace with her age, with her mother's death, with the complicated relationship they had when she was alive.\n\nFor the first few episodes, the focus is squarely on Nadia, who spends the first iteration of her birthday at the party her artist friend has thrown for her. She smokes a joint that is allegedly laced with cocaine, then goes home with a douchey divorced professor. After they sleep together, she wanders the streets of Alphabet City looking for her cat, Oatmeal. At this point, she's hit by a car, and she wakes up again in the bathroom at the party, starting the whole night over again. Despite all the death, the first few episodes are more comedic than dramatic. Did this show make you laugh?\n\nPriscilla: I did do some laughing. Lyonne has such a booming, debauched energy, she had me cracking up with her unorthodox pronunciation of the word cock-a-roach alone. I am mesmerized by her voice, which is part woman with a hole in her throat in an anti-smoking PSA, part sing-songy clown at a kid's birthday party. Her throwaway lines (this whole building used to be a school for Jews!) become bizarre and memorable mantras. Her movements are equally intoxicating and beguiling ― very cartoonish and grumpy old man, which seems to be her brand.\n\nSo much of the humor in the show is also quite dark ― whether Nadia is inviting a homeless man giving her a haircut to kill her if he wants (he doesn't) or snapping her neck in a variety of ways after tumbling down the stairs. The tone of the show, though, grows darker as we get deeper and deeper into the story. While the plot remains relatively constant thanks to the Groundhog Day structure, the vibe shifts from feeling like an episode of High Maintenance to something more like Twin Peaks. By the end I was in the spooky place.\n\nClaire, as a known hater of on-screen violence, I have to know: Did the scary parts bother you?\n\nNetflix Nadia (Natasha Lyonne) puking up mirror shards in Russian Doll.\n\nClaire: It does get pretty dark! What surprised me was that the first episodes, which rely more on quips and cracks, didn't really land for me. I was fascinated by her performance, which was so textured and ebullient, and by those of her friends Maxine (Greta Lee) and Lizzy (Rebecca Henderson), but I didn't laugh much. It made me feel like an outsider in New York again, after almost a decade of living here, because her brand of humor and the content of her jokes were almost too foreign to me to find them instinctively humorous. It's when the show started to get eerie that I, counterintuitively, fell in love.\n\nUnlike lighter versions of this concept, Russian Doll digs into both the why and the how of Nadia's relived day: Is it a bad ketamine trip? Is she in purgatory? Is there a bug in reality that's causing it to crash, and if so, what's the bug? Once the show goes deep into these questions, it's inevitable that things will get spooky. It felt honest and completely necessary, and the gore was kept to a reasonable minimum.\n\nWe have to talk about the twist halfway through, which really kicks the show's metaphysical search for answers into gear: While riding a plummeting elevator to one of her deaths, Nadia learns that another man in the elevator, Alan (Charlie Barnett), is caught in exactly the same loop as she is. I die all the time, he tells her wearily. What did you think of Alan's introduction and what he brings to the show?\n\nPriscilla: Are you telling me your New York parties don't include ketamine and orgies? And, more incredibly, lavishly cooked feasts including multiple chickens?\n\nThat scene where we meet Alan for the first time was such a wonderful surprise; just when I thought I understood the structure and universe of Russian Doll, things shifted just enough to keep me disoriented. I enjoyed the contrast between the characters' interpretations of such a surreal course of events. Alan sees his death loop as some kind of moral quest, while Nadia approaches the problem like a coder trying to fix a glitch in the system. I appreciated that they needed each other to escape the loop. It's a simple and powerful message, and one I didn't see coming. I was happy there wasn't some grand, cosmic connection tying them together. No, they just happened to be at the same bodega at the same time and were acting like selfish assholes. The mix of deep meaning and utter meaninglessness was on point throughout the show.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Alan? Do you think the show would have worked if Nadia was the only one caught in the loop?\n\nClaire: Priscilla, you know perfectly well that my New York parties are fueled by sugar cookies and awkward conversations!\n\nThe addition of a second character caught in the loop was, I thought, a brilliant move. While Groundhog Day places main character Phil's moral development at the center of the narrative, Russian Doll accomplishes this more effectively by removing these two characters from the center of their own narratives.\n\nAlan's experience of being in a loop surprised me: While Nadia feels terrified and trapped by reliving a fun birthday party, he appreciates the control and routine offered by the cycle, even though he spends every night getting dumped by his girlfriend of nine years, Beatrice.\n\nThey learn that the world doesn't revolve around each of them, which is scary ― but also that they're not alone, which is comforting. It also complicates the question of what selfishness and goodness look like. Nadia doesn't seem to feel anything; she's single, hard-partying, independent. Alan feels too much, especially his obsession with his girlfriend, whom he's suffocating with his overbearing emotional needs. Neither of them is a bad person, but both need to learn to actually show up for other people and to allow other people to show up for them. The idea that their intersecting moments of selfishness constitutes a bug in reality that crashes the whole system, a neat nod to Nadia's day job, also hints, in a Good Place-esque way, to the idea that humans owe certain things to each other.\n\nRebecca Henderson and Greta Lee are party animals in Russian Doll.\n\nPriscilla: The other character introduced later in the show is Nadia's abusive, mentally unstable mother, played to unhinged perfection by a redheaded Chloe Sevigny. After Nadia begins hallucinating her younger self, we see flashbacks of young Nadia experiencing trauma at the hands of her mother. In one particularly disturbing scene, Sevigny smashes all the mirrors hanging in their apartment, which is teeming with watermelons. What were your thoughts on young Nadia's appearance in the show? And what's your take on the scene where Nadia finally rids herself of these visions?\n\nClaire: There's nothing creepier than an apparition of a serious young girl, and the ghostly introduction really signals that Russian Doll is more psychological horror than sitcom. The conceit of the show also allows for the chilling twist that Nadia dies of a heart attack whenever she sees her younger self.\n\nIt's become fashionable to dismiss childhood trauma as a motivator, especially in fiction; it reads as overused, overdetermined and cheap. Nadia herself is dismissive of the role of her mother's death, and preceding mental illness, in her own psychology. But the show refuses to either reject that explanation or to offer it in a pat, schmaltzy way. Like many people who lost a parent young, I can attest that it can cause complications down the line ― especially because you're often too young to properly grieve, and you simply skip over the healing process. That doesn't mean that Nadia's brashness can be completely written off as repressed pain. It just means that she has a knot in herself to untwist, rather belatedly. The scene where she rid herself of the visions ... well, it was graphic. But necessary!\n\nThe introduction of young Nadia goes hand-in-hand with the introduction of Lucy, the young daughter of her ex John, whose marriage ended because of his affair with Nadia. He had wanted her to meet his daughter, and she had intended to give her one of her own childhood books: Emily of New Moon by L.M. Montgomery. Instead, she'd missed the meetings and then dumped him. The introduction of Emily of New Moon really intrigued me. Have you read the book?\n\nPriscilla: I have not read it! I was going to ask you.\n\nNetflix\n\nClaire: I have read it! I went through an L.M. Montgomery obsession at around that age, and I read EVERYTHING, even her more adult novels, like The Blue Castle. For those who aren't familiar, Emily Byrd Starr is about 11 years old when her beloved father dies penniless. Her mother has already passed away, so she is sent to live with three of her mother's siblings, who live on a farm called New Moon. She's a very sensitive, odd child with a pale face and inky hair. Like Anne of Green Gables, she's given to fits of fancy and conversations with fairies, but she's more withdrawn, moody and morose. She's also a closer analog to Montgomery, career-wise: While Anne gives up writing to raise her family, Emily becomes a successful author.\n\nThe original hipster move is to prefer Emily Starr to Anne Shirley, so it made enormous sense to me that artistic, wounded Nadia would have gravitated to the New Moon books. Along with Nadia's enviable frock coats and frilly blouses, the Emily theme lent a Gothic Edwardian aura to the show, a sense that the age of video game design and the age of novels penned by hand exist almost simultaneously. Maybe this is a tangent, but what did you think of the show's aesthetic?\n\nPriscilla: What I wouldn't give to meet 11-year-old Claire. If she were haunting me in an eternal loop, I would never try to escape it.\n\nI love what you said about the Gothic feel. I do think the aesthetic harnessed a very contemporary, Brooklyn hipster vibe while also channeling a sort of timelessness. Which fits, obviously. The show is gorgeous. Nadia's hair is a perfect example of how small, stylistic details felt very otherworldly yet contextually appropriate, depending on your perspective. Same with the vaginal geode on the bathroom door of Greta Lee's apartment, which Nadia briefly believes to be an incredibly dense gravitational field that's gaining consciousness and deliberately fucking with us, but is, in fact, just some great design! As the show gets weirder and weirder, the style follows suit. I loved the detail of the rotting fruits, a clue that time is, in fact, moving forward within the loop land. And the eeriness of seeing the once bustling apartment party empty and illuminated in aquamarine light, as Greta dances drunkenly by herself. The fear of an empty party, we can all relate to that!\n\nI also loved how the show turned New York into a Rube Goldberg machine of possible death traps. It was a fun play on the sometimes overwhelming, threatening feeling of being in the city to see every step, subway station and elevator transformed into a deadly weapon.\n\nClaire: I saw a tweet from critic Inkoo Kang about how the show captures the perilousness of New York:\n\nRUSSIAN DOLL is a show about how New York is trying to kill its inhabitants all the goddamn time. — Inkoo Kang (@inkookang) February 3, 2019\n\nAnd I completely agree! New York is terrifying. But I was surprised that my biggest big-city phobia, the subway tracks, was not represented. How did Nadia and Alan not die even a single time by being shoved on the subway tracks? In my imagination, this is how most New Yorkers die.\n\nPriscilla: Earlier you mentioned Russian Doll being an unexpected title for a show like this. Did the name grow on you by the end? What's your interpretation of what it all means? Aside from sounding very sexy and mysterious, which it does.\n\nClaire: Russian Doll does end up being quite apropos. I think my initial reaction speaks more to how the Soviet-era anxiety about Russia has shaped American media portrayals of it, and specifically Russian femininity. Lots of honey-trap spies and contract killers, fewer brassy New York video game designers. In a more literal sense, the title perfectly evokes the idea of how our adult selves contain all the earlier versions of ourselves, or of how multiple selves can exist at once, which is the central question of the show.\n\nI can't vouch for whether the conceptual science of all this is airtight ― some of it seemed a little hand-wavy to me. Why are the insides of fruit still ripe while the exteriors have apparently been hurtling forward in time, unaffected by the resets? Does the fourth dimension distinguish between peel and pulp? Someone explain this to me! But regardless, I loved that the show wasn't afraid to mess around with possible explanations and to land on something that feels both fantastical and functional instead of some bullshit like They were dreaming the whole time.\n\nPriscilla: Oh, I learned so much. We should all be more experimental with our eyeliner, a la Greta Lee. And sometimes you need a buddy to pull you out of a bad spiral. Growth can be about looking backward instead of forward. TIME IS A FLAT CIRCLE. Eating rotten fruit is OK if you're in a loop! And, most important, change is hard! That feeling of reflecting on yourself in a particular pattern or situation you hoped you would have outgrown by now. Don't I know it!\n\nSpeaking of, one version of myself I promised never to revisit again is getting curly bangs, which I fear may be in my future after watching this show and Lyonne's heavenly mane. And we're back where we started! The loop is complete!\n\nClaire Fallon: May I just say: I really believe you could pull them off.\n\nThis has been Should You Watch It? a weekly examination of movies and TV worth ― or not worth! ― your time.
I kinda figured maybe since I didn't get a chance to do it at the time, maybe it would be cool. Back then, I never even thought that I had a chance to win, and we had just performed Lose Yourself on the Grammys with The Roots a couple of weeks before the Oscars, so we didn't think it was a good idea. And also, back at that time, the younger me didn't really feel like a show like that would understand me.\n\nBut then when I found out I won, That's crazy! That to me shows how authentic and real that award is — when you don't show up and you still win. That makes it very real to me.
Getty Editorial Get used to seeing Allison Jones Rushing. She's poised to be a federal judge for decades.\n\nWASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Allison Jones Rushing, 36, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, making her the youngest federal judge in the country.\n\nThe Senate voted 53-44 to put Rushing into the lifetime court seat. Every Republican present voted for her. Every Democrat present opposed her.\n\nDemocrats raised a number of concerns with Rushing, who is a partner at the D.C.-based law firm Williams & Connolly. She worked for Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian organization that has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. She has argued that there were moral and practical reasons for banning same-sex marriage. And some lawmakers said she simply lacks the experience or legal ability to be a federal judge.\n\nShe has practiced law for nine years. How many cases has she tried to verdict or judgment? Four. Has she been the lead attorney on any of those cases? No, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said on the Senate floor. That is the most scant, weakest legal resume imaginable for someone who's seeking a lifetime appointment to the second-highest court of the land.\n\nLike most of President Donald Trump's court picks, Rushing is also a member of the conservative Federalist Society, which has been driving Trump's judicial selection process and funneling anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ nominees to the White House.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who helped usher Rushing through the Senate confirmation process, defended her credentials.\n\nShe is really considered one of the fast-rising stars in the legal profession, he said. She is clearly qualified to do this job.\n\nThe Senate is voting on two more circuit court nominees this week, both of whom, like Rushing, are young, ideological and Federalist Society members.\n\nEric Murphy, 39, is up for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. He has fought to make it easier to disenfranchise voters and argued against marriage equality in the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case before the Supreme Court.\n\nChad Readler, 46, is up for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. He filed a brief on behalf of the Trump administration in favor of striking down the Affordable Care Act's pre-existing coverage requirement. He has also defended efforts to weaken voting rights and defended Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military.\n\nBoth are expected to be confirmed along party lines, though Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Tuesday that she'll oppose Readler. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Tuesday that she's undecided on her vote regarding Readler.\n\nTrump is dramatically reshaping the nation's federal courts. With Rushing's confirmation, he has now gotten 32 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices confirmed. That's so many circuit judges ― more than any other president confirmed by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on U.S. circuit courts is now filled by a judge nominated by Trump.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly gave Rushing's age as 37 and Murphy's as 40.
Marrying for a second ― or third time ― is not for the faint of heart.\n\nEven with the best intentions, statistics show that second or later marriages are much more likely to end in divorce than first marriages.\n\nWhy are these unions more perilous than first marriages? Below, marriage therapists share seven reasons why remarrying couples have a harder time staying together.\n\nA lot of couples enter into second marriages before the first one is finished. This can contribute to trust issues surfacing later on in areas such as communication with an ex or activity on social media sites. Healthy boundaries are crucial in all relationships, but especially in second marriages. ― Kurt Smith, a therapist who counsels men\n\nIn first marriages, it's expected that couples will split finances as well as share financial goals and responsibilities. Because of the higher age of couples in second marriages, couples often get together with much more financial assets than they had in their first marriages. They also probably had independent financial goals they've been working towards for a long time before they got married a second time. And just because they're married now doesn't mean that their goals should change from what they were before they were married. There are also questions about how to split household finances and how to divide assets that were accrued before the current marriage. Money is already a top issue that couples fight about. With more complicated finances, couples in second marriages are more likely to fight about finances, which often leads to divorce. ― Aaron Anderson, a marriage and family therapist in Denver, Colorado\n\nCouples remarrying should still get premarital (or pre-commitment) counseling. A good counselor or religious figure will be able to ask the questions you need answered before you wed, including some questions you may not have thought of or are avoiding. You'll start out on a more secure basis with some independent advice and counsel. ― Tina B. Tessina, a psychotherapist and author of How To Be A Couple And Still Be Free\n\nOne reason many couples choose to solve or deal with marital problems is because they don't want to go through the turmoil of breaking up their family and divvying up community property. If you don't share children and significant assets, there's less incentive to try to make second marriages work. And if a stepparent has never bonded with stepchildren, there's less guilt for splitting up a blended family that never felt blended ― in fact, it might even feel like a relief for all parties. Divorce is not as scary as it was the first time around. It's now the 'devil you know:' if you've been through it once before, you know you can do it again. ― Virginia Gilbert, a marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles\n\nWhether its the unexpected complications of blending families or the disappointment that a new marriage still falls short of one's hope for marital bliss, expectations about marriage and family will be challenged by a second marriage. Complicating this, many second marriages aspire to avoid the irreconcilable problems they left in a previous marriage, only to find them in different forms in their new marriage. Expectations are often unreasonably high, and bonds can crumble under this burdensome weight. ― Alicia H. Clark, a psychologist in Washington, D.C.\n\nYou both likely have leftovers from earlier relationships. If you understand your own history and seek to learn about your partner's, you'll stop repeating past mistakes. Talking about your past will help you understand each other, and resolve guilt, fear and jealousy about past loves. Learn about your similarities and differences, hopes and dreams. Familiarity with what went wrong in the past will help you recognize problems before you repeat them. ― Tina B. Tessina
May 4 can't come soon enough.\n\nThe official trailer for the critically acclaimed documentary film on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appropriately titled RBG, was released on Wednesday ― just in time for International Women's Day.\n\nIn the sneak peek, Ginsburg reflects on her barrier-breaking career as a lawyer and her rise to the nation's highest court.\n\nI did see myself as kind of a kindergarten teacher in those days, because the judges didn't think sex discrimination existed, she says in the documentary, describing her early legal advocacy for women's rights in front of skeptical male judges.\n\nBader also speaks candidly about her marriage to her late husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, who died in 2010. And adding to her impressive feats, there are a few delightful shots of Ginsburg's notoriously challenging workout routine ― planks and all.\n\nGet ready to watch the trailer, above, on repeat for the next few months.
FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Gov. Andy Beshear spoke against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and supported a ban on conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth during a historic appearance at a gay-rights rally Wednesday at Kentucky's Capitol.\n\nBeshear became Kentucky's first sitting governor to attend a rally staged by the Fairness Campaign in the Capitol Rotunda, a few steps from the governor's office. The rallies by gay-rights supporters date back to the 1990s, activists said.\n\nThe Democratic governor received loud cheers from the crowd.\n\nDiversity and inclusion, they aren't buzz words, Beshear said. They are values. And they are keys to making Kentucky stronger. Kentucky cannot reach its full potential if all of our people don't feel supported to be themselves.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear speaks at a Feb. 19 rally held by Fairness Campaign to advance LGBTQ rights.\n\nBeshear's appearance was politically courageous, said Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign.\n\nTo have support in the highest office in the commonwealth of Kentucky is so meaningful for so many LGBTQ people who have never felt seen by lawmakers who can make a difference, he said.\n\nBeshear spoke in favor of a so-called statewide fairness measure. It would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations.\n\nDiscrimination against our LGBTQ brothers and sisters is absolutely unacceptable in this commonwealth, the governor said.\n\nBeshear also endorsed legislation to ban conversion therapy, which attempts to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. He denounced the practice as hurtful and dangerous.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Discrimination against our LGBTQ brothers and sisters is absolutely unacceptable in this commonwealth, Beshear said.\n\nBoth proposals face long odds in the Republican-dominated legislature in a state where opposition to gay rights has some deep roots.\n\nIn 2004, Kentucky voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state Constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman. But in June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees same-sex couples have the right to marry. The ruling overturned same-sex marriage bans nationwide.\n\nA county clerk in Kentucky, Kim Davis, made international news when she was jailed in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses after gay weddings became legal. She cited her religious beliefs and said she was acting under God's authority.\n\nDavis was released only after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The state legislature later passed a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Beshear has supported a statewide ban on conversion therapy, and has spoke in favor of a statewide fairness measure.\n\nGay rights activists have made headway. Eighteen Kentucky municipalities have passed local fairness ordinances, which ban LGBTQ discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. Those municipalities — including the state's two largest cities, Louisville and Lexington — account for just over a quarter of Kentucky's population, the Fairness Campaign says.\n\nBeshear told reporters Wednesday that he's not worried about political backlash. Attending the rally was the right thing to do, he said. The Democratic governor took office in December after defeating socially conservative Republican incumbent Matt Bevin.\n\nAt the rally, Beshear praised the activists for making their voices heard.\n\nYou have not been heard nearly enough, the governor said. Let's make sure that changes this (legislative) session.
Must every movie be heralded as timely and urgent in order to matter?\n\nWhile these phrases and their variations aren't new, they became ubiquitous in the aftermath of the 2016 election.\n\nRelevance is one of the great shibboleths of criticism, and after a real-life event as dramatic and complex as this year's election, the temptation to seek clues and answers in works of popular art is almost overwhelming, New York Times co-chief film critic A.O. Scott wrote in the introduction to his list of the best movies of 2016, following the election of Donald Trump. But cinema is better at exploring than explaining, and the screen is more like a prism or a kaleidoscope than a mirror or a window. We seldom get the news from movies.\n\nA lot of critics and Oscar prognosticators couldn't help but view that year's Oscar season through the lens of Trump's election. One of the prevailing narratives around the Best Picture race was that it served as a referendum on the election. On Oscar night, when Moonlight unexpectedly triumphed over the season's presumed front-runner La La Land, it was seen as Hollywood's rebuke or repudiation of Trump's victory.\n\nPop culture has always been a product and reflection of the world around us, whether that was the artist's intention or not. The best movies — and the best art in general — help us see the world in a new way, crystallize something we hadn't fully seen before, connect the past with the present and the specific with the universal. But overemphasizing a film's relevance or inserting real-life parallels when they aren't there isn't that.\n\nEvery few weeks or months, a critic might declare the latest buzzy movie the movie of the moment or the movie we need right now. Studios and their publicity consultants then splash these flashy quotes onto movie posters and For Your Consideration ads during awards season. It reflects a tired tendency to ascribe some sort of larger significance to the movie, even when it isn't directly there, and reinforces an overused notion that movies must be heralded as timely and urgent in order to matter.\n\nThe Rise Of The Phrase 'The Movie We Need Right Now'\n\nBut Weinstein was mainly known for his blatantly manipulative and heavy-handed emotional appeals to Oscar voters, creating an entire awards season industrial complex. If you wanted an Oscar, you had to schmooze and hobnob at every awards breakfast or dinner, every panel or screening. Weinstein was hellbent on making sure anyone with influence saw his movies, generating a sense of exclusivity: If you haven't seen this movie or met its star or filmmaker at a fancy event, you're missing out.\n\nTake 2008′s The Reader, which Weinstein strong-armed into that year's Oscar race. The slogan on its For Your Consideration ads sums up his entire approach: The one film that has everyone talking. (It's questionable as to whether it did indeed have everyone talking: In his opening monologue, Oscar host Hugh Jackman joked about having not seen it.)\n\nIn 2010, Weinstein produced The King's Speech, that year's Best Picture winner. Some movies you see. Others you feel, the movie's ads declared. Its awards campaign used the extremely obvious slogan: Find your voice. By 2014, when the ads for the Weinstein-produced biopic The Imitation Game urged Oscar voters to honor the man, honor the film, this approach had become the subject of mockery and derision.\n\nRegardless of whether Weinstein was behind them or not, many of the awards campaigns for movies of the 1990s and 2000s relied on these transparently sentimental appeals and bombastic phrases to tug at Oscar voters' heartstrings. Looking back at the quotes from critics' reviews that were emblazoned on For Your Consideration ads, most of them conveyed wonderment and amazement. For example, in 2008 — another seismic election year — the ads for Best Picture winner Slumdog Millionaire boasted that the movie was a buoyant hymn to life and a soaring, crowd-pleasing fantasy.\n\nEvery now and then, there were ads that referenced a movie's relevance, trying to convey that it was about something serious and important. The Dark Knight: this is the zeitgeist movie. Doubt: a movie that is actually about something. But most of these kinds of narratives were applied to movies with more overt political and social themes, such as documentaries, political thrillers and biopics.\n\nSometimes, even those movies didn't lean into political narratives as much as one might expect. For instance, the discourse around 2008′s Milk, starring Sean Penn as LGBTQ rights pioneer Harvey Milk, was very politically oriented for obvious reasons. Its release came at the dawn of the Obama presidency, and California's Prop 8, which banned marriage equality, had just passed, giving the movie something to fight against. Yet when looking at its ad campaign, only some of the language and visuals directly referenced the political landscape surrounding the film's release.\n\nWhy The Phrase Has Become Particularly Useless To Audiences\n\nThe 2016 election marked a turning point. Search for phrases like the movie we need right now, and the results show a huge spike in articles in late 2016 and early 2017. Over the last few years, it has been hard not to view everything through a Trumpian lens.\n\nAnalyzing this phenomenon at the end of 2017, film critic K. Austin Collins pointed out the absurdity of these headlines while acknowledging that the whole concept of relevance is complicated.\n\nMovies don't need to be sold to us as what we need right now, or ever, to be relevant as art, but it's true that this form of relevance is the way our culture is currently swinging, and it's doubly true that art should strive to be about the world in which it exists, he wrote.\n\nPerhaps it's more instructive to think about it as a spectrum. Art that ignores politics altogether and actively tries to be apolitical is often misguided. On the other hand, making a piece of work that's too on-the-nose and inserting relevance for marketing purposes is inauthentic. Sometimes, deliberately underlining a movie's modern-day parallels can have the opposite effect on moviegoers.\n\nFor instance, last year, I really wanted to like Jojo Rabbit. But when it was pitched to reporters and critics as an anti-hate satire, I became more skeptical about the movie than I otherwise would have. I didn't want to be hit over the head with the movie's relevance from the start, but rather, discover it through the movie itself.\n\nThe dynamics of this year's Oscar race are still unfolding, with the contenders jockeying for attention using various narratives. On one level, the current Best Picture front-runner, Chloé Zhao's Nomadland, could be considered a movie for the moment, a movie about something timely and urgent. It documents the grim effects of the Great Recession, the monotony of being cogs in a capitalist machine and the precariousness of life on the margins (and has faced some scrutiny for not being critical enough about these topics). Yet, as my colleague Matt Jacobs wrote, it's not explicit about these Big Important Themes — and it doesn't need to be.\n\nIn an era when so many movies triple-underline their social consciousness, Zhao has crafted a drama too intelligent to submit to such showboating, he wrote.\n\nSometimes, the Academy decides to award Best Picture to something polarizing; sometimes, it gives it to the safest pick. And every now and then, it gives it to a damn great movie, a Moonlight or a Parasite.\n\nTo borrow another oft-used and overwrought phrase, movies are supposed to stand the test of time. The best movies are both timely and timeless. They represent big ideas and evoke a particular moment — and stand on their own, too.
A Black friend on the East Coast texted me two hours before Oprah Winfrey's interview with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry came on Monday night. Because of the time difference, he had just finished watching it.\n\nIt's heartbreaking, he wrote. They didn't want her son to be a prince because of him being mixed-race.\n\nMy whole body clenched as I felt the meaning of his words sink into my chest cavity. I tried to flex against it, to protect myself, but I could not. After witnessing decades of Black men and women dying at the hands of the police and others, I was ready for some good news. I wanted something to ease the pain of the exhaustive barrage of hate, prejudice and harm that my people and I experience on a daily basis. I'm so tired of defending my Blackness and the Blackness of others.\n\nAnd even though I knew better, there was a small corner of me that dared to hope that Meghan's marriage to Harry, and the baby that followed, might be that good news. Not just for people who look like me, but for all people.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nHarry and Meghan's son has not broken the invisible wall and collapsed the British royal family's long-standing caste system as so many of us had hoped. Baby Archie's role is not to heal the wounds caused by years of Britain's racism and colonization, but rather to expose how powerful those things still are today.\n\nThe year that Meghan married Harry, I watched a news story about how a local girl was marrying a prince (Meghan hails from Los Angeles, where I live). They showed a 1995 video clip of a 14-year-old Meghan standing at the all-girls Immaculate Heart Middle School podium, delivering a zealous graduation speech to her peers.\n\nNext, they interviewed several current Immaculate Heart students. Giddy young white girls with ponytails in polo shirts, waxing poetic about how fairy tales really do come true.\n\nIf it could happen to her, it could happen to anyone, said a blond girl with dimples and braces. Meghan is one of us.\n\nCorrection, little girl, I thought as I changed channels. Meghan is one of us.\n\nMeghan Markle is a beautiful woman, actor, activist, philanthropist. But for the 15% of female Americans who check the box next to Black, she has one other identifier that is just as important: Meghan is a sister, y'all, and we are claiming her.\n\nAnd while the world watched as she moved to London and prepared to become the first Black, mixed-race woman to be a British royal and to break barriers at Buckingham Palace, Black American women held silent prayer vigils for Meghan's emotional and physical safety.\n\nWe were afraid because we know better. We know that despite the many beautiful and powerful attributes this woman possesses, there are people who will never see past her race. And while for most of us, Black is a wonderous and desirable thing to be, some people still see Blackness as something to overcome or to rise above.\n\nMy boyfriend Scott and I watched the interview Monday night, and I got teary as Meghan described the horrors that she had endured. The racist headlines, the press's frequent attacks and the utter lack of protection. The emotional welling-up I felt was not just for her but also for me.\n\nBecause I know the feeling of being alone in a place with no support, with no one to validate your experience or give that nod of affinity. I also know the fear of being Black and arriving in a foreign place, hoping to meet and impress the family of your beloved. A family that has a long-standing history on the wrong side of racism.\n\nScott and I had been dating for less than a year when a stroke paralyzed the left side of his father's body and took away his ability to speak. Scott had reluctantly told me stories of his dad's racism and listed it among the reasons why he left home as soon as he could. After spending a week with his dad in the ICU, Scott asked me if I would fly to Richmond, Virginia, the former seat of the Confederacy, to be with him and meet his father.\n\nI was in full-blown paranoia by the time I arrived at the hospital. In my mind, all of the white people I saw in the lobby, sitting at desks and on the elevator were just a pickup truck ride away from a cross burning and lynching. At that moment, walking into the ICU to meet a white man on his deathbed felt like both the stupidest and the bravest thing I'd ever done.\n\nAs I entered, I held my breath, afraid of offending, afraid of being offended. Scott's father was lying under a thin blanket, several tubes stringing from his arms to a machine. His eyes locked on mine immediately, and I found myself walking over to his good side to greet him.\n\nHe kept looking back and forth from Scott to me, his gaze landing on our hands, which were tightly clasped together. After a few moments, his right hand, which still had some mobility, reached for my free one. Once he had it, he held it up to Scott and mouthed the word, Beautiful.\n\nThe way Scott and I see it, his dad made a conscious choice to see me and not just my Blackness when I walked into that room. He knew he was dying, but he could see that his son was happy. For him, I think the love that he witnessed between us was enough.\n\nBut apparently, Harry's love for Meghan is not enough, not for the British press, not for certain palace residents, and not for The Firm. Harry spoke of not understanding what it meant to be Black before he met Meghan, not knowing how difficult it would be for her because of the bubble in which he was raised, the protections he has always received.\n\nI was actually encouraged by his naive statements about not grasping the impact that her Blackness would have on their lives together. Here was a prince who, despite his world travels, hadn't given any real thought to what it was like to be something else, anything else than white. By marrying Meghan, he was able to see and understand his own privilege for the first time.\n\nAnd he was pissed.\n\nI'm glad about that. For there can be no more pretending that there is equity or justice among the members of the house of Windsor. Because Harry loves Meghan, the racism that exists in one of the world's most celebrated institutions has been exposed ― and we're all taking a good, hard look at it.\n\nSo, maybe there is good news here after all. And not just for people who look like me, but for all of us.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost?

Jimmy Kimmel surprised everyone by bringing an unsuspecting tour bus group to the 89th Academy Awards. But little did we all know, a star would soon be born: Gary from Chicago.\n\nSporting a hoody, dad cap and his fiancé's purse, Gary led the tour group into the theater, capturing the moment on his phone the entire time, even after host Jimmy Kimmel told him they were already being filmed by the TV cameras.\n\nGary, in true uncle-at-a-cookout fashion, didn't care.\n\nAs he continued to film the actors in attendance, Kimmel asked Gary if he was ignoring the white actors. Without hesitation, Gary admitted, I am though.\n\nKimmel then asked Gary's fiancé, Vicky, who her favorite actor was. She said, That man right there, and pointed to Denzel Washington. Kimmel suggested that Washington should be Gary's best man, but the actor did him one better. He officiated their wedding on the spot.\n\nGary's Hollywood debut didn't end there.

There are some telltale signs, though, says psychologist Craig Malkin, author of the book Rethinking Narcissism: The Bad — And Surprising Good — About Feeling Special.\n\nAlthough there are many varieties of narcissism (outgoing and bombastic, shy and introverted, or proudly self-sacrificing), there are common traits, Malkin said. What they all have in common is a powerful aversion to sharing authentic emotional vulnerability.\n\nWhat other traits do they have in common? Below, Malkin and other experts share six red flags.\n\n1. They've planned your date itinerary to a T.\n\nYou have to hand it to your date: He or she picked the restaurant, effusively recommended things on the menu and knew exactly what bar you should head to after dinner. It might be nice to have someone plan everything out for you for a change, but narcissists call the shots for a very particular reason, Malkin said: Open-ended plans might end with them not getting their way ― something they don't respond well to.\n\nInstead of asking for what they want, narcissists often arrange events to make them happen, he explained. If your date insists on planning out the entire date, it could be a fun sweep-you-off-your feet experience, but it could also signal something far more ominous: someone who demands that everything always goes their way.\n\n2. They love-bomb you.\n\nYou're still waiting for your appetizers, and your date has already expounded on all the weekend getaways you should plan and how well you click. Their clear interest in you may be alluring at first, but watch out: Love-bombing ― overblown demonstrations of attention and affection meant to win someone over ― is a marker of narcissism, said Virginia Gilbert, a Los Angeles-based marriage and family therapist.\n\nThe adoration is so intoxicating that you may ignore the fact that it's way too soon to be planning a future together, Gilbert said. Reality check: Your date is using love-bombing to hook you so you'll give him what he wants ― most likely physical intimacy, money, connections, or taking care of them.\n\n3. They subtly slip humble brags about themselves into the conversation.\n\nMost narcissists brag, but those who rate high on the narcissism scale have figured out ways to do it covertly. That's because they're experts in impression management and have learned to keep their arrogance in check in the early stages, said Tina Swithin, a divorce coach and the author of Divorcing a Narcissist: Advice from the Battlefield.\n\nA highly skilled narcissist may casually mention the high-end gym that they belong to or that they only fly first-class, but it is done with such subtle sophistication that their target may not even register it as a red flag, she said. The less-skilled narcissist will openly and obnoxiously discuss their Ivy League degree, or the square footage of their new apartment.\n\n4. They're rude to the waitstaff.\n\nPay attention to how your date treats your waiter: It could be an indication of how they'll eventually treat you, said Darlene Lancer, a marriage and family therapist and the author of Codependency for Dummies and Dealing with a Narcissist.\n\nHow do they treat the waitress, the car hop, or staff at the ice cream shop? Rudeness and arrogance signal low self-esteem and narcissism, Lancer said. Their rudeness to the waiter and hostess could hint at pent-up rage and demanding and possibly emotionally abusive behavior.\n\n5. They assure you they're looking for long-term love, but most of their relationships were short-lived.\n\nIf you're on a date with a narcissist, they might tell you that they're looking for a life partner, but can't seem to find anyone who's worth investing in, Lancer said.\n\nChances are, their relationships have frequently ended after intimacy developed, she said. They're looking for perfection but usually find some flaw, and end the relationship so they can continue their search.\n\nUnfortunately for you, the problem might lie with your date.\n\nPay attention to the negative facts people divulge about relationships, Lancer said. Ignore their vulnerability, bragging, and compliments.\n\n6. They pry about your insecurities but never reveal theirs.\n\nNarcissists will grill you about getting passed up for a promotion at work or joke about where you went to college, but they'll get unnerved if you put them in a similar hot seat, Malkin said.
Last year, I was a contestant on ABC's Match Game. I knew millions of people would be watching me, and I chose that moment to confess to the world that I love to collect Lego sets. The audience sniggered, and the six celebrity panelists exchanged quizzical looks. Host Alec Baldwin quipped, Daryl, friend to friend, it may be time to Le-go of your childhood.\n\nI get it. It's a response I've grown accustomed to. A grown man that collects a child's toy is weird to some and just plain creepy to others. I've been so embarrassed by this hobby that one time I even lied to a Lego store employee and told him that I was looking for their newest Marvel set because my son can't get enough of Iron Man. Except I have no son. I'm a father of three daughters ― and I'm pretty sure they have no idea who Iron Man is.\n\nBut that lie was before my game show appearance. Now, I own this part of who I am and I take comfort in knowing that I'm not alone in finding joy in such an unusual hobby. In 2014, USA Today reported on the impact adult Lego fans have had on the plastic brick company. We're known in the Lego community as Adult Fans of Lego, or AFOLs for short. There are so many of us that even celebrity AFOLs have publicly confessed their love of the toy.\n\nDaryl Austin The author's middle daughter, 4 at the time the photo was taken, playing with a new Disneyland Lego castle in a custom Disneyland scene.\n\nDavid Beckham, for example, shared a photo of himself on Instagram last year where he was surrounded by a massive Disneyland Lego set with the caption, Page 1 of the Disney castle. 4000 pieces. 490 pages of instructions. I look confused but I'm so excited.\n\nGrammy winner Ed Sheeran revealed in the documentary A Lego Brickumentary that as soon as he came into money, he wasn't interested in buying a new house or a car. He just wanted to buy Lego sets. Sheeran even confessed on The Graham Norton Show that he once brought a Pirates of the Caribbean Lego set on a date and ended up neglecting the woman he was with to attend to his blocks.\n\nCharlotte Hornets Center Dwight Howard loves Lego so much that when he made an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2012, she brought out a life-size bust of Howard made out of the bricks.\n\nBut I didn't know about any of these guys when I first opened this door back to my childhood. It all started about seven years ago, when my wife and I were walking past the toy aisle of our local Target store.\n\nA Harry Potter Lego set caught her eye. We both stopped to look at it, and I marveled how different it was from the Lego sets of my youth, which were pretty much just police cars, fire stations and pirate ships. The Harry Potter set was on clearance and, seeing how I was responding to it, my wife encouraged me to buy it. We had only been married for a year and we were still on a tight budget, so I hesitated.\n\nWe didn't have any children yet but we were expecting our first. I fantasized that someday I'd want to build the set with my daughter when we read the Harry Potter books together for the first time. So I purchased the set. Someday came a lot sooner than my wife's due date. Within hours of getting home from the store, the box was opened, transparent baggies full of plastic bricks were scattered all over the counter, and I was busy building a miniature version of Diagon Alley.\n\nWhat started as nostalgic wonder grew into a very expensive and time-consuming hobby for me. Soon after we got married, my wife and I started a freelance marketing and design company. At first it started slow, but every time we saw an unexpected increase in sales, I rewarded myself with a new Lego set or two. Soon, we owned all of the licensed sets that Lego had to offer and I started to branch off into some of the lesser-known collectable sets and all of the Lego Minifigure Series.\n\nAt first I tried to kid myself about the amount I was spending, but one day I started adding up all of our Lego receipts and my mouth just dropped. I'd spent over $45,000 on Lego bricks! As crazy as it sounds, I had justified a lot of it along the way because I knew how collectable Lego sets are and saw them as part of our investment portfolio (more on that in a minute). But coming to grips with that number is part of what helped me start thinking about the many reasons why I love the wonderful world of Lego so much. Now, I'm finally at the point where I no longer feel any shame about this – and I've permanently come out of the toy closet, so to speak.\n\nI love the father-daughter bonding time each set offers me and my children. I may not have built Diagon Alley with my oldest, who's 7, but we've built scores of other sets together, including all of the Lego sets from The Little Mermaid, every Angry Birds set, and her favorite, Sleeping Beauty's castle. And my other two daughters, ages 5 and 3, share the same interest — albeit in Lego Duplo form for my youngest. I love watching all three of them turn away from the TV or their video game systems to create and enter whole worlds made out of plastic bricks.\n\nAs South Park co-creator Trey Parker says in A Lego Brickumentary, the act of building something with the toy can offer an insanely therapeutic benefit to users. Lego toys allow me to turn off the noise and distractions in my head. When I'm building a scene made out of Lego bricks, my mind calms down from the stress of running my own business and all of the responsibilities resting on my shoulders.\n\nIn his memoir Eleven Rings, legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson describes a process that I think I experience every time I build a Lego set. He writes, Focusing on something other than the business at hand can be the most effective way to solve complex problems. When the mind is allowed to relax, inspiration often follows.\n\nConcentrating on something as simple and mundane as putting plastic bricks together relaxes my brain unlike anything else. As a result, I've gotten some of my best ideas, come up with some of my best words for writing projects and done some of my best soul-searching while my mind is preoccupied and focused elsewhere.\n\nDaryl Austin Daryl Austin and family on July 4, 2017.\n\nI'm a collector of many things, but nothing is more fun to collect than Lego sets. There are sets from dozens of nostalgic movies ranging from Indiana Jones to Back to the Future available. You can even find Lego versions of shows and cultural experiences as specific as The Big Bang Theory and The Beatles' Yellow Submarine. To add to the collectability, the Lego company produces each set for only a limited time, and they never reproduce the same set number twice. As a result, they're highly valuable to collectors both monetarily and also in terms of the thrill we get in trying to hunt down the rarest limited edition sets.\n\nRemember that Diagon Alley set I purchased? It originally cost me $98, and today it's selling on eBay for more than $300. And that's nothing compared to some other sets. In 2000, a Statue of Liberty Lego set went for $199. Sixteen years later, its value had skyrocketed to $1,998.87. In 2007, you could have purchased the Lego first collector's edition of the Star Wars Millennium Falcon for $499.99. That may seem like a steep price for a toy until learning that, as of 2016, it was worth a whopping $3,987.40.\n\nThe list goes on and on. In fact, in 2015, Time Magazine reported that in the past 15 years, the average value of Lego sets have appreciated by 12 percent annually. They also noted that, by comparison, the S&P 500 has returned about 4.2 percent annually, while gold has returned 9.6 percent annually. Based on this, Lego sets have been a better investment than gold since the turn of the century!\n\nEven in used condition, complete Lego sets appreciate handsomely. My family has put together many of the sets we've purchased, but not all. Many remain unopened and secure in a storage unit, with each set appreciating more and more every day.\n\nBut, in the end, the monetary benefits mean less to me than the appreciation this hobby has given me for the kind of marriage I'm in. Of all the many hobbies and collections that I pursue, this is the only one that makes others raise an eyebrow ― but not my wife. She loves that this is a hobby I can do from home. She loves that it helps me connect with our kids. She loves that it provides a kind of therapy for my overactive mind. And she loves that it satisfies my obsession with collecting in a way that can actually be profitable, instead of just being costly. More than anything, she loves that I love it. Which makes me love her even more for supporting me.\n\nMy wife is a knockout, a super cool, 10 out of 10 former cheerleader who married a guy far beneath her social station in life. If ever there was a woman that earned the right to ask her husband to rein in his inner dork, it's her. Instead, she does the opposite and encourages me to fly my freak flag proudly. Something rare and beautiful happens when you realize you are married to someone that accepts you exactly as you are. As ridiculous as it may sound, if it weren't for Lego, I may never have discovered just how deep her acceptance and understanding of me — of all of me — truly goes. It's enough to make me tell Alec Baldwin that I'm not ready to Le-go of anything.\n\nDaryl Austin Daryl Austin's oldest child, age 7, playing with her Disney Princess and Lego Batman Movie sets.\n\nHave a personal story you want HuffPost to consider publishing?

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia sank deeper into political turmoil Wednesday when another top Democrat — Attorney General Mark Herring — admitted putting on blackface in the 1980s, when he was a college student.\n\nWith Gov. Ralph Northam's career in extreme peril over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook, Herring issued a statement saying he wore brown makeup and a wig in 1980 to look like a rapper during a party as a 19-year-old at the University of Virginia.\n\nHerring, 57, said he was deeply, deeply sorry for the pain that I cause with this revelation.\n\nThe attorney general issued the statement after rumors of a blackface photo of Herring had circulated at the Capitol for a day or more. But in his statement, he said nothing about the existence of such a photo.\n\nThe disclosure further roils the top levels of Virginia government. Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who would be next in line if Northam resigned, was confronted with uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct earlier this week. He denied the accusations, calling them a political smear.\n\nHerring would be next in line to be governor after Fairfax.\n\nIn his statement, Herring said he and two friends dressed up to look like rappers they listened to, including Kurtis Blow, admitting: It sounds ridiculous even now writing it.\n\nThat conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others, he said.\n\nBut he also said: This conduct is in no way reflective of the man I have become in the nearly 40 years since.\n\nHerring, who plans to run for governor in 2021, is among those who have urged Northam to resign after the discovery of a photo on Northam's yearbook profile page of someone in blackface standing next to a person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe.\n\nLast Friday, Herring condemned that photo as indefensible and said it is no longer possible for Northam to lead the state.\n\nNortham admitted at first that he was in the photo without saying which costume he was wearing. A day later, he denied he was in the picture. But he acknowledged he once used shoe polish to blacken his face and look like Michael Jackson at a dance contest in Texas in 1984, when he was in the Army.\n\nAsked if Herring should resign, Democratic state Del. Delores McQuinn, an African-American, did not answer directly.\n\nWe are going to govern — that's what our constituents want us to do, she said.\n\nHerring spent most of his life in Northern Virginia's Loudoun County, where he practiced law after earning bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Virginia and his law degree from the University of Richmond.\n\nHe served as a county supervisor and a state senator before getting elected attorney general in 2013 by a mere 165 votes out of more than 2.2 million ballots cast. He won re-election by a more comfortable margin in 2017.\n\nIn 2006, as a state senator, he supported a Virginia constitutional amendment that outlawed gay marriage. But as term as attorney general, Herring made national headlines for his efforts to overturn Virginia's ban on gay marriage.\n\nShortly after taking office, Herring said he would no longer defend the state in a federal lawsuit that challenged the state's ban on gay marriage as unconstitutional.\n\nIt's time for the commonwealth to be on the right side of history and the right side of the law, he said at the time.\n\nA federal judge overturned the state's gay-marriage ban, and cited Herring's opposition to the ban as a compelling factor in her decision. Virginia court clerks began issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in October 2014, nearly a full year before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling allowing gay marriage nationwide.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Barakat contributed to this report.
Erdark via Getty Images There's nothing wrong with asking your partner about their 'body count,' but it's also worth examining why you want to know.\n\nPart of the fun of having a new sex partner is learning their sexual history and divulging yours, too: What are you into, sexually speaking? When did you lose your virginity (and was it as awkward as everyone else's?) Are there any sexual fantasies you're dying to make a reality?\n\nNaturally, this sexy, sex-positive line of questioning leads to another classic question: What's your sex number?\n\nFor some of us, nothing piques the interest quite like knowing how many people the person we're boinking has boinked before. (Try saying that 10 times fast.) It's not only a fun topic, but one that can bring you closer together and help you understand how you relate to each other as sexual partners, said Megan Negendank, a psychotherapist and sex therapist in Sacramento, California.\n\nIt's really important to be able to have open conversations about sex with our partners and sharing our number could lead to a good discussion about what sex means to us and what we want from sexual intimacy at this point in our lives, she said.\n\nAfter a decade of marriage, Negendank still vividly remembers posing the question to her husband when she was 20. She wanted to know everything: What it was like, who they were, how her S.O. felt about the encounters now.\n\nHe was open to sharing with me and I think that early conversation still helps me better understand him as a partner, she said.\n\nHer future husband wasn't so inquisitive, taking a the past is the past outlook on her sexual count.\n\nI asked him if he wanted to know my number, and he said he wasn't interested, she said. We've had a lot of other conversations about my past sexual experiences and serious relationships, so I know it's not from lack of interest or caring. I think he just thinks knowing the number isn't that important and that's fine with me.\n\nNegendank's intense curiosity and her husband's indifference highlights an interesting divide: When it comes to other people's body count, interest levels vary. If you are intrigued and want to know, there's nothing wrong with casually bringing it up like Negendank did. It's quite a different story if you take the question seriously and get judgmental about your S.O.'s response.\n\nFirst, consider why you want to know and why the number feels important to you, if it does, said Rachel Kazez, a Chicago therapist and founder of All Along, a program that helps people understand mental health and find therapy.\n\nIf you're asking out of concern, you might want to explore a few things, she said. For instance, are you asking because you're insecure about how you rank given their past experiences?\n\nIf it's that, do you trust your partner when they say you are important to them now? Kazez said. Do you have judgments about the number that may be based on religious, societal or media messages that don't actually align with your own values? Would your thoughts on their number differ if they were a different gender?\n\nUltimately, it's not fair to judge and add meaning to anyone else's sexual experiences. Your partner trusted you enough to share this number and honoring that trust includes managing your judgments. - Jesse Kahn, the director and a sex therapist at The Gender & Sexuality Therapy Center in New York City.\n\nIt's smart for you to analyze your reasons for asking, but there's no need to get super serious or anxious when you broach something like this. After all, it's not so much a Big Important Couple Discussion as it is fun pillow talk.\n\nAs for how to respond to the big reveal, treat it with the same casualness you're (hopefully!) treating the question itself. (Yes, keep it casual even if you're a teeny bit surprised by the number, whether it's high or low or something in between.)\n\nI think you could say something like, 'Cool!' 'Fun!' or 'Into it,' said Jesse Kahn, the director and a sex therapist at The Gender & Sexuality Therapy Center in New York.\n\nIn the event that you are surprised by their number, Kahn suggests asking some internal followup questions to yourself. (No need to bring these up with the other person!)\n\nAsk yourself, 'Am I comparing our numbers?' 'Why am I surprised?' and 'Am I judging them and if so what are those judgments?' he said. Ultimately, it's not fair to judge and add meaning to anyone else's sexual experiences. Your partner trusted you enough to share this number and honoring that trust includes managing your judgments.\n\nAlso, remind yourself that no one owes anyone information about their sexual history. It's your right in a relationship to know if your partner has any STDs or STIs (if the two of you are sexually active), what their sexual boundaries are and whether they're faithful to you (if you are monogamous), but sex numbers are quite another matter. By sharing their number with you, your partner is getting vulnerable with you and trusting you with very private, intimate information, Negendank said.\n\nYou should thank your partner for opening up about their number and if you both feel comfortable talking more about it, go for it, she said. Try not to focus on the number so much and instead just stay curious and you'll come to better understand your partner and their sexuality. You might learn a lot about them!
The two men who filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Vistaprint — the popular printing company that sent the couple a boxful of anti-gay pamphlets instead of the weddingprograms they'd ordered — have prompted the printers to announce an investigation into the matter, as well as their commitment to marriage equality.\n\nStephen Heasley, 31, and Andrew Borg, 39, who live in Australia but were married in Pennsylvania, filed their claim in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, the state where Vistaprint is based. The couple spoke with Yahoo Lifestyle about their initial reaction to the bizarre box of pamphlets, which warned, among other things, Satan entices your flesh with evil desires.\n\nAt first we thought it was simply a mistake, and we had accidentally received someone else's order. But once we saw the images and actually read a bit of the pamphlet, we quickly realized this wasn't a simple or innocent error, the husbands said in an email. Both of our initial reactions were ones of shock … utter shock. The wording and imagery was aggressive, threatening, and deeply personally offensive.\n\nThey added, This was by far the most direct, personal, and aggressive act of homophobia either of us has experienced to date, regarding the shipment of homophobic pamphlets, which the couple received on the eve of their ceremony and a party for 100 guests.\n\nVistaprint told Yahoo Lifestyle that the company had first heard of the incident on Tuesday, and with the filing of the lawsuit, spokesperson Sara Nash offered additional comments about the situation on Wednesday.\n\nWe are taking this situation extremely seriously. Below is an open letter we have shared with all of our customers and partners today, which further outlines our immediate actions to address this incident as well as Vistaprint's commitment to using this as an opportunity to shine a light on important LGBTQ issues, she wrote in an email.\n\nThe letter, signed by Trynka Shineman, Vistaprint CEO, and by Robert Keane, Vistaprint founder and CEO of parent company Cimpress, addressed their customers and partners worldwide with the following:\n\nYesterday, we learned that a same sex couple who were married in Pennsylvania in September of last year ordered 100 custom wedding programs from Vistaprint and instead, received pamphlets expressing intolerance and judgment.\n\nWe want to say how incredibly saddened we are to hear this story. To know that any person could be treated in such a way especially during a time that should be filled with joy is extremely disheartening. Imagine a customer who took the time to create something personal to mark this special day and instead, the day before their wedding, goes to open their wedding programs and finds these judgmental messages. We have never been more disappointed to let a customer down.\n\nWe share in this couple's outrage. Vistaprint in no way condones — and does not tolerate — discrimination against any of our customers based on their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. We have encouraged members of the LGBTQ community to use our services to help celebrate their life events for many years, and have published thousands of wedding invitations, programs and other content for same sex couples.\n\nAs an organization, we support diversity and reject discrimination in all forms. We have taken the following steps in response to this incident:\n\nWe have begun a complete investigation to determine how and why the couple received these materials. If we determine that any Vistaprint employee or partner had any role in this situation, we will take strong action.\n\nWe have communicated with all Vistaprint team members and reaffirmed our commitment to equality and diversity for all of our customers and employees.\n\nWe have begun to plan how we can use our global brand platform to share a message of support for same sex marriage and equality around the world.\n\nWe have reached out to the couple to express our outrage that this incident occurred, and sadness that this in any way diminished the joy of their wedding day memories. We are hoping to establish a dialogue with them so together we can use this incident as an opportunity to shine a light on important LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe message was likely a good start for Heasley and Borg, who told Yahoo Lifestyle, Our goal is to hold Vistaprint accountable for the harm they have caused, to give a voice to others who may have been similarly victimized, to help prevent this from happening to someone else, and to send a message that there will be consequences for acts of hate perpetrated against others.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:

Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nDivorce attorneys are experts on marriage. After all, every day in their offices, they see the petty squabbles and simmering issues that can easily bring down a long-term relationship.\n\nWhat have they learned from their day jobs? We recently asked family law attorneys from across the country to share how their own marriages have been affected by their jobs and clients. To get a balanced account, we asked their spouses to weigh in, too! See what they had to say below:\n\nKaren Covy, a divorce attorney and coach in Chicago, Illinois:\n\nI've been with my husband for 10 years and married for eight. I don't take anything for granted. I've seen a lot of relationships that went south just because someone stopped paying attention to them. I see a lot of small mistakes that build into big problems. I've learned from the pain I witness every day. I consciously work on avoiding those mistakes myself. I try not to let my professional stress bleed into my personal life and I try not to cross-examine my husband. But I'm human!\n\nHer spouse, Vit Homolka:\n\nIt really doesn't make much difference what profession my wife is in. She's a strong woman and I like that. It's true that sometimes when we're talking, she hits me with her 'lawyer's logic.' Our discussions get broken down into points and sub-points with supporting evidence. When she flips into lawyer-mode, it can feel like you're in a court room. But, I know who she is inside. Her profession is not the primary thing in our marriage.\n\nMargaret Klaw, a divorce attorney in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:\n\nI've been married for 34 years and for 30 of them, I've been a divorce lawyer. You might think I'd be deeply cynical about the institution of marriage. But you would be totally wrong. I, along with many of my colleagues in the family law bar, are deep appreciators of marriage. I think that is because we, more than most people, truly understand the value of family. We know it's what gives meaning to people's lives because we experience firsthand the depth of the pain when it doesn't work out. And I know that has made me a better spouse and parent. I'm tolerant of small problems and differences because I am so acutely aware of the big picture, of how unimportant those differences may be when compared to the potential cataclysm of divorce. I have to admit, though, that I've heard this from my husband more than once during an argument: 'Stop cross examining me!' But really, if that's all he has to complain about, he has no idea how good he has it.\n\nHer spouse, Alan Metcalfe:\n\nI may have just a few more complaints but I share my attorney wife's perspective on marriage. I also love hearing about how badly couples behave (no names, of course!) in court, marvel at how generous her clients can occasionally be with their estranged spouses in the name of their children, and often think how lucky I am to be in a solid marriage. I also know that I would be screwed if I tried to divorce her because she is the only person I would want to represent me in court.\n\nAlison Patton, a divorce attorney and mediator in La Jolla, California:\n\nYou would think that with all I've seen and learned through the years, I'd be great at marriage and not make the same mistakes divorcing clients have made. Not always the case. For years, John's common line to me when we were having a marital spat was, 'Can't you just use your mediator skills for a goddamned minute and try to understand my perspective?!? And stop interrupting me!' What I've learned from being in this profession is we all make the same mistakes in marriage. Some of us are just lucky enough to have the marriage survive until we figure it out. I think we made it through the rocky stretches because John is as strong a person as I am. He's an attorney too and he held his ground. Even when we were furious with one another, we never lost mutual respect. I'd be lost without him.\n\nHer spouse, John Thickstun:\n\nI'd been divorced for about a year when Alison and I met and started dating. I proposed a few months later. My friends asked me, why are you getting married again? And to a family law attorney!? So I explained, 'This will guarantee that it will last. It has to!' All kidding aside, divorce attorneys are participants in the end of a chapter -– the death of a relationship. But if they're like Alison, they are also witness to the beginning of a new chapter -– a rebirth of sorts. Guiding people through the divorce process creates wisdom if you're open and paying attention. Alison pays attention. She brings the wisdom she's learned to our relationship. I love her more today than the day we were married over 18 years ago.\n\nChristian Denmon, a divorce attorney in Tampa, Florida:\n\nOur situation is a little different: I'm a full-time divorce attorney. My wife does divorce work, but it is a minority of her practice. We apply what we learn from our practices to our relationship and it helps steer us on the right track. And I think, as we transition from what divorce lawyers call a short-term marriage to a medium-length marriage (we have been married seven years), we are still on strong footing. Much of it is thanks to her!\n\nHis spouse, Nicole Denmon:\n\nMy husband listens more to other women's problems than mine. The emergency phone calls at night and on the weekends used to bother me. I used to ask lots of questions as to why a female client needed to talk to him so badly at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. But then I listened to his conversations. Some were true emergencies and others were him just be an attentive lawyer who knew when that his client needed to talk and needed advice right then. Although it did not constitute an emergency to him or me, the person on the other line truly believed that it was. I have come to learn that a good divorce attorney must be attentive and on call if a client needs to speak with them. I know that my husband does not always want to return a phone call, but he puts himself in the position of his client that is experiencing one of the most traumatic experiences one can go through: divorce.\n\nNancy R. Van Tine, a divorce attorney in Boston, Massachusetts:\n\nStu talked me into going to law school while he was studying for the bar exam. Four years later we started our own firm. I didn't choose family law. I backed into it. I was the only female lawyer in my location when we hung out our shingle, and the divorce clients came as a result. And they kept coming, and I loved doing it. Stu and I worked as a team. He did a lot of my legal research and all my appellate writing in the early years. We'd discuss strategy, law and the clients all the time. I think we were more careful of each other in our marriage as a result. Marriage and divorce law have been a fun partnership.\n\nHer spouse, Stuart Van Tine:\n\nYep, I've been married to a divorce lawyer for 52 years. She wasn't a lawyer for the first 14. I'd been an attorney for five years when she was sworn in and we opened our own shop. We later joined a larger firm together; I retired, she's still there. For us, practicing law together was fun. My end was stodgy bank and real estate work. Her practice seemed to bring new and amazing bits of insanity every day. What I remember most is her ability to keep her composure where very few people could, like laughing along with our staff at the death threat left on our answering machine or the court battle over custody of a stuffed parrot. Those were happy days.\n\nKatherine Eisold Miller, a divorce attorney in New Rochelle, New York:\n\nDivorce lawyers hear some pretty crazy stories and we know what destroys relationships. Knowing what destroys them gives us a window into how to nurture and preserve our partnerships. On the other hand, we also know how to protect ourselves and our assets and that could be pretty scary if things weren't going so well.\n\nHer spouse, Richard Heller:\n\nI've been married to a divorce attorney for 18 years. From the beginning I needed clear boundaries between work and relationship ― and no prenup. Prenups look to me like a self-fulfilling prophecy, like you're planning the way out when you have not even begun while to my attorney bride, it just made sense to get clear on financial boundaries. Keeping communications from becoming 'litigious' is an ongoing practice for both of us. I often joke that 'I'm married to a divorce lawyer, I don't mess with her,' but I actually find my spouse appreciates what an amazing marriage we have because she has seen so many marriages that were less than that. She works long hours and I miss her terribly, but our time together is always sweet.\n\nDaniel E. Clement, a divorce attorney in New York City:\n\nAs a divorce attorney, my problem is not making my clients' issues mine. While I am sympathetic, I have to remain detached to keep my objectivity and maintain my sanity. I certainly don't want to bring their problems home with me. That said, I can use my client's issues as life lessons. I can identify the mistakes they made in their relationships, in raising their children, in their decision making, and consciously modify my behavior so as not to follow them. I do not want to be someone's divorce client.\n\nHis spouse, Michelle Schwartz Clement:\n\nMost of the time, Dan seems immune to the stresses of the day. Yes, there are days he brings it home, but what successful professional doesn't do so?
A visibly emotional Brad Pitt won his first-ever acting Oscar on Sunday night, dedicating his award to the six children he shares with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.\n\nThe actor picked up the award for his performance in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in the Best Supporting Actor category, besting screen veterans Tom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood), Al Pacino (The Irishman), Joe Pesci (The Irishman) and Anthony Hopkins (The Two Popes).\n\nAfter hugging co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, Pitt took to the stage to deliver an understated and moving speech about his decadeslong journey through the entertainment industry.\n\nI'm not one to look back, but this has made me do so ... all the wonderful people I've met along the way, to stand here now ― 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,' ain't that the truth, he said.\n\nHe ended his speech by dedicating the award to his children ― Maddox, 18, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 13, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 11.\n\nThis is for my kids, who color everything I do, he said. I adore you. Thank you.\n\nBrad Pitt's full acceptance speech at the #Oscars pic.twitter.com/pIoiixbYrr — Brad Pitt Web (@BradPittWeb) February 10, 2020\n\nPitt and Jolie, who divorced in 2016 after two years of marriage, were locked in an acrimonious custody battle long after their relationship ended. The two reached a final agreement over the custody of their children in November 2018 after years of bitter negotiations in and out of the public eye.\n\nPitt has become something of an awards show darling this year, dominating the competition at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the Golden Globes, the British Academy Film Awards and essentially every other ceremony for his turn as over-the-hill stuntman Cliff Booth in the Quentin Tarantino-directed feature.\n\nAnd, of course, his legitimately funny acceptance speeches, in which he's joked about everything from his difficult marriages to his co-star LDC, have raised expectations for his time on the Oscars stage.\n\nHe did make some cracks during his Oscar speech, referencing President Donald Trump's impeachment trial and the blocking of John Bolton's testimony.\n\nThey told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week, Pitt said.\n\nKevin Winter via Getty Images Brad Pitt accepts the Actor in a Supporting Role award for Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood onstage during the 92nd Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre on Feb. 9 in Hollywood, California.\n\nHe also paid tribute to director Tarantino, adding that the film industry would be a much drier place without you.\n\nFor Pitt, it's been on a long and winding road to his first acting Oscar win. The 56-year-old previously won an Academy Award in 2014 for producing 12 Years a Slave. He's been nominated for six previous trophies at the awards show, scoring his first nod in 1996 for Best Actor in a Supporting Role as Jeffrey Goines in the drama 12 Monkeys.\n\nThe Academy overlooked Pitt's performances for more than a decade after his first nomination until 2009′s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but he lost to Sean Penn for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. In 2012, he received dual nominations for starring in and producing the baseball drama Moneyball before finally taking home a trophy for the Steve McQueen-directed drama two years later. Pitt's sixth Oscar nomination came from producing The Big Short, which was nominated in 2016 for Best Picture but ultimately lost out to Spotlight.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this post misstated the ages of Pitt and Jolie's six children.
Courtesy of Hywel Phillips / RestrainedElegance.com Nine-year-old me would be flabbergasted to discover that we can work hard when we know we're shaping our own future.\n\nMy teacher, having asked everyone who got 10 out of 10 right on the spelling test to put their hand up, went on to ask who got 9 out of 10. She proceeded from there, down to 4 out of 10. I put my hand up. I actually got 1 out of 10, but didn't want to admit I didn't study for the test. She wouldn't have understood why.\n\nI was 9 years old and I wasn't going to grow up. I didn't need to learn to spell because I'd never need a job. It was 1986, my family were Jehovah's Witnesses, and the JW governing body was confidently predicting that Armageddon would arrive by the mid-1990s. Everyone who survived that would live forever in Paradise on earth. We were promised this at each of the thrice-weekly meetings we attended. In Paradise, we'd build log cabins, make friends with wild animals and spend our time picking fruit with other Jehovah's Witnesses. This was all lovingly illustrated for us in the Jehovah's Witness literature.\n\nI tried to suppress the panic I felt whenever I perused the pictures. To me, it looked boring ― because it was going to last forever. I had many opportunities to consider forever, sitting on a plastic chair under fluorescent lights, during the interminable Jehovah's Witness meetings. Forever meant that eventually, the whole world would be so familiar to me that there would be no wonders left. One day I would have had every possible conversation with every single person still alive on the planet. It gave me a feeling like vertigo. So I told myself to trust what I was learning because if everyone else wanted to live forever, it would surely somehow be marvelous, and a more-than-ample reward for all the activities we missed out on in the present-day world.\n\nThere were plenty of those. No Christmas, no birthdays, no Easter. Technically, Jehovah's Witnesses were allowed televisions, but we were warned frequently about worldly influences and my parents had elected not to have one. Higher education was frowned upon ― it was considered selfish not to use all your available time and energy trying to convert nonbelievers, so as to save their lives during Armageddon. Many young JWs left school as soon as legally allowed, took low-paying jobs, and spent all of their spare time and energy evangelizing, or storing up treasures in heaven. I banked on Armageddon coming quickly enough to save me from having to become a window cleaner. I was keen for it to arrive before I turned 16. This, the JW literature assured me, was almost certain.\n\nCourtesy of Ariel Anderssen The author at age 11 in a 1988 school photo. I was expecting the world to end in five years maximum, she says.\n\nWe collectively closed our minds to the fact that this was not the first time the Jehovah's Witness organization had predicted the end of the world. They first believed it would happen in 1914. Their subsequent predictions (1918, 1925 and 1975) were similarly anticlimactic, but many JWs still delayed further education, put off getting married and decided not to have children. All these things, we were promised, would be better done later, in Paradise. I was aware of the large number of unmarried elderly ladies in our congregation ― they'd been waiting, lonely and patient, for their entire adult lives. I was also aware, at least vaguely, that perhaps someday I'd be one of those old ladies. That is if the Jehovah's Witnesses were wrong about Armageddon. Again.\n\nI wasn't terribly worried about not having a career. My dad, who'd grown up in a non-Jehovah's Witness family, was a nuclear physicist, having safely qualified before anyone told him that the end of the world was on the horizon. I certainly didn't want to do that ― his job seemed terribly difficult and jobs in general seemed scary, tiring and not sufficiently rewarding. Rather like studying for spelling tests, I thought. The ones that appealed to me (being a ballerina, a model or Sherlock Holmes) weren't allowed by the JWs. I might as well make friends with lions in Paradise, I reasoned. And though living forever sounded overwhelming, not having to die certainly had some appeal. We learned a lot about death ― it sounded awful. The Bible was full of violent, painful deaths, and all were presented to us with lurid pictures. If the price for my family staying alive was eternal boredom, that at least sounded better than torture and murder.\n\nI might have gone on like this for the rest of my youth, if not for a spectacular fight that ended my family's association with the JW organization. An elder from our congregation told my 16-year-old sister's boyfriend that he should break up with her since Armageddon was just around the corner. He did so without hesitation, over the phone. My sister was devastated. My parents were concerned that she was suicidal. It was exactly the opportunity they needed to decide that raising their children in an authoritarian sect was perhaps not the best choice. I was 13 and suddenly we were free.\n\nI was going to grow up after all. I'd reach adulthood, earn a living, eventually die ― it was a lot to come to terms with. I wasn't condemned to eternal life in Paradise after all.\n\nCourtesy of Drago Bee I'd always been fascinated with stories about captivity, authority and punishment, but I hadn't dreamed that it might be a bona fide sexual desire that others shared.\n\nMy parents joined a run-of-the-mill evangelical church, and while I found it preferable to the JWs because the services were blessedly less frequent, I remained unconvinced of its beliefs. If the JWs could be wrong, so could everyone else. Perhaps, if other people's rules were not to be trusted, I should make up my own rules for my own life.\n\nIt took me three more years to wake up to the idea of applying myself properly to my schoolwork. I realized I wasn't likely to become a ballerina (I'm 6′2″) or a model or a fictional Victorian detective, so at 16, I started doing homework and studying for exams for the first time in my life. I turned out to be good at it. Almost overnight I became a straight-A student. I was offered a spot at a London drama school and I took it.\n\nFour years after graduating, I stumbled into an underground art gallery in London and found myself standing amongst life-sized bondage sculptures. An artist approached me and it turned out that 9-year-old me had been right ― I could be a model after all. Specifically, a BDSM model. I'd always been fascinated with stories about captivity, authority and punishment, but I hadn't dreamed that it might be a bona fide sexual identity that others shared.\n\nThe JWs had taught me that almost everything a person could want was wrong. Especially anything sexual. Gay sex? Wrong. Oral sex? Wrong. Masturbation? Wrong. Sex outside marriage? Wrong. They hadn't seen fit to counsel us on whether modeling bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism was wrong too, but I could figure it out. It'd be wrong. But if it was what I wanted to do (and it was), I realized I could decide for myself how to approach it in a way that I could be proud of.\n\nCourtesy of Hywel Phillips / RestrainedElegance.com If I wanted to produce BDSM images, I needed to also be a good friend to other women and to be the best feminist I could.\n\nBe honest, I thought. I wanted to represent my sexuality truthfully. I was tall and statuesque, so people wanted to cast me as a domme, but I was submissive. I only accepted work if it represented who I was, not what people wished I were. It paid off. After being turned down for submissive roles early on, I discovered that by publishing reviews of shoots I'd enjoyed, producers who subsequently booked me would know more about the things I liked and could do well.\n\nConsequently, my work reflected me. The more I shared of myself with others, the more it encouraged the people I encountered to share their stories with me. I made the best friends I'd had in my life, especially compared with my JW friendships, where we'd all been intent on not showing weakness or vulnerability, lest we be judged.\n\nDo no harm, I thought. I wanted to put work into the world that portrayed male dominance and female submission. I was worried about the impact it would have on people who found the images disturbing. I realized I needed everyone to know that it only represented my sexual tastes, not my worldview. If I wanted to produce BDSM images, I needed to also be a good friend to other women and to be the best feminist I could.\n\nLeave things better than you found them, I thought. As I got older and started hiring performers for my own productions, I tried to be the fairest and kindest employer that I could be. I paid everyone equally and factored performers' interests into my shoot plans. I decided to help every new model I encountered to navigate the industry safely. I eventually set up a YouTube channel dedicated to this.\n\nI couldn't be perfect and I couldn't earn a place in Paradise. My own expectations were less grand but still meaningful to me. I tried to be honest, to do no harm, to leave people in a better state for having known me. With this in my mind, I was relatively unmoved by occasional poor reactions from family members to my career. I was a pornographer of sorts, but being an ethical pornographer is something I will never feel ashamed of. And 9-year-old me would be flabbergasted to discover that we can work hard when we know we're shaping our own future. I can't imagine she'd be ashamed of me. I want to call back through the years and tell her she will be a model after all ― and that it would probably be useful if she paid some attention to her multiplication tables.\n\nCourtesy of Ariel Anderssen The author with her husband, Hywel Phillips, in Wales, where they now live.\n\nSeventeen years later, I'm still a BDSM model and filmmaker, married to a bondage photographer, and happily atheist ― no eternity for me. I acknowledge that growing up in an apocalyptic sect was perhaps not the most healthy start to life. Yet I cannot regret the things that I learned and unlearned as a Jehovah's Witness and then ex-Jehovah's Witness.\n\nFirstly, my life truly exceeds my expectations every day. I didn't think I'd ever earn money for myself, have a bank account, own a home, fall in love, get married. I was told I'd stop aging when Armageddon came and I'd be a teenager forever. Growing up ― and growing older ― comes with inconveniences, illnesses and fears. But they're also privileges of a sort, as is the whole human experience, complete with joy, grief and challenges to overcome.\n\nHaving spent my childhood feeling there was no point in excelling at anything, I learned that there is every point. You are the captain of the ship that is your life and working hard will make you a better captain ― your voyage will be more rewarding for it. God will not fix it for me so that I can live in a log cabin with a tame lion in the backyard. If I want a cabin, and indeed a backyard, I will have to earn it with my own skills. Believing in Armageddon's imminence, childhood me felt nothing I wanted was possible. In contrast, now I feel as though everything is possible. But I'll have to get it for myself. The independence remains intoxicating.\n\nDeath is tricky. I was brought up to believe that I'd never die. Coming to terms with the idea of my own eventual death, and that of everyone I love, was difficult at age 13. As Jehovah's Witnesses, we saw our current existence as a sort of warmup ― a qualifying stage, perhaps. The main event would be Paradise. But now, I recognize that I probably have just one shot at life. Everything I want to achieve, I must do now, because there likely isn't another chance. The people whom I want to feel loved by me, I must love them now, as completely as I can. I remember those elderly Jehovah's Witness ladies, waiting forever for Paradise, not marrying, not having careers or children. I will not wait for Paradise. I am making my own right now.\n\nAriel Anderssen is a classically trained actress and submissive BDSM model, filmmaker and writer based in the U.K. You can find her on Twitter at @ArielAnderssen.

Actor Colin Firth's wife, Livia Giuggioli, an Italian movie producer and director, has confirmed she had an affair with the man she's now accusing of stalking her and her husband.\n\nThe Firths, who've been together for over two decades, apparently separated for a short while a couple years back. During this time, Giuggioli began an affair with lifelong friend and journalist Marco Brancaccia, who has launched a frightening campaign of harassment against the pair, who have since gotten back together, the couple's representative said Friday.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the Firths have never had any desire to make this matter public. A few years ago Colin and Livia privately made the decision to separate. During that time Livia briefly became involved with former friend Mr. Brancaccia. The Firths have since reunited, a representative for the actor told HuffPost Friday in a statement.\n\nThe statement comes after reports about the allegations were made public due to leaked court documents, which possibly stem from the indictment against Brancaccia made by Italian prosecutors after the Firths lodged a harassment complaint.\n\nSubsequently, Mr. Brancaccia carried out a frightening campaign of harassment over several months, much of which is documented, the statement continued. As a consequence of his stalking, threats and refusal to desist, the legal complaint was lodged with the Italian authorities.\n\nThe couple is based in London, but the Firths also have a home in Umbria, Italy.\n\nBrancaccia, who works for the ANSA news agency, is now the subject of an Italian police investigation. He has denied the allegations and accused Giuggioli of fabricating the stalking claims to cover up the affair, which he says occurred between 2015 and 2016.\n\nWe were romantically involved, she wanted to leave Colin for me, he said in a statement to The Times published Friday morning. He added that the couple's marriage had been over for years.\n\nBrancaccia went on to claim that he only sent two WhatsApp messages to Giuggioli, as well as an email detailing the affair to Firth, who he describes as understanding.\n\nIn a year she sent me hundreds of messages of love, photos and videos, even a diary, he added.\n\nFirth and Giuggioli share two children together Luca, 16 and Matteo, 15. The Oscar-winner also has another son, from a previous relationship to actress Meg Tilly.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Colin Firth and Meg Tilly were married. They were not.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Orson Bean, the witty actor and comedian, was hit and killed by a car in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was 91.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Coroner's office confirmed Bean's Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a traffic-related fatality. The coroner's office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from local news outlets.\n\nA man was walking in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Brian Wendling initially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene.\n\nPolice were investigating and didn't identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.\n\nRichard Shotwell/Invision/AP Orson Bean appeared in a number of films and starred in several top Broadway productions, receiving a Tony nod for the 1962 Comden-Green musical Subways Are for Sleeping.\n\nBean enlivened such TV game shows as To Tell the Truth and played a crotchety merchant on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.\n\nHe appeared in a number of films — notably, Anatomy of a Murder and Being John Malkovich — and starred in several top Broadway productions, receiving a Tony nod for the 1962 Comden-Green musical Subways Are for Sleeping.\n\nBut fans remembered him most for his many TV appearances from the 1950s onward.\n\nMr. Bean's face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar, The New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, The Blue Angel. It said he showed a quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat.\n\nBorn in Burlington, Vermont, in 1928 as Dallas Frederick Burrows, he never lost the Yankee accent that proved a perfect complement to the dry, laconic storytelling that established him as popular humorist. He had picked the stage name Orson Bean because it sounded funny.\n\nHis father, George, was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union and Bean recalled later that his house was filled with causes. But he left home at 16 after his mother died by suicide.\n\nIn a 1983 New York Times interview, he recalled his early career in small clubs where the show consisted of me — master of ceremonies, comedian and magician — maybe a dog act, and a stripper. It was a piano player in one such club, he said, who suggested replacing Dallas Burrows with some funny name like Roger Duck — or Orson Bean.\n\nBean's quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on To Tell the Truth. The game required the panelists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a national catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said: Will the real (notable's name) please stand up?\n\nBean's style appealed to both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, and he appeared on The Tonight Show more than 200 times.\n\nBut his early career was hobbled for a time when he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist in the early years of the Cold War. Basically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend, he explained in a 2001 interview. I stopped working on TV for a year.\n\nThe blacklist didn't stop him in the theater. Bean starred on Broadway as a timid fan magazine writer in George Axelrod's 1955 Hollywood spoof Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? alongside Jayne Mansfield and Walter Matthau. He also starred on Broadway with Maureen O'Sullivan in Never Too Late and with Melina Mercouri in Illya Darling, based on her hit film Never on Sunday.\n\nBean took a break from his career for a time in the 1970s when he dropped out and moved to Australia, where he lived a hippie lifestyle. But he returned to the U.S. and — after a period as a self-described house-husband — resumed his career.\n\nI got sick of contemplating my navel and staring up at the sky and telling myself how wonderful it was not to be doing anything, he explained in a 1983 interview with The New York Times.\n\nIn the 1990s, he played the shopkeeper Loren Bray on the long-running drama Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. He remained active on the screen in recent years with guest shots in such shows as Desperate Housewives, How I Met Your Mother and Modern Family.\n\nMeanwhile, his politics turned more conservative. He became related to a leading right-wing commentator, Andrew Breitbart, when his daughter, Susannah, married him. Breitbart died in 2012 and Steve Bannon, later a top adviser to Donald Trump, took over Breitbart's eponymous website, for which Bean had penned occasional columns.\n\nBean wrote a memoir called Too Much Is Not Enough and a book about a non-traditional therapy called Me and the Orgone.\n\nHe had already shown his interest in non-traditional thinking in 1964 when he bought a building in Manhattan and opened up a school based on the philosophy of Summerhill, the progressive British school founded by A.S. Neill.\n\nI said to myself, we have to start with the children. Why not start a school? he told The New York Times. That same year, he co-founded the Sons of the Desert, an organization dedicated to comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, with chapters around the world.\n\nMore recently, income from Dr. Quinn and other voice and acting work allowed Bean to finance the Pacific Resident Theater Ensemble in Venice, where he appeared with his third wife, actress Alley Mills.\n\nHe had a daughter, Michele, from his first marriage to Jacqueline de Sibour, and sons Max and Ezekiel and daughter Susannah from his marriage to Carolyn Maxwell.\n\n―\n\nBob Thomas, a longtime and now deceased staffer of The Associated Press, was the principal writer of this obituary.
Benjamin Alire Sáenz endeared himself to a generation of young adult readers with his seminal 2012 novel, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe. Nine years later, the award-winning author and poet will make good on his promise to further the adventures of his gay protagonists when he unveils that book's much-anticipated sequel this fall.\n\nHuffPost got an exclusive first look at the cover for Aristotle and Dante Dive Into the Waters of the World, due out Oct. 12. Artists Mark Brabant and Sarah Jane Coleman, who previously collaborated on Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, have reprised their duties.\n\nSimon & Schuster Aristotle and Dante Dive Into the Waters of the World is due out Oct. 12.\n\nAristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe follows two Mexican American teens, Aristotle Ari Mendoza and Dante Quintana, who meet at a local swimming pool in the summer of 1987. Once Dante confides that he is gay, Ari begins to question his own sexuality as the friendship intensifies. Soon, a troubling act of violence forces the teen boys to confront their burgeoning feelings for one another. The book received glowing reviews and a number of honors, including the Lambda Literary Award for LGBTQ inclusivity and the Pura Belpré Award for Latino cultural excellence.\n\nPicking up where its predecessor left off, Aristotle and Dante Dive Into the Waters of the World finds Ari and Dante navigating the intricacies of maintaining a relationship. This time, however, they must also grapple with the era-defining impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost, Sáenz acknowledged that Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe was published at a perfect time when the public discourse around marriage equality was ramping up. By contrast, the sequel will be released as the world continues to reel from the devastation of the COVID-19 crisis. In fact, the pandemic motivated the author ― whose works also include 2004's Sammy and Juliana in Hollywood and 2017's The Inexplicable Logic of My Life ― to commit to the long-gestating project.\n\nElisabetta A. Villa/Getty Images It's not so difficult to fall in love, said Sáenz, seen here in 2014. The real work is staying in love.\n\nI wanted to write for the young people living through this time and say something important to them ― something that matters, said Sáenz, who is based in Texas. It's not only the pandemic that makes us feel isolated. It's also our politics and our hate and our bigotry and our racism that work to disconnect us from each other. But these terrible and powerful discourses will not succeed if we stay in solidarity with one another and if we stay true to the beauty that resides within us all.\n\nAs to what readers can expect from the new book, the author kept mum on specifics. Still, he added, It's not so difficult to fall in love. The real work is staying in love.
I was thrilled to read an advance copy of my friend Aidan Donnelley Rowley's The Ramblers, and I'm even more delighted to jump on the table in support of this book.\n\nIt. Is. So. Wonderful.\n\nI read The Ramblers in one delicious gulp last fall and I haven't been able to stop thinking about (or texting Aidan about) the characters since. The three protagonists, Clio an ornithologist who carries deep scars from growing up with a mentally ill mother, her best friend from Yale, Smith, who comes from one of New York's perfect and hugely wealthy families and is recovering from the sudden end of the engagement that she thought would begin her own happily ever after, and Tate, a college classmates of theirs who has returned to New York in the wake of his marriage ending and his company's highly lucrative sale.\n\nClio, Smith, and Tate tell their stories in interwoven chapters and their lives are both absolutely their own and inextricably connected. Each chapter opens with an epigraph, a practice I love in books. The first voice we hear is Clio's, and the use of Charles Darwin's words, if we expect to suffer, we are anxious, sets the stage for a book that is by turns about anxiety and fear, discomfort and adaptation, where we come from and where we're going.\n\nWe learn early on that Clio's mother was bipolar. This fact is at the complicated knot at the center of Clio's life, and her relationships with her boyfriend and her father both exist in its shadow. Her work studying the adaptation of birds, her discomfort really letting her older boyfriend know her, and her passionate attachment to the Ramble, a section of Central Park from which the book takes its name, are all important threads that run throughthe book.\n\nSmith, so structured and fond of order that she runs her own company which helps people declutter and organize their lives, has recently faced the most disorienting disruption she could have imagined. Her fiance, with whom she had planned and envisioned her future, walked away suddenly. In the wake of this loss Smith is working to determine to find her footing in a life that looks nothing like she imagined.\n\nTate, a photographer with a soulful love of poetry, recently sold an app that he founded with a friend for $40 million dollars. His wife also decided that their marriage was over. He has returned to New York after this abrupt turn of events and is, in many ways like Smith, trying to determine what he truly wants to do now.\n\nClio is the central character of The Ramblers. All three central protagonists are compelling, but for me it was Clio's themes that formed the book's animating core. Her mother haunts the narrative, and we hear her voice in the form of a letter towards the end. In their own ways, though, all three characters struggle to define themselves apart from strong family legacies. Clio's mother's bipolar is the clearest example of this, but both Smith and Tate also wrestle with where they're from.\n\nThis is the way it works. No one emerges from childhood totally unscathed. You do the best you can. And, if you are lucky, you find someone to do the best you can with.\n\nAll three of the main characters are, we see clearly, ramblers. Towards the end of the book, in a Clio's notes on a walk in the Ramble, she muses Maybe that is the point after all? To be lost? Clio, Smith, and Tate are all in their thirties, true adults, and all three reckon with this reality. It's time to make personal and professional decisions, and the questions that Clio, Smith, and Tate face beat through the book like a pulse.\n\nWho am I? Who do I love? What do I want to do with my life? Who do I want to do it with?\n\nI can't recommend The Ramblers more highly: the book is gorgeously written, deeply moving, and stays with you long after you finish it.\n\nThis review first appeared on Lindsey's blog, A Design So Vast.\n\nYou can also find Lindsey on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
One year ago, I attended my sister and her girlfriend's wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony that took place among fragrant pine trees in the mountains of Montana — but that's not what I remember most about it. What I remember is witnessing pure joy in the countenance of someone I care for deeply, someone who has been through immense pain and many trials, someone who is finally living her truth.\n\nI was born into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or Mormon church) and was an active member for most of my life. There are many things that I love about the LDS church. It's where I was taught that people should love one another. It's where I learned about the value of honesty, integrity and the importance of helping others. It's where I was taught never to judge another person and that we are all flawed. Living the life of an active member worked for me, but that was partly because all the people I loved most fit the mold of a church member the same way that I did ... until they didn't.\n\nAlthough I have always struggled with the church's hard-line stance against homosexuality and same-sex marriage and believed myself to be one who doesn't discriminate, I was naive. Naive because it was easy to say, I can love someone and not agree with their lifestyle, which was something I had heard spoken often in church. The reality is I had never experienced same-sex attraction or even witnessed anyone close to me experience it, so it was easy for me to say that I didn't agree with it.\n\nA turning point for my sister and my faith came after the horrific shooting that took place at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on June 12, 2016, where 49 people lost their lives. The senseless violence had a profound impact on my sister, who saw herself in those targeted for being different. She sent our entire family a heartfelt message the following day. She told us that she was gay and ready to live her truth. The news shifted something deep inside me. Up until that point, my life had mirrored my sister's in many ways. We both married men in our early 20s, and we both had three sons. My sister was now divorced, and I had watched her suffer through many challenges. I had also witnessed her close connection to another woman, whom she had described as her best friend, developing for many years. I often wondered if their relationship could be more than friendship, but as an even more devout church member than I ever was, she had never revealed her true feelings for her girlfriend to our family, and she steered us away from conjecture.\n\nAlthough I have always struggled with the church's hard-line stance against homosexuality and same-sex marriage and believed myself to be one who doesn't discriminate, I was naive.\n\nHer confession and subsequent marriage shook my faith ― a faith that had already been wavering. At the time, I was attending church infrequently. My husband had left the church, and I found myself struggling with many doubts and questions. In truth, when I did attend church, it was more for my children than for me. I told myself that it was good for them to go because it was the way my husband and I were raised and because I have always believed the most important lessons I learned in church were taught to me in the children's primary program.\n\nThe church also offered them the opportunity to make many friends in our community, but then they began to ask questions. They wondered if their dad was bad because he no longer went to church, and I knew that one day they would have questions about their aunts as well. I began to realize that I was no longer comfortable with all the messages they were receiving from the church and wasn't sure if the positive things they were learning there truly outweighed the negative.\n\nBefore coming out, my sister and her girlfriend were very active members of the church. In fact, they were completely devoted to their faith and accepted any calling (or voluntary position) that was asked of them, and they visited the temple multiple times a month.\n\nHearing their stories of pain, the pain of attempting to put aside their feelings for each other, moved me deeply and made me wonder. If two people that devoted were not worthy to be members after coming to an acceptance of who they are, as the Mormon church declared, what did that mean for someone like me? Mostly it broke my heart. I happen to be blessed in a very happy marriage and cannot imagine living a life in which I was told that it was sinful for us to be together. I can't comprehend having to choose between the church I love and the person I love, and I won't judge another who is forced to make that decision.\n\nAfter my sister's wedding, she received a letter of excommunication from the LDS church. I do not hold blame or ill will towards the church, she told me. They have to decide what they stand for, and I can respect that. But I can also hold my boundaries, which has given me so much peace in my life.\n\nI happen to be blessed in a very happy marriage and cannot imagine living a life in which I was told that it was sinful for us to be together.\n\nThat is what I have noticed most in her over the last year ― that she is at peace, a peace that I am striving for as well. She has let go of the pain and shame, as she described it, of trying to live as a church member. She said the church made her feel as though God's love were conditional upon her doing or being something. It seems to be a consistent issue I've noticed with religion. The spiritual can get lost in the specific aspects of worship, with the faithful feeling they need to complete a checklist for worthiness rather than focus on basic principles and what really matters.\n\nTruthfully, I'm in a complicated place with my faith. I have found that I am no longer comfortable attending a church that I feel turned its back on my sister. A funny thing happens when you take a step back from a church that plays such a central part in its members' lives. You begin to question everything. You strip away all you thought you knew to be true and must dare to ask yourself, What do I really believe? It's a place of uncertainty and even fear.\n\nFor now, I am trying to focus on being more spiritual, as opposed to religious. As a friend and church member recently told me, You don't have to go to church to be a good person. I haven't been to church in a long time, a decision that has been both liberating and painful. When you stop attending the Mormon church, you get the label of inactive. You begin to lose friends and (in Utah especially) an entire community support system. It can be hurtful and has been confusing for my children.\n\nMost of my extended family members and my children's friends are active in the LDS church. That has been the hardest part for me as a mother. How do I navigate what will be best for my sons? I realized that I needed to be honest. I told them upfront that while I feel that there is a lot of good the church has to offer, I have stopped wanting to attend because of the church's stance on same-sex marriage. They have a close relationship with their aunt and were receptive to my message. I also told them that I would not take away their choice when it came to church and that I would drive them to church if they want to attend.\n\nMy upbringing may have taught me that a homosexual 'lifestyle' is wrong, but my life experience has changed my perception.\n\nOne thing I do know is that if they are not receiving the good messages I want them to learn from attending a church, it is up to me to make sure that they are learning them at home. I continue to pray with my children and encourage their spirituality.\n\nI am hoping to find my way, and it all keeps coming back to one thing: love. I witnessed love the day of my sister's wedding and every time I have been with them since. My sister is happier and healthier than she has ever been, and that has fundamentally changed me ― and the way I view religion. She is someone who I know I can always go to with any problems I face in my life and will be met with endless love and compassion. And that is what I want to offer to her and all LGBT people. I want them to know they are always welcome in my heart and my home. My upbringing may have taught me that a homosexual lifestyle is wrong, but my life experience has changed my perception.\n\nAttending my first same-sex wedding changed me, and ultimately it gave me more perspective. Perspective that I hope to pass on to my three boys by teaching them to love and accept everyone as they are and instill in them the valuable lessons that I was taught at church and outside church; everything else I hope to figure out in time.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story you want to share?

Luke Porter Grief\n\nWhen we lose someone we love, we feel grief. Grief is a natural feeling in response to loss. However, grief from our ego wounded self is entirely different than grief from our authentic self. This is because what we feel we have lost is different in the different states.\n\nGrief from the Wounded Self\n\nWhen our wounded self has predominated in an important relationship, the sense of loss might be terrifying. If you handed a part of yourself over to the other person to love, define, take care of and validate, then you will feel deeply abandoned when that person ends the relationship or dies. It will feel as if a part of you has been torn away and the feeling of inner emptiness might be extreme. Fear, anger, despair and grief become intertwined.\n\nThe grief of the wounded self is primarily for what you are no longer getting. The wounded self might be saying to the departed person, How could you leave me? How could you do this to me? Even if the loved one died rather than left the relationship, the remaining person might be angry at being left.\n\nIf it is a parent who died, the remaining child might have secretly hoped to finally get the love he or she never got from the parent as a child. The person might feel furious at the parent for dying without finally coming through with the desired love. This often occurs when people have not been a loving adult and learned to give themselves the love that they always hoped someone else would give to them.\n\nIf your wounded self spent much time withholding love, you might feel deep regret when you no longer have the opportunity to love. Regret is a difficult feeling. What is done is done, and you cannot go back and fix it. Regret might lead to despair when you realize you have forever lost the opportunity to express your love.\n\nWhen you haven't done the inner work to develop your loving adult self, it is the resulting inner abandonment that creates the fear and anger that may accompany the grief. Your inner child is terrified at feeling so alone and is angry at the adult for not being there. You feel alone in the loneliness, which may lead to despair. While loneliness is a natural feeling to feel when we have lost someone we love, you will feel alone in the loneliness when you have no loving adult self to nurture you through the loneliness.\n\nThe fear, anger, despair and grief from the wounded self can be a bottomless pit. Because the inner abandonment is ongoing when there is no loving inner adult, the sense of loss is ongoing. To the wounded self, it feels as if you can never recover from this loss. Until you decide to learn to be a loving adult and learn to take care of yourself, the feeling of loss and emptiness may continue.\n\nGrief from the Authentic Self\n\nGrief from the authentic Self does not include anger and fear. It is a deep sadness about no longer being able to give love and share love with the departed loved one. You miss this person, not just because of what he or she gave to you, but because you can no longer share your love in person. While you can certainly continue to send love to the departed loved one, it is not the same as sharing love in person, and so there is deep sadness and heartbreak.\n\nWhen you are showing up for yourself as a loving adult in the face of loss, you will not feel abandoned, and therefore you will not feel the fear and anger that comes from inner abandonment. Anger at the departed person is actually a projection of one's own inner abandonment, and the fear is also a result of this inner abandonment. When you are taking care of yourself as a loving adult, there is no inner abandonment. When you operated in the relationship as a loving adult, openly sharing your love, you have no regrets and no despair that comes from not having loved.\n\nWhile loss is always challenging, when your loving adult is in charge you will not feel alone in your loneliness. You will be there for your own feelings with kindness and compassion, allowing yourself to grieve when the grief comes up. While you may always feel sad when you think of your departed loved one, you will not feel empty, alone, angry or fearful when you are being a loving adult, compassionately embracing all of your feelings.\n\nStart learning to love yourself with our free Inner Bonding eCourse at http://www.innerbonding.com/welcome.\n\nConnect with Dr. Margaret on Facebook: Inner Bonding, and Facebook: SelfQuest.
Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are two-time co-stars who shared one other key thing in common at the Oscars on Sunday: their plus ones.\n\nNo, the Sweet November-starring duo did not arrive at the 92nd Annual Academy Awards together with Enya scoring their entrance, but instead, they each brought their mothers with them to the big show.\n\nJazzing up the red carpet with a special dose of love, Reeves and mom Patricia Taylor linked arms in complementary black-and-white suits, and also conducted press interviews together at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Yes, when E! Host Ryan Seacrest pushed Taylor for details about the Oscar presenter's upcoming The Matrix 4 reboot, well, mum is the word.\n\nNothing, said Taylor — a costume designer — during E!'s live red carpet broadcast about what she can say about the long-awaited sequel. [I can] only [talk] about 'The Matrix' one, two, and three.\n\nAmy Sussman via Getty Images Keanu Reeves with his mother Patricia Taylor at the Oscars on Sunday.\n\nTaylor certainly knew how to keep these secret Hollywood details under wraps, proving few can make a judgment call better than moms. Still, this is one of the first public appearances for the pair since the 2006 premiere of Reeves' film The Lake House in Los Angeles.\n\nSo, perhaps that's one of the reasons why outlets like The Hollywood Reporter briefly confused Taylor for the Toronto-raised Toy Story 4 actor's girlfriend, visual artist Alexandra Grant. Last November, the 47-year-old Grant's likeness was compared to Dame Helen Mirren. Mirren is 74 years old.\n\nComedian Whitney Cummings summed up this identification confusion best:\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter confusing Keanu's mom with his gf... @WhitneyCummings nailed it. pic.twitter.com/tvAK4Qa1G8 — Bridget Phetasy (@BridgetPhetasy) February 10, 2020\n\nMistaken identity aside, attending the Oscars as a presenter is a really big deal. A nomination is an even bigger honour, and Best Actress nominee Theron had a Bombshell of her own, telling E!'s Giuliana Rancic that her mom's presence alone is worthy of a trophy.\n\nI win the award for best date, for sure, said Theron.\n\nVALERIE MACON via Getty Images Charlize Theron with her mom, Gerda Maritz.\n\nTheron and her mother, Gerda Jacoba Aletta Maritz, go beyond the traditional mother-daughter roles, too, and actually co-parent the Atomic Blonde star's two children, Jackson and August.\n\nIn 2018, Theron spoke of their dynamic to Elle magazine, saying, To not acknowledge her in co-parenting my children would be a lie ... I would feel pretty alone if I didn't have a partner-in-crime in all of this.\n\nAll the more reason for a double night out, then! Dressed in midnight blue, a harmonious hue to Theron's onyx Dior Haute Couture gown, Maritz was spotted savouring the Oscars experience inside the telecast.\n\nMaritz joined Theron and the rest of the front row VIPs to cheer on the Parasite cast and crew to continue their Best Picture acceptance speeches after the allotted 45-second time in order to further reflect on their historic wins.\n\nAnd then there's the three generations represented by newly-minted Oscar winner, Laura Dern.\n\nDern won her first little gold man for Best Supporting Actress in Marriage Story on Sunday, and reveled in her accolade by having proud mom Diane Ladd, as well as her two children, Jaya and Ellery Harper, by her side.\n\nKevork Djansezian via Getty Images Laura Dern with her mother, Diane Ladd, and her kids Ellery Harper and Jaya Harper, at the Oscars on Sunday.\n\nSome say, never meet your heroes, said Dern, while clutching her first Oscar in hand on the eve of her 53rd birthday.\n\nBut, I say, if you are really blessed you get them as your parents. I share this with my acting heroes, my legends, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern. You got game! I love you … thank you all for this gift; the best birthday present ever.\n\nThe perfectly-timed cutaway shot of a tearful Diane Ladd, an Oscar nominee herself, gave Dern's golden moment an extra boost of sentimental and significant maternal energy.\n\nSome say, never meet your heroes.

The man who literally wrote the book on how to talk to anyone, anytime, anywhere has died.\n\nLarry King, the legendary TV host and radio personality recognized by his trademark suspenders and black-rimmed glasses, died Saturday morning at the age of 87 after a weekslong battle with COVID-19. He was hospitalized with the disease in late December. He had several health scares in recent years, including multiple heart attacks, a lung cancer diagnosis and a stroke.\n\nKing died at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The news was announced with profound sadness on his official Twitter account by the company he co-founded, Ora Media:\n\nFor 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster, read the statement.\n\nLarry always viewed his interview subjects as the true stars of his programs, and himself as merely an unbiased conduit between the guest and audience, it continued. Whether he was interviewing a U.S. president, foreign leader, celebrity, scandal-ridden personage, or an everyman, Larry liked to ask short, direct, and uncomplicated questions. He believed concise questions usually provided the best answers, and he was not wrong in that belief.\n\nCNN President Jeff Zucker paid tribute to King, describing him as the scrappy young man from Brooklyn with a history-making career.\n\nWe are so proud of the 25 years he spent with CNN, where his newsmaker interviews truly put the network on the international stage, Zucker said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nKing was best known for his two-and-a-half decade run as the raspy-voiced host of Larry King Live, CNN's longest-running program and one of its most-watched.\n\nHe rose above personal tragedy, financial despair and half a dozen divorces to become one of the most revered and prolific interviewers in broadcasting.\n\nKing was the recipient of numerous accolades during his life, including several Cable ACE Awards, Peabody Awards and lifetime achievement awards. Most recently, he hosted the talks shows Larry King Now and Politicking With Larry King on Hulu, OraTV and RT America.\n\nSGranitz via Getty Images Larry King on Larry King Live at CNN Studios in Hollywood, California, in 2003.\n\nKing was born Larry Harvey Zeiger on Nov. 19, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised in an Orthodox Jewish household by his parents, Jennie Zeiger (nee Gitlitz), a garment worker from Lithuania, and Aaron Zeiger, a restaurant owner from Ukraine. He had a young brother named Marty.\n\nKing was 9 years old when his father died suddenly of a heart attack, forcing his mother to go on welfare. Soon after, the family packed up its home in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood and moved roughly seven miles southwest to a tiny attic apartment in Bensonhurst.\n\nLarry King was a baseball fanatic from a young age and spent his childhood idolizing the Brooklyn Dodgers and fantasizing about broadcasting their games one day. He later became a die-hard New York Yankees fan after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles.\n\nKing lost interest in school following his father's death, barely finished high school and never enrolled in college. He became a self-proclaimed radio freak, spending countless hours listening to broadcasts of baseball games to help fill a void left by his father's death.\n\nBy the time I was in junior high school, I already knew. You could see it in the school yearbook, King wrote in his 2009 bestselling autobiography, My Remarkable Journey. They asked me what I wanted to be, and I told them: a radio announcer.\n\nYouTube King appeared on a 1961 episode of Miami Undercover when he was 27.\n\nAt 23, King took a train to Miami to pursue his dream of working in broadcasting. He landed his first radio job at WAHR (now WMBM), helping to clean and to perform administrative tasks at the small station.\n\nThe aspiring broadcaster got his big break a few weeks later when a morning disc jockey suddenly quit, and King was tapped to fill the open spot.\n\nMoments before going on air for the first time, the station manager called him into his office to suggest his new host drop Zeiger in favor of a less ethnic last name. And so on May 1, 1957, he made his radio debut as Larry King. (He didn't change his name legally until 1959.)\n\nKing gained notoriety after making the switch to local station WKAT, where his morning radio show was broadcast live from a Jewish deli called Pumpernick's. The show started out by airing interviews with restaurant patrons or staff members before reeling in enough listeners to attract big names such as Bobby Darin and Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nThe Pumpernick's spot created more opportunity for King to pick up other local gigs, including a weekly interview show at a small TV station and a column in the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter bouncing around local radio and TV stations, King's reign as one of Miami's most regarded figures came crashing down in 1971 when he was arrested on grand larceny charges.\n\nKing's arrest followed years of poor personal finance decisions in the 1960s that left him nearly broke. When his imprisoned friend gave him thousands of dollars to pass along to a law firm on his behalf, King decided to pay off his own debts with the cash instead. He was slapped with the charges shortly after his former friend was released from prison.\n\nThough the case was eventually dismissed, King's employers dropped him anyway. It would be years before he was offered another gig in Miami.\n\nReuters Former President Bill Clinton on CNN's Larry King Live on Sept. 3, 2002.\n\nKing was working at Miami's WIOD radio station in 1977 when he received the call that would launch his career to the national stage. Ed Little, then president of the Mutual Broadcasting System radio network, offered him his own all-night national radio talk show.\n\nFrom midnight to 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time every weeknight until its final broadcast in 2010, King interviewed guests and took questions from callers. The show won a Peabody Award in 1982 and captured the attention of listeners across the country, including media mogul Ted Turner.\n\nIn 1985, Turner hired King to host a nightly hourlong TV show on CNN, which had launched in 1980. The opportunity would be a defining moment in King's career.\n\nLarry King Live hosted hordes of celebrities — U.S. presidents, world leaders, entertainers and athletes — in the 25 years the show was on the air.\n\nKing interviewed nearly everyone worth noting in more than 6,000 episodes of Larry King Live, which averaged more than 1 million viewers nightly.\n\nThe tenacious interviewer earned Larry King Live a Peabody Award in 1992, the same year billionaire Ross Perot announced his presidential bid on the show.\n\nA 1993 episode featuring a debate between Perot and Al Gore won the title of CNN's most-watched segment until 2015.\n\nKing was often criticized for throwing out softball questions, though he denied this was intentional. He preferred his interviews to develop organically, adopting a more conversational style rather than sticking to a script or preparing a set of questions, he said.\n\nYou've got to know basics, he wrote in his autobiography. But if you have the time to draw people out, I find it's better to know very little. You can always get into the whos, whats, and whys. It's not only better than knowing too many of the whos ― it's more fun.\n\nHis unthreatening style appealed to guests and scored him countless interviews with people who would otherwise skip journalists who would pose more aggressive questions. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd once called his show the resort area of American journalism.\n\nKing was drawn to celebrity gossip, sometimes devoting the bulk of a segment to a scandal rather than to serious news coverage. His show received record-high ratings during the infamous O.J. Simpson slow-speed chase on a Los Angeles freeway in a white Bronco.\n\nLarry King Live covered the former NFL star's arrest and double-murder trial extensively, and King scored Simpson's first interview after he was acquitted.\n\nWatch King discuss Perot's presidential announcement below:\n\nKing shied away from revealing his political leanings for most of his broadcasting career. He briefly abandoned this position when he came out in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nLarry King Live ran until December 2010, earning the title of CNN's longest-running program of all time. In January 2011, British journalist Piers Morgan took over King's time slot with Piers Morgan Tonight. (Morgan's show was dropped from the network in 2014.)\n\nBesides the Peabodys, King also won GLAAD Media's Vanguard Award in 1999 and was honored with two lifetime achievement awards: One at the 2011 News & Documentary Emmy Awards and again in 2015 from the Association for International Broadcasting.\n\nKing was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1992. He earned a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame in 1997.\n\nFred Prouser/Reuters King with his plaque after his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was unveiled May 8, 1997.\n\nKing also earned numerous honorary degrees from universities, including Brooklyn College, George Washington University and Columbia University.\n\nHe was a prolific writer, authoring more than 20 books, including a novel, a children's book and his autobiography.\n\nHe made cameos in dozens of TV series and movies, including Ghostbusters, Contact and Enemy of the State. He also provided the voice of Doris the Ugly Stepsister in three installments of the Shrek animated film series.\n\nKing suffered multiple heart attacks in the decades leading up to his death. He was a heavy smoker but never touched a cigarette again after his first heart attack in 1987. After receiving quintuple bypass heart surgery in 1988, King founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation to help patients afford expensive treatments associated with heart-related illnesses.\n\nMichael Tullberg via Getty Images King speaks at the Heart & Soul: An Evening of High Comedy and Low Cholesterol benefit for the Larry King Cardiac Foundation on Nov. 7, 2009, in West Hollywood, California.\n\nKing wasn't shy about his love of women and sex. He was known for making numerous trips to the altar, tying the knot eight times over his lifetime ― twice to the same woman.\n\nKing married his high school sweetheart, Freda Miller, at 19, though the couple's parents had the marriage annulled within a year.\n\nIn 1961, he married Annette Kaye, but the union ended months later. She gave birth to King's first child, Larry King Jr., in 1961. The elder King never knew Kaye was pregnant and didn't know he had a son until 1994, when King Jr. reached out to him at the request of his dying mother.\n\nPlayboy Bunny Alene Akins became King's third wife soon after his split from Kaye. King adopted Akins' son, Andy, from a previous marriage. The couple divorced in 1963. They remarried in 1968, had a daughter, Chaia King, and divorced again in 1971.\n\nIn between King's two marriages to Akins, he married (and subsequently divorced two years later) fourth wife Mickey Sutphin. They had a daughter, Kelly, who would be adopted by Sutphin's next husband.\n\nKing married his fifth wife, Sharon Lepore, in 1976. By 1983, the marriage had fizzled. He met and married his sixth wife, Julie Alexander, in 1989, before separating the following year.\n\nKing's seventh wife was his last. He met actress and singer Shawn Southwick in front of the Tiffany's in Beverly Hills, California, in 1996 and married her the following year. They had their first son, Chance, in 1999 and another son, Cannon, in 2000.\n\nThe couple filed for a divorce in 2010 but reconciled after three months. But the marriage came to an end nearly a decade later when King filed for a divorce in 2019, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nJason LaVeris via Getty Images King with his seventh wife, Shawn Southwick, and sons Cannon King and Chance King at a party for the final broadcast of Larry King Live on Dec. 16, 2010, in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nDeath was a subject King thought about deeply in his later years. Though he was raised Jewish, he declared himself an atheist during various interviews on his shows.\n\nBecause he didn't believe in an afterlife, he told The New York Times in a 2015 profile, he had arranged to be cryogenically frozen and hoped scientists could later revive him with the help of future advancements in modern medicine.\n\n''I can't get my head around one minute being there and another minute absent,'' he told the Times before cooly describing his ideal funeral. I would like the ceremony to begin, 'Today we are honoring a 160-year-old man who was caught in bed by an irate husband. And the funeral is late because it took six days to wipe the smile off his face.' ''\n\nKing is survived his sons Larry King Jr., Chance King and Cannon King. He is predeceased by his son Andy King and daughter Chaia King.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY RIP Celebs: Stars We Lost In 2020

Written By Angela Mujukian\n\nDon't follow all the other fish, make your own fish bowl!\n\nYes, it seems all too enticing, and we've all questioned our careers at one point or another.\n\nWhether we chose the right route, even though all the other ones seemed much easier and lavish, bearing more fruit. Questioning ourselves as to why we picked the road less traveled, which only leads to sleepless nights, debt, unemployment, stress beyond imaginable, further creating wrinkles and baggy eyes, peaked cortisol levels, and of course losing sight with all the things we love with family and friends, missing birthdays, engagements, weddings, graduations, etc., Replacing memories with stacks of loans on loans on loans which is not ideal nor the American Dream.\n\nYou 'think' you want marriage, a family and kids because social media is lurking at your doorstop every morning but it's just a plain mirage and illusion of success and the things you left behind that you did in fact did not want. However, this road leads us to be bitter, lashing out at others, and looking at the glass half-empty. Well, it's time to change your perspective, because you did choose the correct path of higher education and grad school to become a professional, it was the right choice -I promise. Although you may not see it yet or now in 2016, come back and read this article in hindsight in 2026 and you'll know that you made the right choice.\n\nHaving a professional career, as a woman, in the 21st century is more important i.e. going to college and graduate school than dropping out and becoming a Fashionista on Instagram. You can establish yourself FIRST, and hobbies and publishing books will eventually become a luxury in your thirties, forties, and even fifties. It will even come more naturally to you as you get older.\n\nEven though it feels like you haven't reaped the benefits or rewards -just yet, keep going! You won't feel satisfied or fulfilled for at least another five to ten years (har-har) but it's true!\n\nAlthough it seems so easy to travel the world, post a picture on Instagram of the #ootd and create a blog and get vendors and advertisers on your page and etc., And yes, point in fact, people do make careers out of it but becoming a doctor, lawyer, engineer, pharmacist, business woman, consultant, therapist, entrepreneur, etc., should not be looked down upon nor overlooked.\n\nIf it was easy--everybody would do it! Don't question if you picked the right career field, there was a reason you had so much passion to pursue it in the first place. Although we all want to have fun, and the idea of work hard, play hard has somewhat changed, in that MUAs, DJs, and Bloggers seems like all fun and games, it's not, it's just a wave or a cycle, that will soon pass, and eventually come crashing down, but that M.D., J.D., M.B.A., degree will still be there. Get that degree, first. Then decide if you want to be a MUA, blogger, or DJ and publish a book on the side and become an author.\n\nLife is fun and exciting now, with social media paving the avenue of success. But in 10 years from now, there is no guarantee that your blog nor make up clients will still be at your doorstep, this is why establishing a career first, is more important. A career, will give you that foundation, not necessarily that you'll always have a job you love but that you will have a legitimate job, and can still pursue other things you love. A career will be the stepping stone to pursuing other creative non-traditional jobs you love--like blogging and make up and DJs.\n\nGetting that business degree will allow you to maintain and manage the jobs you love and open up your own shop whether that's writing, traveling the world and public speaking, food, marketing, hairstyling, interior design, art, make-up, etc., But, get that degree, first and foremost! Establishing a career means creating a medium where success meets opportunity. By following your passions, establishing a career will enable a limitless amount of possibilities and design an outlet for personal and professional growth.\n\nAfter all, there's many fish in the sea of opportunity looking for a quick financial breakthrough NOW, but there's no guarantee it will last, nor be stable. In order to be safe, for long-term compliance, be the fish that is seeking the benefits of a home, real estate, investments in stock, retirement, and pension plans, not taking the easy way out and trying to make a quick buck like all the fish in the same fish bowl. Create your own fish bowl. Make it big! By taking the extra leap, extra investment in the hours of your career, extra hours of working hard, extra hours of studying, no matter the loans, to create your own fish bowl, to live in it's big, safe bubble, and stand out in the future.\n\nLA native, Angela Mujukian is a co-author of the best selling book series, 20 Beautiful Women: Volume 3 edition and a Medical Student at St. George's University School of Medicine.

Illustration: Rebecca Zisser; Photos: Getty A good night's sleep can do wonders for a relationship.\n\nJames* has been married for two decades, but it wasn't until a couple years ago that he and his wife started sleeping in different rooms.\n\n″[My wife] would constantly kick me awake to stop my snoring, then we would try to race each other back to sleep. Doing this 20 times a night meant no one was getting any decent sleep, he told HuffPost.\n\nIt may not be the traditional setup, but it works for them.\n\nWe have had a couple of friends say how they could never do this — it's against what marriage is about, James said. But let me tell you: Marriage is a lot better when everyone's well-rested and not grumpy.\n\nNot much research exists about couples who sleep apart at night. A 2005 National Sleep Foundation report found that 23% of couples opt for separate beds, although one 2017 survey put that number at 14%.\n\nMany people attach a stigma to this less conventional sleeping arrangement and assume it's a sign that a relationship is on the rocks. While some couples may sleep separately because of marital discord, it's often for a more practical reason like James and his wife: They just want a good night's sleep. Maybe one partner snores and the other is a light sleeper. Maybe they have different bedtimes and wake-up times. Perhaps one needs air conditioning or a fan blowing year-round, while the other is perpetually cold.\n\nWhatever the reason, these issues can get in the way of quality shut-eye — and that's not good for either partner.\n\nSleeping apart has its benefits.\n\nGetting good sleep on a regular basis is good for your mental and physical health, as well as the health of your relationship.\n\nWhen you're well-rested, you are generally a more patient, pleasant and loving version of yourself. When you're exhausted, you're more likely to wake up cranky and combative.\n\nA 2013 study from the University of California, Berkeley, confirmed what anyone in a relationship knows to be true: that couples tend to have more frequent and more severe fights after getting poor sleep. And if your partner is the reason you didn't sleep a wink, then it's really going to cause some friction.\n\nFeelings of resentment that build from lying awake each or most nights are destructive for a relationship, Jennifer Adams, author of Sleeping Apart Not Falling Apart, told Good Housekeeping. And dealing with those feelings of resentment when sleep-deprived is not recommended.\n\nSeparate bedrooms can help a relationship flourish because both partners are finally getting the sleep they need, Adams added.\n\nWhat's more, when you snooze in different rooms, you can each tailor your own sleeping conditions to your heart's content. James and his wife now keep their respective bedrooms at their preferred temperatures (76 degrees for her, 70 for him).\n\nWhen people learn about the couple's unorthodox sleeping arrangement, their first question is usually about how it's affected their sex life. Turns out, their sex life hasn't taken a hit ― it's actually improved.\n\nInstead of our evenings being tired all the time, we are able to have romance time more often, James said. And if we stay up late, it's not as hard to recover losing that sleep time as we sleep so much better apart.\n\nAs far as who goes where, it depends, he added. We sort of just follow each other into each other's bedrooms or slip back and forth whenever the mood strikes.\n\nLet me tell you: Marriage is a lot better when everyone's well-rested and not grumpy. - James\n\nFive years into their relationship, Kimberly* and her husband started sleeping separately after she sprained her ankle. She moves around a lot in her sleep, so she thought it would be better not to risk bumping it against him in bed. During this time, Kimberly said she and her husband discovered they actually got better sleep apart than they ever did together. So they kept it going.\n\nWe both snore and I'm a bed hog, even with a king-size bed, she told HuffPost. It works out pretty well, especially since we have different work schedules and I usually stay up later than him. I can go to bed at 2 or 3 in the morning without worrying that I'll wake him.\n\nHere's what to know if you're going to try it\n\nWhile this arrangement works well for some couples, for others, it may strain the relationship depending on why the couple decided to move to separate rooms in the first place.\n\nWhether it does damage to the relationship is found in the question of why they are sleeping apart: Do both partners agree to it? Is it temporary? Becky Whetstone, a marriage and family therapist, told HuffPost.\n\nFor example, if you and your spouse are sleeping apart so that your children or pets can sleep in the bed instead, that decision could potentially breed hostility down the line.\n\nIf you are choosing to be with your child over your mate, this says, 'I value my child over you,' Whetstone said. The partner left behind will almost always resent this. In a healthy marriage, your spouse comes first over your child, except in rare and temporary circumstances.\n\nIf you're contemplating sleeping in separate bedrooms simply to get better sleep, there are a few things to keep in mind so that the arrangement doesn't damage the relationship:\n\nFirst, figure out where the sleep issues stem from.\n\nGet to the root of the snoring, sleep talking, tossing and turning or insomnia. Enlist the help of a physician, sleep specialist or therapist who may be able to help you find a solution to the problem, whatever it may be.\n\nYour noisy or antsy partner could be suffering from a sleep disorder or anxiety problem that could be resolved through therapy, medication or behavioral interventions, which could result in each of you experiencing a restful night's sleep, clinical psychologist Ryan Howes told HuffPost.\n\nThat means you both can set a goal of sharing a bed again once the situation gets addressed.\n\nRecognize that sleeping together builds connection and intimacy, and not just sexual, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who specializes in men's counseling. Losing that time together requires an effort by both partners to make up that loss elsewhere.\n\nBe more intentional about intimacy.\n\nIt's still possible for couples who sleep apart to cultivate intimacy ― they just need to make more of an effort to do so.\n\nOne partner will need to join the other for cuddling, sex and other intimate expressions of love and desire, Howes said. They can trade off. Sleep may be a problem, but affection doesn't need to be sacrificed as well.\n\nBe willing to make adjustments.\n\nOne partner is often more in favor of separate rooms than the other, Smith said. So check in with your spouse regularly to make sure the set-up is still working for them. If not, be open to making some compromises.\n\nA couple I'm counseling right now has slept in separate bedrooms for a few years now. She thinks it's great because she gets a restful night's sleep, but he hates it because it's also killed their intimacy, Smith told HuffPost. To address this, we're negotiating a couple of nights a month when they do sleep together as well as more effort for physical touch, such as snuggling while watching a show together.\n\nKeep an open-door policy.\n\nYou don't need to actually leave the bedroom door ajar if you're a light sleeper, but your partner should know that they're welcome to come in any time.\n\nI'd recommend that partners not get too precious about 'my room' and 'your room' by restricting access or locking doors, Howes said. This can challenge the trust the relationship was founded on, raise suspicions and cause a partner to feel shut out or rejected.\n\nSync up your sleep schedules, if possible.\n\nGoing to bed and waking up at the same time can be tricky if the partners have different work hours or if one is a night owl and the other is an early bird. But do your best to make an effort.\n\nGiven how busy we all are, partners may struggle to find time to regularly connect with each other, and the loss of sleeping in the same bed just compounds this challenge, Smith said. I often hear couples describe their daily routines using the phrase like, 'ships passing in the night,' because they hardly see each other.\n\nExpect mixed reactions from others.\n\nNot everyone will understand your decision to sleep in separate bedrooms, and that's OK. Some people are envious, while others seem confused and say we just seem like roommates, Kimberly said.\n\nJames and his wife have received similar responses from their friends and family.\n\nIt's sort of funny because every time they find out, one of them gets a light in their eyes like they would love to do that, too, and the other one shoots it down, he said. I'll also say probably one out of 10 couples we know also have separate bedrooms for pretty much the same reasons we do.
Israel's highest court ruled Monday that people who convert to the Reform and Conservative movements of Judaism in Israel are Jewish in the eyes of the law and are entitled to Israeli citizenship.\n\nThe landmark decision from the High Court of Justice comes after 15 years of legal battles, and it challenges the near-monopoly that Israel's chief rabbinate holds over religious matters.\n\nThough the Reform and Conservative movements don't have large footprints in Israel, they are the two largest Jewish denominations in the U.S., which means the court's decision is a significant milestone for many Jewish Americans.\n\nRabbi Josh Weinberg, who leads the Association of Reform Zionists of America, told HuffPost that he believes the place of non-Orthodox Jews in Israel is one of the biggest wedge issues causing tension between North American Jews and the country.\n\nSebastian Scheiner/Associated Press The heads of the Jewish Reform and Conservative movements carry Torah scrolls as they march to the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City in 2016. Israel's Supreme Court on Monday bucked Israel's powerful Orthodox establishment when it ruled that people who convert to Judaism through the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel also are Jewish and entitled to become citizens.\n\nTo be able to see yourself recognized in the Jewish state ― this has been a particularly difficult and challenging issue for many years, Weinberg said.\n\nIt will be uplifting for Jewish movements in America to be able to tell members that we're moving in the right direction, despite some of the horrible opposition that we've encountered, he added.\n\nRabbi Jacob Blumenthal, CEO of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, the network linking Conservative congregations in North America, told HuffPost that Monday's decision affirms the pluralistic nature of Jewish life inside and outside of Israel.\n\nWe hope that it will also lead to true equality for all forms of Jewish life in Israel, including marriage, divorce, funding and other elements currently under the control of the ultra-Orthodox, Blumenthal said.\n\nLiberal-leaning strains of Judaism have clashed with Israel's chief rabbinate, which maintains jurisdiction over including religious rituals, such as marriage and conversions. The rabbinate, which is controlled by Haredi, or strictly observant, Jewish leaders doesn't recognize the validity of Reform and Conservative Judaism.\n\nReligious conversions matter in Israel because the country grants Jewish people certain immigration rights under the Law of Return. This law gives Jews around the world ― including people who convert to Judaism ― the right to live in Israel and gain citizenship. Since 1995, the Law of Return has applied to Reform and Conservative conversions that happen outside of Israel.\n\nThe restrictions on in-country conversions had the effect of questioning the legitimacy of non-Orthodox movements and was deeply insulting and alienating to our members, Blumenthal said.\n\nMENAHEM KAHANA via Getty Images An ultra-Orthodox Jewish man tries to prevent Anat Hoffman (center), the founder and president of Women of the Wall, and members of the liberal group from entering the women's section of the Western Wall while carrying a Torah scroll in Jerusalem in November 2016 during a protest by the group demanding equal prayer rights at the site.\n\nDavid Lau, one of the country's two chief rabbis, insisted Monday that people who convert through Reform Judaism or something similar are not Jewish.\n\nNo ruling by the Supreme Court this way or that way will change this fact, Lau said, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIsrael's Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, who leads a Haredi political party, said the court's decision will cause deep division and dissension in the country, The Time of Israel reported.\n\nI promise to amend the law so that only conversion according to Jewish law is recognized by the State of Israel, he said.\n\nBlumenthal, the Conservative movement leader, said he was worried that after Israel's upcoming elections, newly installed legislators could overturn the High Court ruling.\n\nThis would not only narrow the options of Jewish life in Israel but would further drive a wedge between the Jewish people living in Israel and in other parts of the world, he said.\n\nEven after Monday's ruling, marriages officiated by Reform and Conservative rabbis in Israel aren't recognized by the rabbinate ― and since Israel doesn't have an option for civil marriages, liberal-leaning Jewish couples often have to get married outside of the country.\n\nAnother long-standing source of tension is the fight over expanding mixed-gender prayer at the Western Wall. As it stands, the rabbinate does not approve of women reading aloud from the Torah and wearing religious garments while praying at Judaism's holiest site.\n\nIn order to convert in Israel, the Reform movement requires people to pursue a year of intensive religious study, commit to a Jewish lifestyle, and perform certain rituals, such as circumcision and immersion in a Jewish ritual bath, according to the Jerusalem-based Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), which has spent decades pursuing equal status for the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel.\n\nIRAC director Rabbi Noa Sattath told HuffPost that Reform and Conservative converts face uncertainty and severe discrimination in the country.\n\nMonday's court decision was a meaningful step in our journey towards equality, she said.\n\nWe are thrilled and elated, Sattath said. We hope this will begin a healing process in the rift that has existed in recent years between the Israeli government and our movements over our continued discrimination.
White supremacist Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) will have a Republican primary challenger next year.\n\nIowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced Wednesday that he will challenge King in the race to represent Iowa's 4th Congressional District in the House of Representatives.\n\nToday, Iowa's 4th District doesn't have a voice in Washington, because our current representative's caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table, Feenstra said in a statement announcing his candidacy. We don't need any more sideshows or distractions, we need to start winning for Iowa's families.\n\nFeenstra, a former emergency medical technician, is currently in his third term in the Iowa state Senate, where he serves as assistant majority leader.\n\nNews of his candidacy comes months after King narrowly secured a ninth consecutive term in Congress. King beat his Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, by only three percentage points. It was a remarkably close race for the deeply conservative district, which King had routinely won by over 20 points in previous elections, and which President Donald Trump carried by 27 points in 2016.\n\nKing's near defeat in November ended a year in which he gained national headlines for his embrace of white nationalism. King retweeted neo-Nazis and endorsed a white supremacist candidate. HuffPost also uncovered an interview he gave to an Austrian media outlet affiliated with Europe's neo-fascist identitarian movement.\n\nThroughout 2018, the GOP establishment was largely silent on King's white nationalism. Only after a poll in early November showed him neck and neck with Scholten did the National Republican Congressional Committee decide to denounce him. Corporate campaign donors, under public pressure for giving money to a racist, also ditched King.\n\nIt's clear Iowa Republicans are frustrated with King, but where's the line drawn? Democrat J.D. Scholten, who challenged King in 2018\n\nAfter the election, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), for whom King had served as campaign co-chair, distanced herself from the congressman.\n\nI think that Steve King needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else, and I think he needs to take a look at that, Reynolds said in November.\n\nScholten, the Democrat who lost to King, told HuffPost Wednesday that it's clear Iowa Republicans are frustrated with King, but where's the line drawn?\n\nThey've accepted and embraced him for so long, he said. I wish they would have been more vocal during the 2018 election cycle.\n\nWith little support from the state and national GOP, and with donors dropping him, King will likely face a tough race against Feenstra in next year's primary.\n\nKing seems to have anticipated the challenge. He announced last week that he would hold town halls in each of his district's 39 counties. The congressman had previously eschewed town halls for fear of the events being disrupted by protesters.\n\nKing's office did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on Feenstra's candidacy.\n\nAlthough Feenstra may not be as far-right as King, he is no moderate. He once spearheaded an effort to ban gay marriage in Iowa by constitutional amendment.\n\nFeenstra also appears to be a supporter of Trump. His campaign website encourages supporters to Help fulfill our promise to Make America Great Again!\n\nI am pleased to hear of anyone challenging Steve King for Congress, Kim Van Es, vice-chair of the Sioux County Democrats, told HuffPost in an email Wednesday. But based on Randy Feenstra's record, I doubt that he would fight for platform issues important to Sioux County Democrats, issues like affordable and accessible healthcare, gun violence prevention, immigration reform, and environmental protections.

Hi, readers!\n\nHolly Conroy is a transgender truck driver from the rural Australian town of Wagga Wagga. She first tried to come out as trans when she was 27, but her family and friends dissuaded her from doing so. After a five-year marriage to a woman, she came out again at 37, sharing the news with friends on social media.\n\nOnce I got good reactions on Facebook about coming out, that was a huge load off my shoulders, she told HuffPost Australia editor Alicia Vrajlal. Now she's planning a three-day Wagga Wagga Mardi Gras Festival, modeled after the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras — Australia's answer to Pride — that attracts hundreds of thousands of people each year.\n\nHolly's story is just one of many shared via HuffPost Australia's new Proud Out Loud series, which profiles people in the LGBTQ community whose voices aren't always heard, including Indigenous Australians, trans people, immigrant families and people from rural areas. The package of stories is an extension of HuffPost's 2019 Proud Out Loud initiative in other countries and comes shortly after Sydney won the bid for World Pride in 2023.\n\nReaders have embraced Holly's story, with plenty of circulation on LGBTQ Facebook groups and community hubs, Alicia told me, noting that the images with the piece reflected femininity in a male-dominated industry.\n\nHolly said her boss at a construction company was supportive when they first discussed her coming out and transitioning. Now she drives a truck for a different company, and her straight male colleagues attended the pride parade she organized last year.\n\nHolly is a pioneer in the trans community, senior editor Carly Williams told me. Rural Australia can be a tough place for LGBTQ people and Holly has been imperative in changing that.\n\nUntil next week,\n\nSara\n\nSara Bondioli, editor, HuffPost U.S.\n\nFollow Alicia (@LeeshieV) and Carly (@Williams__Carly) on Twitter.

HONG KONG (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Hong Kong property tycoon Cecil Chao offered $65 million to any man who could win over his lesbian daughter and make her straight, he inadvertently laid the ground for her to become one of Asia's most prominent gay rights campaigners.\n\nThe bizarre reward in 2012 grabbed international headlines and his daughter, Gigi Chao, was bombarded with thousands of marriage proposals from across the world – from war veterans to a body double of George Clooney in a sports movie.\n\nIt was the first time the issue of acceptance of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community had played out in such high-profile way in Hong Kong – a city modern in many ways but where social attitudes remain conservative.\n\nI am glad it happened, Gigi Chao told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the office of her property firm is housed in Hong Kong's third-tallest skyscraper overlooking the city's harbor.\n\nAFP Contributor via Getty Images Gigo Chao is the most recognizable face campaigning for LGBTQ rights in Hong Kong.\n\nIt has been able to put a comic spin on a topic that is often marred by a lot of tragedies and taboos, said the 38-year-old, wearing a sparkly rainbow-colored jacket.\n\nThe elder Chao - whose property empire invests in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia - put the $65 million marriage bounty on his daughter's head after she entered into a civil partnership with her girlfriend in France in early 2012.\n\nAfter failing to find any suitors, the 81-year-old billionaire doubled the offer to HK$1 billion ($127 million) in 2014.\n\nThis prompted Chao to pen an open letter published in Hong Kong newspapers which said: Dear daddy, you must accept I'm a lesbian and urged him to treat her partner like a normal, dignified human being.\n\nSuch a public feud in a well-known family would have been remarkable anywhere but was particularly unusual in Asia when no country in the region at that time recognised same-sex marriage.\n\nIt was only last year that the Taiwan's constitutional court paved the way for the island to become the first place in Asia with gay marriage after it ruled in favor of same-sex unions.\n\nToday Chao is not only the heir to her father's property business and one of Hong Kong's richest women, she is also the most recognizable face campaigning for LGBT rights in the city.\n\nBobby Yip / Reuters The businesswoman has been using her influence in high society to forge a coalition of allies to mobilize support for the LGBTQ community.\n\nENGAGING BUSINESSES\n\nHomosexuality has been decriminalised since 1991 in Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The city has an annual pride parade and lively gay scene.\n\nBut despite the city enjoying freedom of speech and assembly, it does not recognise same-sex marriage and campaigners say LGBT people still face widespread discrimination and often come under family pressure to marry and have children.\n\nTransgender people are recognised if they have undergone sex reassignment surgery but activists have been lobbying to remove this requirement.\n\nA proposal to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation has been under discussion in the city's legislature, the Legislative Council (LegCo), but there is no clear indication whether it will be adopted.\n\nIt is disappointing in that LegCo doesn't have the forward vision or the courage to put something forward like this in fear of offending the traditional groups, Chao said.\n\nBut where the government has failed, is where Chao believes businesses can step in to take the lead.\n\nThe businesswoman has been using her influence in high society to forge a coalition of allies to mobilize support.\n\nWhat we found to be most effective is to engage top executives and allow them to see how inclusion, diversity and equality is something they should, and they shall, stand for and let it cascade down the organisation, she said.\n\nThere are a lot of notable organizations which have been doing that. Engaging the government is more difficult.\n\nBobby Yip / Reuters Chao poses next to a family photo of herself, her father (center) and brother Howard.\n\nTOP LGBT EXECUTIVE There have been other signs of growing acceptance. Hong Kong is set to become the host of the 2022 Gay Games, a sports and cultural event dubbed the Gay Olympics, after fighting off bids from cities in the United States and Mexico. In a rare victory, a Hong Kong court last year ruled that a British lesbian whose partner worked in the city should receive a spousal visa. The charity Big Love Alliance - of which Chao is a founding member - organises an annual Pink Dot gathering to campaign for LGBT rights and it has attracted sponsorship from embassies and investment banks. Chao also works with the United Nations on LGBT rights and became the first Asian to be named as the top LGBT executive on an annual OUTstanding list compiled by the Financial Times which ranks LGBT role models in business. A qualified helicopter pilot, Chao said the marriage bounty episode did not tarnish her ties with her father - who like her also shares a passion of flying. You build a much stronger bond in these relationships after you have been able to live your full self, be a full person and live as an honest person in front of your mum and dad, she said. It is an important process to go through although in the short term it does jolt them into a bit of shock. But in a signal that there is still a long way to go for same-sex marriage in Hong Kong, Chao said she and her partner have had to temporarily put aside the idea of having children. Even for people like me - who many perceive as having all the resources in the world to do whatever I want in some ways - it is very difficult, she said. It is not easy because you can't do it in Hong Kong or anywhere else in Asia.
VictoriaBee via Getty Images Two conservative Christian store owners are fighting for the right to refuse service to queer couples.\n\nPHOENIX (AP) — Lawyers are scheduled Tuesday to argue at the Arizona Supreme Court over the constitutionality of Phoenix's anti-discrimination ordinance that bars businesses from refusing service to same-sex couples for religion reasons.\n\nTwo Christian artists who operate a business that makes invitations and other wedding-related items argue that the ordinance will violate their religious beliefs by forcing them to custom-make products for same-sex marriage ceremonies.\n\nSo far, two courts have upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and rejected the arguments made by the artists, who believe a marriage should be between a man and woman.\n\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals ruled this summer that while the ordinance may have an incidental effect on free speech, its main purpose is to prohibit discrimination. The appeals court concluded the ordinance regulates conduct, not speech.
Writer, director and actor Kit Williamson would like his Emmy-nominated dramedy EastSiders to stand as a testament to love, both on- and off-screen.\n\nThere was, of course, no shortage of romance on the Netflix series itself, which concluded its seven-year, four-season run in December. Set in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, the pleasantly soapy show centered on a gay couple, Cal (played by Williamson) and Thom (Van Hansis), as they grappled with what it means to be in a committed queer relationship in the 2010s.\n\nCatch the trailer for Season 4 above.\n\nFor the Mississippi-born Williamson, EastSiders was a labor of love, too. He'd written the script for the show's first season out of his own frustrations with the lack of LGBTQ representation onscreen as well as a scarcity of acting offers since his relocation from New York to Los Angeles. With the help of an online fundraising campaign, he launched the series on YouTube in 2012.\n\nJono Photography EastSiders stars Van Hansis (left) and Kit Williamson as Angeleno couple Thom and Cal.\n\nI'm not one of those people who thinks that we're exactly the same as straight people, Williamson, whose credits include recurring roles on Mad Men and The Good Wife, told HuffPost. We have our own unique experiences, and those shape how we see the world and how we come into relationships. We don't have many long-term depictions of queer characters, and even fewer long-term depictions of queer relationships. So I thought to myself: What can I do that will add to the zeitgeist ― the queer zeitgeist?\n\nBy all means, EastSiders was a gamble. But that first season ― which also starred a pre-Fresh Off the Boat Constance Wu as Cal's best friend, Kathy, and Williamson's real-life husband, John Halbach, as her boyfriend, Ian ― garnered a cult following.\n\nThe next three seasons of EastSiders would incorporate storylines about lesbians, drag queens and gender non-conforming characters, garnering eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations along the way. The show also switched from YouTube to Logo TV before being picked up for distribution by Netflix in Season 3.\n\nThe world around EastSiders would change, too, with same-sex marriage becoming the law of the land in 2015 followed by the election of President Donald Trump, who ran on an anti-LGBTQ platform, the next year. Such cultural shifts were woven into the narrative of EastSiders, expanding both the show's scope and ambitions. Politics, in particular, became the source of some pushback among viewers when it was revealed that gay adult film actor Colby Keller, who appeared in a Season 3 episode, was a Trump supporter. (Williamson, a Democrat, defended the casting choice in an Advocate essay.)\n\nThrough it all, the series never lost its sense of indie cool ― in some respects out of necessity, as Williamson continued to rely on fan crowdfunding for its budget.\n\nNetflix Thom (Van Hansis, left) and Clifford (Jake Choi) enjoy an afternoon rendezvous.\n\nSeason 4 finds Cal and Thom once again testing the boundaries of their relationship as their drag queen pal Douglas (Willam Belli) plans to marry his fiancé, Quincy (Stephen Guarino). Ian, meanwhile, is now in a relationship with Cal's sister, Hillary (Brianna Brown), but he begins to explore his sexuality just as the couple face a possible pregnancy.\n\nGiven the absence of big studio promotion, the final six episodes of EastSiders debuted in December to minimal fanfare. As in previous seasons, however, word-of-mouth has proven to be the show's selling point. In January, the series was a New York Times Critics Pick, while Cosmopolitan featured it alongside Schitt's Creek and RuPaul's Drag Race on its list of the 15 best LGBTQ+ shows.\n\nAs for Williamson, he's found creative ways to maintain the EastSiders buzz, too. On Jan. 23, he released a documentary retrospective that took a behind-the-scenes look at all four seasons of the show. And last week, he appeared with Wu on The Kelly Clarkson Show, bonding with Clarkson over their shared Southern upbringing.\n\nNetflix Good stories have endings, and I wanted to leave all of the characters in a satisfying place, Williamson said of Season 4 of EastSiders. (From left: Katya, Marta BeatChu and Biqtch Puddin')\n\nStill, Williamson said he and the EastSiders cast and crew were always aware of the fact that existing incarnation of the show would end after its fourth season. Wu, for instance, was unable to appear in the final installment because of her Fresh Off the Boat shooting schedule.\n\nIt's important to always keep moving, growing and evolving, Williamson said. Good stories have endings, and I wanted to leave all of the characters in a satisfying place. I don't want to keep imperiling these relationships unnecessarily.\n\nThe show, he added, has led to a wealth of new screenwriting projects. Though he would like to maintain his acting chops, Williamson ultimately sees himself following in the footsteps of Phoebe Waller-Bridge of Fleabag as a writer, showrunner and performer.\n\nNetflix John Halbach, who is Williamson's real-life husband, stars in EastSiders as Ian.\n\nHe also isn't opposed to revisiting the characters he introduced in EastSiders in the future, either by way of a feature film or a different format. Until that happens, he's hopeful the show's forward-thinking take on love will find new audiences around the world.\n\nWe regularly get messages from people in countries where it's illegal to be gay, saying the show has made them feel less alone, he said. That's been the biggest reward in this because I know how much representation means, having grown up gay in Mississippi.\n\nCatch EastSiders: The Documentary below.
Running into your ex is always a little bit awkward. Just ask Carmen Electra.\n\nThe model and former Baywatch actress stopped by HuffPost Live Thursday and talked about a recent run-in she had with ex-husband Dennis Rodman. The 43-year-old actress said she was hosting a party in Florida when Rodman unexpectedly showed up.\n\nThere was chaos with security -- they thought it was going to be this big problem and this big deal, she said. They said, 'do you want us to keep you guys separate?' and I said, 'no!'\n\nIn the end, Electra and the former Chicago Bulls forward ended up having a nice catch-up sesh.\n\nWe talked for five minutes, we caught up a little bit and that was it -- and it was nice, Electra said. I've cared about him throughout all these years and it was great to hear that he sounded like he was in a decent place. \n\nElectra and Rodman got married in Las Vegas in 1998 after a whirlwind months-long romance.The couple were married for less than a year before officially divorcing in 1999.\n\n(Story continues under the photo.)\n\nSGranitz via Getty Images Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman in 1999 at a press conference at Planet Hollywood in Beverly Hills.\n\nDuring an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? in 2014, Electra looked back on the oftentimes volatile marriage.\n\nOur relationship was very passionate, she said. When it was good, it was amazing. And when it was bad, it was the worst.\n\nMore From HuffPost:
After months of grooming and emotional manipulation, Sarah Jackson says the pastor of her Maryland Baptist church called her into his private study and kissed her. She was 17, trembling and numb, while he was 29, married with children. It was the first time she had ever been touched this way.\n\nThat was Jan. 3, 2007. The date was imprinted in Jackson's mind as sexual abuse continued over the ensuing months. Jackson claims the pastor, Cameron Giovanelli, used it as a secret code to initiate intimate text conversations. Giovanelli would text Jan, and if she was alone, she would reply 3rd ― signaling that the coast was clear for him to text freely.\n\nThirteen years later, Jackson has become a vocal advocate for survivors of sexual abuse. And on Jan. 3 this year, she was composing a victim impact statement to read out loud at a Baltimore County court at Giovanelli's sentencing for sex offense and assault.\n\nWhat you did to me could have destroyed me but I need you to know that I'm stronger than you have made me feel all these years, Jackson told Giovanelli in court on Monday. I no longer hold your secrets.\n\nOne day you and I will both stand before God who cannot be manipulated by your words like so many still are, and He knows the truth and I'm so grateful that He does, Jackson added. Despite what you did to me, He still finds me worthy of love.\n\nJanuary 3, 2007. The first time I was abused by my pastor as a child.\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2020. Typing a statement I will read to a judge at sentencing next week.\n\n\n\nIf you're still silent, know your voice CAN be heard. Even 13 yrs later. If by no one else, I will listen. #metoo #churchtoo — Sarah Jackson (@Mrs_Triple8) January 3, 2020\n\nBaltimore County Circuit Judge Robert E. Cahill Jr. sentenced Giovanelli to 90 days at the county detention center and five years of probation for a fourth-degree sex offense and second-degree assault. As part of a plea deal reached in December, prosecutors dropped an original felony charge of sexual abuse of a minor and agreed Giovanelli won't have to register as a sex offender, according to The Baltimore Sun.\n\nGiovanelli's attorney said Monday that his client accepts responsibility in the case, the Sun reported.\n\nJackson is now a 30-year-old married mother of two living in a small community north of Baltimore. She has said she was compelled to come forward with allegations against Giovanelli in 2018 after the birth of her first child made her realize she wanted to protect children from abuse.\n\nShe told HuffPost that she believes no amount of jail time could account for the abuse she endured from her former pastor.\n\nIs 90 days ideal for the crime he committed? Absolutely not, Jackson wrote in an email. But, what is a harsh enough sentence? 5 days, 5 months or 5 years. Nothing will take back what he did to me 13 years ago.\n\nAll I am trying to focus on, is the fact that I got this far. That is huge, she added. We now have the opportunity to spread a message that regardless of the amount of years that have passed, you CAN be heard.\n\nCourtesy Sarah Jackson Sarah Jackson reported her allegations about abuse by her former church pastor several years earlier to Baltimore County police in 2018.\n\nGiovanelli was the pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Dundalk, Maryland, between 2004 and 2014, the Sun reported. The church is independent fundamental Baptist (IFB), part of a loosely affiliated network of deeply conservative evangelical churches in the U.S.\n\nIn her victim impact statement, Jackson described how Giovanelli started grooming her for abuse in 2006. Giovanelli held several positions of authority in Jackson's life at the time. Not only was he her pastor, he was also a teacher at the church school she attended, she said. According to Jackson, Giovanelli also hired her as a babysitter for his children and assigned her to work as his office aide.\n\nHis abuse continued over several months, Jackson said, and eventually included touching and oral sex,\n\nIt was extremely hard to know what was going on behind closed doors and then sit in a pew and listen to this man preach about purity, marriage, integrity. ... It made me question a lot, Jackson told HuffPost.\n\nLater in 2007, another church leader discovered what was happening and intervened. Giovanelli volunteered to resign as pastor, an offer that was declined, Jackson said. Conversations between the pair slowed and Giovanelli convinced her to keep silent to protect both of their reputations, she said.\n\nCourtesy Sarah Jackson Sarah Jackson in a senior year high school photo. She was 17 years old when Cameron Giovanelli, then 29, began abusing her.\n\nThe ordeal left her alone, embarrassed and confused and with no idea how to process what had happened, she said in her victim impact statement. She also said the abuse has taken a physical, emotional and mental toll on her health.\n\nWhen someone asks you who your first kiss was, you can't say it was your adult pastor when you were a child in school, she said in her statement. Even though he was out of my life, he still was affecting my life and had me living as someone I didn't want to be.\n\nGiovanelli continued working at Calvary Baptist Church for several years, after which he became president of California's Golden State Baptist College, an independent, fundamentalist Bible school in Santa Clara. He resigned from that post after Jackson reported her allegations to police.\n\nGiovanelli has also been involved with starting a new IFB college, North Florida Baptist College in Jacksonville, near where he now lives. He was slated to become president of the school this year, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. North Florida Baptist College did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment on whether Giovanelli still holds that position.\n\nCalvary Baptist Church's current pastor, Stacey Shiflett, is an abuse survivor himself and has publicly supported Jackson since she came forward with her allegations.\n\nCourtesy Baltimore County Police Department Cameron Giovanelli was the pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Dundalk, Maryland, between 2004-2014.\n\nIndependent fundamental Baptists are distinguishable from other streams of evangelicalism by their desire to separate themselves from mainstream U.S. society. While practices can vary from church to church, independent fundamentalist Baptists often home school their kids, refrain from engaging in pop culture and share a fierce loyalty to the King James translation of the Bible. IFB churches also don't have the hierarchical denominational structures that unite more mainstream evangelical groups, like the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nRev. Ashley Easter, an abuse victim advocate who was raised in an IFB church in Virginia, said that it's common for children in these communities to not receive adequate education about sex and sexuality. (In her victim impact statement, Jackson said that she was raised in an extremely sheltered and religious atmosphere, with no sex education other than to keep herself pure until marriage.)\n\nI personally experienced an extreme lack of sexual education which made the abuses I experienced all the more difficult, Easter told HuffPost. This lack of knowledge about sex and sexuality creates a greater vulnerability for children, teens, and young adults victimized by abuse because they have not been given language to understand what is happening to them, let alone the language to describe and report it to a safe adult.\n\nIn December 2018, an investigation by the Star-Telegram uncovered hundreds of abuse allegations against IFB leaders in the U.S. Survivors claimed that IFB pastors are treated as if they were chosen by God and beyond reproach ― a culture that ensures that predator pastors are protected. Giovanelli was one of the accused pastors cited in the report.\n\nEaster said that too often, IFB churches try to handle abuse inhouse or use unqualified individuals to help create their safety protocols.\n\nIFB churches, and all churches, should receive training about abuse response and prevention by qualified experts such as licensed trauma therapists, trained domestic violence prevention advocates, and police, she said.\n\nJackson told HuffPost she believes that sexual abuse has been a taboo subject in IFB church communities for too long. She said churches should stop worrying about their reputations and treat sexual abuse for what it is ― a crime.\n\nYou'll be far more respected by the outside world if you are protecting people from predators and doing so boldly, she said.\n\nDespite the abuse she faced from her pastor, Jackson said she's managed to hold on to her faith. And she's determined to keep speaking up for others who are victims of abuse in Christian communities.\n\nI may never truly know why God allowed it to happen, but that doesn't mean that God neglected me, she told HuffPost. There is a reason and I will continue to try and use this situation for His glory. I will continue to try and make a change in churches and protect the next generation of 'Sarahs.'\n\nCORRECTION: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this story gave the wrong locale for North Florida Baptist College.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear defended a photograph of him posing with drag queens at a gay rights rally and accused a Republican lawmaker of using homophobic tactics by displaying the photo at a recent campaign rally while accusing Democrats of corrupting traditional values.\n\nBeshear, a Democrat, told reporters Thursday that he would pose for the photo again, saying he was practicing his faith to treat everyone with respect.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker who denounced the photo at the rally owes an apology to everyone appearing in the picture, the governor said. At the weekend rally for a Republican legislative candidate, state Sen. Phillip Wheeler accused Beshear and the Democratic Party of corrupting the values of children, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.\n\nThey were absolutely homophobic, the governor said of the lawmaker's remarks. I don't think he is the fashion police for the Capitol. I believe he owes each and every one of them an apology. They are as much Kentuckians as anybody else.\n\nWheeler defended his comments Thursday, saying they were not directed toward homosexuals.\n\nMy problem is not with the gay movement, he said in a phone interview. I didn't say anything about the 'Pride Celebration.'\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear greets members of the Kentucky Order of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an LGBTQ charity group, following a rally at the Capitol building in Frankfort.\n\nWheeler said he objected to what the drag queens wore. One of them donned a KFC bucket crafted to look like a nun's habit while another posing behind Beshear was wearing horns.\n\nWhat I thought indecent was the fact that they wore outfits that mocked the Christian religion and mocked traditional values, Wheeler said. That's what I've got a problem with, is the mockery and the fact that the governor would pose and support that.\n\nThe Republican candidate won this week's special election for an eastern Kentucky House seat that had been held by a Democrat for decades. The Appalachian region is a stronghold for Republican President Donald Trump. Beshear said Thursday he didn't think the photo influenced the outcome.\n\nAt the campaign event, Wheeler said: This is not only a fight for the soul of America, the Lexington newspaper reported. It is a fight against evil, for just the forces of decency.\n\nBeshear recently became Kentucky's first sitting governor to attend the gay rights rally in the state Capitol Rotunda, a few steps from the governor's office. The rallies by gay-rights supporters date back to the 1990s, activists said.\n\nThe governor spoke against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and supported a ban on conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth during the rally.\n\nBeshear said Thursday that he was proud to make history with his appearance.\n\nIt's time to move beyond the hatred and the division and treat everyone the way that they're supposed to be treated, he said. For me, it's a matter of faith, morals and doing what's right.\n\nI would absolutely take that picture again because those are Kentuckians that were here at their Capitol, the governor added.\n\nBeshear defeated Republican incumbent Matt Bevin, a staunch social conservative, to win the governorship in last year's election.\n\nPolitical opposition to gay rights has some deep roots in Kentucky.\n\nIn 2004, Kentucky voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state Constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman. But in June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees same-sex couples have the right to marry. The ruling overturned same-sex marriage bans nationwide.\n\nA county clerk in Kentucky, Kim Davis, made international news when she was jailed in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses after gay weddings became legal. She cited her religious beliefs and said she was acting under God's authority.\n\nDavis was released only after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The state legislature later passed a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.\n\nGay-rights activists have made headway. A growing number of Kentucky municipalities have passed local fairness ordinances, which ban LGBTQ discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations.
Last week, the second lady of the United States, Karen Pence, went to work as an art teacher at Immanuel Christian School in Northern Virginia. Immanuel Christian is one of the many American religious institutions, as Rebecca Klein reported for HuffPost, that discriminates both in its hiring and its admissions. The school requires moral purity from its staff, meaning they can't be queer, have sex outside marriage or watch porn, and must respect the unique roles of men and women. The school also reserves the right to expel students for being queer.\n\nImmanuel Christian is not unusual. Too many religious schools at all levels regulate the personal conduct of their employees and students, restrict the books teachers can assign or students can read, and demand fealty to narrow constructions of religious identity, while enshrining bigotry into their bylaws.\n\nVice President Mike Pence says that criticizing institutions that discriminate like this is anti-Christian. I say that these schools are not only anti-American, in that they exclude so many Americans, but are also not in the best educational interests of the students who attend them.\n\nFor too many other institutions, faith provides the material to build a defensive wall rather than a strong foundation.\n\nThere are about 27,000 religious private K-12 schools in the United States and over 1,000 religious colleges and universities. Many of these institutions are inclusive, welcome, places. I should know, as I taught at Dominican University, a Catholic institution in the Chicago area, for over 10 years. I only left so I could raise my kids in Minnesota. For Dominican, and for thousands of institutions like it, faith traditions provide a rock of identity on which to stand and welcome the world with confidence.\n\nAs a secular Jew, I felt at home at Dominican. As an institution, it knew what it was and hoped I would share in the mission to make a more just and humane world. My Muslim and queer colleagues reported similar feelings of inclusion, and I don't think Dominican is atypical in this regard. From kindergarten to graduate school, it's possible to attend or work at a religious institution of learning that takes faith seriously without endorsing exclusion or bigotry.\n\nAlas, for too many other institutions, faith provides the material to build a defensive wall rather than a strong foundation. Karen Pence's new employer, Immanuel Christian, is one of many examples at the secondary level. I've been tracking similar issues at the collegiate level.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, appeared at events for the anti-abortion March for Life in Washington, D.D., on Friday.\n\nThere are 139 colleges that exempt themselves from following Title IX rules against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy or receipt of abortion. Yet these schools continue to receive federal funding. Many require explicit professions of faith from faculty. Not only must teachers avoid acting in a way that is immoral in their personal lives, but every aspect of the educational experience is policed to make sure students only receive limited viewpoints and are never challenged on their core beliefs.\n\nWheaton College, an elite school sometimes styled the Harvard of Christian Schools, began termination procedures against professor Larycia Hawkins (the first tenured African-American professor in the school's history) because she posted on Facebook that she stands in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God. According to Wheaton's provost, the idea that two of the three Abrahamic religions might venerate the same deity violates the school's doctrinal convictions. Hawkins and Wheaton eventually parted ways. No one questioned whether Hawkins was a Christian, but whether her theological understanding of the nature of divinity narrowly clung to Wheaton's ideological mandate.\n\nAt another elite Christian school, Ozark College, students are required to venerate the U.S. flag as well as maintain a Christian life. For Ozark, Christianity excludes touching, caressing, and other physical conduct of a sexual nature with a person of the same sex, all of which is grounds for being fired or expelled.\n\nImagine what it's like to be a student or professor at Wheaton today and to know that it's not just required to be a Christian, but to be exactly the right type of Christian. Will the next professor at Franciscan who wants to challenge students with a complex, possibly offensive, book hold back in order to preserve their professional status? And no one, anywhere, ever, should risk employment because of who they love or what consensual activities they choose to engage in with other adults.\n\nAccording to them, the modern practices of overprotective parenting and oversolicitous educators have created a generation of snowflakes, students unequipped for the real world, locked in ideological bubbles, and prone to mental health struggles. But these concerns for educational rigor always seem to apply in the same direction. We hear more about sandwich diversity in the Oberlin cafe then we do about the experience of students at religious schools.\n\nI agree that intellectual diversity is important to a true education. But if there are students who are being turned into snowflakes by their education, by mollycoddling parents and by teachers, then surely it's the millions of students who are attending schools that mandate limited viewpoints, adherence to ideology, and no exposure to true diversity.\n\nAs this essay went to press, a video of young white men from Covington Catholic High School harassing a group of indigenous people went viral. The students had traveled from Kentucky to D.C. to attend the March for Life, but paused to surround elder Nathan Phillips as he was playing a drum and chanting. One slid close, grinning, thrilled with his racist provocation, a Hazel Massery of his generation. Maybe if Karen and Mike Pence are worried about saving Christian education in this country, they are going to have to break down the walls of bigotry that cocoon such institutions. Alas, all they seem to care about is keeping queer people out.\n\nAren't they the real snowflakes?\n\n\n\nDavid Perry is a historian and journalist. He works at the University of Minnesota.

It was love at first sight for Nicole Kidman when she first met husband Keith Urban back in 2005. But for Urban, it took a little longer ― four months to be exact.\n\nKidman told the story of the fateful night she met the country singer more than a decade ago at G'Day USA ― a Los Angeles gala for Australians where they were both being honored ― on an episode of Ellen that aired Thursday. The pair even have a picture of their first encounter.\n\nWe met that night. The craziest thing is to have a photo of when you first met, she said. Someone just took that photo and sent it to us. I remember thinking I had such a crush on him. And he wasn't interested in me.\n\nOur very first photo together 2005, minutes after being introduced to each other. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABY. LOOOOOOOOVE YOU!!!!!!!!! xxxxxxxxx - KU A photo posted by Keith Urban (@keithurban) on Jun 25, 2016 at 6:05am PDT\n\nAn incredulous DeGeneres just couldn't believe that. But Kidman insisted: It's true! He didn't call me for four months.\n\nWhen pressed about why it took so long for Urban to pick up the phone, Kidman replied with a smile:\n\nThere's certain things ― and I think anyone in a marriage would agree with this ― you just don't. You just leave that. We're here now and it's all good. We don't need to hash up all that stuff.\n\nBased on an interview Urban did with Oprah Winfrey back in 2010, it seems that he was just intimidated by Kidman at first.\n\nI introduced myself and she was very pleasant and everything, he said. And there was that moment of waiting for the next thing to be said, which I didn't know if I was bothering her or what was going on. So I just sort of said, 'Well nice to meet you.' And I walked away.\n\nAnd then I thought, was I supposed to say more? Urban continued. A friend of mine said, 'I think she wanted to talk to you. Me? Why would she want to talk to me? So I went back over and apologized and we just started talking and really clicked.\n\nThe couple, who are now parents to daughters Sunday and Faith, celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in June. These days, Urban is undeniably smitten with his wife.\n\nMeeting [Nicole] and getting married wasn't life-changing, it was life-beginning, he said on CBS' Sunday Morning in May. It was literally, like, 'Okay, life starts.'
Meghan Markle opened up about why she and Prince Harry are speaking out now in a new preview clip of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's upcoming interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nGayle King introduced the video on CBS This Morning Friday, saying it would show why Meghan and Harry did not feel free to speak candidly sooner.\n\nThe clip shows Winfrey approaching the subject with Meghan: I called you either or February or March 2018 before the wedding asking, 'Would you please get me an interview,' and you said, 'I'm sorry, it's not the right time.'\n\nI remember that conversation very well. I wasn't even allowed to have the conversation with you personally, right? Meghan answered. There had to be people from the comms [team] sitting there.\n\nThere were other people in the room when I was having that conversation, Winfrey said. You turned me down nicely and said 'Perhaps there will be another time, when there's the right time.'\n\nThe media mogul gently pressed: What is right about this time?\n\nCBS\n\nWell, so many things. That we're on the other side of a lot of, a lot of life experience that's happened, Meghan said. And also that we have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to you then, that wasn't my choice to make.\n\nAs an adult who lived a really independent life to then go into this construct that is, um, different than I think what people imagine it to be, it's really liberating to be able to have the right and the privilege in some ways to be able to say, 'Yes ... I'm ready to talk.'\n\nWinfrey added: And to say it for yourself. And not to have to consult with anybody at this point.\n\nThe duchess responded: Yeah, to be able to just make a choice on your own. And just to be able to speak for yourself.\n\nIn another clip from the interview released earlier this week, Winfrey asked the duchess: How do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today?\n\nI don't know how they could expect that after all of this time we would still just be silent if there is an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us, Meghan said in the teaser, released on Wednesday.\n\nAnd if that comes with risk of losing things, I mean ― there's a lot that has been lost already, she added.\n\nCBS told HuffPost in a statement earlier this month that Oprah speaks with Meghan about stepping into life as a Royal, marriage, motherhood, philanthropic work to how she is handling life under intense public pressure, during the interview.\n\nLater in the interview, Meghan is joined by Prince Harry, and the two discuss their move to the United States and their future hopes and dreams for their expanding family, CBS said.\n\nThe two-hour prime time special is set to air on Sunday at 8 p.m. on CBS.\n\nSubscribe to HuffPost's Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond).
Diahann Carroll is best known for her 80s television role on Dynasty and her impressive Broadway chops, but the actress offers more beyond her professional resume. Speaking with Oprah: Where Are They Now?, Carroll opens up about the wisdom she's gained from her four marriages: First to agent and producer Monte Kay, with whom she had a daughter; then to Las Vegas businessman Fred Glusman, who she divorced weeks later; then to magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who was killed in a car accident after two years; and finally to singer Vic Damone, with whom she experienced many ups and downs before officially divorcing after nearly a decade.
In 2002, hip-hop fans and rom-com lovers were blessed with the movie Brown Sugar. Actress Sanaa Lathan starred as Syd, a young editor and journalist at a hip-hop magazine, who asked all of her interviewees the same question: When did you first fall in love with hip hop?\n\nFalling in love would be an interesting choice of words for a Black woman to use because the hip-hop industry does not love women in the same way that women love hip-hop. Women are deeply and emotionally connected to this genre, despite the fact that their role in the growth of the industry is easily dismissed. Black women like Sylvia Robinson, Queen Latifah, Missy Elliot and others helped mold hip-hop into the musical juggernaut it is today.\n\nUnfortunately, music videos now reduce most black women to eye candy, and lyrics depict them as objects for pleasure. And in real life, male artists and executives across genres use their power and influence to silence and violate women. As we prepare to celebrate the world of music at Sunday's Grammy Awards, where hip-hop happens to have dominated the nominations in multiple categories, we should ask: When is the industry we love going to collectively acknowledge it's legacy of sexual assault, shame and silence?\n\nHip-hop is black women's baby, and what mother isn't protective of her child?\n\nIn his 2014 song You, rapper Chief Keef states, Ain't gon' let me fuck, and I feel you. But you gon' suck my dick 'fore I kill you, literally threatening a woman's life if she refuses to perform oral sex. This line made it past each level of production ― writing, recording, mixing, distribution ― seemingly without a single person saying, maybe you shouldn't normalize threatening to kill women who refuse to have oral sex with you. And lyrics like this aren't unique to just one rapper.\n\nEven socially conscious MCs like the beloved Nas, who created the 90's hit If I Ruled the World with the soulful Lauryn Hill, are guilty. In the song, he imagines what he would do if he had complete control over the world: For the men, he would open every door in Attica and send them to Africa, freeing prisoners and returning them home. For women, every girl I would meet would go down town. In Nas' perfect world, the men would be free and the women would be virtual sex slaves. And like Lauryn Hill, the whole world sings along with tracks that reduce black women to sex objects in a culture that black women birthed.\n\nBeyond lyrics and in the real world, industry heavyweights like rapper, producer and business executive Dr. Dre can still have a lucrative career after admitting to physically abusing women. In 1991, Dre physically attacked Pump It Up host Dee Barnes, who alleged that he threw her down a flight of stairs, slammed her head against a wall, kicked her and stomped on her fingers. Dr. Dre told Rolling Stone shortly after the incident, It ain't no big thing – I just threw her through a door, while his groupmate Eazy-E cosigned: Bitch deserved it.\n\nIf Dr. Dre's career trajectory after that admission is any indication of how we view the physical violence suffered by black women, then I imagine millions of people consider it no big thing. Even after he publicly admitted it, Dr. Dre was still able to become a world-renowned hip-hop artist with a net worth of $740 million.\n\nThis type of wealth creates power, and we've seen powerful men in hip-hop use their position to silence victims. Recently, three brave women came forward to allege that they were raped by Russell Simmons, a legendary gatekeeper in the hip-hop community. These women described feeling powerless against the mogul and afraid that if they spoke publicly about what Simmons allegedly did, they would be ostracized by the community in which they worked. We've known for decades that singer R. Kelly repeatedly uses his power and influence to allegedly coerce minors into inappropriate relationships with him. We all know about his illegal marriage to a 15-year-old Aaliyah. We've read the stories about his compound where he allegedly keeps a cult of underaged black girls against their will. Yet this man is still able to sell tickets to shows and go on a world tour.\n\nIf we truly love music and the women who are suffering in silence, then we should collectively use our power to create something better.\n\nStill, hip-hop is black women's baby, and what mother isn't protective of her child? I suspect this deep sense of protection is part of the reason we choose to ignore the many ways the industry has violated women. We may never see a massive public reckoning with sexual harassment like the one we're witnessing in Hollywood. Respectability politics dictate that black people ― entertainers included ― overcome historical stereotypes that label us violent, sex-hungry criminals. Having a public conversation around real-life crimes like sexual harassment and assault that occur within the hip-hop industry ― within our family ― would feel like pulling the curtain back and exposing your family issues to the world. It's uncomfortable, and it stands in direct contradiction to the adage, family business is family business.\n\nSo, in the name of family, poisonous secrets like sexual assault are swallowed. But when poison is digested, it causes a slow and painful death. In hip-hop, women who have repeatedly swallowed poison in the name of family are slowly dying, in silence.\n\nAs stories of violence and sexual harassment against women continue to become more public, it's fair to say that this phenomenon isn't exclusive to hip-hop. Pop star Ke$ha, who's slated to perform Grammy Awards ceremony, recently went through a lawsuit with famous music producer Dr. Luke, wherein she accused him of sexual assault, sexual harassment and gender violence. Taylor Swift, a country music singer who's nominated for two Grammys this year, has been vocal about her own alleged assault at the hands of David Mueller, a radio personality. But their star power combined with the numerous tales of violence in hip-hop are still not enough to spark a movement for change in the industry.\n\nIf we truly love music, hip-hop culture and the women who are suffering in silence, then we should collectively use our power to create something better. Will we keep loving problematic things, acknowledging that some bad feminism is unavoidable, or do we finally put our feet down? What if we showed how much we value black women by refusing to support artists who create music that normalizes abuse? What if we stopped supporting artists who are so casual with their abuse that they tell us about it in their lyrics?\n\nCash rules everything around music. Use yours to send a message that even though no one is stopping artists from bragging about assault at the production level, we, the listeners, will stop them at the consumer level. Supporting musicians who brag about raping and killing women provides those artists with the money and power they need to continue to silence their victims. We can no longer be passive spectators, complicit in a performative type of love. Real love demands better.\n\nIf Brown Sugar was set in 2018, the character Syd may ask something a little different than When did you first fall in love with hip-hop? She may instead want to know, When is hip-hop going to show love for black women? Or perhaps: Is your favorite artist promoting violence against women? How about: What are we going to do about the silence around violence in hip-hop? Women love to listen to hip-hop, but as the industry's silence about sexual assault shows, hip-hop doesn't love to listen to women.\n\nShanita Hubbard is an adjunct professor, writer and speaker who you can follow on Twitter for social commentary and occasional snide remarks.\n\nThis piece is part of HuffPost's brand-new Opinion section.

Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, many predicted a baby boom would result, thanks to all the idle hours couples were forced to spend at home.\n\nSo far, though, the research suggests the opposite may be true: We're in the early days of a baby bust.\n\nAccording to reporting by the NBCLX news outlet, several states and a few hospital systems that keep track of births saw significant drops in birth rates in December, compared with the same month in 2019. This past December's birth rates were down 8% in Florida, 5% in Arizona and 7% in Ohio compared with the previous year. (Most states and hospitals contacted either couldn't provide information or hadn't shared their December numbers yet.)\n\nNBCLX looked at December birth rates because most stay-at-home orders were instituted in March. The majority of babies conceived in mid-March would be born in late December.\n\nWith a few exceptions, hospital systems contacted by the news site reported similar declines. OhioHealth, which delivers babies at 10 hospitals across the state, saw an 11% drop in births over the second half of 2020, compared to the second half of 2019. JPSHealth Network in Texas reported a 13% drop in births from December 2020, compared with December 2019.\n\nSignificant declines in birth rates come as no surprise to researchers ― though they stress that the data to fully gauge the number of lowered birth rates won't be available for a few months.\n\nThe economic fallout, persistent health concerns, uncertainty about the safety and availability of medical care and the closure of schools all combine to make this a very unappealing time for couples to start or expand their family, said Emily Smith-Greenaway, an associate professor of sociology and spatial sciences at the University of Southern California.\n\nWill we see a baby boom once the pandemic abates? With fewer singles dating because of lockdowns and the already historically low rates in marriage, researchers have their doubts.\n\nWe certainly anticipate there to be a rebound, but we're not so sure about an overshoot ― a boom that helps to offset the bust, Smith-Greenaway said. The longer this economic and public health crisis persists, the more likely these births aren't just delayed, but will be averted entirely.\n\nThe longer this economic and public health crisis persists, the more likely these births aren't just delayed, but will be averted entirely. - Emily Smith-Greenaway, an associate professor of sociology and spatial sciences at the University of Southern California\n\nMelissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland, and Phillip Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley University in Massachusetts, published a report over the summer predicting the pandemic could result in half a million fewer births in 2021.\n\nThe pair updated their estimate in December, projecting the number may be closer to 300,000, but they remain convinced the virus will lead to a sizable reduction in children born in 2021.\n\nAs soon as the stories started coming out last spring about a potential baby boom, Phil and I discussed how those predictions were surely wrong, and how what we should expect to see instead was a sizable baby bust, Kearney told HuffPost.\n\nAccording to Kearney and Levine, the baby boom speculation is rooted in a long-standing myth that birth rates spike after crises or events that force the population to stay home (say, a blizzard or a major electricity blackout.)\n\nBut the researchers say the theory doesn't tend to hold up to statistical examination ― and the COVID-19 crisis is obviously far more disruptive and longer-lasting than those two examples.\n\nIt makes more sense to draw parallels to the 1918 influenza pandemic, which led to a large decline in birth rates.\n\nWe're not surprised to see a decline in births this time around, Kearney said. It's what economic reasoning, data, and evidence would have predicted.\n\nGoogling habits support these estimates. Searches for pregnancy-related terms like ultrasound ClearBlue pregnancy test and morning sickness all fell in 2020, according to one study.\n\nHere's why the so-called baby bust matters.\n\nAll of this could spell trouble down the line. Birth rates were sinking to a record low, even before the COVID-19 crisis. As Levine recently told Insider, fewer workers in the labor force could have a dire impact on our Social Security system, since it's dependent and financed through tax contributions of new employees.\n\nAt this point, 300,000 fewer births in one year, one time, isn't really that big of a deal for the broader economy and society as a whole, Levine said. But you start finding yourself down close to a million births a year, for several years, so those trends continue, and that's going to have important implications for the country going forward.\n\nFuse via Getty Images The 1918 influenza pandemic led to a dip in birth rates, and experts say the trend is likely to happen again.\n\nA similar study shows that European women are also putting family planning on the back burner because of the pandemic. Even in New Zealand, a country that has come out of the pandemic relatively unscathed, birth rates are declining. (Data collected by that nation's government found the birth rate for those of childbearing age has fallen to a record low of 1.63 per woman — far below the 2.1 needed to replace population numbers.)\n\nLow birth rates and concerns over public pension systems have driven countries like France to offer young couples financial incentives to have children, including subsidized daycare and expanded parental leave for mothers and fathers.\n\nEconomic, child care and health concerns weigh heavily on couples.\n\nFor those who had every intention to get pregnant last year, the decision to wait was a heavy one.\n\nRandali de Santos, a mom of one, in Portland, Oregon, said she and her husband had plans to conceive again around the winter of 2020. As the pandemic stretched out into the spring, they decided to hold off. Now the plan is to wait until they're both vaccinated, but also to wait until their parents get the vaccination as well.\n\nEven before news of the vaccine, we held off because we were worried about having to have a child without the additional help and backup of my mom, who lives in Los Angeles, de Santos said. She had a C-section delivery the first time, and was concerned about the recovery process involved with another one without her mom by her side.\n\nAt times de Santos wishes she had a new baby at home, especially since she's not currently working. When the COVID crisis worsened, she left her job to be able to take care of her two-year-old daughter who she'd pulled out of daycare.\n\nIn some ways, the pandemic makes it more enticing to have a second child ― a friend for our daughter, ample time at home for both parents, a built-in excuse to not entertain friends and family ― but it also makes it difficult for people like us that don't have family nearby who can help with child care or preparing for a newborn, she said.\n\nRachel Meyer / 500px via Getty Images Some would-be parents are waiting until more is known about the vaccines for COVID-19 before they conceive.\n\nDe Santos, like many other parents, has concerns about a vaccine's effect on a baby in utero and the chance of getting COVID-19 while pregnant. (A new study out of Washington state found that pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized for the disease than other females and that the mortality rate among them was more than 13 times higher than those of similar ages who were not pregnant.)\n\nThere is no suspicion that the vaccine should be bad for pregnant women, Jane Minkin, clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale University School of Medicine, previously told HuffPost. But we just do not have the information.\n\nStill, some would-be parents are waiting until more is known about the vaccines. Eliana Meyer of Denver, Colorado, is one of them.\n\nSince there's no current research on the possible effects the vaccine has on pregnant women and babies, my husband and I felt it was a safer option for us to wait, rather than possibly risking anything happening to me or a baby if I got the vaccine while pregnant, Meyer told HuffPost.\n\nMeyer and her husband both work in the administrative side of health care, so they hope the wait will be short. Ultimately, this is pushing our timeline out by at least a few months, but we both feel like it's worth it, she said.\n\nThis is a multifaceted crisis that is really touching individuals' lives in such distinct ways. - Smith-Greenaway\n\nMary Kim, a mom of three in Nashville, Tennessee, said she and her husband were ready to have their fourth child last year, but the stress of the pandemic sidelined those plans.\n\nHer father-in-law died from COVID-19 early on in the pandemic. For a time, she and her husband were working from home with three kids under the age of five. (Now she's back in the office, which comes with its own work-life balance stress.)\n\nI turned 38 last year, so it's ticking clock and all that, but my husband wanted to put it on the back burner, Kim told HuffPost. He was still traumatized from everything.\n\nAs matters turned out, Kim got her first vaccine last month and then found out she was pregnant. She's getting her second dose at the end of this week.\n\nIt was a shock, finding out, she said. My main concern at the moment is having gotten the first dose vaccine without knowing, which is probably for the best, because had I known, I wouldn't have been able to help but to be hesitant about getting the shot.\n\nKim's experience speaks to the other side of this conversation: Unplanned pregnancies will happen, especially amid the pandemic, according to Smith-Greenaway.\n\nWhile social distancing and lockdowns mean that fewer people are having casual sex, the same restrictions have meant that hundreds of thousands of women have struggled to access birth control, which is likely to result in unplanned pregnancies. (In a typical year, roughly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended.)\n\nAnd of course, plenty of couples have gone ahead with their pregnancy plans, along with resuming fertility treatments that many put on hold (or were forced to put on hold) earlier on in the crisis.
A gay Mormon who became famous for his mixed-orientation marriage has announced that he's divorcing his wife and hopes to fall in love with a man.\n\nMormon blogger Josh Weed was formerly a poster child for mixed-orientation marriages in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which views queer relationships as sinful. But in a blog post published last week, he said he came to realize that he could no longer be married to his partner, Laurel Weed, who is a straight woman.\n\nTogether, the pair also apologized to queer Mormons for the way their story has been used to bully others.\n\nWe're sorry for any degree that our existence, and the publicity of our supposedly successful marriage made you feel 'less than' as you made your own terribly difficult choices. And we're sorry if our story made it easier for people in your life to reject you and your difficult path as being wrong, the Jan. 25 blog read. If this is you, we want you to know: you were right.\n\nYou listened to your gut and to God and did a brave, brave thing. Now I'm following your example.\n\nGeorge Frey via Getty Images A pride flag flies in front of the Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah.\n\nIn 2012, Josh Weed wrote a viral blog post in which he came out as a gay Mormon who was very happily married to a straight woman. He wrote that his wife, a childhood friend, knew about his sexual orientation before they were married and that he decided to marry her because he believed in the doctrines of the Mormon church, wanted to have a traditional family and genuinely loved his wife.\n\nThe story attracted a flurry of media attention, leading to features on ABC's Nightline and the VH1 reality television show I'm Married To A...\n\nNow, he says his former approach toward queer sexuality was a manifestation of lingering internalized homophobia. While he believes his marriage was beautiful and he still thinks of his wife as his very best friend, the relationship contained an undercurrent of pain the pair were not able to see clearly for years, he said.\n\nHe also wrote that he had always thought of himself as a broken straight person ― someone who was meant to be straight and whom God would one day fix. But he realizes now that viewing himself as fundamentally broken has led to overwhelming sadness in his life and at times, to suicidal thoughts, he added.\n\nThe things I talked about in my coming out post in 2012 weren't false. The joy I felt was real! The love I felt was real, but something in me wanted to die, he wrote. It's the thing that wants to die in all of us when we don't have hope for attachment to a person we are oriented towards.\n\nAfter about 15 years of marriage, the idea of going for decades more without experiencing authentic romantic and sexual attachment was finally too great a burden to bear ― for both of them, the couple said.\n\nIn the post, Laurel Weed wrote about how being married to her husband had brought her both immeasurable joy and pain. There was a void in their connection, and it wasn't just about sex, she wrote.\n\nPlatonic love is simply not enough, no matter how much we hoped it was, she said. God designed us to need and want romantic attachment.\n\nA post shared by Josh Weed (@the_weed) on Jan 1, 2016 at 12:06am PST\n\nThe pair also wanted to acknowledge how their story had caused pain for others in the queer Mormon community.\n\nWhen they went public with their story in 2012, Josh Weed said that he and his wife had very little exposure to gay people. But not long after their post went viral, they began to receive messages from queer Mormons about how the Weeds' mixed-orientation marriage had been used as an impossible standard.\n\nKathy Carlston, a queer Mormon from Syracuse, Utah, told HuffPost she feels the Weeds have often spoken against their story being used as an example for other queer Mormons. Still, she said that didn't prevent straight Mormons from holding it up as a standard and implying that, if they can do it, so can you.\n\nCarlston said she had been publicly out of the closet for about a month when the Weeds' original blog post went viral in 2012. At least 10 different members of her church sent it to her as if they had given me the panacea for my gayness, she said.\n\nI personally felt insulted and unheard, as none of those who had sent me the link had taken time to ask me what my experience had been like as a queer Mormon, Carlston said. Admittedly, the experience at the time was a bit humiliating. I had never found myself to be a lightning rod for folks to unleash their evangelizing before. It showed me a bit of what would lie ahead for me in the church: people who were uninformed or unconcerned about the realities and direness of the queer Mormon experience.\n\nIn November 2015, the Mormon church clarified its approach toward same-sex relationships with a series of policy changes. Mormons in same-sex relationships were declared apostates. The church also resolved that the children of these couples would not be allowed to be baptized until they were 18, at which point they would need to move out of their parents' home and disavow their parents' relationship to be considered for membership in the church.\n\nThe church made its position on queer sexuality even clearer in 2016, when it updated a web page meant to serve as a resource for gay and lesbian Mormons and their allies. The website emphasized that the church believes it's OK to be Mormon and gay ― as long as members don't act out on what the church calls same-sex attraction. The page shares the stories of Mormons who identify as gay but have pledged to pursue a life of celibacy or who have committed themselves to mixed-orientation relationships.\n\nEntering into a mixed-orientation marriage or remaining celibate were held up as the only acceptable goal to achieve throughout my youth and young adult life, and continue to be held up as the standard, Carlston told HuffPost.\n\nA post shared by Josh Weed (@the_weed) on Oct 2, 2015 at 8:14pm PDT\n\nIn his post, Josh Weed wrote that this conservative religious approach toward queer sexuality was both cruel and dangerous. He said the church's stance can fill queer Mormons with self-loathing and internalized homophobia.\n\nThe thing that is most cruel to religious LGBTQIA folks is not the lack of partners, but the lack of hope for a partner—that is the thing that makes them want to die, he wrote. Not the loneliness, per se, but the decades and decades before them with no hope of attachment.\n\nIt is for this reason that comparisons of gay people to simply single people who have not married yet are so woefully lacking in nuance. I once heard the difference between these groups stated this way and it's always stuck with me: single Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will fall in love with someone tomorrow; gay Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will never fall in love with someone.\n\nHe said that he and his wife have felt that God is calling them to separate from each other and pursue true love. They hope to continue raising their children together. The plan is to acquire a property that will accommodate their family and the addition of future partners if that time comes.\n\nHe also said that he isn't sure whether the Mormon church will continue to accept him or allow his two youngest children to be baptized if he ends up in a same-sex relationship. Still, he said he would like to be a part of the church, though the institution itself might consider me an outsider, he wrote.\n\nFive years ago, he said, he believed that a gay person could choose to live the life of a straight person. But now he knows that isn't possible without serious consequences to mental health.\n\nInstead, he said he's focusing on the things he can choose.\n\nI can choose to love Lolly with every ounce of love a gay man can have for a woman. And I can choose to find a partner and love him as well, adoring him and attaching to him in the beautiful way I was always intended to.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Sadar Jafar/Facebook Sadaf Jafar, a teacher and a political activist in Lucknow, was arrested by the UP Police on 19 December.\n\nLUCKNOW, Uttar Pradesh — Naheed Varma was in college and her sister Sadaf was in class 11 when communal riots erupted in Ahmedabad in 1991. It was their first experience of communal violence, the sisters were shocked by the violence they witnessed in Gujarat. The fear that Naheed felt almost three decades ago has never left her.\n\nIt was horrifying for us. We had never seen anything like this. We realised how polarised Ahmedabad was. We were the only Muslims in a 10 kilometre radius, Naheed said. That was our first experience with the Gujarat model of polarisation.\n\nThe trigger for the violence lay 1,400 km away in Ayodhya, where then UP Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had ordered the police to fire on the karsevaks who had gathered near the Babri Masjid. A year later, the 16th century mosque would be demolished by the karsevaks, and 27 years later, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of building a temple at the site.\n\nVarma, who married a Hindu man in 1993, was born into a Shia Muslim family from Lucknow, a mostly peaceful city where she spent her formative years. Lucknow remained calm even as the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December, 1992, triggered the worst communal riots since the Partition in 1947.\n\nToday, Varma still can't believe that Lucknow, a city that she considered her safe haven, where her granduncle and great granduncle had fought British rule, is where her younger sister Sadaf has been arrested, assaulted by the police, and charged with attempt to murder and being in possession of explosives.\n\nOn 19 December, 2019, Sadaf Jafar, who came out to protest against the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act, was the only woman arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-run state. For two days, the police did not tell her frantic family members where Jafar, who is a member of the opposition Congress Party, was.\n\nYou won't believe this when I tell you, but I felt relief when we finally heard that she was in jail. Just to know where she was was, that she wasn't dead, was all that mattered in that moment, she said. Then, it hits you. Our lives have changed forever.\n\nUnder the garb of maintaining law and order, Chief Minister Ajay Bisht, who calls himself Yogi Adityanath, has unleashed a brutal crackdown to crush any dissent against the discriminatory citizenship law. The UP Police has arrested thousands of people, beaten women and children, shot at non-protestors, and tortured children. Now, the government is sending notices to people suspected of damaging public property to pay damages or face seizure of their properties.\n\nFor a week now, there have been rumours of the police sending a recovery notice to Jafar and two other prominent social activists — Deepak Kabir and Mohammed Shoaib — who were arrested on 19 December in Lucknow.\n\nOn Thursday, Varma said the family had not received any notice so far. Honestly, we are prepared for the worst. We are living in some alternative reality where the truth no longer matters, she said.\n\nOur lives have changed forever.\n\nWho she is\n\nAll that her sister did was to come out for a peaceful protest and make live videos for Facebook, Varma said. But it is not what her sister was doing that bothers Bisht and the BJP, she said, but rather who she is and what she represents.\n\nThe arrest and beating inside the thana was payback, but not only for the Facebook videos that embarrass the BJP government and raise questions about how the UP police were operating on 19 December.\n\nIn a state where people critical of the government are arrested and charged with defamation or sedition, Jafar was one of the very few voices still calling them out on everything from the poor quality of midday meal for students to the alarming levels of sexual violence against women in the state.\n\nShe is everything they hate. She is Muslim. She is a woman with a mind. She speaks angrezi. She stands up to them, said Varma.\n\nShe is Muslim. She is a woman with a mind.\n\n'Revenge'\n\nJafar, a mother of two children, did not flee the site of the protest even after it turned violent on 19 December. The former school teacher stuck around and posted videos of the events unfolding around her.\n\nIn one video, Jafar is seen and heard urging the policemen to take action against the miscreants. Why are you not stopping them? she says over and over again. There was so much police, but when the violence happened, the police disappeared, she says in the video.\n\nIn her final video, Jafar says, Why are you arresting me? I was protesting peacefully. You could not catch the people who threw stones?\n\nA woman constable is heard saying, Those thugs were with us (as if). Jafar says, Who knows?\n\nWhen Varma met her sister in the district jail in Lucknow, she noticed that a clump of her hair was missing.\n\nJafar told her sister that a woman constable had ripped out her hair and clawed her face. That was after male constables had beaten her with batons on her back and kicked her in the stomach.\n\nFollowing the public outrage that followed these allegations last week, the police released a video, denying all the accusations levelled against it in Jafar's case.\n\nSadaf said that someone who was beaten in jail before told her, 'show them your back or they will break your hands,' Varma said.\n\nSomeone had burnt a woman constable's scooter in the violence and she took her revenge on Sadaf, she told me. Someone said, 'bahut angrezi bolti hai.' They find English speaking women particularly irksome, she said.\n\nSpeaking of the men who beat her sister, Varma said, They must have thought video bana rahi hai, humko bata rahi hai…\n\nBisht, Varma said, had sworn revenge and that state police was complying.\n\nThe UP chief minister has vowed revenge against alleged arsonists. He recently tweeted, Anyone interrupting the yagya of the sanyasi for public welfare, will face punishment.\n\nVaibhav Maheshwari, the spokesperson for the Aam Aadmi Party in UP, said there were two reasons for Jafar's arrest. Her name, he said. And the absolute power given to the UP Police.\n\nPolicemen at the lower rung of the force, he added, were not acting like they belonged to a system, but lashing out on their own. Ego driven, bias driven police has replaced the system driven police force, he said.\n\nसंन्यासी की लोक सेवा और जन कल्याण के निरंतर जारी यज्ञ में जो भी बाधा उत्पन्न करेगा उसे दण्डित होना ही पड़ेगा।\n\n\n\nविरासत में राजनीति पाने वाले और देश को भुला कर तुष्टिकरण की राजनीति करने वाले लोक सेवा का अर्थ क्या समझेंगे ?#भगवा_में_लोक_कल्याण — Yogi Adityanath Office (@myogioffice) December 30, 2019\n\nFinding a voice\n\nJafar, her sister said, had never tired of reinventing herself. She was a single mother to a 16-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. She was a school teacher for many years. She was a social activist and a poet.\n\nShe had helped organise the first LGBTQ pride parade in Lucknow. She had recently joined the Congress Party hoping that it would amplify her voice.\n\nVarma, a career counselor in Lucknow, is a Muslim who practices Buddhism. She married Raj Saran Varma, a Hindu, whose mother was Muslim. He died in 2016. They gave their daughter a Sikh name — Simran.\n\nPointing to a grey bust of Vladimir Lenin in the room, Varma said, We're basically commies, but right now communism in India is just about making noise without solutions.\n\nDissent and politics runs in the family, said Varma. Their father's brother S.M. Jafar was a renowned freedom fighter in Lucknow, who had worked alongside Mohandas Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose. Their grandfather's brother Syed Ali Zaheer was the law minister in Jawaharlal Nehru's first cabinet and India's ambassador to Iran. Their great grandfather was Sir Syed Wazir Hasan, a prominent jurist who served as the Chief Justice of the Awadh Court.\n\nHer father, a bank employee, only showed them one movie but he made them watch it three times when they were growing up, Varma recalled. That was Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. Many years later, they made him see Ashutosh Gowariker's Lagaan.\n\nHer father was one of five brothers, all of whom chose to stay in India following the Partition. One sister moved to Pakistan with her husband's family. They learnt how she had suffered from depression and died in a mental health facility in Karachi, almost a decade after her passing.\n\nWhen they say, 'Go back to Pakistan…' It's not just words to us. It's not just political. It's personal, she said. We have lived the pain and tragedy of separation.\n\nWe have lived the pain and tragedy of separation.\n\nJafar, Varma said, could never stand for injustice in her personal or professional life. She was fighting a long and difficult custody battle for her children. She loves teaching but often ended up leaving for challenging the management.\n\nJafar, her sister said, quit her job at a reputed school when the teachers were told to fill up the seats at a function organised by the BJP government, and when the students were told to line up and wave at the CM's cavalcade.\n\nSadaf is exceptional in many ways, said Varma. Things that people accept, a bad marriage or injustice at work — people say arre thoda sa adjust kar lo, arre udhar mat dekho bus apna kaam karo — she cannot do that. When it comes to her beliefs, she is uncompromising. She chooses to do the right thing over comfort and convenience.\n\nEver since Narendra Modi led the BJP to power in 2014, Jafar had spoken up on a host of issues involving minorities and Dalits. She spoke against the fees hike at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi and the disappearance of Najeeb Ahmed, who went missing from the JNU campus in 2016.\n\nShe wanted to make a difference. She wanted her voice to be heard, said Varma.\n\nShe wanted to make a difference. She wanted her voice to be heard.\n\nPaying the price\n\nThe charges against her sister, Varma believes, will eventually be dropped. She has faith in the higher courts of India. But the lifelong legal battle, which now lies ahead of them, will change their lives forever.\n\nFighting for bail is just the first step, she said. Sadaf's life is disrupted forever.\n\nKnowing her sister as she does, Varma believes Jafar will not be broken, but emerge stronger from her ordeal.\n\nIn any theocratic state, there is no place for women, she said. But we will not be silenced. This movement is spearheaded by women.
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a swing state progressive with strong ties to organized labor and a reputation as a rumpled representative for the working man, has decided not to enter the race to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nConnie and I have spent the last few months traveling around the country to make dignity of work a centerpiece of Democrats' 2020 campaign, and we are so grateful to everyone who has welcomed us into their communities and into their lives, Brown said in a statement, referring to his wife, journalist Connie Schultz. We've seen candidates begin taking up the dignity of work fight, and we have seen voters across the country demanding it – because dignity of work is a value that unites all of us. It is how we beat Trump, and it is how we should govern.\n\nI will keep calling out Donald Trump and his phony populism, the third-term senator continued. I will keep fighting for all workers across the country. And I will do everything I can to elect a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate in 2020. The best place for me to make that fight is in the United States Senate.\n\nCalls for Brown to run were quickly amplified after he easily won re-election in 2018, dispatching then-GOP Rep. Jim Renacci by a nearly 7-percentage-point margin. Brown was the only Democrat to win statewide in Ohio, a onetime presidential swing state where Trump romped in 2016.\n\nI will keep fighting for all workers across the country. And I will do everything I can to elect a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate in 2020. The best place for me to make that fight is in the United States Senate. Sen. Sherrod Brown\n\nIn his election night victory speech, Brown hinted at a presidential run.\n\nAs progressives, we know you build the economy from the middle out, by putting people first, by rewarding their work, not by cutting taxes for the rich, Brown said at the time. That is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018, and that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\n\nBrown is a career politician. He served in the Ohio state legislature from 1974 to 1982 and then won two terms as secretary of state before winning election to Congress from the Cleveland suburbs in 1992. He won his first Senate election in 2006 and then a hotly contested re-election bid in 2012.\n\nDuring that time, he built a reputation as a staunch liberal. He voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which outlawed gay marriage nationwide, in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, he opposed the United States' invasion of Iraq. He is considered perhaps Congress' fiercest critic of free trade agreements and wrote a book titled The Myths of Free Trade.\n\nBrown, a longtime supporter of Medicare for all, did decide not to sign on to legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) last year. Instead, he chose to focus on his own legislation aiming to lower the eligibility age for Medicare to 55.\n\nThe senator stands out as the highest-profile candidate from the industrial Midwest in the expected 2020 Democratic field. While President Barack Obama twice won the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa in his elections, Trump swept the region in 2016. For Democrats focused on appealing to the white working-class voters key to winning the Upper Midwest, Brown had a track record of success.\n\nDuring his journeys around the country exploring a bid – Brown had traveled to Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – he had pitched himself as a compromise candidate: Liberal enough to win over progressives, but with a track record of winning in a red-tinted state to assuage moderates' fears that a liberal candidate couldn't defeat the president.\n\nBrown's decision not to run may clear space in multiple lanes of the 2020 Democratic primary: Progressives, including Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, will face one fewer candidate pitching themselves as the solution to the county's rampant income inequality. But candidates who are arguing they are best positioned to defeat Trump – including Vice President Joe Biden, who is still weighing a run – may find themselves with less competition to win over moderate voters.\n\nHis decision not to run will come as a relief to other Senate Democrats – and not just because many of his colleagues are running for president. Had Brown won the presidency, GOP Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine would've selected a Republican to replace him in Congress' upper chamber. (This also makes it less likely the eventual Democratic candidate will select Brown as their vice presidential nominee.)\n\nBrown's decision makes him the third Democrat to rule out a presidential bid in recent days, following former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley.
When in doubt, procreate is essentially the Duggar family's motto, so we should really stop being surprised when a member of their small child army announces a new baby is on the way.\n\nThat being said, we did do a double take when Josh Duggar and his hero of a wife Anna announced on their family's website on Friday that they're expecting their fifth child together. The couple are already parents to Mackynzie, 7, Michael, 5, Marcus, 3, and Meredith, 19 months.\n\nIf you are trying to remember which Duggar Josh is, he's the one whose been at the center of a seemingly endless string of scandals over the past couple years, including the sexual molestation of underage girls, Ashley Madison-style adultery and addiction to pornography.\n\nFor nearly the last two years, we have quietly worked to save our marriage, focus on our children, and rebuild our lives together as a family. Doing so is never easy after a breach of trust, the pregnancy announcement begins. We've learned that a life of faith and rebuilding a life together is simply done one day at a time, the post continues.\n\nAs we continue our journey as a family and rebuild our lives, we are delighted to share with you that we are expecting a new baby boy later this year, the post continues. Beauty comes from ashes and we cannot wait to see and kiss the face of this sweet new boy!\n\nDuggar has largely stayed out of the public eye since completing a faith-based rehab treatment in 2015 following his various scandals. The last we heard from Duggar he was being sued by a man who claims the former reality star used his photo on OkCupid and Ashley Madison to meet women.\n\nA month later, the couple celebrated their eighth anniversary commemorated by a rare photo featuring the couple on the Duggar family's Facebook page, praising God's redemptive love in your lives.\n\nCongratulations?
If popular fiction books are to be believed, the world as we know it is definitely ending, and soon -- the only question is when, and how.\n\nA firm belief in an eminent doomsday isn't the only thing that keeps people reading dystopian fiction, of course -- it's also a neat means of examining the problems that exist in society today. The only problem with the Hunger Games-fueled trend? It's pretty much everywhere, and shows no signs of letting up soon.\n\nIf you're tired of reading and re-reading similar books about heroes overcoming corrupt governments in worlds that resemble our own, these dystopian books might offer something different from the norm. Behold:\n\nTwo Dollar Radio\n\nThe Only Ones by Carola Dibbell\n\nIf the compassionate themes and thrilling plot of Children of Men captivated you, Dibbell's novel might pique your interest, too. After a pandemic wipes out much of humanity, Inez is hired as a test subject, prized for her immunity-containing genes. Her work is risky, however -- a religious and violent group that opposes scientific work poses a threat, and when a woman she works with changes her mind about working with Inez, she's left with a child to care for, who she eventually grows to love and protect.\n\nRiverhead\n\nGold Fame Citrus by Claire Vaye Watkins\n\nWatkins recently said in an interview that her aim in creating a story about characters living in an apocalyptic wasteland was to make them self-aware -- almost worn tired of the whole dystopia cliche. She achieves that with Luz Dunn and her partner-in-everything Ray, who while away their days in an abandoned LA mansion before they meet a child who changes all that. Faced with the task of keeping a living thing safe, they set out on a journey through the expansive and expanding desert -- and meet some shady characters along the way.\n\nRestless Books\n\nA Planet for Rent by Yoss\n\nDystopia is powerful not only for predicting the future, but also for putting the problems with the present in a fresh context, allowing readers to see stripped-down versions of societal wrongs. That's exactly what Yoss does with his pithy critiques of Cuba, so searing that he wrote them under a pen name. In A Planet for Rent, aliens take over a planet and revamp it as a tourist spot.\n\nFarrar, Straus and Giroux\n\nFind Me by Laura van den Berg\n\nIn Find Me, the life as we know it isn't threatened by war or otherworldly forces, but by a strange, mystical disease that strikes suddenly and wipes out most of the population. Some, however -- including protagonist Joy -- find that they're immune. Incubated in a hospital with other survivors, Joy gets the idea to escape and find her mother, a relentless explorer who left her and many questions behind. It's as much a dystopian book as it is a road trip novel, and a poignant commentary on loneliness.\n\nLittle, Brown\n\nCalifornia by Edan Lepucki\n\nLike Watkins' novel, Lepucki's turns away from the broad scope of post-apocalyptic societies and instead looks at how a new living situation might effect the parties in one of the most personal relationships there is: a marriage. Cal and Frida have fled Los Angeles and are living in a ramshackle old house, blissfully happy and trading for supplies with an occasional visitor. But Frida's eventual boredom leads them to seek out a nearby settlement, and that's when the trouble begins.\n\nHenry Holt and Co.\n\nThe Beautiful Bureaucrat by Helen Phillips\n\nIf you're more interested in those writers working in the spare, weird camp of fantasy where Haruki Murakami and Steven Millhauser's work resides, Helen Phillips might be a great pick for you. As the title implies, Phillips's novel starts out as a story set in a slightly off-putting workplace, but as strange happenings keep getting stranger, protagonist Josephine begins to question just what she's signed up for. Think The Adding Machine meets 1Q84.\n\nNan A. Talese\n\nThe Heart Goes Last by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood has a penchant for facing contemporary problems head-on, exploring them through fictional stories set in the could-be near future. The Heart Goes Last is set amid an economic disaster that has antiheroes Charmaine and Stan living in a car, moving often to avoid threatening visitors. The solution, it seems, is a community that functions by allowing its citizens alternating months of comfort and willful imprisonment, doing the grunt work that keeps the small society functioning. Things go swimmingly for a while -- until they don't.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nPHOTO GALLERY 10 Sci-Fi And Fantasy Books To Explore
Pulling the covers around my neck, I snuggle into bed and feel my whole body melt. After working, plodding on the treadmill, picking up the kids, fixing dinner, giving baths and reading books, I'm spent. In the lightning-fast pace of the day, this might be the first time I've taken a deep breath. Still, I feel content. I stretch out and take up space. I don't mind being alone in my bed. In fact, I prefer it that way.\n\nI've been separated for about a year. There are challenges, but sleeping alone isn't one of them. I always desired more space in my marriage ― which is, in part, why I decided to leave it. For a long time, I wondered if I'd ever have the strength. I wondered if it would be too devastating for my kids, who are now 4 and 9. I worried about whether I'd be able to support myself financially. Friends gave me phone numbers for couples therapists, and we saw them. Three, in fact.\n\nStill, for the longest time, I felt that something needed to change.\n\nAt first, I thought it was something in me that needed shifting. So I committed to my health. I ate well and exercised. I cut back on drinking. I got yoga-certified and attacked my sleep issues from all angles. I was working my dream job of being a freelance writer, and with one child in school and the other in part-time childcare, I finally had the time to commit to it. I was finding success in most areas of my life. But I still wasn't happy. I felt pent-up, irritable and borderline depressed. At times, I thought, Maybe this is just what married life with two kids is. Maybe this is how everyone feels.\n\nI couldn't imagine being the person who tore our family in half, all for my own comfort. For years, the guilt I knew I would feel if decided I couldn't be married anymore kept me planted.\n\nI started to take a hard look at my life. I couldn't ignore that the main thing driving my discontent was that I felt unsatisfied in my marriage. Deep-diving into what was wrong meant I stopped holding back when I spoke to my husband. I railed against him about all kinds of things, like coming home late or being distracted by his phone. I was always on him for being unreliable. I let my anger come to the surface, and we had the same arguments over and over because I was no longer hiding my feelings about what I needed.\n\nBut the truth is, none of it really mattered. Deep down, I knew I wasn't happy in my marriage and probably never would be, regardless of what my husband did. But admitting the truth to myself, let alone to family, was painful. I couldn't imagine being the person who tore our family in half, all for my own comfort. For months, for years, the guilt I knew I would feel if I decided I couldn't be married anymore kept me planted. I was an unhappy mother, but one whose kids had a home with two parents. My kids didn't have to shuffle back and forth or divide holidays between two homes. And even though my husband and I were fighting more than ever, each of us suffering as a result, going our own ways felt impossible.\n\nFinally, I hit a breaking point. It happened just after my husband returned home from a week-long work trip. I had realized while he was gone that I didn't feel so angry all the time. I slept better, too. I knew I couldn't sacrifice my mental health any longer. I needed to make a change.\n\nWhat if I didn't try hard enough? What if we could've made it work? What if my own happiness wasn't worth the emotional strain I put on my husband and my two kids?\n\nA few months later, after rehearsing the conversation with myself over and over, I told my husband I didn't want to be married anymore. We moved forward, slowly and painfully. Telling the kids was crushing. My daughter ran into her room and sobbed, then hid her head under a pillow while continuing to cry and asking questions about what would happen next ― her biggest concern was whether each of us would get married again and if she'd have to share us with someone new.\n\nWe tried to make the transition as easy for the kids as possible. We rented an apartment for six months to swap in and out of. And when the lease ended, my husband moved out of our home and into a new house a few miles away. I was ready for the change, and after all the time spent preparing, it seemed like the kids were ready, too. They were even excited to decorate their new rooms. And as the months have gone by, they haven't complained about our new living arrangement. They've been more resilient than I could've possibly imagined. And yet, so much has changed. And each one of us has had to be brave in our own ways.\n\nI know it's all been for the best, but I still think about the what-ifs: What if I didn't try hard enough? What if we could've made it work? What if my own happiness wasn't worth the emotional strain I put on my husband and my two kids?\n\nOn quiet nights, before I drift off to sleep, that familiar feeling hits me. It's one I have to work hard to distract myself from; in the moment, I can't. I'm not lonely or struggling with my daily tasks. I'm not more overwhelmed by my life than I was when I was still in my marriage. Certain stresses have even been alleviated. But guilt still plagues me. I think about how I drove my family apart. I picture my husband alone in his home. I wonder if he's OK.\n\nMost single moms complain about the challenges of finding time to date, and about the shitshow that is modern dating if they do manage to find the time. They talk about being lonely, or about how much falls on them. They talk about financial burdens, affordable childcare, not having anyone to call to grab groceries. These are all realities of single parenthood, and they are hard ― it's true for me, too. But by far, the biggest hurdle I've had to face is how it makes me feel to know I was the one who left my marriage, the one who gave up, who called it quits, who knew I was ready to move on.\n\nThe truth is that I would be more gentle, more forgiving, with just about anyone else.\n\nI believe we're all better off in the long run, but I often can't get through the day without feeling bad that what broke my family was me needing something different. If I'd kept my mouth shut, found a way to be content in my life as it was, no one else would have suffered. My husband wouldn't have gone through all of the struggles he has dealt with over the past year. My kids wouldn't have to go back and forth between houses.\n\nKnowing that the end of my marriage was my choice feels like a weight so heavy that I might never know how to put it down.\n\nThe tug of guilt makes it tough to move on with my life in an intentional way. Every time I feel like I'm doing fine, it sucks me back in. It makes seeking joy hard because wondering if I deserve to be happy haunts me. I have to dig deeper just about all the time to get to the truth, even though it is so immensely hard to see.\n\nAnd the truth is that I would be more gentle, more forgiving, with just about anyone else. If another mother came to me and told me of her longstanding unhappiness in her marriage ― the feeling that she already knows what to do but can't find the strength to do it ― I would tell her to get out, that her happiness matters as much a everyone else's. I would never tell someone to stay for their partner, or even for their kids. When one person is deeply unhappy, the whole family suffers. I know all of this, but reminding myself of it is easier said than done.\n\nWhen I wake up the next morning, I'm not under the cloud of guilt anymore. And I know that the more I do it, the more natural it will become to allow myself to simply feel my feelings, good or bad, then let them go to make space for something new. After all, that's why I moved my life in a new direction to begin with ― to make space.\n\nI snuggle my kids, who are happy and content. I make my coffee, pack lunches and get everyone out the door. Then, I settle into my favorite coffee shop and a new feeling arises. I'm met with relief that I had the awareness, the strength, the commitment to change my life because it wasn't easy, but it was right. I know the guilt isn't over. I know it will bubble up again and I'll have to talk sense into myself, the same as I would my closest friend. I know I'll have to give myself compassion.\n\nI might always feel some guilt at changing the shape of my family, but I also know that I'll be a happier, healthier person ― and thus, a better mother ― because I did just that. That's what I come back to each time the guilt takes hold. And I know that the more firmly I ground myself in this new life, the more that waves of confidence in that will come.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story you want to share?

Last month, a Saturday Night Live sketch highlighted a very relatable pastime: scrolling through home listings on Zillow. The digital short presented a sultry commercial in which adults in their 30s get turned on while looking at houses they could buy.\n\nI'd never live in North Carolina, but if I did, I could buy a big, gross mansion, Daniel Levy coos.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the bit resonated with many people, especially millennials living in high-rent cities. Turns out, websites such as Zillow, Trulia and Redfin hit a little differently during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany singles in their 30s can't date, as the pandemic has made it hard, so they are looking to real estate porn to fill the gap, New York-based psychiatrist Lea Lis told HuffPost. They are wanting to escape from cities to a simpler, more green life. This has become more appealing for many, creating the mass exodus that cities like New York and Boston have experienced. The sketch is actually so funny and real, and humor is the best way to escape from the harsh reality which is 2020-21, including the COVID pandemic, loneliness and isolation.\n\nIndeed, Zillow reported record traffic to its website and mobile apps, as well as revenue booms, in 2020. But why exactly do people who aren't necessarily shopping for a new home love browsing real estate listings so much? Below, Lis and other mental health experts break down some of the reasons.\n\nBrowsing real estate provides escapist fantasy.\n\nWe have all enjoyed a daydream, and millions of us tune in to HGTV to watch someone else build, renovate or buy a home, said Kati Morton, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles and author of Are U Ok? A Guide to Caring for Your Mental Health.\n\nZillow is similar to those, but even more realistic, and it's a nice escape for us during this difficult time. With the continued stress of the pandemic, people are seeking various ways to escape the overwhelming reality, and Zillow is one very popular way to do that, Morton continued. You easily move from state to state, area to area, and imagine what it would be like to live in that home, critique the flooring or dated cabinets in the kitchen, and for a few minutes you can forget about the stress we are going through, the job loss, political issues or whatever upset you may be feeling.\n\nWithout movie theaters and concerts, people can turn to real estate websites for an escape. The added bonus is that online browsing is completely free and you can do it in the safety and comfort of your home.\n\nWe've all been stuck inside for an entire year and the concept of moving — even just the possibility — is exciting, said Kathryn Smerling, a psychotherapist in New York. We all fantasize about what it would be like to spend more time in another location with a hot tub by the ocean. There's an element of good health in fantasy — obviously not every day, but having these healthy fantasies can keep you going sometimes.\n\nIt breaks up the monotony.\n\nWe're all looking for something to break up the monotony of working from home, going for walks, cooking almost every meal and repeating the same process day after day. Some people find that escape through looking at home listings on sites like Zillow.\n\nFor a moment, we're not living in the same Groundhog Day that has become that loathsome phrase of 'the new normal' anymore, said Jenny Maenpaa, a New York-based psychotherapist.\n\nIf you're in a healthy state of mind, it can help you take your mind off the routine that you've established for yourself, Smerling said. However, it can also produce feelings of jealousy, which can make you feel angry. If this happens, then you should probably stop browsing.\n\nVoyeurism can be fun.\n\nDuring the pandemic, there aren't as many opportunities for people-watching, eavesdropping on conversations and other ways of getting a glimpse into strangers' lives. Scrolling through real estate listings may fill that void.\n\nThere is a healthy voyeurism to it, in the same way we watch reality TV and read people's money, food and sex diaries online, Maenpaa said. We get to look at houses staged by others, judge their taste and imagine ourselves either in their lives or the life we would design if we lived in that house.\n\nAs with any form of voyeurism, don't let Zillow browsing interfere with your own life.\n\nIt's really kind of fun to see how the other side lives, especially during the time of the haves and have nots, Smerling said. However, you have to be very careful that you aren't putting so much of your real energy that you can't function in your everyday life. It shouldn't take the place of functioning in the real world. But it is one of the pleasures you can have in moderation that does no harm to anyone else or yourself!\n\nThere's a chemical response.\n\nWhen a property or idea you like pops on your screen, your brain responds in the same way it would if you had found a gold nugget on the sidewalk, Bethany Cook, a clinical psychologist in Chicago, told HuffPost. A release of happy hormones surge through your body, which in turn boost your mood and overall feeling state.\n\nAlthough this burst of joy may seem good for your mental health, there can be a downside that should be taken into consideration.\n\nOverall, it is mostly negative to one's state and mind, Lis said. It will result in an instant dopamine burst of joy, followed by the crash.\n\nShe pointed to the moment in the SNL sketch when a Zillow browser actually calls a real estate agent and reality shatters the escapist fantasy. Getting too caught up in that fantasy can be detrimental to your mindset, she said. Check in on how you feel before, during and after your Zillow sessions.\n\nIt's easy to view your new life to be better than the one you already have, Lis added. It is the extreme form of 'keeping up with the Joneses.' Instead of living in the moment, you imagine yourself living someone else's life in another place — and in a better place — than the one you already have. It's kind of like social media. There is always someone thinner, prettier and more successful. There's always that stunning Colonial with better bushes than the one you already have.\n\nIt offers a sense of control.\n\nDuring these challenging and somewhat isolating times, several of my patients have reprioritized the importance of their homes and have begun searching home listing websites, said Desreen Dudley, a Connecticut-based clinical psychologist with the telemedicine platform Teladoc. Looking at homes online could be an escape of sorts, a hopeful way to look toward the future with excitement ― as well as a way to focus on what they can control during this tough time.\n\nIn times of uncertainty, humans crave control to feel a sense of power and agency in their lives. For many, reasserting control has stemmed from creating routines, learning to cook or doing craft projects. Others have thrown themselves into real estate and home improvement.\n\nA year ago, we were planning vacations and comparing Airbnbs with our friends and family to plan for our future fun. But for almost a year now, there has been no planning, no fun, no future that we feel safe counting on, Maenpaa said. Many of us haven't been able to even think about what travel or adventure looks like because we are stuck in our own four walls. It makes total sense then that we have turned that same planning eye to the one thing we can control right now, which is what those four walls could look like.\n\nWe want to feel like informed consumers.\n\nWe've grown up with the internet, so the ability to compare offers, find discount codes and publicly shame a company on social media to get the best deal has primed us to be careful, wary shoppers, Maenpaa said. Add that to our crippling student loan debt, and we are more likely to spend months or years searching for the perfect return on our investment instead of buying a starter home with the assumption we can upgrade in a few years.\n\nEndlessly scrolling through Zillow listings offers knowledge about the real estate market that makes us feel like more informed consumers ― and therefore more in control of our home-buying futures. In some ways, it may also provide a road map for making tangible goals and working toward them.\n\nIt could be the catalyst for you to start planning backward from this dream by saying to yourself, 'OK, I want to live in this city and in this kind of home, which seems to cost around this much for what I want. So to afford this life, I need to be making this salary, which in my field means this title. Or maybe I'm going to change careers because mine just won't get me there in the amount of time I want, so let me think about boosting my resume or adding a certification or skill in the near future,' Maenpaa said. And so on until you've gathered enough data about what it would take for you to achieve this next phase.\n\nThere may be unaddressed needs at play.\n\nHabitually browsing through sites like these might be a symptom related to a longing for making changes in one's life, whether the changes be a new home, a new career or even a new relationship, said Paula Durlofsky, a clinical psychologist in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, and author of Logged In and Stressed Out: How Social Media is Affecting Your Mental Health.\n\nTherefore, this behavior might represent an unmet emotional need that's looking to be met through misguided digital habits, Durlofsky continued. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's important to take the time to examine and acknowledge what's driving this behavior so you can find real solutions to your issues.\n\nIf you find yourself increasingly drawn to real estate websites, take the time to consider what you're really looking for. It could be a bigger home or simply a different home or something else entirely.
It's been three years since shy bookworm Lara Jean Covey and lax bro Peter Kavinsky blushed and flirted their way into our hearts in the Netflix smash To All The Boys I've Loved Before, a high school romantic comedy based on the YA book by Jenny Han. That first movie — as sweet and dreamily hued as a macaron from Lara Jean's own kitchen — made stars Lana Condor and Noah Centineo into heartthrobs and helped fuel a streaming rom-com mini-boom.\n\nRunning with the momentum of the original adaptation, Netflix quickly greenlit adaptations of the other two books in Han's trilogy. In 2020, they released the sequel, To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You. Now, just in time for Valentine's Day 2021, the final installment is hitting the streaming service.\n\nIn To All The Boys: Always And Forever, Lara Jean and Peter are nearing the end of their senior year and making plans for a future. Peter has been recruited to play lacrosse at Stanford, and Lara Jean (the stronger student of the two) is planning to enroll with him — as soon as she gets her acceptance. Though she's already dreaming of a four-year college idyll together, followed by marriage and a picket fence, she's also excited to study English literature and have new experiences. When she ends up at an NYU party during their class trip to New York City, Lara Jean starts to wonder if being near her boyfriend is the best way to pick a college. Oh, and of course, there's prom. And her father's wedding. And Peter's estranged father's reemergence in his son's life. And when will these two lovebirds take a step forward in their physical relationship?\n\nThere are a lot of threads to tie off in this bittersweet finale. But there's only one thing that matters: Does Always And Forever cast the same spell as To All The Boys I've Loved Before? Or would rewatching the first installment be a better way to spend a Valentine's Day under lockdown? HuffPost reporters Marina Fang and Claire Fallon got out their coziest blankets and a tray of freshly baked cookies to discuss.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTo All The Boys: Always And Forever fails to recapture the magic of the original, but it's perfectly fine weekend viewing.\n\nKatie Yu / Netflix Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) and Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) in the final installment of Netflix's To All the Boys rom-com trilogy.\n\nClaire Fallon: It's finally here! The last chapter of To All The Boys, the sweet capper on the Netflix depiction of the high school romance I wish I had. Three years ago, I fell so hard for the first film that I watched it over 20 times. Last year, on maternity leave, I managed one viewing of the cute-but-less-thrilling follow-up. And now, here we are, yet again seeking to escape from this cruel world into Lara Jean and Peter's softer one. The big question, Marina: Did it work for you?\n\nMarina Fang: I gotta say, it was pretty underwhelming. I, too, adored the first movie — it was charming as hell and thawed my cold, cynical heart. Its release came a time when the rom-com genre was having a renaissance, and it was a part of a wave of movies and TV that achieved the platonic ideal of becoming more inclusive and culturally specific without being strictly about that. But both follow-ups have lacked the inventiveness of the first movie, which was such a brilliant fusion of leaning into rom-com tropes while also playing around with them in bold, new ways. This one felt especially formulaic and saccharine. And even as a form of escapism, it didn't really deliver for me. I felt constantly at a remove and only minimally invested in it. It left me wondering if there's a limit to pandemic escapism, and whether it was the movie itself, hitting that pandemic wall where I can't tell up from down anymore, or a combination of both. Claire, where did you land on this one?\n\nThird Time Is Not A Charm\n\nClaire: Sadly, I agree. As much as I love a couple hours with Lana Condor and Noah Centineo, it's hard to capture that lightning in a bottle twice, let alone three times. There were cute moments (I did tear up here and there, maybe just because the idea of high school love is so foreign to my harried new-mom lifestyle), but it doesn't hang together enough that I could relax into it. I'd love to hear more about what you thought the first movie did that was missing here! Is it the plot? The writing? The music?\n\nMarina: All of the above, I think? To outline the plot, our adorable couple has reached the spring of their senior year and have to figure out whether they're going to try to stay together in college. I think I've seen this plot line far too much. There's only so much agonizing over college acceptances and planning elaborate promposals that I can take. Even Condor and Centineo's winsome chemistry wasn't enough to keep me interested. Yes, Peter continues to be the ideal Good Guy, supporting and respecting Lara Jean's choices, but I hate to say it: His charm has worn off a bit.\n\nKatie Yu / Netflix Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) channeling John Cusack from Say Anything ... \n\nThe Aesthetics & Music Cues\n\nMost surprisingly, the sunny aesthetics were even too much for me! In both the original and the first sequel, I paused the movie to admire, say, the wallpaper or a piece of furniture. (Holland Taylor's character lives in an absurdly glamorous assisted living facility.) But here, I just couldn't take it. There's a scene when Lara Jean and Peter go on a date at a bowling alley, and she lays out these pastel-colored pastries. Pastel-colored pastries. At a bowling alley. Too much.\n\nClaire, am I being too much of a killjoy?\n\nClaire: Ugh, I wish I thought so. The opulent, saturated visuals keep getting dialed up in every installment. I thought the first movie was perfect eye candy; the assisted living facility severely tested me. This one almost felt feverish. The musical cues also went over-the-top for me. I still listen to some favorites from the soundtrack of the first movie — and, as a millennial, I bopped happily to the opening number (Girls' Generation's Gee was a hot thing when I was in college! 12 years ago! it still bangs!). But for the most part the songs were heavy-handed, like they were being used to glue together a narrative that didn't quite feel cohesive. When Lara Jean dreams about her heteronormative fantasy future with Peter to the ear-shattering strains of Wannabe, I rolled my eyes — and I am the queen of heteronormative fantasy futures! It was all a little unsubtle.\n\nThe Limitations Of Rom-com Sequels\n\nLet's dig more into the plot. It certainly lacked the freshness of the original — and at 32, I may want to relive first love, but I certainly don't want to relive college acceptance season. (Not the movie's fault, though it's true.) Mostly, it just didn't feel strongly plotted to me. The movie starts with Lara Jean and her sisters exploring their mother's culture in a spring break trip to South Korea, and weaves together threads about prom, her father's wedding to cool neighbor Trina, and Lara Jean's rejection from Stanford, where Peter has been recruited to play lacrosse. Ultimately, the great obstacle of the movie becomes her curiosity about going to school in New York rather than trying to stay close to Peter. It felt a bit disjointed to me, and the urgency of the two characters getting together was gone. I've written before that I don't really believe in rom-com sequels, and I definitely felt that here. What did you think about how the narrative hung together?\n\nMarina: 100% agree. It was too fragmented. You bring up a good point about whether rom-com sequels are even effective, and I'm struggling to come up with a rom-com movie franchise that actually held together from installment to installment. As a writer or creator, there's only so much you can do: Maybe add a love triangle, insert a second (or third) round of will-they-won't-they intrigue, have the couple grapple with how their professional ambitions affect the relationship, etc. If the couple is married, maybe add some marital tension. What are some other reasons rom-com sequels generally don't work, and was it inevitable that this one wouldn't work?\n\nClaire: I think you're right about the central flaw — options for a second and third story are limited and unsatisfying. A rom-com is about two people falling in love, and once they're together, that story has been told. You can separate them or create a huge obstacle for them to overcome, but typically this also lessens the perceived strength of their connection. The emotional payoff when they make it work again is smaller. For some reason, this bothers me more in a movie than in other formats. I read the Jenny Han books on which the movies are based after seeing the first film, and the movies are reasonably faithful to the source material. But where a book can get away with just letting us spend some more time with characters we love, navigating their changing relationship in an episodic fashion, a genre movie calls for a strong cohesive arc. It's difficult to conjure that for a story about a relationship hitting the skids and then recovering.\n\nI don't think it was entirely inevitable, though. The book, I thought, made more out of the question of physical intimacy alongside the question of a looming long-distance relationship, which grounded the conflict more in their romantic connection. Instead, their first experience of sex is a very rushed afterthought.\n\nWere there any bright spots for you in Always and Forever? Or any other random gripes?\n\nMarina: I did like that we got to see our characters in new locales. The movie begins with the Coveys visiting Seoul during spring break, and later, there's a senior class trip to New York. As much as romanticizing New York is such a rom-com cliché, it definitely made me miss pre-pandemic times. Also, I've always liked the dynamic between the Covey sisters, and we get more of that here.\n\nKatie Yu/Netflix The Covey sisters (from left to right): Kitty (Anna Cathcart), Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and Margot (Janel Parrish).\n\nSo, Should You Watch It?\n\nClaire: It hurts me to say this: I think this one can safely be skipped. No judgment, of course, if you want to spend a few hours of your weekend watching Peter Kavinsky and Lara Jean Covey making eyes at each other in slightly different settings than in the original film.\n\nMarina: If you've been a To All the Boys devotee/completist, then by all means, fire up Netflix and watch it while wrapped in a cozy blanket. It's adequately watchable weekend viewing, but not a must-see.\n\nTo All the Boys: Always and Forever is now streaming on Netflix.
By Shannon Ullman\n\nWe've been together for 13 years and we have no intention of getting married. Ever. While many of our friends are tying the knot, we've been busy making other life plans.\n\nShannon Ullman\n\nMarriage isn't something that we're putting off. It's just something that we've decided not to participate in. Here's why.\n\n1. It doesn't add anything useful to our lives.\n\nWhen I think about marriage, I can't think of anything useful that it brings to my life. After 13 years together, Josh and I are already committed to each other. It wouldn't serve as a barrier against breaking up because... divorce. It won't make our future children's lives easier to understand because we don't plan on having any. It won't help either one of us become more financially stable, because we both have jobs and have been splitting costs 50/50 since our teens.\n\n2. A wedding would be a waste of our money and time.\n\nIt only costs $80 to get legally married in Philadelphia where we live. No big deal. A wedding, though? Prices can get pretty outrageous. And neither of us have parents who could help pay for the event. Sure, we could have our moms make the food, brew our own beer, and thrift all the decorations. But even a wedding on an extreme budget costs money and time.\n\nJosh and I are both trying to advance our careers, build businesses, pay off debt, make smart investments, save money, and still have the time and capital left over to enjoy ourselves. I can't think of any worthwhile reason to have a wedding, even if it somehow only cost $100. Our friends and family know that we love each other. We can celebrate it with a house party if we wanted to.\n\nOh, and I can't forget to mention the insane cost of engagement rings. The price of most rings could probably pay off my student loans or put a down payment on a new rental property. And, to me, that seems way more romantic than a stone on my finger.\n\nShannon Ullman\n\n3. It would be a burden for our loved ones.\n\nHave you ever played an important role in someone else's wedding? If you have, you may have found it to be a lot of work. Maybe you like that kind of thing. That's totally fine. But, from my experience, other peoples' weddings cost a lot of money and time.\n\nOur friends are paying off student debt and trying to build lives for themselves. Our parents barely have enough money to cover their own bills. The last thing we want to ask them is to buy dresses, suits, and give us gifts. Sure, it would be awesome to party with all of our friends and family, but we could just as easily invite everyone over for a BBQ in our backyard.\n\nShannon Ullman\n\n4. We both come from divorced families.\n\nOur parents' divorces didn't make us lose faith in love. If anything, it taught us what NOT to do in a relationship. What divorce did do was show us that marriage doesn't mean much when divorce is such an accessible option. It also showed us that marriage doesn't make a relationship happy or better. In fact, we learned that marriage was pretty insignificant when it came to whether our parents were happy or unhappy in their relationships.\n\nMy aunt and uncle have been together longer than anyone I know and they were never married. My dad has been with his girlfriend for five years and is happier than he ever was while married. My mom was with her boyfriend for thirteen years and was miserable. There are all kinds of situations with relationships, but marriage, from my experience, doesn't seem to play any role in whether they are good ones or not.\n\n5. We don't care about social norms.\n\nGet married just because that's what I'm supposed to do? No thanks. It doesn't matter to me what everyone else does when it comes to marriage. I try to live my life based on my own beliefs and goals. I'm not getting married, no matter how disappointed or uncomfortable it makes someone else.\n\nShannon Ullman\n\nLet's be clear, we don't hate marriage or people who get married. I mean, Josh is a wedding photographer who SERIOUSLY loves his job. Whatever meaning or value that you personally put on marriage is your business. If you think marriage is the most sacred and beautiful thing in the world, then it is. It's a concept that is yours to define.\n\nAll I can say is that I hope you've given your stance on marriage some thought before you invest your money, time, and emotions into the process.
Dave and Les Jacobs via Getty Images Taking on a big trip together can help you learn how your partner reacts to challenges and new environments.\n\nBuilding a strong foundation for marriage or another long-term committed relationship doesn't happen in an instant. There are certain experiences couples go through over time that help them understand each other on a deeper level.\n\nWe date and spend time together to figure out if a person is right for us, but time together is important also because the experiences that we have together build a bond, piece by piece, marriage and family therapist Becky Whetstone told HuffPost. The bonds are what helps the relationship withstand good times and bad.\n\nSo ideally, what things should a couple go through together before taking a walk down the aisle? We asked marriage experts for their suggestions. (Note that what's listed below are just that — suggestions. Every relationship is different, so this is by no means a be-all, end-all checklist.)\n\n1. Take a big trip together.\n\nWhether you opt for a road trip across the U.S. or spend a few weeks backpacking through Southeast Asia, you need to see how it feels to truly rely on your partner when navigating novel experiences together. How do they cope with challenges like a flat tire or being immersed in a society without the ability to communicate in English? Are they able to roll with the punches and stay positive, or do they get pessimistic, moody or unreliable? This can be a litmus test for how they deal with the challenges that will arise later in life. ― Spencer Scott, psychologist\n\n2. Successfully resolve a big argument.\n\nCan you talk about things in a mutually respectful way? Can you communicate and collaborate without shutting down, attacking, blaming or getting defensive if you don't immediately get your way? Or can you notice such reactions and then take a breath, step back, soothe yourself and continue the conversation? Can you arrive at some solution that feels okay to both of you? Facing and working through differences and conflicts creates an important foundation for your relationship going forward. If you can't deal with conflicts at some point during dating, then how can you expect to deal with inevitable conflicts that arise in even the best relationships after marriage? ― John Amodeo, marriage and family therapist and author of Dancing with Fire: A Mindful Way to Loving Relationships\n\n3. Have an in-depth conversation about your childhoods and family histories.\n\nUnderstand who your partner is and what they believe in. Spend time understanding one another's history, learn about their family, what they loved and didn't love along the way. Are they open or closed off? Do they believe they should put their parents above the marriage? What do they value and believe in? The more you know and understand about each other, the more solid your relationship will be. ― Becky Whetstone\n\n4. Make a shared budget and stick to it.\n\nFinances are the No. 1 reason partners who share a household fight. Before commitment, you need to know if you can rely on your partner to stay true to a budget and effectively manage your shared pool of money. It might be a good idea to start small, like agreeing how much money you want to spend as a couple one weekend, then trying to have fun within that set limit. ― Spencer Scott\n\n5. Hit a rough patch — like a job loss, health scare or other stressful event — and come out the other side.\n\nIt's easy to love when things are going well. However, it's the thunderstorms and difficulties that arise that show us if the relationship is based on real love or infatuation. Ultimately, in every relationship, frustrations happen, storms arise and our unhealed wounds come out of the shadows for healing. It is important to have a 'rough waters' game plan when the inevitable problems, fears, anger or regressions hit. Nothing builds trust more than a good storm. That's when you learn what you are made of, how secure the relationship really is, and how committed you both are. When it gets tough, do you fall apart, run away or hold hands and talk it out? ― Sheri Meyers, marriage and family therapist\n\n6. Go to couples therapy.\n\nCouples need to take the time to learn from someone that solidly understands the dynamics [of communication in a relationship]. The goal is to be able to transmit and receive messages in a way that remains respectful and doesn't damage the relationship. This sounds easy and simple, but it isn't ― especially when people are sensitive and tend to get feelings hurt or take things personally. ― Whetstone\n\n7. Live together.\n\nYou'll be able to find out how you live together, how compatible and how tolerant you can be toward one another. Sharing a living space will help you figure out what annoys and upsets you in regard to your differences, needs and priorities and whether the two of you can manage and accept them. Also, when you live together, you realize the importance of teamwork and respect while dealing with chores and responsibilities.\n\nManaging shared lives is much more difficult than managing life by yourself. Through the experience of living together, you get to know your partner and yourself better. You are forced to develop boundaries, intimacy and relationship skills and hopefully you move toward personal growth. ― Moshe Ratson, marriage and family therapist\n\n8. Go through a sexual rut. Then be willing to talk about it.\n\nWhile it's natural for couples to experience peaks and valleys in their sex lives, when a valley happens or stays too long, hurt, disappointments and rejection creep in. If your partner is starting to feel more like a roommate than a lover, this is a prime opportunity to come together and talk truth, all masks off about your desires, turn-ons and sexual expectations. How much sexual contact do you both want? What makes you feel connected and intimate? What are you going to do on the 'off' days? What do you each need to feel desired? How much experimentation is allowed?
Love must be as much a light, as it is a flame.\n\n- Henry David Thoreau\n\n\n\nPerforming a wedding ceremony is a blessing for me. I love the weddings I officiate, and the couples I meet for them.\n\nFirst of all, I am romantic. Witnessing two people who love each other, make the commitment to their partnership, touches me. The loving they express re-awakens love in their guests for their own loved ones. A wedding is a great family occasion.\n\nBut I am also practical. It takes more than romance to make a good marriage, and even a good wedding. Vows need to reflect your daily priorities and values, how you will use challenges to deepen your love, the strengths and qualities you will express to enrich your partnership.\n\nWhat can you do to bring lightness into the dark moments that life sometimes presents? Do you have a strategy for challenging episodes? How practically can a blessing of Light make a difference?\n\nA blessing of Light in your wedding ceremony introduces a special quality to the occasion. This blessing is simple and gentle yet powerful. The Light brings the gift of levity and joy to the emotions, wisdom and understanding to the mind.\n\nHere are 5 ways you can bless your marriage with a light touch.\n\n1. Laugh\n\nDear friends of mine have a very challenging family condition. I never hear them bemoaning their lot. They are light-hearted and always find something to laugh about. They are a joy to spend time with.\n\nWhen you see the funny side in a situation, humour is very healing. Joy turns a seeming tragedy into a story you will laugh about in the future.\n\nAngels can fly because they take themselves lightly.\n\nScottish saying\n\n2. Celebrate\n\nKeep you eyes focussed on the qualities you love in your loved one. What is special about him or her that most touches you? How does he or she show their love for you? What do you love about your partnership?\n\nIn the height of romance, you may put your beloved on a pedestal, a being who can do no wrong. None of us is perfect. One groom recently vowed that although his bride was not perfect, they had their differences, but he loved her imperfections.\n\nThere are no prizes for noticing the negative. Bad news is abundant. Yet there is so much good, especially in you and in your loved one. Celebrate yourselves often.\n\n3. Accept\n\nAcceptance starts the process of resolving issues, and restoring well-being and happiness. Co-operating and communicating with each other to produce a solution leads to greater understanding, bringing with it wisdom.\n\nKeep in mind the Serenity Prayer.\n\nGod, grant me the Serenity to\n\nAccept the things I cannot change,\n\nCourage to change the things I can, and\n\nWisdom to know the difference.\n\n4. Learn\n\nIf you are feeling challenged, it is worth asking: what are we to learn here? And how can we love the lesson? How can we love ourselves through the process of learning?\n\nConsider: Everything that comes to you is for you. Lifting above the fog of the unknown possibilities will give you perspective. Be open to see clearly the blessing in every situation.\n\nThe spiritual Light will assist you. Ask for it to bless you, bearing in mind the highest good of all concerned.\n\n5. Appreciate\n\nDrs Ron and Mary Hulnick, highly respected authors and founders of the University of Santa Monica, speak about how they end a day. Each shares 3 things they have appreciated about themselves and the other during the day. It is a great way to fall asleep.\n\nFeelings of gratitude can invoke the lightness of warmth, comfort and a sense of security. An attitude of gratitude is a gift you can give to each other. Appreciation for yourself and your loved one will enrich you with more contentment and peace throughout your marriage.\n\nOn the most romantic day of your lives, remember your love is as much the light, in both of you, as it is the flame that brings you together. Your light never goes out.\n\nFor your Anne Naylor Wedding and more suggestions for creating the Wedding of your dreams go here
1 / 28 Daniel Radcliffe\n\nIn an interview with <a href=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daniel-radcliffe-friend-zone-buzzfeed_n_5530873 target=_blank>Buzzfeed Brews</a> in June 2014, Radcliffe discussed his views on the friend zone: Have you ever heard a girl say she's in the friend zone? It's a thing I think men need to be really careful about using... Do I think men and women can be friends? Yes, absolutely. Do I think men and women who are sexually attracted to each other can just be friends? Eh, it will probably become an issue at some point whether you deal with it, and talk about it and just move on, but it will always sort of get dealt with eventually… I definitely think the idea of friend zone is just men going, 'This woman won't have sex with me.'\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images
GOP lawmakers in Utah have unveiled a bill meant to protect LGBTQ kids from conversion therapy ― a dangerous and discredited practice that attempts to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nRepublican state Reps. Craig Hall and Dan McCay introduced the bill on Thursday in the state legislature. The proposed law would prohibit therapists from trying to change, eliminate, or reduce behaviors, expressions, attractions, or feelings related to a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity. Therapists who flout this rule could potentially lose their license.\n\nAdvocates hailed the bill as a milestone in conservative Utah, where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which condemns same-sex relationships, has considerable political influence.\n\nChurch officials indicated earlier this week that they would not oppose the bill, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThere is a growing scientific and medical consensus in America that conversion therapy is damaging and ineffective. People of faith are seeing that, said Troy Williams, executive director of Equality Utah, an LGBTQ advocacy group that has made passing the ban a top priority.\n\nConversion therapy, sometimes called reparative therapy, refers to attempts to change a person's sexual orientation. The practices can range from talk therapy to electric shock therapy, the AP reports. Although this therapy doesn't happen as overtly as it has in the past, varieties of it still persist.\n\nIn a 2009 report, the American Psychological Association found no evidence that performing conversion therapy on minors can ultimately alter sexual orientation. APA researchers did, however, find some evidence indicating the practice had negative side effects, including depression, suicidality and anxiety.\n\nStephenie Larsen is the founder of Encircle, a LGBTQ resource center in Provo that is also one of the largest providers LGBTQ-specific therapy in Utah. Larsen told HuffPost that conversion therapy is a damaging and harmful practice.\n\nThis is a huge step forward for Utah, Larsen said about the bill.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Republican Rep. Dan McCay, one of the sponsors of a bill that would prohibit practicing conversion therapy on minors, speaks during a news conference at the Utah State Capitol on Feb. 21, 2019, in Salt Lake City.\n\nFor decades, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints taught that queer people could be cured of same-sex attractions. More recently, the church has denounced conversion therapy and the idea that homosexuality is a sin. However, it still maintains that same-sex relationships are sinful and that Mormons in those relationships are apostates. LGBTQ members who want to remain in good standing with the church are expected to either commit to a lifetime of celibacy or marry partners of the opposite sex.\n\nNotably, the Utah bill contains an exception for religious counseling. It explicitly does not apply to a clergy member or religious counselor who is primarily acting in a pastoral or religious capacity and not in the capacity of a health care professional.\n\nStill, some advocates were concerned about the language of the bill. Jennifer Pizer, law and policy director for LGBTQ advocacy group Lambda Legal, said the bill suggests a licensed health professional who also is a clergy member can engage in pastoral counseling according to religious teachings, contrary to what they are permitted to do as licensed therapists. Although she supports the bill as a step in the right direction, Pizer said she is concerned that this language invites blurring between the roles of clergy and licensed mental health professionals.\n\nThe concern here is that those roles should be kept fully, cleanly distinct, Pizer told HuffPost. The cost will be borne by those who are confused, and subject themselves to harmful treatment thinking it's mental health care.\n\nHowever, Williams insisted that the bill's language doesn't include a religious exemption.\n\nLike every other state conversion therapy law, our bill only applies to licensed healthcare professionals. The state does not regulate clergy, Williams said. To do so would violate First Amendment protections.\n\nLisa Dame is the vice president of Mama Dragons, a group of largely Mormon mothers who advocate on behalf of their LGBTQ children. Dame, who lives in Sandy, Utah, told HuffPost that she doesn't think the clergy exception undermines the effectiveness of the bill.\n\nIt is for licensed professionals only, who are regulated by the state, Dame said. Clergy can not be monitored in the same way that a professionally licensed therapist can be.\n\nGeorge Frey via Getty Images A pride flag flies in front of the historic Salt Lake Temple in Utah, on November 14, 2015 in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nUtah's bill is part of a nationwide campaign pushing for states to ban conversion therapy. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have outlawed the practice to date.\n\nThe campaign has received some pushback from those who believe conversion therapy bans violate free speech and the right to religious freedom.\n\nEquality Utah sees the bill as a way to address Utah's suicide rates, which are the fifth highest in the country. Williams said his group worked with the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the Human Rights Campaign, The Trevor Project, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention to craft the bill's language.\n\nFor over a decade we have been actively engaging the LDS Church in dialogue over LGBTQ issues, Williams said. While we disagree on many issues like marriage equality, it's clear that we share a common goal to see young people live happy and healthy lives.\n\nDame said the Mama Dragons also see the effort as a suicide prevention bill.\n\nWe have seen firsthand in our community, the damage that is done with the mental health of people who have undergone these therapies, Dame said.  We believe that our children are perfect as they are.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Dating-based reality television shows are notoriously whitewashed. (See: The entire Bachelor universe.) But on Netflix's new hit show Love Is Blind, the epic, sweeping love story that fans can't stop swooning over has a Black woman at its center.\n\nLauren Speed, a 32-year-old content creator from Michigan, and Cameron Hamilton, a 28-year-old data scientist from Maine, met and fell in love during the dating experiment, in which a group of men and women are put into pods and left to speed-date for hours over the course of 10 days. The catch? They can't physically see each other until they're engaged.\n\nWell, Speed and Hamilton made that commitment, then met in person, and subsequently moved in together in Atlanta. Then, 38 days after their initial introduction, they made their way down the aisle and actually said I do in front of a slightly nervous group of family and friends.\n\nSpeed and Hamilton's love captivated viewers, who have continued to champion them in the days following the Season 1 finale episode. During an interview on HuffPost's Here To Make Friends podcast this week, the happy couple said they are humbled by and beyond grateful for all the support they've received.\n\nBeing in an interracial relationship, I wanted to really just live my life authentically, Speed told hosts Leigh Blickley and Emma Gray. I wanted to talk about, 'What about our children?' ... It's sad. I mean, we are in 2020, so it really shouldn't be an issue, but it's real life.\n\nWe had to have these conversations about parenting in a mixed relationship, Hamilton added. Children who are mixed, how they're going to be treated by society, what are other kids going to say to them at school, and how are we going to parent them when they're being perceived as Black and are going to have different experiences than me as a white man? That was something that was critical for us to touch on, not because of the show, but because we were about to get married.\n\nSpeed also acknowledged how important it is for other women to see a Black woman as the lead of a dating show, especially one who doesn't fit the mold of what they've come to expect on their screens.\n\nYou don't see a lot of Black women in reality TV being the object of affection or in the forefront or being admired, she said. I'm a quirky, kind of nerdy Black girl. Kind of awkward, too. So it's great because a lot of people are seeing me and I feel like I'm representing a thing that wasn't there before.\n\nIn this edited interview, Speed and Hamilton talk all things Love Is Blind, and share their insider perspective on the process that brought them to each other.\n\n―――――\n\nCameron and Lauren, how has it been? Just getting all of this amazing feedback and love from people who have binge-watched Love Is Blind?\n\nLauren: Oh man! It's really super amazing, especially because for Cameron and I, we took this super seriously. We were both very vulnerable and that's scary, especially if you're being vulnerable in front of the world. So we're so honored that the world not only can identify with our story and relate, but that they appreciate it.\n\nWere you a little skeptical going into the whole thing?\n\nLauren: Yeah. I was definitely open to it just because I was at a point in my dating life where it kind of sucked. Let's be honest. So I was just like, what do I have to lose? Go there and meet somebody great? And plus my mom was kind of putting the pressure on me like, You're getting old, Lauren. I mean, what's the worst that can happen.\n\nCameron: We were skeptical, but we went into it with an open mind. And at first it felt a little bit artificial, but I think once Lauren and I met each other and we had this first initial conversation about family, the reality of it struck immediately and then we really started taking it very seriously.\n\nDAMON DAHLEN/HUFFPOST; PRODUCED BY CHRISTY HAVRANEK/HUFFPOST\n\nCan you explain the structure of the pods and how much time you actually got together to talk? How many times per day?\n\nLauren: So we started off with 15 on each side ― girls and guys. And the pods are like these mystical meditation chambers, as we like to call them. So the more people that were there, you get less time dating. But as it whittled down, if you didn't make a connection with someone then, of course, that was that. But we would have these ranking lists, so you would just say your top five, like out of all of the people that you dated they would match up like, OK, these two made a connection. That's how it will go on. And Cameron was always my top.\n\nCameron: Yeah, we were No. 1 on each other's list every day.\n\nLauren: But as time went on, we would have longer dates, even up to four hours. And we're talking about multiple dates a day, so there would be times when we would be on 16-hour dates.\n\nWhat are some conversations that maybe couldn't make it into the narrative that you wish people had gotten to see?\n\nCameron: Yeah, we talked about how we would raise kids together and sort of have similar family values. We talked about spirituality; we talked about family life ...\n\nLauren: Political views.\n\nCameron: Finances.\n\nLauren: All the stuff you don't talk about on a first date.\n\nHonestly, all the things that I would love to see more of on reality TV.\n\nCameron: It was just a matter of time, really. But there was a lot of complexity to our relationship that there just wasn't enough time to show it.\n\nWhen you first saw each other, what was that moment like and did anything really surprise you about the way you each looked?\n\nLauren: Well, I was a nervous wreck just because I'm just like, OK, this is going to be my fiancé. First off, I'm thinking, what if he doesn't like what I look like?\n\nCameron: Come on!\n\nLauren: I mean, but that's a real thing. Just 'cause everyone's taste is different, though. But when I saw him, I was just like, oh, he's so cute. He looks like a prince. When I say he looks like Prince Charming, to me, literally that's what I felt. And it wasn't even just about how he physically looked. It was just like, man! He has all the qualities that I wanted in my husband. So to me, that's my Prince Charming. Like, how did you get so perfect? And it was just unreal.\n\nCameron: Yeah, it was a very surreal moment. I felt like I couldn't really even trust my eyes at that moment.\n\nLauren: Oh yeah. His eyes were wandering.\n\nCameron: That's true.\n\nI'm sure the sweat was just pouring down. I'd be so nervous.\n\nLauren: Oh yeah, he was a wreck.\n\nCameron: Yeah. 'Cause we're waiting in front of those reveal doors to open for some time. It could have been an eternity.\n\nLauren: I feel like they stretched it out 2,000 years. We were waiting.\n\nCameron: Yeah. I was standing there, just chanting her name. I don't know why.\n\nLauren: What? You were?\n\nCameron: Well, 'cause I was going to, as you saw, re-propose to Lauren now that she could see me, so I wanted it to be, I don't know ... I was just saying Lauren Michelle Speed. Lauren Michelle Speed.\n\nLauren: Oh, Cameron! You never told me that!\n\nCameron: I never told you that?\n\nLauren: That's cute, babe.\n\nDAMON DAHLEN/HUFFPOST; PRODUCED BY CHRISTY HAVRANEK/HUFFPOST\n\nNow that you guys got to know each other in the pods, you met in person, you're re-engaged and then you're whisked off to a vacation. What was the vibe like that first night when you guys were together in person trying to figure out your connection?\n\nCameron: Like I said on the show, it was like waking up from a dream to a dream and I mean that sounds corny, but it's true. I really couldn't believe it. I was trying to process it.\n\nLauren: Yeah. We literally couldn't keep our hands off each other and I'm awkward anyway. So I've seen comments hover where people were like, Lauren is so awkward around cameras. No, I'm just awkward, in general. So yeah ... We've built this connection and we've talked, we've had all these deep conversations and I already love you and now I'm meeting you for the first time and I'm able to touch you and rub your skin and hold your face and look into your eyes. So we were just head over heels.\n\nAnd what was the process like of actually combining belongings and moving into an apartment together?\n\nLauren: For me, it was kind of a struggle at first. I'm not going to lie, because at that point in my life I was kind of a hermit. I was independent; I enjoyed my own space. I had my own business and my dating life wasn't really that good. So I was kind of used to being by myself. So having to move in with someone ― I've never lived with a man before, besides my family ― so having to share a space and just being there with each other all the time was something that I had to get used to. And Cameron is very affectionate with that, which I appreciate, but I had to learn how to be, I guess, comfortable with sharing that space 'cause that was different for me. So it was definitely a transition.\n\nCameron: And I didn't want to push too hard for her to move in and I knew how much her space really meant to her. So it was tough too because I was really excited for her to move in, but I didn't, I don't want to force anything.\n\nLauren: You know, it's like when you're set in your ways, 'cause I'm in my 30s. So that's kind of where I was. But of course it worked out fine. Cameron was super patient with me. He's like, Take your time. It's all good. I know when you need space, let me know. So it was good. We definitely got through it.\n\nYeah, I remember when you were on Cameron's ― well, it's now your house, I'm assuming ...\n\nLauren: Yes it is. It's our house.\n\nBut you were outside on the deck and you said, But can I keep my apartment?\n\nLauren: Oh yeah, I did! 'Cause that was scary to me! Like, wait! I have to get rid of my place and move in ... Like I said on the show, that's my sanctuary. I'm a loner. I love being in my space, having my music, just being weird, whatever. And so the thought of that was terrifying to me 'cause I was like, oh my God, this is a complete change. In a way, I felt like I was going to be uprooted even though that's not necessarily the truth. It's kind of like I was growing. I wasn't being uprooted. But I ended up getting rid of my place. Of course, I kept it for three months after we got married because I still needed that. I needed that transition. I couldn't just go cold turkey. That's a lot for me. And Cameron was super supportive with that too, so it was great.\n\nCameron: Yeah. One thing I learned was that when I'm able to give her her space, she just feels happier. And it's not like it's something that she needs all the time, but I learned that just giving her that space is how she recharges her batteries, so to speak. And of course we, like any married couple, are continually building our relationship. But that was one thing that I had to learn pretty quickly and I'm thankful that I did.\n\nAnd how was it with your friends and family when you guys were like, Hey, doing this thing, see you in a while. Might come back engaged?\n\nLauren: Mostly, people were definitely skeptical at first. But I feel like our friends and family trust us and they know that we're both kind of good judges of character. So they're like, If you feel like this then let's see what happens. Well, at least my family and friends for sure. They were like, This is crazy but OK, I support you.\n\nOh, your parents are my faves. Papa Speed had me bawling at your wedding.\n\nLauren: Oh girl, I was too. I cannot watch that scene with me and my father without crying every time. If you played it now, I would start crying just because me and my father, we've always been so close. I'm a daddy's girl, for sure. And so it really meant a lot to me for him to just embrace this. Like, this is my husband and I know we met in an odd way, but him grilling Cam, I feel like that's anything that any protective father would do for his kid.\n\nCameron: Yeah. I would have done the same.\n\nLauren: So it was nerve-wracking, for sure. But I feel like that's one of the passages to your daughter's partners. You kind of have to go through that.\n\nYeah. Lauren, you left the room [for that conversation], too...\n\nLauren: For sure, they needed to have a man-to-man.\n\nCameron: It was a necessary one.\n\nSo on the day of your wedding, did you both go into it being like, I'm saying yes?\n\nLauren: You know what? For me, it was scary. It was a huge commitment. So it's definitely something that I thought about for a long time. But, for the most part, I knew. But like I said, it's a scary thing. So even as I was in my wedding dress, I'm just like, OK, Lauren, are we really about to do this? 'Cause we're talking lifelong commitment here. But eventually I got up out of my own head and listened to my heart and was like, yeah! We're not messing this up, girl.\n\nCameron: It was very fast by most measures. But you all know that I was going to say yes. I think that was pretty clear.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost; Produced by Christy Havranek/HuffPost\n\nSo on our podcast, we talk about several reality dating shows, but focus primarily on The Bachelor. And shows like The Bachelor are kind of notoriously overwhelmingly white and obviously you guys are an interracial couple. You became kind of the central love story of this juggernaut reality TV show. I'm wondering if that's something that either of you thought about while filming and how you've been conscious of that as the show has aired and you've seen the response.\n\nLauren: Well, for me, it was definitely something that I knew had to be addressed. Being in an interracial relationship, we can't just ignore that because it's something that's real and we live in a real world and it is what it is.\n\nSo I wanted to really just live my life authentically. I wanted to share my concerns. I wanted to talk about, What about our children? My friends and peers, what would they think? This is new for me. And it's sad, I mean, we are in 2020, so that really shouldn't be an issue, but it's real life. You know what I mean? So watching it play out, it's amazing, because so many people have been touched by our transparency in it and how we were honest with it and talking about real-life things and how it could affect us in our life and our family.\n\nAnd a lot of women are really appreciative because, like you said, you don't see a lot of Black women in reality TV, even on dating shows, being the object of affection or in the forefront or being admired or, you know, so a lot of people are happy and they're happy that it's not as stereotypical catfight, loud. I'm a quirky, kind of nerdy Black girl, kind of awkward too. So I think that it's great because a lot of people are seeing me and I feel like I'm representing a thing that wasn't there before. So I'm really appreciative of that.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that, Cameron?\n\nCameron: For me, the main focus after we got engaged was focusing on our relationship working out. The filming aspect of it, of course, it's there, but I realized that these are conversations that we need to have if we're going to have a successful marriage when everything ... all this stuff disappears, the filming and all that. We're still going to be married and we're going to have children and we need to make sure that they're taken care of in the world and our family at large.\n\nSo we had to have these conversations about parenting in a mixed relationship, children who are mixed, how they're going to be treated by society, what are other kids going to say to them at school and how are we going to parent them when they being perceived as black and are going to have different experiences than me as a white man? So that was something that was critical for us to touch on, not because of the show, but because we were about to get married ...\n\nLauren: That's real life.\n\nNo, absolutely. I think, just as viewers, it was something that was awesome to watch actually be addressed because, again, a lot of these shows it feels like try to exist in this world where, there is no race, there are no political views.\n\nLauren: Right, and it's very real!\n\nSo how has life been since filming? Did you have to spend 18 months avoiding posting photos of each other on Instagram?\n\nLauren: We did! Trying to hide our rings and pictures. It was actually nuts. Of course, our close family and friends knew, but I had to keep my marriage a secret from some of my associates, my school friends. And that was hard. No posting pictures, no holiday stuff. Had to look like I was by myself. Just post the plate, not the family: Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!\n\nCameron: It was frustrating 'cause you want to share, especially when you're in a happy relationship, you want to be able to share that, especially in our day and age. We couldn't, and having to kind of feign being single or what have you, I mean it was just frustrating when you're happily married and you want to be open about it and talk about it. That was such an important experience for us in many ways.\n\nLauren: Absolutely.\n\nDAMON DAHLEN/HUFFPOST; PRODUCED BY CHRISTY HAVRANEK/HUFFPOST .\n\nI can't even imagine because even with The Bachelor, it's like three to four months of secrecy. That seems like a long time.\n\nCameron: It was kind of the daily mental battle. 'Cause we didn't know exactly when it was going to come out and we tried not to think about it. I think Lauren did a better job than I did of dealing with it.\n\nLauren: 'Cause if we would have become obsessed with it, it just would have been torturous. So I was just like, OK, let's just take this time to focus on you and me and strengthen our relationship, and that way if it does come out or when it comes out, at least we'll be strong.\n\nSo we did see the reunion, and I just need to know what was going through both of your heads when Amber went after Jessica? You looked like you wanted to crawl out of your skin.\n\nLauren: Right! I kind of did! I cannot hide my face, guys. My face is so reactionary. So when she said that, I was just like, Oh, do they have security? 'Cause it might be about to go down. Now it's just like, They better not come over here and hit me by mistake. But do you know what? I saw Amber's face throughout the time when Jessica was talking and I was like, if she says one wrong thing, Amber is about to go off. So it was kind of like, oh! When she said, You sheisty whatever, I was like, OK, here we go.\n\nCameron: I thought it was going to be a really long day after that, but it was great to see everyone.\n\nLauren: I think a lot of people got a lot of closure that they needed from a lot of people and got their feelings out, so ...\n\nCameron: People had some things to air.\n\nLauren: Clearly!\n\nWell, you were in this experiment and you know how taxing it could be. But then someone like Jessica has received a ton of criticism. Awful, like, hate.\n\nLauren: Yeah. It's been bad. Bullying.\n\nI find it unfair, but do you guys feel that way, too? To see someone who you were a part of a cast with kind of have to suffer a little more than others.\n\nCameron: Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nLauren: It's super unfortunate, especially because being on a show like this, you have to be vulnerable and even if you're trying to live your truth, like if whatever Jessica did or said, hopefully that was her truth in the moment. And the fact that she bared that and unfortunately the public reacts negatively. I could imagine that could be hurtful. Whatever growth she had to go through in that process or whatever she did in that time, that's kind of hurtful. Like, man, I was just saying how I felt or doing this and now I'm being crucified for it. So it's unfortunate, but that's reality TV. You open up your life to opinion and you never know if it's going to be good or bad.\n\nThere's always someone ready to take that criticism too far.\n\nLauren: Right! Exactly!\n\nCameron: Just to pair it somewhat with what Lauren said, the vulnerability was so high, the bar that you had to go to participate in the right way. To meet someone and fall for them. You had to put it all out there. Anyone who's listening, caution against judging people for this. Although we've talked a lot about it, it's hard to really know what the pods were like and the whole experience in general. So, yeah.\n\nWe also learned that Gi and Damian are dating still, which is very exciting. A good twist.\n\nLauren: Yeah. Shocking!\n\nDo you guys hang out with them? Have you seen their relationship grow or...\n\nLauren: Cameron is close with Damian.\n\nCameron: Yeah, I talk to Damian weekly and I think they've been working on it for some time. They have a very unique relationship, I'll say. And I'm not going to pretend like I know the deeper workings of it.\n\nLauren: Hey, if it works for y'all, then go for it.\n\nCameron: I really hope they can work it out and that they are working it out now.\n\nLauren: I hope they're happy.\n\nCameron: Yeah, I think that's the main thing as we just want them to be happy. However it works out.\n\nOn the reunion, they seemed great and it seemed Gi has really sort of explored their relationship more. She seems so much more mature about how they treat each other, how they talk to each other.\n\nLauren: I would definitely hope so. After a year and a half, hopefully they both matured as individuals, but especially as a couple, too.\n\nWho are you guys closest with currently from the cast? Is there anyone that you talk to a lot, see a lot beyond?\n\nLauren: Oh, it's probably Mark.\n\nCameron: The most, yeah. But I stayed friends with Damian, too.\n\nLauren: Mark, he's the best. Hey, Mark!\n\nAlso, I want to shout out to Kenny, who had a great finale episode moment where even Kelly's mom was like, I love him.\n\nLauren: That speech. I was like, he needs to run for a political office. It was amazing.\n\nHe really kept it together. It was impressive. But he revealed he has a new girlfriend and that this experience has helped him navigate that relationship and what he needs to do to be more vulnerable. Have you met the new girlfriend?\n\nCameron: We haven't yet, love to if we get that opportunity.\n\nLauren: Yeah. But I feel like this whole experience has to change you as a whole. You can't be the same person that you were going into this or especially not even a year and a half ago. You just learn so much about yourself because you're trying to partner up with someone and you can't properly do that unless you know what you want and who you are. So the whole process is just life changing and it's amazing.\n\nCameron: There was so much introspection going on throughout the whole process. And speaking on the guy's side, you might've thought that there would have been some competition. All of us were just talking about our emotions day in and day out when we weren't in the pod. You don't usually see that in your typical scenario, a bunch of men talking about how deeply they're falling for these different women. And so it was a beautiful thing and we all came out of it, like Lauren said, changed.\n\nYeah, absolutely. So the people have spoken and they want you to host Season 2! [Laughter] We might need to get rid of the Lacheys!\n\nLauren: Ohhhhhh. [More laughter]\n\nWhat is next for you guys, though? I know there's been talk of a spinoff, people want you to host, people want you to get a YouTube channel. What do you guys want to do?\n\nLauren: All those things, we would love to do all of them — whoever's listening that can make that happen. But we're going to start with YouTube. So we'll start there and just continue sharing our life and our story and ask for the rest. You know, we'll see.\n\nCameron: I think one of the main things for me beyond building our relationship was, like, working together with Lauren every day. Just being together in our work life as well, in a sense. So I just want to continue doing projects with Lauren in any capacity, really.\n\nAnd still be an artificial intelligence scientist, like what??\n\nLauren: I know, it's crazy!\n\nCameron: Crazy stuff.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

SR. LUCY KALAPURA/FACEBOOK\n\nWhen Bishop Franco Mulakkal returned to the Jalandhar diocese in October after spending 21 days in jail, his supporters welcomed him back with massive garlands and showers of rose petals. As images of the hero's welcome given to the rape-accused priest filled her TV screen and social media timeline, something snapped in sister Lucy Kalapura.\n\nThe 52 year old, who has been a nun for more than three decades, had often heard stories of powerful men of the cloth sexually abusing women and sometimes children. But the Mulakkal case shook her.\n\nI couldn't believe how relentless it was. I heard the man raped her 13 times, Kalapura told HuffPost India.\n\nIt was in June 2018 that a nun from a convent in Kottayam's Kuruvilangad filed a police complaint, accusing Mulakkal of sexually abusing her multiple times between 2014 and 2016.\n\nAs news of the assault broke, a few nuns from the survivor's congregation, the Missionaries of Jesus, began protesting, demanding that action be taken against Mulakkal.\n\nKalapura waited, expecting more women from convents to take to the streets to demand Mulakkal's arrest.\n\nForget the Bishop being arrested, I realised more and more women were going against the nun who complained, said Kalapura, who belongs to the Franciscan Clarist Congregation.\n\nSIVARAM V / REUTERS Bishop Franco Mulakkal (2nd R) pictured outside a crime branch office on the outskirts of Kochi on 19 September 2018.\n\nSo first, she posted a flurry of enraged status updates on Facebook, demanding that the woman get justice. She didn't feel like that was enough, though.\n\nWithout waiting for anyone else to join her, Kalapura landed at a protest site where some civil society organisations were demonstrating against the bishop.\n\nOn 8 September, five nuns began protesting outside the Kerala high court. Kalapura also took part in the protests, which soon gained national attention, increasing the pressure on the Kerala government to act.\n\nMulakkal was arrested, jailed for three weeks, released on bail and is now back at the Jalandhar diocese, the headquarters of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation.\n\nThe nuns who fought for his arrest have been heckled, isolated and face the threat of actionby their superiors in the church.\n\nIn the past four months, Kalapura has received two notices from her convent, accusing her of not following the 'principles of religious life' and allegedly violating the rules of the congregation.The first was served around Christmas last year, but that did not deter her from rallying behind the rape survivor with social media posts and comments to the press. So on 9 January, the convent served her another notice—this one, she said, contained a thinly-veiled threat of expulsion.\n\nAct of courage\n\nThe powerful Catholic Church has long been accused of shielding priests who have sexually abused minors and women. An AP investigation published earlier this year uncovered a decades-long history of Indian nuns enduring sexual abuse from within the church. Nearly two dozen people AP spoke to said they had direct knowledge of such incidents.\n\nThe extent to which Kalapura and the five nuns have risked their livelihoods and personal safety is evident from the fact that several male priests are afraid to speak up against Mulakkal and the church, even if they want to support the protests.\n\nGETTY IMAGES Christian nuns and Muslim supporters protest as they demand the arrest of Bishop Franco Mulakkal outside the High Court in Kochi, Kerala on 13 September 2018.\n\nOne priest from Kerala shared with HuffPost India a letter he received from higher authorities in his congregation after he attended a protest organised by nuns in the state. The letter 'warns' the priest of disciplinary action if he participates in public demonstrations again.\n\nI am helpless, and like me, many are helpless as well, he said, requesting that his name be withheld.\n\nDespite receiving multiple such warnings, Kalapura has soldiered on.\n\nShe is a martyr, said Sister Jesme, a former nun who quit her convent in Kerala in 2008 and then published a controversial book called 'Amen: The Autobiography of a Nun', accusing the church of multiple malpractices. She is still a part of the convent and waging a war against them. That needs incredible courage. Even when I wanted to, ten years back, I couldn't gather the courage to speak up while being a part of the system, Jesme told HuffPost India.\n\nSocial life in Christian communities in Kerala, Jesme pointed out, is closely tied to the church. In fact, it is often difficult to separate the threads of social life from the community's religious life, making the act of opposing the church a life-altering decision. When a child is born you go to the church, marriages are held in the church, christening is done in the church, people bond over church fairs and sales, during holidays also you go to the church, literally everything is centred around the church. Going against the church means going against family, friends and everyone you know and care about in our case, Jesme said.\n\nAnto Kokkat, member of the Kerala Catholic Reformation, an organisation which has helped organise several protest meetings, told HuffPost India that the implementation of the Church Act would prevent churches from welding disproportionate amounts of power and make congregations safer for women. The Act, which most political parties have refrained from touching and several Christian civilian groups want implemented, gives the government power to regulate the land owned by churches.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A nun cries as she participates in a sit in protest demanding the arrest of a Bishop Franco Mulakkal in Kochi, Kerala on 13 September 2018.\n\nChurch vs freedom\n\nKalapura, one among 11 siblings, joined the Missionaries of Jesus at 17. She had just finished school and joining the church seemed like a legitimate vocation. However, as the years passed, a number of things about the church's discipline began troubling her. She was careful, though, to never mention them to anyone.\n\nThen in 2003, said Kalapura, something terrible happened— she wouldn't reveal what this was— and she found that the only way to cope and heal was to scribble her thoughts down. She began by writing accounts of how she dealt with difficulties and moved on to composing short poems about nature and how she realised 'god lives in nature'. Later, as the years passed and the restrictions of the convent began chafing, she also began jotting down her thoughts on love, marriage and life. All this was merely a process of catharsis until 2016, when some close friends suggested Kalapura should publish her poems in the form of a book.\n\nI began asking for permission in 2016 and some financial help to publish the book. But I was refused both, she said. These were simple poems on nature and God, but I was told that this goes against the rules of our lives as nuns.\n\nKalapura spent two years trying to convince the convent to reconsider their 'disciplines' and allow her to publish the book of poems—they didn't budge. So, in March 2018, she published her book despite their remonstrations.\n\nSoon, I started getting calls and letters from the provincial (the nun in charge of the convent). I had also bought a car and learnt driving despite them forbidding me to do so. I tried explaining I needed the car to travel for work and the writing is an act of self-expression for me. However, I don't think the sister absorbed what I said, she told HuffPost India.\n\nA few months later, when Mulakkal's case came to light, Kalapura said she could relate to the isolation faced by the survivor and the few women supporting her.\n\nI wear a habit (nun's dress) too and it would be inherently dishonest of me if I did not support them, Kalapura said.\n\nJesme recounted the years that she spent in her own convent trying to ask questions and wondered how unbearable it must be for Kalapura to carry on protesting while being a part of the convent.\n\nHow must the other sisters treat her, with indifference and hostility. It is so difficult to be inside and rebel, she said, adding that she hoped Kalapura's actions gave other women courage.\n\nPower and abuse\n\nIn Amen, published by Penguin in 2009, Jesme wrote extensively about how disillusioned she was by malpractices within the church, including sexual abuse and money laundering. Sexual abuse, she told HuffPost India, was normalised to such a degree that men and women in power often convinced survivors that keeping quiet was somehow doing service to 'god'.\n\nSometimes, the priests who are all powerful, they get ample people from the nunnery—either forcefully or with their consent. If they don't agree, these priests will say, 'oh, this is something holy, we should keep this secret, whatever sin happens you confess to me, I will give you absolution, I'm a priest', Jesme told HuffPost India.\n\nSometime in the mid-90s, a priest in Bengaluru approached her with a similar proposition. He said, 'confess to me'. I didn't, she said.\n\nPENGUIN Sister Jesme\n\nJesme suspects that Mulakkal may have emboldened other priests to pursue women in that manner. I am sure a lot of nuns have been victimised by the same men, but they are afraid to speak up. There's a pattern, said Jesme. Such things are happening everywhere. Often, even when you complain to senior sisters, they're told that just like Jesus suffered, they must also suffer.\n\nThe 62-year-old nun said how she would often share her questions with her seniors, but instead of being reassured, she was told that people are simply following 'god's will'. I went raging with questions, came back like a lamb, she added.\n\nKalapura said that the few times she had spoken to the survivor, she had come across as a woman of great strength. I wanted to meet her but wasn't able to. But we speak on the phone occasionally. She has a lot of difficulties, but she isn't the kind of person to talk about it too much, and I haven't asked her too much either, she said.\n\nWhile Jesme seems to pin the allegedly never-ending cycle of abuse in churches to the fact that many join the services because they need jobs and not because they are interested in spirituality, Kalapura believes that many people join the convent at a very young age and later realise they have different desires.\n\nOne of her several journal entries, Kalapura recounted, was about how a person should embrace this life of abstinence only once older and fully aware of what that implied.\n\nTimes are changing. There are cultural changes as well. Since times have changed, it is time to think about marriage and priesthood as well, if there are priests and nuns who want to get married, they should.\n\nWhen they get married and have a couple of children, they'll know what life is, Kalapura said. She also said that the church should understand that 'sexuality is a gift of god' and shouldn't deny its workers the right to love. In fact,she added, it was sexual repression that fed the culture of sexual exploitation.\n\nThese men preach abstinence but can't follow it, then use their power to fulfill their needs. How many women must he (Mulakkal) have oppressed? she said.\n\nJesme, however, believes that the sexual predators within the confines of the church are deeply aware of their position of privilege and exploit it for sexual and material gains.\n\nWhen I started speaking up, I was immediately labelled insane. In fact, people in my convent started telling my mother to send me to a church retreat for my 'mental issues'. My mother, though aghast by me, refused to let me go, she said. For years, her family excommunicated her, only calling once or twice a year to ascertain where she was living.\n\nThey are ashamed of me, said Jesme.
President Donald Trump has issued a wave of pardons and clemency just hours before he was set to leave office.\n\nPardons and commutations were announced for 143 people, including former aides, party loyalists and rappers.\n\nContrary to recent speculation, the list did not include any members of the Trump family or other notable figures such as Rudy Giuliani, Julian Assange or Edward Snowden.\n\nHere are six people you should know about.\n\n1. Steve Bannon\n\nThe former chief strategist and long-time Trump adviser was facing trial and a possible conviction for his role in a coordinated scheme to fleece the president's supporters with a border wall fundraiser.\n\nBannon faced multiple fraud counts following an indictment for allegedly stealing funds from a charity he controlled, which purported to raise money to help build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. The indictment claimed the fund was actually a slush fund for the personal expenses of Bannon and his co-defendants, Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea.\n\n2. Kwame Kilpatrick\n\nThe former Detroit mayor was serving a 28-year prison term on corruption charges after being found guilty of racketeering and extortion in 2013. Prosecutors had charged that he ran a criminal enterprise out of City Hall while serving as mayor from 2002 to 2008.\n\nAmong other accusations, Kilpatrick was found guilty of using donations from his fund for the needy to support his own leisure activities. He was convicted of 24 charges, including racketeering, extortion, attempted extortion, bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud and filing false tax returns.\n\n3. Lil Wayne\n\nThe rapper, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter, was prosecuted on federal weapons charges had been facing up to 10 years in prison. In December, he pleaded guilty to possession of a .45 calibre, gold-plated handgun and six rounds of ammunition despite being a convicted felon following a 2019 search of a private plane in the Miami area. A search warrant said Carter told investigators the gun was a Father's Day gift.\n\nLil Wayne has previously voiced his support for Trump and endorsed him for a second term in office, posting a photo of the pair after a great meeting. Trump also pardoned the rapper Kodak Black, who had also been prosecuted on federal weapons charges.\n\nJust had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump @potus besides what he's done so far with criminal reform, the platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership. He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done. 🤙🏾 pic.twitter.com/Q9c5k1yMWf — Lil Wayne WEEZY F (@LilTunechi) October 29, 2020\n\n4. Ken Kurson\n\nThe former editor of the New York Observer and a close friend of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Kurson had been charged with cyberstalking last October.\n\nHe was accused of repeatedly visiting his victims at work, making false complaints with their employers and malicious cyber activity. Kurson was charged with cyberstalking three people and harassing two others, including a friend who he blamed for the disintegration of his marriage.\n\nWhen he was editor, Kurson read and provided input on a draft of Donald Trump's speech to a pro-Israel lobbying group. He later sat in the Trump family's box at the Republican National Convention.\n\n5. Anthony Levandoswki\n\nThe former Google engineer had been sentenced in August to 18 months in prison for stealing trade secrets from the search giant, after pleading guilty to transferring 14,000 files from Google before leaving the company. Levandoswki went on to found a start-up called Otto, which was acquired by Uber.\n\nUber was accused by Google's self-driving car unit Waymo of using trade secrets in its driverless-car technology — an allegation that Uber denied. The companies settled their legal dispute in 2018, but Levandoswki had to face criminal charges.\n\n6. Michael Harris\n\nCo-founder of Death Row Records, Michael Harry O Harris was granted clemency after serving nearly 30 years on attempted murder and drug-trafficking charges. His sentence had been due to end in 2028.\n\nEarlier this week it was revealed that the rapper Snoop Dogg – an outspoken Trump critic – had been secretly lobbying the president to free Harris. Death Row Records is known for having signed Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur.
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An Australian state is considering the nation's first ban and jail sentences for so-called gay conversion therapy, a bid that has sparked division more than two years after the country legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nThe northeastern state of Queensland introduced a bill in November that would prohibit conversion therapy, with its top health official labeling the practice highly destructive. Offenders face up to 18 months in jail under the proposal.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would be the first outright ban on conversion therapy in Australia. Other states have come under pressure to adopt the same ban and the state of Victoria began public consultation on a proposed law in October.\n\nA committee in Queensland's parliament that has been tasked to examine the bill on Friday urged the government to review parts of its proposal to provide clarity on which health services would fall under the ban.\n\nBut LGBT+ campaigners urged the government to pass the bill without delays.\n\nIt's ground-breaking because it will be Australia's first gay conversion therapy ban if the law is passed in Queensland, said Shelley Argent, a spokeswoman from the advocacy group Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays in Australia.\n\nConversion therapy is psychological abuse because it's telling the person they are broken, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\n\nConversion therapies range from counseling to hypnosis and electric shock therapy and have been widely condemned by medical associations globally as ineffective and harmful to mental health.\n\nWorldwide Malta, Ecuador, Brazil and Taiwan have banned conversion therapy, according to LGBT+ advocacy group OutRightAction International. Britain and parts of Canada are mulling bans and about 18 U.S. states outlaw such therapy for minors.\n\nConversion therapy is pervasive in many faith communities in Australia, according to a 2018 report by Melbourne-based LaTrobe University and campaign group the Human Rights Law Centre.\n\nThe bill has faced opposition from Christian groups which slammed the proposed jail term.\n\nConversion therapy is vaguely and and very broadly defined, said Mark Spencer, the director of public policy at the Christian Schools Australia, which represents over 125 schools across the country.\n\nThe bill as it stands potentially criminalizes biologically sound and medically factual responses to students by school counselors and possible even classroom teachers, he added.\n\nQueensland's officials said they want to lead the way in protecting LGBT+ people.\n\nPractices that try to change or suppress a person's sexual orientation or their gender identity have always been immoral and unethical, the state's Health Minister Steven Miles said last year, calling the practice highly destructive.\n\nThe minister's office did not immediately reply to a request seeking comment on Friday's report.\n\nThe move to ban conversion therapy came after Australia allowed same-sex marriage in December 2017 in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until 20 years ago.\n\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by BelindaGoldsmith Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.Visit http://news.trust.org)
Life is considerably crazier with a toddler in tow.\n\nJust ask Jonathan Jui. On his Instagram page, Jui documents daily life with his wife Tina and their two-year-old son Baobao.

He definitely knows what he wants, and yes, that's a euphemism for saying he's a little dictator.\n\nBy day, the first-time dad works in asset management, but by night, he's busy doodling his life with Baobao, who's in the midst of potty training:\n\nA post shared by jonathan jui (@jonajooey) on Apr 9, 2018 at 10:40am PDT\n\nHe also draws cute, relatable scenes from his marriage:\n\nA post shared by jonathan jui (@jonajooey) on Mar 14, 2018 at 8:40am PDT\n\nJui's fanbase is growing, but Tina remains his biggest fan.\n\nMy wife loves the comics, Jui said. I often don't tell her what I'm going to draw, so she gets a kick out of how I interpret a particular moment from that day.\n\nHere's what the family looks like in real life:\n\nJonathan Jui Tina, Jonathan and their son, Baobao.\n\nJui joked that life with a toddler is a bit like an amusement park.\n\nIt's a lot of fun, there are some moments of waiting and frustration, and we're all tired by the end of the day, he said. Plus, amusement parks and raising a kid are both so expensive!
The StarTalk TV show hosted by popular astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson will be off the air during an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him, according to media reports.\n\nJust three episodes of the fifth season of StarTalk ran in November before the program was suspended after allegations of sexual misconduct emerged against Tyson.\n\nNow a decision has been made to halt the program until some conclusion is reached in an investigation by the National Geographic Channel and Fox Networks Group, which share Cosmos, also hosted by Tyson. Both Nat Geo and Fox had planned to launch a revival of Cosmos: Possible Worlds in March.\n\nTyson is also the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.\n\nIn order to allow the investigation to occur unimpeded, we chose to hold new episodes of 'Star Talk' until it is complete, a representative of Nat Geo told Variety, which was the first to report the decision. We expect that to happen in the next few weeks at which time we'll make a final decision.\n\nTyson has denied all the accusations and said he welcomes an investigation.\n\nPatheos.com reported in November on a rape allegation by Tchiya Amet, which she said occurred in 1984 when she was a student at the University of Texas at Austin while Tyson was working on his doctorate.\n\nBucknell professor Katelyn Allers also accused Tyson of grabbing her in 2009, and production assistant Ashley Watson accused him of making unwanted sexual advances over wine and cheese in 2018, Patheos also reported.\n\nTyson denied the allegations in a lengthy Facebook post. He said he was searching for Pluto in a solar system tattoo on Allers' shoulder — beneath the material of her sleeveless dress. He said the wine and cheese was simply that. And he wrote that the sex with Amet was consensual.\n\nAccusations can damage a reputation and a marriage. Sometimes irreversibly, Tyson wrote in his Facebook post. I see myself as [a] loving husband and as a public servant ― a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public.\n\nTyson could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.
Georgina Chapman is keeping her fashion line, Marchesa, strutting despite husband Harvey Weinstein's far-reaching disgrace.\n\nMarchesa and Marchesa Notte released photos of their pre-fall 2018 collection this week, with 38 new looks. A statement from the Marchesa brand, which is run by Chapman and her partner Keren Craig, described the collection as a visit to a nocturnal garden party, boasting dramatic silhouettes and colors.\n\nA post shared by Marchesa (@marchesafashion) on Jan 8, 2018 at 4:41pm PST\n\nA post shared by Marchesa (@marchesafashion) on Jan 12, 2018 at 7:36am PST\n\nA post shared by Marchesa (@marchesafashion) on Jan 5, 2018 at 10:50am PST\n\nChapman, 41, announced that she'd be splitting from Weinstein, 65, in October 2017, amid explosive reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker that accused Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein denied the allegations.\n\nSince then, the couple have privately reached a settlement to end their 10-year marriage and give primary custody of their two children to Chapman. They have not yet formally filed for divorce in court.\n\nMy heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions, Chapman previously said of Weinstein's deeds in a statement to People magazine.\n\nMustafa Yalcin/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman attend the Cannes Film Festival in France in May 2015.\n\nIn the past, Weinstein reportedly supported his wife's fashion business by forcing stars like Felicity Huffman and Sienna Miller to wear her brand on the red carpet. With Weinstein now deluged by accusations of sexual misconduct, many speculated that Marchesa would suffer unless Chapman cut ties. Now that she seemingly has, we can only wait and see what will happen.
For BRIDES, by Jillian Kramer.\n\nGetty Images\n\nYou've likely read some scary — and outdated! — research that says nearly half of marriages end in divorce. But rather than fret you'll one day become a statistic, why not work on protecting your marriage instead?\n\nYou don't need to do monumental actions to divorce-proof your marriage, says relationship expert Dr. Jane Greer. The most important thing is to maintain a sense of intimacy and connection, and to not let your anger build up to the point where you have grievances and grudges and can't reconcile the conflict.\n\nHere, experts give nine ways to divorce-proof your marriage today.\n\nAlways greet one another with affection. Make a point to say hello with a kiss when you come home from work — not just a quick peck on the cheek — to truly say hello and convey good feeling and happiness at seeing your partner at the end of the day, suggests Greer.\n\nRather than fret you'll one day become a statistic, why not work on protecting your marriage instead?\n\nSee More: What Your Zodiac Sign Says About Your Love Life in 2017\n\nShow your support. Men especially want you to be their cheerleader, says relationship expert Rachel DeAlto. They want someone who encourages and supports them. Even if you don't agree with everything they do — who does?! — try to be supportive every day.\n\nDo a daily check-in. Make it a habit to check in on each other with a hands-on 'I've got your back' sign, such as squeezing or massaging their shoulders and asking how they're doing, says Greer. This offers them the opportunity to unload and know you literally have their back.\n\nGet physical. Sex is a need, not a want! says DeAlto. If you aren't having regular sex, you need to find out why. It may not be every day you're having sex, but every day your partner should feel desired.\n\nExpress your appreciation. People often take their partners for granted, Greer says. Still say 'thank you' — even for the small things like doing the dishes, a cup of coffee in the morning, etc. Saying 'thank you' never grows old!\n\nTalk over your feelings. A huge relationship killer? Couples not talking, DeAlto says. Let them know when you are happy, let them know when you are sad. Most people that love you will want to know how they can help to keep you in your happy place.\n\nSend special messages. Make a point to send a special text of joy, says Greer. Think, 'I miss you,' 'I love you,' and 'I'm looking forward to seeing you.' Anything that will make your partner happy or reference something you share together. Always make sure your text conversations are not only about responsibilities like picking up the kids, what you'll have for dinner, when they're coming home, etc.\n\nBe kind. Studies have shown that couples headed for divorce often name call and get nasty during arguments, DeAlto says. A divorce-proofed marriage avoids that and the couple remains kind to one another — even when you want them to sleep on the couch.\n\nLet go of anger. Agree to disagree if you can't resolve a fight, then come back and talk about it at another point when you've both had a chance to cool off and think about the disagreement a little further, advises Greer.
Ada daSilva via Getty Images This one sentence, writer Alexander James says, has saved him and his wife from arguing nine out of 10 times.\n\nAfter 12 years together, Alexander James and his wife have had their fair share of misunderstandings and arguments.\n\nBut a few years back, the Seattle-based couple stumbled upon what most marriage therapists would probably call conflict resolution gold.\n\nMy wife and I got into the habit of asking each other, 'Do you want comfort or solutions' when the other was having a bad time, James shared in a now-viral tweet recently. That one sentence can save us from an argument 9/10 times.\n\nSome years back my wife and I got into the habit of asking each other\n\n'do you want comfort or solutions' when the other was having a bad time. That one sentence can save us from an argument 9/10 times. — Alexander James (@DrunkScribe) January 23, 2021\n\nThe tweet racked up 67,000 likes and a lot of appreciative feedback from people in relationships. You are far smarter than the average couple and over-the-top smarter than me, one man joked.\n\nOf course, the clever marital hack didn't come to James and his wife overnight. Prior to realizing that they could just explicitly ask what the other needed, they'd often rush to offer each other advice in stressful times.\n\nSometimes, one spouse would come home and complain about office drama and really need the other's perspective and lens to sort through an issue with a coworker or their boss. Other times, We just wanted to shout and yell and have the other be entirely on our side, James told HuffPost.\n\nWe'd go round and round in circles, treading and re-treading over the same points, tossing the same phrases around with more and more anger and defensiveness ― mostly, I think, because we weren't sure what the other person wanted, he explained.\n\nJames credits his impressively emotionally aware wife with coming up with the question.\n\nI think the beauty of the phrasing is it sets us on the same track together, right from the start, he said. I'm not brainstorming solutions while she's trying to vent, or vice-versa. When you're on the same page, arguments are few and far between.\n\nPsychologist Sarah Joy Park saw James and his wife's suggestion and instantly loved it. No issue more often brings otherwise happy partners into couples therapy quite like misguided communication, said Park, whose office is in San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nMost of the time, it's really a vulnerability issue, she said. Asking directly for what you need makes you feel vulnerable; what if you ask and the other person doesn't deliver or what if they reject you?\n\nShe added, What I see is many people prefer the secret disappointment of not asking and not receiving because it can feel safer, but playing it safe often does not lead to a satisfying connection.\n\nThe comfort or solution hack puts the onus on the non-distressed partner to do a little heavy lifting, but it's worth it, she said. Why waste time crafting a fail-proof solution to a work squabble or power dispute when all your partner wants is to lay out all the specific ways their boss is the absolute worst and hear you say, Damn, totally.\n\nThis premise sets the couple up for success, Park said. If everyone is clear on what is desired in the communication, then the chances are much higher that both people will feel good about their connection.\n\nSDI Productions via Getty Images Just because I would prefer honesty and solutions doesn't mean that someone else will want the same response, said romance novelist Elise St. George.\n\nNaturally, the Jameses aren't the only couple to have stumbled upon this little argument-avoiding gem ― or something similar to it. After the tweet went viral, other solution-oriented folks offered variations on the theme.\n\nAnother good question [is] 'Do you want me to leave you alone, give you some space, or would you need/want me to stay here with you? said U.K. psychology professor Julie Castronovo.\n\nRomance novelist Elise St. George said she prefers: Do you want my actual advice or do you want me to make you feel better?\n\nSt. George told HuffPost she can jump into problem-solving mode very quickly, but time has taught her that her friends and romantic partners oftentimes just need a sounding board.
There is a difference between friends and girlfriends. Read my musings to discover the characteristics of each.\n\nIt was a lovely summer afternoon in my beautiful Chicago. I had just left my friends, whom I get together with twice a week for lunch and cards. My life has become so positively overwhelming (in a good way) that I usually leave them after lunch. I walk the short distance home, window shopping along the way, and often drop into boutiques to 'glance' at what they have to offer. I am a very discriminate buyer though. It is part of the feminine mystique to 'gather,' right dear readers?\n\nOn that particular day, I came home empty-handed. I walked through the revolving doors of our condominium, saying hello to everyone in the lobby, before stopping in the mailroom to check our box. It was fortunate that I came home empty handed from the boutiques.\n\nWith arms filled full of mail, I grabbed an elevator, pressed floor 71 and like a bird, the elevator flew up to my apartment in the sky.\n\nI hurried down the hall and put my key in the lock as I said, Orchid! Orchid, I'm home! As I opened the door, my leapin' Wheaton, Orchid, excitedly jumped up to greet me with licks. I then called out, Shelly? Shelly are you home? He emerged from our office, Hi Honey, how was your day? He is my best friend, my best girlfriend.\n\nTogether the three of us walked into our den with a full view of the Chicago skyline. I swoon at the beauty of my Chicago.\n\nPlopping down on the couch, my arms still full of mail and Orchid by my side, I noticed an invitation in the mass of bills, magazines and junk. Naturally, it was the invitation I opened before handling any of the other mail.\n\nIt was a save the date from a close girlfriend, Sue. Notice, I write girlfriend and not friend. She had invited me to a girlfriend party in January on the evening of the Golden Globes. She is a Los Angeles gal, but lives in Chicago six months of the year with her husband, a Chicagoan. We share both an address and a friendship.\n\nFast forward to now - January 15th. The party was last Sunday evening.\n\nI knew I was Sue's newest girlfriend that night and it made me happy. Having lived in various locations throughout my life, I have always been the newest friend or girlfriend on everyone's list.\n\nOver the past few days I have been thinking about you, dear readers, who have lifelong girlfriends. Notice again I said girlfriends and not friends. You are very fortunate. Having shared lifelong joys and sorrows with one another throughout life. You have a bond and a history. Your small group is a sisterhood and your girlfriends are your sisters. Please phone them today to tell them how grateful you are to have them in your life.\n\nAs I continued to think about the term girlfriend, I thought about my husband, a very masculine man, who I call my 'best girlfriend.' There is a reason I have given him this worthy title.\n\nBecause I am a writer, I enjoy delving deep into my thoughts. I probe my mind to think things through and then I try to live my answer.\n\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS\n\nThere is a 'subtle' difference between a friend and a girlfriend.\n\nFRIEND\n\nYou email and you chatter.\n\nYou lunch and play cards.\n\nYou have dinner with spouses or significant others.\n\nYou travel to distant places.\n\nYou catch a movie and talk about your grands.\n\nYou laugh together and discuss issues ranging from family to lifestyle, feeling visible and more.\n\nThey are exterior relationships, though very necessary because they enhance our lives.\n\nThat is a friend.\n\nGIRLFRIEND\n\nA girlfriend is your sister. We all have those few special bonds.\n\nYou 'choose' one other.\n\nYou keep and share secrets.\n\nYou forgive each other.\n\nYou are loyal.\n\nYou tell each other what you 'really' think.\n\nYou help one another when in need.\n\nYou aren't jealous.\n\nYou share all of your sources.\n\nYou listen and do not judge.\n\nYou are soulmates.\n\nYou wish one another well.\n\nYou get each other, protect each other, respect each other and love each other.\n\nA girlfriend is a substantial marriage without a license.\n\nThat is a girlfriend.\n\nI want to pass along one final message. If you have moved or plan on moving away, leaving your girlfriends behind is very hard.\n\nPlease do not despair. Look forward to making new friends. Be selective and 'choose' with care those you want to spend the next several years surrounded by. These friends can turn into girlfriends and you will need them as much as they will need you. We all need sisters.
On Jan. 3, 2011, a 19-year-old University of Iowa engineering student named Zach Wahls stood up and delivered a speech about his life and experiences growing up with two lesbian mothers that resonated with LGBTQ people around the world.\n\nThe speech, delivered in front of the Iowa House of Representatives, was a response to proposed legislative efforts to end civil unions in the state. At the time, marriage equality in America was still four years away, and moments like this felt precious to many same-sex couples who often felt as though they would never win the right to wed.\n\nToday, Wahls is 26 and running for Iowa state Senate. In the years since his speech, he has engaged in a number of battles for the rights of LGBTQ Americans, including co-founding Scouts for Equality, a national campaign to end discrimination in the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nSeven years after delivering his speech, Wahls sees the viral video as a key moment in his life, one that played a major part in his decision to pursue a career in public service rather than his earlier interest in renewable energy. Last week, he described the experiences of that day in a powerful Twitter thread.\n\n5/ I will never, *ever* forget how it felt to hear politicians talk about the dangers of terrorism in one breath and families like mine in the next. I knew what it felt like to be afraid of our government. — Zach Wahls (@ZachWahls) February 1, 2018\n\n20/ When I think about community, I think about family. And as I said that night at the Capitol, what makes a family is our commitment to each other — to work through the hard times so we can enjoy the good ones — Zach Wahls (@ZachWahls) February 1, 2018\n\nWahls told HuffPost he still get messages from people around the world who tell him how the video affected them on a personal level.\n\nI hope [the video] can continue to do two things, Wahls told HuffPost. One: to help kids of queer parents know that they are OK, their families are OK, and that things may be hard right now, but they will get better. And two: I hope LGBTQ people who want to be parents someday will watch that video and know they are not going to mess up their kids just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nWahls went on to say that his birth mother had her own moment of realization about the value of queer parenthood in the late 1980s while talking to her cousins over pizza. Today, he says, LGBTQ prospective parents can reach similar conclusions thanks to YouTube videos and other platforms.\n\nWithout a moment like that my mother had [in the '80s], I literally would not exist, he said. So to be able to pay that forward ― whether here in the United States or internationally, whether it's today or tomorrow or 10 years or 50 years from now, whatever the case may be ― that is its own reward.\n\nEditor's note: Wahls is dating a HuffPost editor who was not involved in the reporting or editing of this story.
Photo by Harpo Productions/Joe Pugliese via Getty Images Oprah Winfrey interviews Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on CBS, March 7, 2021.\n\nOn Sunday, the world was once again reminded that Oprah Winfrey is a gifted orator, master storyteller and expert interviewer. Over two hours of a CBS primetime special, Winfrey's empathetic yet firm questions to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry about their exit from the British royal family prompted dramatic disclosures about the racist treatment Meghan and her son Archie faced in the U.K. and the toxic relationships between members of the royal family.\n\nYou may not be a media mogul who honed her skills over more than 5,000 episodes of a daytime talk show, but there will likely come a time in your job or your life where you will need to have a high-stakes conversation and ask uncomfortable questions.\n\nHere are some techniques just demonstrated by the expert herself:\n\n1. To have a good conversation about hard topics, find areas of alignment.\n\nOn Monday's CBS This Morning show, Winfrey was asked why the Duke and Duchess of Sussex agreed to be interviewed by her when they knew it was unlikely to make their relationship with the British royal family any easier.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, sat down with @Oprah in their first major interview since stepping away from royal duties.@Oprah joins us exclusively with her reaction on that revealing interview. #OprahMeghanHarry pic.twitter.com/M4oqmbKGfR — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) March 8, 2021\n\nBefore I do any interview, I have a conversation with whoever I'm interviewing and ask, 'Tell me what your intention is, and I will tell you what my intention is, and let's see if we can align those two,' Winfrey said. I don't want you to finish an interview and at the end of the interview, you say, 'I wish I had said ... '\n\nIn other words, Winfrey doesn't need a gotcha moment in which she springs a question on a participant who is not willing to answer in order to have an effective conversation. She does it by seeing where interests intersect and focusing her questions along those paths.\n\nWhen you are talking with someone and have an eye for a desired outcome, see where your goals and theirs align.\n\n2. The root of conflict is not feeling heard. Give people your full attention when talking.\n\nWinfrey said last year that she has interviewed 37,000 people, and from that experience, she has learned that, above all else, people want to know they are being heard. I can tell you, in your daily encounters, in your kitchen, in your conference rooms, in your work, in all of your relationships, Winfrey said, that is what every person you encounter is looking to know. 'Did you see me? Do you hear me?' And every argument is about that.\n\nWinfrey has said she validates that concern by practicing meditation and working to stay present during her conversations. During her interview with Meghan, viewers could see Winfrey validating the Duchess' experiences and giving her the power of her full attention.\n\nAt one point, when Meghan said concerns had been raised about the possible color of her future child's skin, Winfrey let out an incredulous and purposeful What?!? that conveyed the weight of what Meghan had just revealed. Without rushing or interrupting, Winfrey then asked: Who is having that conversation with you? ... What?\n\nShe knows the power of pausing, and letting the moment build.\n\nMeghan Markle is opening up about baby Archie and the concerns that were raised about his skin color. https://t.co/NzIAQaOchX pic.twitter.com/ffFAicU4ik — People (@people) March 8, 2021\n\nBy showing her empathy and her incredulity, Winfrey let the viewer know that this is something that deserves their full attention, too. Doing this with others shows you are an empathetic listener who will give their sensitive story the attention it deserves.\n\noprah's what is so powerful — hunter harris (@hunteryharris) March 8, 2021\n\n3. If an answer is unsatisfactory, don't be afraid to follow up.\n\nThroughout the interview, Winfrey asked hard questions of the Sussexes. When they did not fully explain an answer to her satisfaction, Winfrey asked it again, often by reframing the question or asking a follow-up such as, How so?\n\nWho?\n\nHow so?\n\nWhy?\n\nSo let me get this right?\n\n\n\nFollow up game is impeccable. I'm over here taking notes! — Safiyyah (@soqweenly) March 8, 2021\n\nWhen Meghan explained that she had always advocated for women to use their voices but then she herself was silent, Winfrey followed up by asking if she was silent or silenced after her marriage to Harry. Meghan then clarified: The latter.\n\nWhen Winfrey first asked Harry to share what was said about his son's skin tone, he said, That conversation, I'm never going to share, but later Winfrey got him to clarify it was centered on the question, What will the kids look like? In her appearance on CBS Monday morning, Winfrey clarified that she followed up again off-camera and learned the person who brought up the topic was neither Queen Elizabeth nor her husband, Prince Philip.
As the female lead on M.A.S.H., Major Margaret Hot Lips Houlihan was in a class of her own. The character was the head nurse in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital unit (set during the Korean War) and her physical beauty was written into both storylines and one-off gags. Though Hot Lips often leaned into her sex appeal and clashed with other characters in earlier seasons of M.A.S.H., by its end, she had changed ― and the actress who played Hot Lips is part of the reason why.\n\nAs Emmy winner Loretta Swit tells WhereAreTheyNow.buzz, she was able to have a significant role in her character's evolution thanks to a rare collaborative environment among actors and writers.\n\nWe had the freedom to say, 'Well, I don't think I would say that,' Swit says. There was this excitement, this creativity that you don't find on every job.\n\nSwit exercised that freedom during a fateful conference call with writers and producers, discussing where Swit saw her character going over the next year. Up until that point, Hot Lips had been having an affair with the show's antagonist, a somewhat incompetent military doctor named Frank Burns, but Swit wanted to see that pairing end.\n\nThey were writing her more intelligent, and they were writing him sillier, she explains. I said, 'I see her breaking off with Frank, because it's demeaning. He's married, it's not going anywhere, she has no respect for his craft, his skill as a doctor.'\n\nGetty\n\nInstead, Swit suggested that her character travel to Tokyo, where she would then meet a single gentleman with whom she could fall in love and get married. Show producer Gene Reynolds initially balked at the idea of Hot Lips walking down the aisle.\n\nGene said, 'Oh... that's so permanent, Swit says. I said, 'Gene! You're divorced. How can you sit there and say that to me?'\n\nAs Swit explained to the group, the marriage didn't have to last. In fact, she argued, it shouldn't.\n\nThey said, 'OK, we marry you. Then what happens?' I said, 'She finds out he's cheating on her and she leaves him, and comes back to her life without him ― and realizes that she doesn't really need another person to complete her life,' Swit says.\n\nAnd so the script was written. By the time Major Houlihan returned to her unit, she had become more liberated and fulfilled, independent of a partner. At the character's core, however, Swit believes she was always a fiercely strong person.\n\nShe's busy, she's ambitious, she's caring. She wanted to be the best damn nurse in Korea, Swit says. She was a real first.\n\nLoretta Swit's latest project is titled SwitHeart, a collection of her watercolors of animals. Proceeds from the book's sales will go to Swit's campaign to end animal cruelty.\n\nAnother actor's influence on his role:
Unearthed footage used in a new Britney Spears documentary is making fans cringe.\n\nThe New York Times' recent documentary Framing Britney Spears features part of a 2003 Primetime interview that Diane Sawyer conducted with Spears that many believe is laden with misogyny.\n\nHaven't watched the Britney doc yet, but just watched the entirety of the old Diane Sawyer interview. Absolutely disgusting. Misogyny executed by another woman. No wonder Britney seems so lost. We all betrayed her by allowing that narrative. — Gracie Lou Freebush (@chcachrycola) February 8, 2021\n\nSpears — who did not participate in the documentary — has not commented on the film's release, multiple outlets report.\n\nSawyer's interview with the then-21-year-old pop star, which you can watch in full below, included multiple pearl-clutching remarks regarding Spears' sexual image and music.\n\nThe Times' unauthorized doc highlights Sawyer's questions about Spears' very public 2002 breakup with fellow pop star Justin Timberlake.\n\nHe has gone on television and pretty much said you broke his heart. You did something that caused him so much pain, so much suffering. What did you do? Sawyer asked a seemingly exasperated Spears, who had asked for a break earlier in the interview when the subject of Timberlake came up.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake arrive at the 28th Annual American Music Awards in 2001.\n\nI was upset for a while, Spears responded. I think we were both really young and it was kind of meant to happen, and I will always love him. He will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nIn 2002, Timberlake dropped his first solo album, Justified. The album included the song Cry Me a River, which had lyrics about infidelity, and the accompanying video included a Spears-lookalike.\n\nTo help promote his album, Timberlake perpetuated the idea that Spears was the reason the two broke up. He also poked fun at her 2002 movie Crossroads and made coy suggestions that the two had had a sexual relationship — despite Spears' saying earlier in her career that she wanted to remain a virgin until marriage.\n\nAlso featured in the Framing Britney Spears documentary is Sawyer pressing Spears about a comment by Kendel Ehrlich, who was Maryland's first lady in 2003. In a speech at an anti-violence rally that year, Ehrlich called Spears a bad influence, saying: Really, if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears, I think I would.\n\nScreenshot via Hulu/NYT/Framing Britney Spears Former Maryland first lady Kendel Ehrlich's quote as it was shown during Diane Sawyer's interview with Britney Spears in 2003.\n\nSpears looked shocked in response to those comments, but Sawyer seemed to sympathize with Ehrlich, telling Spears:\n\nIt's because of the example for kids and how hard it is to be a parent.\n\nI'm not here to, you know, babysit her kids, Spears responded.\n\nFollowing the film's release, Spears' fans expressed outrage over the interview, calling it painful.\n\nI'm sorry, why is Diane Sawyer defending someone who threatened to shoot Britney Spears? — Robyn Johnson (@RobynEJohnson) February 8, 2021\n\nI wonder if Diane Sawyer looks back on this Britney Spears interview and cringes. What a poor interview. — Melissa (@mels452) February 8, 2021\n\nThere's lots to discuss in this Britney Spears doc, but feels like much more time needs to be devoted to the part where a politician's wife says Britney should be SHOT for the way she dresses and respected journalist Diane Sawyer is like well, she's a concerned mother 😐 — Angela Spera (@speradactyl) February 7, 2021\n\nDiane Sawyer made it sound reasonable that the First Lady of Maryland wanted to shoot Britney Spears because being a parent is hard. — 🔪Sarah Carbiener🌶 (@notanothersarah) February 7, 2021\n\nWatching that @britneyspears movie reminded me how badly women were treated in the 1990s, like the innate misogyny was incredible. — Molly Jong-Fast🏡 (@MollyJongFast) February 9, 2021\n\nThe slut shaming, the misogyny— in today's world, it's astonishing, but was normal. I was probably around 15 when this interview came out, and it makes me furious for Britney and for all the girls who were exposed to that stew of misogyny and sexual shaming. It was so damaging. — Corvin Esque (@Corvinesque) February 9, 2021\n\nMeanwhile, Timberlake's Instagram posts are flooded with comments from fans demanding that he apologize to Spears.\n\nABC, Sawyer and Spears did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment.
Allie, a 22-year-old from North Carolina, is waiting until marriage to have sex. She's totally comfortable with that decision, but it's made dating a bit uncomfortable at times.\n\nI've been ghosted more times than I can count, she said. I had one guy who found out right before our first date and suddenly went from very interested to putting in no effort. It was the dealbreaker for I'd guess about 80% of prospective dates.\n\nShe's always been upfront about her choice, and her boyfriend of three years is fine with it.\n\nI never lied about my celibacy because it doesn't end well for either person, she said. Celibacy is more common than most people think. Just hang in there and the right person will eventually come along.\n\nAllie is hardly the only person choosing to be celibate ― after all, we're in a so-called millennial sex recession. And even couples who've gotten physical are starting to practice a kind of reverse celibacy, said Tammy Nelson, a sex therapist and the author of Getting the Sex You Want.\n\nThey'll be sexually active, get engaged and then decide to stay pseudo-virginal until their wedding day.\n\nIt's almost like a kickback to an old-fashioned desire to marry without having sex first, even though they have had a fully sexually pre-approved relationship prior to their commitment, she said. They know they are compatible, and yet they are starting over, and holding out, hoping they'll rekindle a spark and feel some anticipation before their wedding. It's charming, really.\n\nClearly, people choose to abstain from sex for all types of reasons. But how do you make your sexual status known when you're single and celibate? Below, sex therapists share when and how to broach the topic.\n\nBring it up quickly after meeting — certainly by the third date — and consider putting it in your profile.\n\nGenerally speaking, it's always a good policy to be clear and upfront about your sexuality, whether you're gay, straight, poly, pro-kink or celibate.\n\nDo it fast and be honest, Nelson said. Why leave something so important to a later time when it might be too late for either of you to make a clear decision, or for the other person to understand why you waited so long to tell them?\n\nShould you state it explicitly in your profile ― or hint at it? (For instance, Looking for something platonic or companionship.) Maybe, said Vanessa Marin, a sex and relationship therapist and online course creator.\n\nIt depends on how long you're planning on being celibate for. If this is a temporary decision, you can tell a person fairly early in the dating process, she said. If it's a lifelong decision, I would put it on your profile.\n\nAllie, the celibate woman mentioned above, recommends bringing it up by the third date.\n\nI feel that anything sooner is too... I don't know, presumptive? she said. If a guy starts pushing for physical stuff sooner I will tell him earlier, but date three has always been my rule. Anything later than that feels like I am hiding it from the guy and not being honest.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images Explain the reasons for your celibacy if you're interested in pursing a relationship.\n\nWhen you have the conversation, be as clear as possible.\n\nThere's obviously no right way to broach the subject, but if you're apprehensive about bringing it up, it helps to have a loose script in mind.\n\nIt doesn't have to be complicated, said Janet Brito, a psychologist and sex therapist at the Center for Sexual and Reproductive Health in Honolulu. Say something like, 'Before we get closer, I want to make sure that we are on the same page. I don't want to mislead you. Currently, I am taking it slow and not interested in being sexual. If you are interested in dating without sex, let's continue. If not, I wish you the best.\n\nExplain the reasons for your celibacy and how you expect it to affect any potential relationship.\n\nPeople usually assume there's a religious reason behind choosing celibacy. But is that the reason for you? Are you accidentally celibate (i.e., you just haven't had sex for a while and don't mind keeping it that way)? you waiting to find the right person? Are you getting over an ex? Your potential partner is probably curious (and maybe making a lot of assumptions), so you might as well be honest.\n\nExplain the parameters of your celibacy, too, said Nelson: Are you abstaining until marriage? Down to do it after you've been together a certain amount of time? Are there other physical things you are willing to do?\n\nBefore you share the intimate details of your sex life, or lack of a sex life, think deeply about what you want now and what you might want later, she said. Be clear about why you are choosing not to have sex right now and understand your motivation.\n\nIf you're struggling to find someone, consider looking for support online.\n\nDon't take other people's reactions personally. Celibacy isn't a teeny tiny thing for most people to wrap their heads around, even if you're clear on your rationale and decision. Look to online forums for support and consider trying a dating app that caters to celibate people.\n\nI'd recommend singles looking for others who share similar views join an app for celibate and asexual people called Celibate Passions, Brito said. You're all on the same page. (If you are asexual, there's another called Asexual Cupid.)\n\nOwn your decision.\n\nYou're not the only person on the planet who's not interested in getting physical for one reason or another. If you know that this is in your best interest, be confident in your decision and eventually, you'll find the right person.\n\nI truly believe that we all get to decide what feels right for us in our own sex life, Marin said. Celibacy may not be super common, but that doesn't mean it's not a valid choice.\n\nAnd once you tell a potential partner, don't feel the need to apologize.\n\nYou're not confessing to some horrible misdeed, she said. You're just sharing something honest and truthful about who you are.
Illinois Authorities are looking into a Cook County marriage license issued three weeks ago in the names of Robert Kelly and Aaliyah Haughton, a 1994 issue of the Detroit Free Press reads.\n\nHe's R.Kelly, a 25-year-old R&B singer known for subtle tunes like 'Bump 'N Grind' and 'Sex Me.' She's his opening act, a vocalist whose first single is titled 'Age Ain't Nothin' But A Number.' Speaking of which, she's 15.\n\nThe news clip, a brief entry in Neil Rubin's Names & Faces column, epitomizes the way many mainstream media publications in the 1990s and early aughts addressed the then-rumored marriage between R. Kelly and Aaliyah. Rubin doesn't express particular concern about the alleged union of a grown man and a girl under the age of legal consent; despite being a journalist, he doesn't attempt to confirm or deny the persistent speculation.\n\nIn fact, his cursory tone almost pokes fun at the scenario, using jokes that shift the onus of blame onto Aaliyah, the minor, rather than the man 10 years her senior.\n\nTwo and a half decades later, the way journalists regard Kelly's conduct has shifted dramatically. Today, his marriage to Aaliyah (which was later reportedly annulled) is accurately understood to be abuse. Moreover, most journalists failed to probe a revered public figure in the 1990s and early aughts, and it's now rightly viewed as professional malpractice.\n\nFollowing the Jan. 3 premiere of the Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly, a six-episode investigation into the abuse Kelly allegedly inflicted, current and former entertainment reporters began revisiting how the media covered ― and failed to cover ― this disturbing moment in pop culture history.\n\nIf you look back at the reporting during the R Kelly-Aaliyah marriage, it was a massive failure, Jemele Hill, a writer for The Atlantic, tweeted on Jan. 3. Zero understanding of sexual abuse. Nobody treated this seriously. It was a collective shrug.\n\nMon, Aug 27, 2001 -- Page 2, The Cincinnati Enquirer (Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio, United States of America), Newspapers.com\n\nThe collective shrug can be attributed, in part, to the fact that fans and journalists alike saw Kelly as a hitmaker beyond reproach. As writer and former entertainment journalist Alexia Hudson-Ward put it, some folks want to enjoy his music without guilt, and that included writers and reporters within the entertainment industry. This much is clear in Nekesa Mumbi Moody's 2001 obituary of Aaliyah for the Associated Press, penned after Aaliyah's tragic death in a plane crash, where she refers to Kelly as an R&B superstar who had the greatest impact on [Aaliyah's] career.\n\nHer artistic pairing with R.Kelly allegedly turned romantic when the singer was just a teen, Moody wrote. Her breezy characterization of their relationship is preceded by a description of how Aaliyah's midriff-baring clothes and suggestive lyrics raised some eyebrows. Moody appears to be more critical of Aaliyah than of Kelly's apparent predatory behavior.\n\nA 2001 Montclair Times opinion piece remembering Aaliyah's life by Jeff Harrell similarly places the onus on the young singer for Kelly's allegedly criminal behavior. Aaliyah's life was not filled with enough sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll to kill a rock god, Harrell wrote, referring to the singer's public persona. Of course, if the bare midriffs in her videos and lyrics like 'going all the way with an older man' are any indication, there was sex. Aaliyah was a mere teenager when she reportedly married her producer, the Grammy winner and older man R.Kelly.\n\nAlluding to Aaliyah as a teenager fails to clearly demarcate that she was under the age of 18 when the marriage license was allegedly issued. Claiming she married her much older producer negates the abusive dynamic at play and makes her seem like a willing participant in a union that by law is non-consensual.\n\nIt assigns her and other teenagers with a kind of agency that we know is wrong, but that you can skirt around, said Treva Lindsey, a women's studies professor at The Ohio State University.\n\nMoreover, blithely referencing the content of her first album ignores the fact that Kelly helped write those songs, and reducing Kelly to an older man in this scenario effectively normalizes his behavior and absolves him of accountability.\n\nThere are many instances of [older male] celebrities marrying 15-year-old girls — Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis ― all these icons of American music who had these stories, said Mark Anthony Neal, the James B. Duke professor of African and African American Studies at Duke University. For some folks, R. Kelly just fit neatly into that narrative.\n\n20 years ago, Vibe prints marriage certificate of Aaliyah & R. Kelly, states she is 18 yrs old. She was 15. He was 28 pic.twitter.com/AbIBbknfIS — Steven James (@TheLaunchMag) January 2, 2015\n\nWhat was missing from early mainstream discussions of the marriage between R. Kelly and Aaliyah was a black feminist critique of the relationship. Instead, critical analysis of Kelly's conduct was confined to fan magazines serving mostly black readers. Major papers weren't covering allegations of the urban artist's predatory behavior, nor were they exploring how misogynoir, which describes how hatred directed toward black women is influenced by both their race and gender, affected how the story was being framed.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the criticism didn't exist.\n\nI was an entertainment journalist in the early 90s. Many of us reported on his predatory practices, Hudson-Ward tweeted in response to Hill. I remember people being horrified. It seemed 'quiet' because we didn't have the internet & R. Kelly was 'urban.'\n\nAuthor and activist Kevin Powell was a senior writer at Quincy Jones' Vibe magazine when the publication printed Kelly and Aaliyah's marriage certificate in 1995. I interviewed Aaliyah first for the publication, and I remember her sounding deeply connected to R. Kelly in a way I thought was not right, given she was a minor and he an adult, about my age, Powell wrote in an email to HuffPost. I mentioned that fact to folks at Vibe and to the best of my recollection we were the ones who published their marriage certificate first, and talked about the marriage being annulled.\n\nBut pretty much most media simply never touched it, he added, and it remained a rumor only, for years and years after.\n\nWe did not do a good job in the media, in the music industry, in the community — even in social justice spaces — of saying this guy is a sexual predator and his victims are young black girls with aspiring music careers, said Kenyette Tisha Barnes, co-founder and national organizer of #MuteRKelly.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Early discussions of the marriage between R. Kelly and Aaliyah lacked a black feminist critique of the relationship.\n\nKelly and Aaliyah's marriage certificate was the standout element of Vibe's cover story, a Kelly profile by Danyel Smith that included quotes from Kelly fans and members of his inner circle, offering a snapshot of how the producer's supporters were complicit in his behavior, long before the Me Too era uprooted preconceptions about what constitutes and who enables abuse.\n\nThe piece opens with a scene at a Philadelphia hair salon, where women getting ready for a Kelly concert are discussing his rumored marriage.\n\nI can't believe R.Kelly got married to that child, one woman says.\n\nBut then I heard she ain't no child, another retorts.\n\nI heard she is. And that nigga needs more than any 15-year-old can give him.\n\nThe conversation illuminates the way many Americans understood sexual violence at the time — especially as it pertains to black girls, who are often perceived as older, less innocent and more knowledgeable about sex than their white peers. Like the women in Philly, many of Kelly's fans were shocked and dismayed by Kelly's relationship with Aaliyah. But they aimed their disgust at the younger woman, who was presumed to be either sexually unsatisfactory or suspiciously seductive ― never a victim or a survivor of abuse.\n\nBlack girls are likened more to adults than to children and are treated as if they are willfully engaging in behaviors typically expected of black women, said Dr. Monique W. Morris, the founder and president of the National Black Women's Justice Institute, in her book Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools. This compression [has] stripped black girls of their childhood freedoms [and] renders Black girlhood interchangeable with black womanhood.\n\nIf you're underage, there's no such thing as consent, Neal reiterated. People still can't wrap their heads around that, and so much of the blame gets placed on the 'black girl being fast,' which is a false narrative.\n\nSun, Dec 10, 1995 -- Page 338, The Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America), Newspapers.com\n\nNear the conclusion of her Vibe profile, Smith confesses her desire to confront Kelly about what a grown-ass man is doing with a teenage girlfriend. What's going on with him that he doesn't want or can't get with a girl his own age? I want to know if Aaliyah is being ravished and manipulated.\n\nUltimately, however, Smith doesn't ask those questions. The same year Smith's Vibe story was published, LA Times reporter Cheo H. Coker profiled Kelly in a piece titled Media Shy, Music Savvy: R. Kelly ― a writer, producer and singer with the Midas touch. At one point Coker describes Kelly's demeanor as drained, as if the weight of the world is on his shoulders, almost as if questioning Kelly was subjecting him to unjust suffering. Even after Smith opened the doors to discussing Kelly's past, reporters were still hesitant to press the celebrity on what appeared to be his documented marriage to an underage girl, fearing they'd lose access to him.\n\nHad [the abuse] occurred in 2018 everybody would know, and there likely would have been some handheld device that captured it, Neal said. It's really not until the videotape emerges that we start to get a different type of narrative attached to R. Kelly.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Chicago Sun-Times journalist Jim DeRogatis anonymously received a tape that appeared to show Kelly having sex with an underage woman and turned the tape over to police. The year prior, he'd received an anonymous fax tipping him to the fact that the sex-crimes unit of the Chicago police had been investigating Kelly for two years.\n\nRobert's problem is young girls, the fax ― later confirmed to be written by one of Kelly's assistants ― said. I've known Robert for many years, and I've tried to get him to get help, but he just won't do it. So I'm telling you about it hoping that you or someone at your newspaper will write an article about it and then Robert will have no choice but to get help and stop hurting the people he's hurting.\n\nDeRogatis' groundbreaking investigative piece accusing Kelly of being a sexual predator published in December of 2000, marked the beginning of a slow sea change for entertainment journalists. After DeRogatis' bombshell investigation, rumors solidified into legal allegations. The artist's mysterious public aura transformed from controversial to possibly criminal.\n\nYet even these revelations failed to turn the tide of public opinion, because, as Powell put it, the lives of women, and especially poor or working-class women like the ones Kelly preyed on, are simply not valued. The media's reluctance to report on Kelly was ultimately the result of a tangled web of racism, rape culture and celebrity obsession that took years of reporting from DeRogatis and others to untangle.\n\nAs DeRegotis put it in an interview with the Village Voice, a lot of people who are critics are fans.\n\nToday, Powell believes entertainment journalists are responsible for holding powerful stars accountable for their actions, even and especially when those actions bleed beyond the boundaries of business as usual.\n\nI think the job of a journalist is to tell the whole truth, if they know something, if you have real facts and real sources, Powell said. Part of the challenge with R. Kelly for many years[...] is that there were all kinds of enablers around him, and it appeared that many people who made allegations or knew things were paid off. On top of that fame, celebrity, is a very destructive thing. People turn their heads and ignore things because of their addiction to the famous, to celebrities.
This Sunday tens of thousands of Christians will gather in church basements and living rooms across America for an evening of fun, fellowship and football. Super Bowl Sunday is perhaps the nation's most widely observed and passionately celebrated day of the year, and Christians across the land will be front and center in embracing this cultural icon.\n\nMost thoughtful Christians realize it's rather silly to pray for God to help my team win the big game, but does God want the game to be played at all? Might God be offended by the very spectacle of big time football in America today?\n\nChristians would be wise to ask ourselves some uncomfortable questions here. Is the cozy relationship of faith and football an unholy marriage? Has the time come for us to take a hard look at what we enable when we buy tickets and team jerseys, and cheer the big game on in our fellowship halls? Are we guilty of turning a blind eye to a very ugly aspect of the game - the increasingly obvious and undeniable destruction of the bodies and minds of those who entertain us?\n\nPeople of any belief system claiming to value the well-being of our fellow men and women should take a hard look at these questions, but Christians have a clear scriptural imperative to treat our bodies, and by extension the bodies of others, as temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). How can that message be reconciled with support for football, a game that has directly caused documented cases of life-long physical and mental damage, not just to a few, but to many who live with these consequences for the benefit of our armchair entertainment?\n\nA September 2015 article in The Atlantic magazine titled The NFL's Continuing Concussion Nightmare reported that Boston University studied the brains of 91 former National Football League players. The result? 87 of them, or 96%, had signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a degenerative disease believed to stem from repetitive brain injury. Even considering that those who chose to donate their brains for such research would logically have a greater likelihood of CTE, the numbers are still staggering.\n\nIn recent weeks there's been a barrage of heart-breaking news about those who play the sport. The New York Times reported on one of the heroes of the first Super Bowl, Green Bay Packer Willie Wood, as he lives out his days in an assisted-living center with no memory of the game or his induction into the football Hall of Fame.\n\nAccompanying that piece is a sad roll call of NFL players who have succumbed to the awful effects of CTE, including many of the game's greatest names like Hall of Famers Frank Gifford, Mike Webster, and Junior Seau whose 2012 suicide at age 43 woke up many to the game's tragic toll.\n\nAntwaan Randall El, a 36-year-old former wide receiver who played in the Super Bowl wishes he never played the game. He speaks of walking down the stairs sideways and asking his wife the same questions over and over again.\n\nThen there is the tale of Tyler Sash, a 27 year old from Iowa whose life spiraled out of control after being released by the New York Giants. He had experienced five concussions during his brief career in the NFL, a career which also included a Super Bowl appearance.\n\nSash died shortly thereafter from what appeared to be an accidental overdose of pain medications. His brain was donated to Boston University who confirmed it showed evidence of CTE at an advanced stage rarely seen in someone his age.\n\nFor years the NFL stonewalled research and denied football's culpability in such tragedies, borrowing a page from the playbook of the tobacco industry in ferociously defending their dangerous product. That story is currently being told in the feature film Concussion starring Will Smith.\n\nFinally, facing the prospect of a tsunami of lawsuits and their potential for financially damaging if not destroying the business of football, the NFL caved. In 2015 they agreed to a $1 billion settlement with over 5000 former players who accused the NFL of deceitfully hiding from them knowledge of the devastating long-term effects of concussions suffered during their careers.\n\nThis tacit admission of guilt by the NFL should make Christians who still enjoy watching grown men smash into each other with a ferocity that leaves bodies and minds damaged for life squirm, and question their continuing loyalty to the sport.\n\nWhat would Jesus do? many ask when confronting thorny moral and ethical choices. Can we really see Jesus cheering the game on this weekend, when He who can see throughout time has the foreknowledge that many of the players will endure lifelong pain in knees and hips, or lose their minds and control of their bodily functions at age 45 or 50, as has happened to so many?\n\nI think not. I think the whole super-hyped, super-charged spectacle that gives many Christians such great enjoyment gives Jesus, the Prince of Peace, only a deep sadness.\n\nThe time has come for Christians to turn off the television, and for Christianity to file for divorce from the unholy marriage of our compassionate faith with the worldly and violent game of football.\n\nI believe it's what Jesus would have us do.
Do me a favor. Think back to those first moments of falling in love with someone. Do you remember the tingles and the thrills when you saw or thought of them? What if they suddenly broke up with you and your relationship came crashing down? Or maybe you cheated on them, or they cheated on you — but you both stayed in the relationship. And even though you treated them like crap or they treated you like crap, you couldn't stop being with them. You got back together like, eight times, and each time your self-esteem shrank.\n\nMaybe you found another partner right away to take away the bad feeling. Or you started to stalk your ex everywhere they went. Maybe you even started to sleep with all their friends to get back at them. Or you followed their new lover on social media. Maybe you broke into their house and then set up spy cameras.\n\nNo? Did I lose you way back at treating you like crap? If that's the case, it's probably because you aren't driven by compulsion and a disease called sex and love addiction. But I am.\n\nI could go back to the beginning and tell you how and why I started acting out with men at the young age of 13, but let's go straight to one of my bottoms as they call it in Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA), a 12-step program along the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nYour bottom is a moment when your whole world comes crashing down around you, and you're looking at the horrible mess you made and thinking to yourself, Crap, I created this drama and now I have to figure out this disaster of a life I've messed up.\n\nThe beginning of the end started in my small circular driveway. I was standing there trying to prevent two men from actually killing each other. One was from New York City and the other was a longtime boyfriend from back home, whom I'll call M.\n\nM and I had been together on and off for 10 years. But, for the past two years, I had been with both of these men in what they thought were monogamous relationships.\n\nI used to love to have multiple partners at once. Especially if they were living in different cities and would never be able to run into each other. I usually had one male companion in Los Angeles as well, but at this particular time, we were taking a break. Multiple partners kept me on my toes. Spinning lies is a huge part of the high a sex and love addict gets.\n\nMy ultimate fantasy was the ability to mold three or four guys together to make the perfect mate. I'd get emotional security from this guy, financial security from the other one, sexual chemistry with that one over there, and good old-fashioned best friend vibes with some other fool. It was like a revolving door of stand-in dudes for whatever need I had to fill at the moment.\n\nThe author, Brianne Davis-Gantt.\n\nThe huge problem with that — other than it is morally wrong and cruel to another human being — was that I was never really available to anyone. I never saw them for who they truly were. I was using them as a mirror to reflect what I wanted to see.\n\nSo that's how I found myself at the end of the driveway screaming from the pit of my soul I'm sorry!! … and I wasn't even sure that I was being 100% honest. But I wanted to diffuse the situation: two men standing in front of me both asking for an explanation which I did not have at the time.\n\nThis could have been the moment I realized that what I'd done to these two men was pretty messed up, but no. Instead, I detached. I felt myself float outside of my body and watch the whole thing play out like I was watching myself in a soap opera. (Strange, since I am an actor.)\n\nBut I am not a character in a play or show. I am a person. And something was seriously wrong with me. Was I missing the gene that made me care about others? Was I simply a cold-hearted bitch? I felt so numb. I wanted to die. I had hurt two people who didn't deserve it. Why was I like this?\n\nWe all know people who drink too much. They're alcoholics, and they make their lives and the lives of those they love a living hell. As a sex and love addict, I used men as my drug of choice. Multiple partners, inappropriate affairs and cheating were my acting out behaviors.\n\nSome sex and love addicts date unavailable partners, some are addicted to masturbation and porn, some depend on one night stands. For my life as an addict, the addiction told me that without men, without their attention, their love, and the power that came with that, I was nothing.\n\nEventually, it started to not be fun anymore. I was spinning too many lies and I was not getting the high I once had from the attention. So I thought I needed new partners. When they did not fix me, I obsessively started flirting and intriguing — which is like fishing and reeling someone into your world and then, once they're hooked, throwing them away.\n\nJust like an alcoholic, I couldn't stop.\n\nThere's nothing sexy or hot about using someone else to get high. I had done it too many times. I was tired. I was burnt out. I was miserable. Enough was enough.\n\nThat confrontation in the driveway was the beginning of the end for addict-me. But what in God's name did I do now that I was starting to understand how truly lonely and messed up I was? What was the next step? Especially since I had lost both men in my life, I couldn't seem to drag myself out of this bed.\n\nI walked my depressed self into a church rec room in Los Angeles with a bunch of sex and love addicts, after my therapist told me I had a major problem with relationships (shocker).\n\nSitting down in the uncomfortable metal chairs, my inner dialogue was running rampant and my ego was out of control. These people are nothing like me. What if someone recognizes me? Look, I know, I'm not famous by any means, but sometimes I have been asked for an autograph before. I have been on television a lot.\n\nThen the speaker, an older rocker dude, started to share. My mouth dropped in disbelief as he began telling my exact story. It seemed impossible that I could have so much in common with this man. He said that when he first walked into SLAA, he thought everyone there were freaks and losers. He didn't think he belonged there. He even left early at his first meeting, which made me laugh out loud because at that moment I too was thinking of my exit strategy.\n\nHe continued that he just reached seven years sober from this disease, and his life could not be more different. He felt peaceful and he had a lot more serenity. He was truly happy most of the time and living his best life in a committed marriage, which he never thought was possible.\n\nWhile he spoke, I felt a moment of peace. For the first time in my whole life, I belonged somewhere and I wasn't alone in my struggle. It gave me such hope. If he could recover, I might be able to as well.\n\nThat was well over a decade ago. I still remember his face. He saved my life that night in that church basement. I will forever be grateful for his authenticity and honesty about his journey out of his disease.\n\nAnd now it is my turn to help others see the way out of their darkness. Today, I am married and my husband and I have a beautiful baby boy. I am fully committed to my spouse, to my program and, more importantly, to myself.\n\nI just received my 10-year chip for continual sobriety in SLAA, which for me still includes no cheating, no flirting or intriguing outside of my marriage. It means not doing anything I wouldn't like my husband to know about — which, in a nutshell, means having no secrets, because secrets are what kills an addict.\n\nI used to think life without secrets and lies would be boring but I was completely wrong. I have more freedom. I'm not drowning in a web of deceit. I am present, healthy and truly happy. I am fully participating in my life, instead of living in a fantasy of lust. I am forever grateful for the 12-step rooms and my sobriety.\n\nI can honestly say now that I'm on the other side, it is a blessing to be a sex and love addict in recovery.\n\nBrianne is an actor, and appeared most recently on History Channel's Six.

When I walked down the aisle on May 2, 1987, to share, I do's with the man I had met seven months earlier, I anticipated that we would be spending a long lifetime together.\n\nWe had met when I was 28 and he was 36, introduced by a mutual friend during the intermission of a lecture by spiritual leader Ram Dass. Our marriage would be what I call paradoxical, with its share of love and its own major dysfunctions that I shudder to think I allowed for the time we were together.\n\nThe dynamic in my marriage fell into the category of chosen allegiances. If I wasn't siding with my husband against anyone who disagreed with him, I was not being loyal. I felt as if I was always being tested and found wanting. I thought I could heal the emotional wounds that he carried, but I realized that it needed to be an inside job. His pain spilled over into our home.\n\nIn my marriage, love and abuse lay side by side. It was primarily emotional, with two incidents that were physical. Both times he expressed remorse, but I wondered when it might happen again. I was embarrassed to be in such a situation, since as a therapist I would have advised clients to leave.\n\nIn 1992, he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C and I became his caregiver, citing the in sickness and health part of our marriage vows. My hope was that as a result of his needing my assistance with his ADLs (activities of daily living), he would magically become kinder and more patient. That same year we adopted our son, then 5.\n\nWhat I discovered, to my disappointment, was that even with my mad skills as a professional therapist, I was at a loss to facilitate a healthy relationship between Michael and myself. A month after we adopted him, I had an ectopic pregnancy. A few months after that, we lost our home to the raging winds and rising waters of Hurricane Andrew in Homestead, Florida. It could have heralded the end of the marriage, but we pulled together.\n\nMichael took his last breath on Dec. 21,1998, and since then I have had short-term relationships, lovers and friends with benefits. I have not been in a committed relationship since my husband died nearly 21 years ago. I call myself incidentally poly, since it is not my consciously chosen lifestyle, but I have had several simultaneous connections.\n\nI have done the internet dating thing off and on for years, being both delighted and disappointed. I had a catfishing experience a year or so ago, and I met one man who became a pivotal person in my life, but we knew we weren't soulmate material. We talk a few times a year now.\n\nMy son has told me that I will never find a man with the qualities I am looking for and that I need to be with a woman. I tell him that I haven't even met a woman I could see myself with, although I would welcome her if she does arrive.\n\nI have another long-divorced friend who says it would take someone exceptional to take her out of her single life. While I love being single with the freedom to create my own life, I simultaneously miss the companionship of a partner. I have amazing friends who meet some of my needs. I wish I could create a composite person comprised of all the wonderful qualities of those I know.\n\nI have done all the things relationship coaches advise, such as feng shui-ing my home, designing a vision board, making the list of qualities I desire in a partner, cleaning out a dresser drawer, acting as I would if I were in a relationship, journaling about it, being the kind of person I want to attract, loving myself as I want to be loved.\n\nI have held wedding ceremonies in which I have married myself. I take myself on dates. I have no fear of going anywhere alone. Movies, dinner, concerts, walks in the park ― all things I would love to do while holding hands with a significant other. I have written cards and poems to give to this person.\n\nI have wistfully gazed at couples who are all mushy-gushy with each other and desire that. I have also heard stories about the vitriol and violence in relationships and sigh with relief that I am a party of one. It is so much less complicated when I am the only one who needs to make decisions that affect my life, the only one to get out the door on time, the only one whose cleanliness standards I meet, without expectations of someone else meeting mine.\n\nWhen I officiate at a wedding as an interfaith minister or attend one as a guest, without a plus one at my side or on the dance floor, a sense of wistfulness overcomes me at times. I toggle back and forth on the daily.\n\nI have worked with a few coaches who have assisted me in peeling off the layers and getting to know myself better, but have not yet attracted the love of my life. I used to believe that in order to be in love, people had to carry little baggage (or at least have it fit in the overhead compartment), have financial independence, be healthy and low maintenance with minimal drama, have it all sewn up in a nice, neat little package. Yet there are folks like me who have done the work to be relationship-ready, and who are still a solo act. And there are those who meet few or none of the criteria listed above who have devoted partners.\n\nI know I am the real deal, the whole package, good relationship material, despite my wounds and fears of attracting the same dynamics as the undesirable ones in my marriage. Friends attempt to assure me that I won't, since I have grown dramatically in the two decades since Michael died.\n\nA part of me died that day, too. The part that was, as he so eloquently put it, an emotional contortionist who would bend over backward to please people, a deer caught in the headlights when it came to making a decision and was always looking over my shoulder to see if the propriety police were watching. She is long gone, replaced by the resilient thriver who gazes back at me from the mirror and lives a rich, fully, juicy life.\n\nI ask myself, as do many of my single friends in their 50s and beyond, what if I am never in a full-out committed relationship?\n\nI have just turned 61 and imagine I have another 20 some years left. What if I remain single for those decades? I am accepting that possibility as I might embrace an unpartnered life.\n\nWhat would that look like, I ponder? Will I be one of those eccentric older women who lives an unconventional existence? I already do, according to my son. His weird hippie mom whose effusiveness, color and pizazz, highlighted by purple hair, sometimes embarrasses him as much as it did when he was a teen. Will I be satisfied to have needs met in a patchwork style, with affection, attention, sex, and companionship arriving sporadically? Can I refrain from judging myself for being alone, since it seems no one else in my life casts disapproval on my single status?\n\nI sometimes ask my intended, Is this the day you will show up? Am I hiding in plain sight despite feeling transparently, nakedly visible? People keep telling me that when I surrender attachment to outcome, this person will indeed knock on the door to my heart.\n\nIn the meantime, keeping my heart open to myself is essential. I am always and forever, the love of my life.\n\nDo you have a personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost? Find out what we're looking for here and send us a pitch!
Courtesy of Kasey Koop Unlike the legions of guys who fetishized my occupation during the courting period, he never brought it up.\n\nAre you really gonna wife a stripper? was the first of many messages my boyfriend received from an old acquaintance regarding our relationship, then only two months in.\n\nFirst off, moving a little fast there, bud. Marriage? It took me five-and-a-half years of playing the field to finally commit to a monogamous relationship and I even tried canceling our first date because I was tired! He suggested we take a nap and it worked.\n\nOver a year and some change together, my boyfriend has taken the brunt of the pushback against our stripper-civilian relationship. Although he tries to spare my feelings by avoiding the gritty details of the flak he's received, he has mentioned that people frequently ask him how he can feel comfortable dating a stripper.\n\nOne of his co-workers kept pressing him to confess that we have an open relationship ― when, in fact, we do not. On Facebook, he once received a direct message from an anonymous account created with the intent of dissuading him from dating a sex worker. Poor guy, he has to put up with dating a gorgeous and confident woman whom everyone pines over. How does he survive?\n\nSeriously, though, my boyfriend doesn't mind dating a stripper. Unlike the legions of guys who fetishized my occupation during the courting period, he never brought it up.\n\nMy boyfriend and I met through mutual friends, officially at a party but unofficially via cyber-stalking. His opening line was, I added you on Facebook so now we're friends. He informed me, much later, that he had already seen my Instagram account, which functioned as my stripping advertisement page. It flaunted everything from my Playboy photos to twerking videos to a Vice documentary about exotic dancing that I was featured in.\n\nMy dirty laundry was proudly aired and didn't scare him, which is a lot more than I can say for guys I've met much older than he is (my dude is five years my junior). As my social media had already outed me, I was free to be myself. He seemed to see stripping the way I do ― as a job.\n\nPrior to meeting my partner, I played the dating app game and hid my profession from guys until it was time to come out, after which they'd friend-zone me or try to check off their bang-a-stripper bucket list. Finally, burned out on playing to male smallness, I threw the idea of dating to the wayside and owned myself, stripping and all.\n\nThere is something magnetic about being unapologetically yourself. That's when my boyfriend appeared, taking me on real dates and shelving sex until we got to know each other first.\n\nEven before I was a stripper, I was a stripper: free-spirited and exhibitionistic. I've been allergic to people controlling me since twerking my way out of the womb.\n\nI started dancing three years ago when I needed to save up for a car and also needed to never answer to a boss again. As a dancer, flirt and hustler, I'd found my perfect fit.\n\nThree months in, I hit rock bottom with my addictions and got sober while continuing to work in the strip club. Since then, I've had more fun than ever. Running around in my panties, stone sober, gives me a freedom I haven't felt since middle school.\n\nLike any job, it has good and bad days, typically contingent upon how much money I make. The best part is working only 18 hours a week, which frees up time for my stand-up comedy, writing, podcast, friends and dog.\n\nMy biggest fear going into dancing was that now no one would ever love me, never mind the fact that I had been single for nearly six years. But in the strip club, I met girls who were in long-term relationships and even married. One of my co-workers met her husband while she was Stella-Getting-Her-Groove-Back at a nude joint following an abusive relationship. Her future husband worked nearby and was friends with the girls at her club. My co-stripper tested his goodness by hustling customers right in front of him while he sipped a beer at the bar.\n\nThe key to meeting your match is being your whole and happiest self. My realest self happens to be wearing a pink fur bikini while body-rolling in front of 50 onlookers to Drake's God's Plan.\n\nLike any romantic relationship, communication is the cornerstone of health. I complain to my boyfriend about cheap customers just as often as I gloat about making a couple hundred simply for talking to someone. He offers support by listening or sharing a pack of break-apart cookies with me like any solid partner would. (Another cool aspect of stripping is that I have the metabolism of a 13-year-old with ADHD.)\n\nThere are other ways that I uphold and maintain trust, such as not giving lap dances to men that I know from outside the club. While my partner has never said not to, I felt it was inappropriate and established that boundary. I also don't give out my number or social media handles to customers (actually that's something I wouldn't do even if I were single). Half of them are girlfriend shoppers who come to the club trying to take home a lady, which is asinine. It's like playing Monopoly and thinking you'll cash out in real dollars at the end.\n\nMy boyfriend also appreciates the no-touching rule that my club maintains. As lovely as my dude is, he is human and takes solace in the fact that men aren't allowed to rub their hands all over me. Frankly, so do I.\n\nThe biggest issue in our stripper-civilian relationship is how the physical pain from dancing in heels impedes our love life. It's hard enough trying to make out with a younger man while pretending my back doesn't hurt, but those song lyrics, My neck, my back, are a lot less sexy when finished with, Ouch, careful on my knees and hips too. The man who gives me the most pleasure is my chiropractor.\n\nWorking nights while my boo is busy during the daytime can also be a hassle, but I would've been busy at night with comedy, anyway. Being able to spend only four nights of the week together actually keeps the fire lit between us.\n\nOne major boundary that we've maintained is that he doesn't visit me at work. While some of the other girls have beaus come in, I wouldn't feel comfortable with mine seeing me flirt up other guys. We have visited my club together as patrons and made it rain on my girlfriends.\n\nI've never asked him if his parents know about my job because I'm positive they do and I don't want to talk about it. Sometimes it's better not to go into situations thinking people hate you for your line of work.\n\nUltimately, stripping is my talent and I refuse to waste my God-given attributes. I'm not embarrassed about being able to move with simultaneous strength and grace. I'm proud of overcoming the self-consciousness that kept me from eating enough food and fueled my finding new and creative ways to self-destruct.\n\nTruthfully, if people have a problem with my relationship, it's because most don't know what love without ownership feels like.\n\nOur love challenges society's views of the male and female roles. That is, it confronts the assumption that a man owns the copyright on his girlfriend's sexuality. In the same way, people view sexy selfies as thirst traps or a sex-themed joke as an invitation. Maybe a girl just wants to express her whole humanity.\n\nMy sexuality is as much a working part of my personality as my wit. It doesn't lie dormant in an underwear drawer, waiting for my lover to get into the mood. I express it openly and profit off it because that feels natural to me. It doesn't take away from the well of deep intimacy that my partner and I share. The sexuality I sell is surface-level, not the shared trust of two people in love, walking hand-in-hand through hardship.\n\nWe need to let go of the scarlet letter burned into sex workers that cuts us off from society and the embrace of our partners' friends and families, let alone those potential partners. It's killing us, between the stigma and the resulting violence against sex workers. And even if you're not a sex worker, you're hurt too by the patriarchal control that insists a relationship amounts to ownership of a woman. Let's overthrow it.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story you want to share? Send your story description to pitch@huffpost.com.
No one saw this coming. Not me, and therefore, I assume, no one else. In our defense, the teaser for Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance provided no evidence — or even much justification for optimism — that the movie itself would be low-key amazing.\n\nThe brief trailer captured all the most cookie-cutter Lifetime moments (like Harry telling Meghan, I don't need my life to be this perfect royal picture. I just need you) and passionate bedroom interludes. This had a haunting appeal of its own, to be sure. It's ghoulish, but if Lifetime wants to show us fake Harry and fake Meghan smooching topless in bed, I will not turn away.\n\nBut approximately every third Lifetime rom-com features a prince going down on one knee in front of a comely American. What makes Harry and Meghan different from the usual offering of handsome-ish barista from Wisconsin portraying the crown prince of Mendavia woos onetime network sitcom child star playing an aspiring fashion designer — aside from how much wine I drank while watching (about half a bottle)?\n\nThe script, for one thing, which hopscotches wildly from schmaltz to snark. After Princess Diana's funeral, Prince Charles takes his sons to Botswana, where he begins lecturing them on the importance of reflecting on the broader sweep of history by visiting the birthplace of mankind.\n\nYou're not going to start quoting 'Lion King' again, are you? Prince William says with a sigh. Yes! William's first line in the movie is a crack about the 1994 Disney movie The Lion King. Reader, I was done for.\n\nAnd that's before we even meet the grown-up William, portrayed by Burgess Abernethy. How striking the resemblance — to your 43-year-old tax accountant. Grown-up William says things like I'm just having a giggle and uses a coffee mug that reads World's Best Dad.\n\nNot every royal fares well in the script. The fake Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge (Laura Mitchell), takes on the tough but necessary job of making married life look miserable (Marriage isn't so bad, is it, Will? she asks her husband pointedly, as he evades her gaze), and the members of the royal family look calculating and cold. She doesn't like that Americans are so loud, and sniffs her doubts that this upstart actress could handle the rigors of royal life. By the time we see her assuring Meghan that us commoners have to stick together and confiding in her about feeling like a baby-making machine, it's too late: I hate Kate now.\n\nIt wasn't all sunshine and English tea roses for the real Harry and Meghan Markle either. I feared that Lifetime would gloss over the racist reaction Markle faced when their relationship became known and superimpose a more palatable, standard-issue rom-com conflict. But instead of giving us a lame storyline about Meghan — I don't know — seeing Harry kiss an ex-girlfriend's cheek and fleeing to Toronto in tears, Lifetime gave us some real talk about race.\n\nOK, sometimes this real talk feels … not so real. At the end of the movie, Queen Elizabeth shows Harry and Meghan a portrait of her ancestor Queen Charlotte, a German princess with Portuguese roots who may have had African heritage. Oh, yes, you're of mixed race, Harry, says Elizabeth. And so am I! A very sweet scene that also seems a tad out of character for the matriarch of the royal family, which has long been cool about research into Charlotte's racial background.\n\nOther moments feel more painfully honest. After a royal hanger-on at a tea makes a snide comment about Meghan's hair, then tries to touch it, Harry becomes righteously incensed. This is just how things are, she tells him. Let's fight how things are! he exclaims. If anyone can, it's you and me. She replies, calmly, You have never seen how ugly people can get about this. To enlighten him, she relates a painful story from her childhood about being out with her mother, who is black, and seeing a white man call her the N-word.\n\nBut fake Meghan does not say the N-word. She fully drops the word, in the middle of this primetime, soft-filter Sunday romance. Jesus, Lifetime, I hope you plan to pay the dry-cleaning bill for my wine-stained couch.\n\nThis could all have gone wildly awry; a script is only as good as the actors who bring it to life. Often Lifetime movies are fronted by former teen soap stars who check only one acting skill box, like sexy squinting or natural-seeming laugh or looks like she's really drinking coffee even though it's an empty cup.\n\nBut Parisa Fitz-Henley, as Meghan, and Murray Fraser, as Harry, are top-shelf Lifetime talents.\n\n(Fun aside: Fraser is only 23, just a couple of years out of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Fitz-Henley is 41! Talk about goddamn female empowerment. Let's cast more movies in which the woman is decades older than her male costar.)\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan engage in first-date banter about his showing up 40 minutes late, it could easily have been a cringingly wooden exchange of quips. I mean, It would really hurt my street cred to be seen in public with a guy who can't tell time is barely even a joke. But Fraser and Fitz-Henley deliver their lines like two people actually trying to impress each other on a date, not like two community theater actors doing a first table read, and I ate up every second of it. When they laughed, I laughed. When they caught their breath and leaned in for a kiss, I caught my breath and leaned toward the TV, which was unreceptive to my advances.\n\nOr maybe it was the wine.\n\nLook, Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance is the type of movie best enjoyed with basement-level expectations. Do not cue this up on your DVR and head in expecting a special episode of The Crown. This is, as promised, just for the real monarchy trash out there. Only cornballs welcome here! An entire subplot of the film follows Harry's mystical lion sightings in Botswana, which may or may not be visitations from his late mother. Or, in my mind, Aslan. It's bonkers!\n\nThe edges are rough, production-wise. Who can blame them? A top-quality movie doesn't get made and released in the six months between a royal couple's public engagement and their nuptials. At one memorable moment, the two's first blind date is interrupted by sunrise, which arrives with the abruptness of a powerful lamp being switched on offstage. At another, the film noticeably cuts to news footage of a car going into the real Buckingham Palace. Hey, they tried their best.\n\nThe movie, in general, leans heavily on their target audience's knowing the general arc and milestones of Harry and Markle's relationship, which relieves its creators of the obligation to transition smoothly from scene to scene. Why not just jam in a scene in which Harry confronts a crusty old British lady wearing a racist Blackamoor brooch at Pippa Middleton's wedding? Princess Michael of Kent did once wear a Blackamoor brooch at a lunch with Markle, and royal fans will be excited to see that tidbit pop up in the fictionalization.\n\nThe movie takes certain liberties with the timeline and the actual events in order to squeeze it into a rom-com template, but mostly it's just a checklist of aww-able moments: The engagement chicken! The public statement from Harry defending his new girlfriend! Meghan bonding with Elizabeth's corgis! Botswana!\n\nI thought Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance would be terrible as well as intoxicating, but instead it was perfect as well as intoxicating. I loved the weird spirit lions. I loved the no-holds-barred approach to race and Meghan's feminist activism. I loved our new accountant uncle, William. I loved Kate's rebirth as the British Regina George. I loved when fake Harry told his family that he wouldn't make Meghan shut down her blog, The Tig, because that blog is part of her identity. (Anyway, she totally did shut down the blog, but I appreciate the sentiment.)\n\nAnd I love that I don't have to watch the actual wedding next week anymore. Nothing could possibly top this.
It's only his second Netflix special, but David Letterman's new edition of (deep breath now) My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman already seems to be straining for effect. The guest this time is George Clooney. It starts with the two of them standing outside an In-N-Out Burger joint in Los Angeles, munching burgers and fries — you know, just a couple of regular guys, you're supposed to think. That is, until an In-N-Out employee comes out to give them chocolate milkshakes and they look at him as if this worker was a Martian. The most these two wealthy showbiz fellows can summon in his presence is the idea that maybe one of them should have given the guy a tip. That's how celebrities look at you or me: Maybe we should give this person a few bucks.\n\nCut to the interview proper. Clooney comes out onstage, he and Letterman sit down in chairs, Clooney does the obligatory joke about Letterman's beard, referring to this Soggy Bottom Boys thing you've got going, and they ramble on the subject of Clooney's childhood, with a fair amount of Letterman's childhood thrown into the bargain. It's nothing you haven't heard if you've ever seen Clooney profiled, or read a Letterman interview, but here's the thing: To each other, this is all new material, because Clooney and Letterman live inside their separate fame bubbles, so Letterman's never heard the Clooney stories about all the bad TV acting gigs he had before ER made him a star, and Clooney hasn't heard Letterman talk about how his mom was emotionally withholding. Basically, watching all this on Netflix, you're waiting for them to get these niceties out of the way to dig down a bit deeper.\n\nUnfortunately, the deeper stuff is also the most tedious stuff. Once the conversation has taken us up to Clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, the show cuts to a filmed segment of a visit to Clooney's boyhood home in Lexington, Ky. There, his dad, former broadcaster Nick Clooney, introduces Letterman to Hazim Avdal, whose chyron reads, Iraqi refugee sponsored by the Clooneys. Yes, the elder Clooneys have taken in a nice young man at the bidding of George and Amal, who works with people whose families have been affected by genocidal war. It's a pleasant enough interlude — until they're all walking down a leafy Kentucky street chatting and Letterman mock-yells at a guy riding on lawn mower. Except it's not really a mock yell; he really does want the guy to shut off his motor so they can keep filming. Again: rich and powerful person meets ordinary citizen as alien presence.\n\nThe hour is genial enough, with Clooney professing extravagant love for Amal: I had met someone for whom I would absolutely trade my life for … her life meant more to me than my life, and I'd never had that experience before. George talks about the twins he and Amal have, and Letterman chimes in with more tales of parenthood. Clooney starts asking Letterman questions about his childhood, and when he says, People don't know much about you and people are interested in how you became David Letterman, we're back to that Celebrities, they're not like us stuff again, because we have to sit through stuff we already know about Letterman's Midwestern childhood and his early days as a weatherman and comedian.\n\nAs I say: affable enough. But if you find yourself getting bored, I'll give you a Netflix tip: Give Babylon Berlin a shot. It's a German crime series — I'm only one episode in, but it seems interesting.\n\nMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman is streaming now on Netflix.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:
A gay couple who claimed to have had their marriage recognized in Russia by way of a bureaucratic loophole have gone into hiding after facing legal persecution.\n\nPavel Stotzko and Eugene Wojciechowski are believed to have left Russia after an apparent standoff with police, The Guardian reported Monday. Members of the local activist group, Russian LGBT Network, said the entrance to Stotzko and Wojciechowski's Moscow apartment had been blocked over the weekend by officers, who were attempting to confiscate the couple's passports. The apartment's electricity and internet access were turned off for several hours, the group wrote on Facebook.\n\nBy Monday, the men had handed their passports over to authorities and had relocated to a safe location, Russian LGBT Network members wrote in a second Facebook post.\n\nStotzko and Wojciechowski are believed to have left the country, The Guardian and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty both reported. (All Russians over 16 are required to have internal passports that document their place of residence and marital status. A separate, external passport must be used for foreign travel.)\n\nHuman rights activist Igor Kochetkov told The Moscow Times that he'd helped the couple, who had been receiving death threats, to flee.\n\nThe police officers declared openly that they could not protect [the pair] from attacks from homophobically minded citizens and organizations. This was a hidden threat, Kochetkov said. Therefore the decision was made that for now, they must leave Russia.\n\nStotzko and Wojciechowski were married in Copenhagen on Jan. 4. When they returned to Moscow last week, they presented their passports to a customs officer, along with their Danish marriage certificate. The officer stamped the marital status page in Stotzko and Wojciechowski's passports and filled their names in.\n\nRussian law states marriages that were registered abroad will be recognized if they do not contradict article 14 of the Family Code, according to The Moscow Times. Though polygamous unions and marriages between close relatives are prohibited, the law does not mention same-sex couples.\n\nHence, the men interpreted their passport stamps as legal recognition of their union. Their story made international headlines and was touted as a rare LGBTQ-rights victory in Russia, where same-sex couples are not permitted to wed.\n\nTheir happiness, however, was short-lived. After news of the couple's story broke this weekend, Russia's Interior Ministry spokeswoman Irina Volk told RT that Voytsekhovsky and Stotsko's passports were marked as invalid in a federal database. The customs officer who stamped the passports and her direct supervisor, she added, were fired for committing violations of Russian legislation.\n\nRussia's stance on LGBTQ issues has been the subject of global scrutiny in recent years. In 2013, the country adopted a controversial law forbidding distribution of gay propaganda to minors.\n\nOver the past year, lawmakers have repeatedly dismissed troubling allegations that gay men are being detained, tortured and even killed in the Russian republic of Chechnya.\n\nClarification: The article has been amended to include information describing Russia's use of internal and external passports.
Vice President Mike Pence defended second lady Karen Pence's decision to take a teaching job at a school that discriminates against LGBTQ individuals and families, suggesting that the uproar over it is an attack on Christianity.\n\nDuring an interview with the Catholicism-focused Eternal World Television Network on Thursday, Pence said that the attacks on the Immanuel Christian School, which bans LGBTQ employees, students and families, were offensive to his family.\n\nTo see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us, Pence said.\n\nWe'll let the critics roll off our backs, the vice president continued. But this criticism of Christian education should stop.\n\nPREVIEW -- @VP @mike_pence responds to critics of @SecondLady's new job. The criticism of Christian education in America should stop. Tune in tonight for part one of my full interview with the Vice President on @EWTNNewsNightly at 7 PM EST on @EWTN. pic.twitter.com/YKEHyroswC — Lauren Ashburn (@LaurenAshburn) January 17, 2019\n\nThe interview comes just two days after HuffPost broke the news that Karen Pence accepted a job at the Immanuel Christian School in Northern Virginia. The school refuses to admit any students who participate in or condone homosexual or bisexual activity and included in its 2018 employment application a requirement that applicants pledge not to participate in or condone homosexual activity, or violate the unique roles of male and female.\n\nThe employment application also says the school believes in a definition of marriage that strictly includes one man and one woman and notes that a wife is commanded to submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ.\n\nIn its parent agreement, the school reserves the right to expel a student if they, their parents, or someone in their household engages in homosexual or bisexual activity, or supports or condones that behavior.\n\nVirginia is one of more than two dozen states that do not prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual and gender identity.\n\nMike Pence on Thursday said that religious schools like Immanuel Christian School were a part of American tradition and are protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion.\n\nWe have a rich tradition in America of Christian education and frankly religious education broadly defined, he said.\n\nWe celebrate it. The freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\nOthers see Pence's decision to teach at Immanuel Christian School, which includes students from kindergarten to eighth grade, as an endorsement of discrimination against the LGBTQ community.\n\nIt's disturbing Second Lady Karen Pence would put her stamp of approval on an institution that actively targets LGBTQ students at one of the places where they should feel the safest, Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said in a statement.\n\nEllis noted that many young students coming to terms with their gender identity turn to the arts as a safe haven.\n\nAs an art teacher, I suspect [Pence] is aware of that, she said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the second lady said that Pence was previously employed by the school for 12 years while her husband, Mike Pence, was in Congress.\n\nIt's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, Pence spokeswoman Kara Brooks told HuffPost.\n\nIn a statement to USA Today, the second lady said she was excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do. I have missed teaching art.\n\nWatch Mike Pence's full interview here.
The benefits of going to therapy cannot be overstated, though it may feel intimidating to dive in and make it part of your routine at first.\n\nWhile therapists take many different approaches to meeting frequency and length, the norm for individual therapy (i.e., therapy with one client) tends to be weekly 45- or 50-minute sessions. But when did this time become the standard therapy hour or therapeutic hour?\n\nThere are various theories on the origins of the 50-minute therapy session and some reports that trace back to Freud, Becky Stuempfig, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Encinitas, California, told HuffPost. There does not seem to be a consensus on exactly when the 'therapeutic hour' was established, but it has remained the industry standard.\n\nFatCamera via Getty Images The therapy hour or therapeutic hour is typically not a full hour.\n\nBeyond the history, however, there are many reasons ― practical, psychological and insurance-related ― to stick to this time frame. HuffPost spoke to Stuempfig and other therapists to find out why the 45- or 50-minute session has persisted.\n\nIt Helps With Logistics\n\nThere are many logistical factors keeping session lengths around this time frame, rather than a full hour.\n\nFor clients, this timing may make it easier to see a therapist during a lunch hour or just before work. For therapists with back-to-back sessions, the 10 or 15-minute break offers the opportunity to write progress notes about the client they just saw, return calls and emails, handle billing, take a bathroom break, get a glass of water or even just breathe.\n\nThere are therapists who work extensively with clients dealing with very heavy, traumatic experiences, so the break gives them the chance to decompress a little bit, said Tammer Malaty, a licensed professional counselor at Malaty Therapy in Houston, Texas.\n\nLogistically speaking, therapists typically rely on the time between sessions to reset themselves for their next client, noted Stuempfig, adding that this can involve taking deep breaths to prepare themselves mentally for their next client so they can feel present and alert.\n\nMany therapists utilize 45 minutes, rather than 50, to extend the break between sessions, or to schedule back-to-back sessions on the hour and half-hour marks.\n\nThis is a newer practice, said Nicole M. Ward, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles. She noted that 45-minute sessions also allow therapists to see more clients in one day.\n\nIt Feels More Contained\n\nThere are also psychological reasons why these session times remain the norm. First of all, the length of time feels more contained, so it lessens the risk of over-exposure to painful emotions.\n\nIt could feel traumatic to a client to sit with their pain for an extended period of time, risking emotional harm and causing the client to not return due to fear of retraumatization, Stuempfig said.\n\nGiven the unique personal and emotional natures of therapy, many people would find an hour or more to be overwhelming to their nervous system and moving on with their day after that, added Denver-based licensed psychotherapist Brittany Bouffard. It allows the client to visit important processes, feel feelings, derive their insights and get the sense that there will be a reprieve from the intensity so that they can then go back to work or to their family.\n\nThe therapeutic hour also sets psychological boundaries for the therapist and client. Stuempfig noted that 45- or 50-minute sessions allow therapists to offer a fresh perspective and remain objective without getting too immersed in a client's life.\n\nAt the core of the therapeutic relationship is confidentiality, she explained. The client enters the relationship being guaranteed that their revelations will not leave that space, unless of course there are safety risks. This creates a unique dynamic that is not meant to go on for long periods of time. It would not be sustainable to have this type of conversation for many hours at a time.\n\nHaving a clear endpoint after less than an hour can help create a safe space for the client to feel, process and contain intense emotions, rather than go into it with the sense that there's no end in sight.\n\nLucy Lambriex via Getty Images There are practical, psychological and insurance-related reasons to limit session length to 45 or 50 minutes.\n\nIt Encourages Good Use Of Time\n\nKeeping therapy sessions under an hour may also motivate both parties to make the best of the time allotted.\n\nIt can encourage both therapist and client to get to the heart of the problem rather quickly, Stuempfig noted. They know that if they engage in typical small talk, it will be a waste of valuable time.\n\nWhen the client knows a big issue won't be fully resolved in one session, they may feel more comfortable presenting it, discussing goals to counter the problem, exploring different aspects of it and learning coping skills to implement in everyday life.\n\nWhen people have longer, they don't get to the meat of the material very quickly, Lori Gottlieb, a Los Angeles-based psychotherapist and author of Maybe You Should Talk To Someone, told HuffPost. When people know they have 50 minutes, they feel aware that they need to take advantage of that time. It's about striking a balance so that work is getting done.\n\nLonger sessions may also lead to a sense of fatigue or burnout for both the therapist and the client. For children, that timing sweet spot can be shorter with 30-minute sessions, as 45 or 50 is sometimes too long for a kid's attention span.\n\nIt Helps You Process What You Learn\n\nSaniyyah Mayo, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, compared therapy sessions to high school classes. Each class presents a set amount of time that students spend learning about a specific section of the curriculum. Afterward, they can process the information and even explore it in a different setting through homework.\n\nA person can have a 4-hour session but they are not going to reflect and digest everything that was discussed during the session, Mayo explained. The client may think it was a good session, but too much information would be covered for them to completely digest it and benefit from it. Giving people increments of information and allowing them to process it in sections is good for the best possible outcome for treatment.\n\nThis is why therapists often suggest meeting more frequently, rather than extending sessions, when clients express a desire for more time.\n\nI think more work gets done in two separate sessions than in one longer one when you feel like you have all the time in the world, said Gottlieb, who compared therapy to a big, filling meal.\n\nYou can't have this whole huge meal at once and expect it be digested or processed in the same way as if you'd just eaten a little bit and let it digest and then eaten more later, she explained. You need that time in between. You can't take too much in and have it stick.\n\nIt Allows You To Incorporate Your Findings\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is that therapy is an ongoing conversation, and the real change happens when the clients practice what they learn in their lives outside the therapist's office. The focus should be on the skills and insights they gain during sessions and how they'll implement them ― not the length of the sessions.\n\nThere's a great deal going on in the span of the therapeutic hour, Stuempfig said. It is intended to be limited and therefore, powerful in its impact. This also leaves time between sessions for the client to reflect on their therapeutic insights and hopefully adjust their perspective or relationships. Our brains and bodies need time and space to incorporate lessons learned in therapy.\n\nLightFieldStudios via Getty Images The 45- or 50-minute session is not a hard and fast rule. There are many situations when therapists opt for longer sessions.\n\nInsurance Pushes it\n\nInsurance companies also feed into the 45- or 50-minute session standard, as they base reimbursement on the type and length of therapy. A common billing code is 90834, which denotes 45 minutes of individual psychotherapy but can be used for sessions ranging from 38 to 52 minutes.\n\nIf the clinician stays with a client for more than 52 minutes, then technically a different code should be used ― a code that defines 'one unit' of therapy as 60 minutes, said Zainab Delawalla, a clinical psychologist in Decatur, Georgia.\n\nHowever, there is a lot of pushback from insurance companies about actually paying clinicians for the '60-minute' code. Many companies require preauthorizations and have very strict criteria of when and for whom the 60-minute therapy hour is appropriate. If the insurance provider decides that the criteria were not met, they will not pay the clinician.\n\nThus, to avoid not being paid or breaking the law (by billing a code that doesn't accurately convey the length and nature of the service provided), clinicians tend to stick with the industry standard of 45 or 50 minutes.\n\nOf course, therapists can and do offer different session lengths based on individual client needs and make it work with providers. And even if your therapist doesn't take your insurance, your provider may offer out-of-network reimbursement options.\n\nBeyond The 45- Or 50-Minute Session\n\nAlthough 45- or 50-minute sessions are the industry standard, it's not a hard rule across every case. For couples or families, therapists offer longer sessions, usually 90 minutes.\n\nThese are spaces where there are multiple perspectives at play and you want everyone to be able to have space, Ward said, noting that these sessions involve more information and relationship dynamics to address.\n\nIn individual therapy, there's sometimes a clinical need for longer sessions, whether that's a more complex issue to work through or even a time of crisis. In these cases, session timing may shift.\n\nMany therapists also offer longer sessions for intake appointments with new clients to ensure that they have enough time to gather information and ask questions for diagnostic clarification.\n\nUltimately, therapists assess clients and determine meeting times on a case-by-case basis.
Axelle/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Jennifer Garner at the 2071 Baby2Baby Gala in Culver City, California.\n\nWe dare you not to aw at this love note written by Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck's son.\n\nThe Alias actress, who's busy gearing up for her next action project Peppermint, is usually hesitant to share anything about her three children with Affleck ― Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 5, but we're guessing this was just too adorable to keep to herself.\n\nOn Monday, Garner posted a photo of a note written by her son that he apparently left behind in a book for another reader to find.\n\nHello, You are loved. I believe in you, the note reads.\n\nWhen the librarian finds a love note your son tucked into a picture book, Garner captioned the photo adding the hashtags #actsofkindness #spreadthelove #belikemlkjr #lovenote.\n\nA post shared by Jennifer Garner (@jennifer.garner) on Jan 15, 2018 at 8:38am PST\n\nGarner and Affleck initially separated in June 2015 after 10 years of marriage. Although there were rumors of reconciliation over the last year, the pair officially filed for divorce last April.\n\nThe Justice League actor has since entered into a relationship with Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus. The two were recently spotted on a casual shopping date in Los Angeles.\n\nMeanwhile, the former couple continue to co-parent their children, reuniting last week for daughter Seraphina's ninth birthday party at Garner's place, as well as spending Christmas Day as a family.\n\nWhatever is going on in their personal lives, they're clearly doing something right at home.
And because I was a bit afraid that if I did not come, if I did not live with him, I might grow too used to living without him. As indeed he might grow too used to living without me. (I also feared he might meet somebody else and fall in love all over again in that stereotypical way men of a certain age are supposed to. And then I got here and realized -- given the dearth of female company I can pick from for a laugh over a shared bottle of Chablis -- that that was probably an empty threat. Too late, though, I was already ensconced: Mrs R firmly in residence).\n\n\n\nSome people are good at staying married whilst remaining apart.\n\n\n\nI'm not. Possibly because I'm not very brave. Possibly because I'm a mite old fashioned (Until Death Do Us Part? I Do, I Do). Possibly because like a swan -- or an albatross (aren't they extinct?) -- my mate's for life.\n\n\n\nMainly because I have been with this man since I was 22; I have grown too used to his being there. Here.\n\n\n\nI consider that my life now -- the one I have opted for in lieu of proximity to my children, my friends, the job I had - must fly in the face of what our bra-burning sisters of yesterday fought for: emancipation from male dictate. Am I anathema to the liberation they battled for? I cook for him, I run a home for him because he's the kind of bloke who enjoys a home with kids and cats and fat Labradors slumped on floors, I entertain his colleagues and sometimes I bite my tongue when they ask me how I find life here (sometimes, not always: I'm married, remember, not mute). I try to remember to consider my reflection in the mirror; I try to remember that it is not just me that sees the face that scowls back (and so I drag on some lippie). I try to smile when he comes home. I open a beer for him (and one for me too) and I relate my day.\n\n\n\nAnd I try -- I really, really try -- not to complain.\n\n\n\nHaving it all is the stuff of myths and legends and media-hype. Didn't your mother ever tell you? You can't have everything.\n\n\n\nI couldn't. I couldn't have it all: all my darling babies close enough to tuck up every night, all my friends near enough to laugh with regularly, my husband in a job that paid all the bills.\n\n\n\nSo I had to choose.\n\n\n\nI rationalized that my children were probably -- and certainly will be soon -- ready to untangle themselves from my long and knotty apron strings. I asked my Mum, 'What shall I do?' Mum, who lost my father when she was younger than I am now. Go with him, she urged. Nobody ever asked her; Fate just snatched him away.
Breaking up is hard to do, but when money is involved, it's often messy, too. In addition to books, furniture and maybe the dog, you'll have to decide how to split up any debt you accumulated together. Who's responsible for what? And how can you protect yourself from bearing responsibility for your ex's debts?\n\nIf you're going through a breakup and your name isn't listed on the debt, you're not legally responsible, said Leslie Tayne, a debt resolution attorney and author of the book Life & Debt: A Fresh Approach to Achieving Financial Wellness. But that doesn't necessarily mean you aren't morally obligated, if, for example, the debt was incurred to benefit you both. You may also have the debt under one person's name and used the borrowed money for both of you, Tayne said. In that case, even though there isn't a legal obligation to the creditor, there may be an obligation to the other partner.\n\nThat obligation ultimately depends on where you live and the nature of your relationship, whether married or not. Here's a closer look at what happens to debt when you break up with someone, and how to handle it.\n\nTetra Images via Getty Images Dividing debt during a breakup comes down to the nature of your relationship and the state where you live.\n\nWhat happens to debt if you aren't married\n\nIf you're not married, then generally, the person whose name is on the debt is going to be the person that's responsible for it, said Tasha Cochran, a lawyer and founder of the personal finance blog One Big Happy Life.\n\nSo if you racked up a credit card balance with the expectation that your partner would help pay half, the reality is that in the eyes of the card issuer, you are legally responsible for 100% of the bill.\n\nIn the event of a breakup, you and your ex will need to work together to decide how you want to split up the debt that you accumulated while together. Of course, that's not always easy to do when your relationship is ending.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself and each other from a potential breakup if you're not married is to have a cohabitation agreement, where you decide in advance how your property and debts will be split between the two of you if you break up, Cochran said. A cohabitation agreement won't supersede the law when it comes to ownership of debts, but it can help facilitate a more civilized discussion about how the two of you will handle them.\n\nOf course, hindsight is 20/20 and you may not have had the foresight to write up an official contract. If you just can't reach an agreement, one option is to take the issue to small claims court and have a judge decide. But without a written agreement, it's going to be a he-said, she-said situation, so there is no guarantee as to how the debt will be divided or if it will even be divided at all, Cochran said.\n\nA better (and less expensive) solution, she said, would be to split the debt in a fair manner, such as 50-50 or proportionately according to your incomes. If you have a loan or credit card in your name that your ex agrees to handle, it's a good idea to refinance the debt into their name. If they don't qualify to refinance due to poor credit or unsteady income, one option is to sell off the backing asset (such as a car) and pay off the loan. That way, when you split, you each take the debt that's in your name and you're done, Cochran said.\n\nWhat happens to debt if you are married\n\nIf you are a married couple going through a divorce, there are certain rules that apply to your debt. Those rules, however, vary depending on where you live.\n\nThe good news is that any debt a person incurred before marriage stays theirs in the divorce. That means if your hubby had six figures in student loan debt before you got hitched, those loans are his alone to repay once you're divorced.\n\nWhen it comes to debt you accumulated together, such as a credit card balance or mortgage, it will be handled according to state law.\n\nThere are nine community property states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. If you are married, and then get divorced, and live in one of those states, all of your assets and debt accrued during your marriage are evenly split between partners, Tayne said. That means you'd be equally responsible for your spouse's debts post-divorce.\n\nIn the remaining common-law states, debt taken on by one person during a marriage (i.e., their name is on the account) remains their sole responsibility once divorced. However, even in other states, certain debts can be considered marital debt, and that would have to be reconciled during a divorce, Tayne said. For instance, debt related to a rent or mortgage, utilities or child care may be considered marital debt.\n\nHow to manage debt in future relationships\n\nDebt in relationships can be tricky since it can be uncomfortable to tell a new significant other that they're struggling financially or have large amounts of money owed, Tayne said. However, once you're in the relationship and both partners know about the debt, it's never too late to discuss where responsibility falls, she noted.\n\nYou can memorialize that in an agreement or simplify the information in an email so you both can remember later what you agreed to, Tayne said. The agreement doesn't have to be, nor should it be, contentious.\n\nIf you're getting married or already married, that agreement is known as a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, a fairly common type of contract. You don't need to have a lot of money or assets to utilize these types of agreements, and they can help to make sure everyone understands who is responsible for what, Tayne said.
Holidays are supposed to be a time for family, a time of joy and a time for reflection. Sadly, they are often a time when people are disappointed, hurt and angry -- prompting January visits to a divorce lawyer.\n\n'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house,\n\nNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.\n\nDinner was cooking and sweet smells filled the air,\n\nShe had such high hopes that her husband soon would be there.\n\nSuddenly there was a racket as that louse came home drunk.\n\nFalling and slurring, he smelled like a skunk.\n\nHis clothes were disheveled. He had lipstick on his collar.\n\nTears came to her eyes and they started to holler.\n\nUnfortunately, this holiday scene has played out many times before, and it is often the final straw in a relationship.\n\nHolidays are supposed to be a time for family, a time of joy and a time for reflection. Sadly, they are often a time when people are disappointed. The Currier & Ives perfect Thanksgiving, Chanukah or Christmas is not a reality for most people. Family gatherings are often difficult. You do not pick your relatives and many people can't stand their in-laws. Holidays are also a time when people make mistakes. What about one drink too many at that holiday office party? An indiscretion with another man or woman can be problematic. A word that should not be said, a careless email or text message -- the list is endless. With social media, it is so much easier to cross that line than it was a few years ago.\n\nI have many clients who come to me during the holiday season with expectations that things in their marriage would be better if they could just get through the holidays. However, January is the busiest month for new divorces. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that people have unrealistic expectations about the holidays.\n\nSometimes the year-end and the beginning of a New Year are also thought of as a time for change and new beginnings. That change may be to not spend another year with your husband or wife, and to begin again by ending a bad marriage or relationship. The reasons for divorce are endless, but the holiday season often brings matters to a head -- which makes January open season for divorce.\n\nThese are some of my thoughts. What are yours?\n\n_____________________________________

According to a release shared with HuffPost, the formerly 90-minute interview has now been extended to two hours, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nIn one of the clips, Oprah asks Meghan, Were you silent or were you silenced? before discussing a breaking point.\n\nThe media mogul later tells the couple, You've said some pretty shocking things here.

Finances pretty much top the list of things couples fight about.\n\nWhat makes money such a raw topic, and how can you fight less about it? We asked experts for their thoughts.\n\nUnderstand that money arguments aren't really about money.\n\nYou only think you're squabbling over your credit card bill, said Syble Solomon, a financial behaviorist and creator of the interactive tool Money Habitudes. You're actually fighting about what money emotionally represents: love, security, power, control, status, acceptance, etc.\n\nUntil people understand that, it is very difficult to resolve issues, she said.\n\nWhile one person may see money as the freedom to do what they want ― say, to go out to dinner tonight ― their partner may want to stick to a budget because they think of money as a way to achieve future goals.\n\nThe solution in such disputes is to dig a little deeper and figure out the underlying issues. Set mutual goals for your finances and determine the best route to reaching them.\n\nUse your indoor voice.\n\nStart by having open, honest conversations when there isn't a crisis, Solomon said ― which includes finding a time when neither party feels hungry, tired or in any way out of sorts.\n\nShe created a game that serves as an ice-breaker to these conversations. Money Habitudes presents players with 54 different statements about money (for example: When I go shopping, I have to buy something or I will spend a lot of time and energy to get a better deal). The player decides whether he or she agrees or disagrees with each statement by sorting the cards into three piles: that's me; sometimes, it depends; and that's not me.\n\nThe pattern of answers can be a starting point for a constructive conversation about money, financial beliefs, and how those beliefs affect their lives and their relationships, Solomon said.\n\nSeventy-three percent of people say their partner is their financial opposite, according to an Ameriprise Financial study. Still, they have chosen to build a life with that person. Keep in mind that you really do want to be with your partner who thinks differently than you, and keep the yelling in check.\n\nThe higher earner in a relationship generally feels entitled to dictate spending. And shouldn't.\n\nMarriage is a joint venture, unless you have prenuptially stated otherwise.\n\nIn every relationship, one person outearns the other. Yet both partners contribute to the relationship in different ways, Solomon said. One may generate more income, but the other is the primary caregiver of offspring or older relatives. One may work, but the other attends school to get an advanced degree and, ultimately, a better-paying job.\n\nUsing money to control your spouse can seriously damage your relationship. It can help to set a specific dollar amount for each partner's discretionary spending, or to agree that you'll discuss any purchase over a pre-agreed limit, Solomon said. The goal is to diminish the idea that one partner controls the other.\n\nRelax.\n\nDisagreements don't mean your relationship is suddenly on the line, said Gary John Bishop, a personal development expert and author of Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life.\n\nStructured in the right way, shared in the right way, talking about your fears, upsets and frustrations over finances can bring you closer as a couple, he said.\n\nToo many people go straight to the nuclear button, which accomplishes little except hurting the relationship.\n\nThe secret to great money conversations? Talk about yourself. Talk about your hang-ups, your resentments, your failings, your fears, your concerns, your broken promises and bullshit, Bishop said. Who knows, maybe this responsibility thing might catch fire and you'll finally get that breakthrough you've been after all these years.\n\nSolomon agreed.\n\nIt's balancing control and letting go — both are important, she said. When one person is too controlling the other will, subconsciously, spend more freely.\n\nOwn your own garbage, and stay empathetic.\n\nStop blaming and start taking responsibility.\n\nOwn your upsets, own your broken promises and emotional purchases, Bishop said. Open up to each other about what intimidates, frustrates and constrains you around the subject of money. Make the effort to get what this subject is like for the other person all the while giving up the need to blame or make wrong.\n\nThe reason why conversations about money end in raging arguments or stony, resentment-hoarding silences is simple, according to Bishop: Survival. When it comes to money, or the lack thereof, we all too quickly descend into our most base, fight-or-flight selves.\n\nThis is why you may find yourself feverishly blistering your way through the credit card bill or Amazon account to see who the biggest sinner was, quietly justifying that completely necessary pizza bathed in a lake of extra cheese that you bought that hungover Sunday morning, he said.\n\nDon't assume that practical is synonymous with adult.\n\nAdults know how to have fun, too. Every relationship has one person who is more practical than the other ― and nowhere is it written that being practical always trumps having fun, Solomon said.\n\nOften the point of conflict is where couples actually balance each other. The partner brings something they actually want to grow or limit in themselves, she said.\n\nDon't lose sight of that.\n\nKnow the difference between an argument and a fight.\n\nA fight is about each person trying to dominate the other to win, said Jay Heinrichs, a rhetoric professor and best-selling author of Thank You For Arguing. The goal of an argument is to win over the other person and get them to agree with you happily. In a relationship, it's better to argue ― even if it isn't easy. The first goal should be keeping the relationship intact, Heinrichs said. A divorce usually isn't good for finances. So it's best to start out by saying, 'I love you. Even when I think you're wrong, remember that I love you.' Try to keep the argument away from blame for what happened in the past, or proof that the other person is a spendthrift or an idiot. Focus on solutions, not blame. A rule of thumb: Switch to the future tense, such as, I get why you're angry about what I did, but let's talk about how we're going to deal with this credit card debt.
A surprise marriage proposal usually takes the cake, but one woman stole the show before her boyfriend even popped the question.\n\nErin Tobin was selected to participate in a Dunkin' Donuts half-court shot promotion during Thursday night's Siena Saints men's basketball game at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York.\n\nTobin's boyfriend, Steve Duckett, set up the scenario with the help of Dunkin' Donuts and Siena Athletics so he could propose to her mid-court. He hid in the Dunkin' Donuts mascot while the Siena alumna got ready.\n\nBefore Duckett revealed himself and popped the question, Tobin sank a half-court basket and the crowd went wild. The proposal turned out to be the cherry on top of an already awesome night.
I survived a divorce in 2015 with a two-year-old and a four-year-old underfoot and an emotional minefield to wade through.\n\nAbout 16 months after my former husband left, I spent five weeks at my grandmother's bedside when she suffered a stroke. I watched my grandfather hold her hand after more than 60 years of marriage, and I lived through the raw pain of what came next when it was her time to pass on. I will never, in all my life, forget what I witnessed between the two of them.\n\nTiming can be excruciating and painful sometimes when it feels like life hands you one heartbreak after another, but in hindsight, I can see how all these pieces were working together to teach me what I couldn't learn any other way.\n\nA few months after her passing, the seasons finally changed, and fall weather arrived in Georgia on the first day of October. I drove a few winding roads to my grandfather's place that morning and accompanied him to my grandmother's grave site to place new flowers on her grave. It would have been their 62nd wedding anniversary.\n\nMy sister and I walked the cemetery a bit with him that sunny morning and watched him take out flowers that were hardly faded and replace them with new ones. Huddled over the iron vase in the bright fall sunshine on what would have been the beginning of year 63, he carved a bit at the tough foam base of the arrangement and fit it snugly on the metal marker.\n\nHe is honest and real and can do hard things. Do men exist like that anymore? I honestly don't know.\n\nI remember running into an acquaintance a few months after my grandmother passed, and she asked me if my grandad was meeting women yet with plans of another wife. I didn't even know what to say to that. He is in his eighties and spent a lifetime with her. There are tears in his eyes still when he talks about her sometimes, and there was not yet grass fully on her grave. Is this really how people do it now? They just skip all the hard parts and move on to the next distraction?\n\nI have reached the two-year mark of my divorce now, and I can see that something happens to you when spend time alone and do things you never thought you could do, when you carry the impossible. I take out the trash. I sleep alone. I pay the bills. I've attended real estate closings alone. Weddings alone. Parent conferences alone. Soccer games alone with my chair for one. And at first it is all terrifying and depressing, but then you break through that initial moment, and it liberates you from everything that tied you before. I'm doing hard things, but I'm okay. What you want in a partner is a list that begins to change with the first passing seasons of your time by yourself, and the bar creeps a little higher each time.\n\nAnd in the midst of all that, my grandmother got sick, and I watched my grandfather do all of the hardest things. The taking care and the letting go. Never once in those last days did he try to control her pace as she drifted. He just left a sacred space between them for her to do what she needed to do in order to walk on.\n\nHe is 6'2 with clear blue eyes and an uncommon steadiness and more strength and integrity than anyone I've ever met. I was there in June when a hospice nurse told us it would likely be less than a week or so until the end, and after the nurse left, I could hear him sobbing in the room where she was laying as I waited downstairs. Never once pushing her to abide by his own plans and always holding steady in the hard work of compassion.\n\nI hear talk shows and see articles shared online where people talk about marriage tips and what to do when you are struggling in a partnership. I'm realizing that people think marriage is hard these days because you aren't always happy. Because you feel tired and you work too much and the kids are always demanding something and the other person can't make all that go away. Is that hard? Really? Because now that I've seen what the hard part actually is -- the grieving and the accepting and the letting go -- burnt dinner on the stove or noisy children or a cluttered bathroom counter don't seem like a cause for unhappiness. Whatever happy means anyway; it's always a moving target when you depend on the other person to provide it.\n\nIt's all connected though, I think. If you can't do the hard work of putting aside your own selfishness in the earlier years, what do the later years look like? It took 62 years to build what they had, and I understand that. But if there's one thing I've learned, it's that maybe the little things are actually the big things. Honesty and integrity start with lending a helping hand and showing respect and saying I'm sorry and meaning it. If I knew then what I know now. But isn't that always how it goes?\n\nI'm so grateful for every bit of it -- my own pain in the earliest days of discovering something that felt like a knife's edge, the itchy pain of being alone and figuring out what it all meant after the dust settled, and even the hardest pain of watching this season happen in the lives of the couple who was always my fixed center point and likely always will be.\n\nI never thought my 35th year would find me single. I can see that I'm a misfit in a world of speed dating and swiping right and perusing the dozens of possible matches waiting for you on your phone. But if this season of my life has taught me anything, it is to be true to yourself and value strength of character and steadiness and honesty above all else. I'm grateful for the chance to start all over and do it right. And I don't care how long it takes. The truest pieces of a life well-built always grow slowly.\n\n____________________
The Roman Catholic bishops of Texas are roundly criticizing Gov. Greg Abbott's recent decision to end the official resettlement of refugees in Texas.\n\nThe Republican governor, who identifies as Catholic, announced Friday that Texas will be taking advantage of President Donald Trump's recent executive order allowing individual states to refuse to participate in the federal refugee resettlement program.\n\nThe 16 Catholic bishops based in Texas quickly responded with a joint statement calling Abbott's decision misguided.\n\nIt denies people who are fleeing persecution, including religious persecution, from being able to bring their gifts and talents to our state and contribute to the general common good of all Texans, the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops wrote in their statement. The refugees who have already resettled in Texas have made our communities even more vibrant.\n\nAs Catholics, an essential aspect of our faith is to welcome the stranger and care for the alien, the bishops added.\n\nJoshua Roberts / Reuters Gov. Greg Abbott, seen here greeting President Donald Trump in May 2018, appears to share Trump's concerns about refugees.\n\nAbbott's decision could have a crucial impact on refugee resettlement during a period when Trump has already slashed refugee admissions to historically low levels. During the federal government's 2019 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, Texas resettled more new refugees than any other state, according to the Pew Research Center. And since the 2002 fiscal year, Texas has resettled about 88,300 refugees, second only to California.\n\nAbbott said Friday that Texas has done more than its share in assisting the refugee resettlement process.\n\nAt this time, the state and non-profit organizations have a responsibility to dedicate available resources to those who are already here, including refugees, migrants, and the homeless ― indeed all Texans, Abbott wrote in his letter.\n\nAs a Catholic, Abbott has cited his faith to support anti-abortion and other conservative policies. But on the issue of refugees, the governor's stance sharply diverges from the official positions of his church ― and the example set by Pope Francis.\n\nThe pope has long been a vocal advocate for refugees and has called on the nations of the world to take in as many refugees as possible. In December, Francis gave 33 refugees from Afghanistan, Cameroon and Togo a chance to build new lives in Italy. Their resettlement was financed by the Holy See and by the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic charity.\n\nANSA/ETTORE FERRARI/Pool via REUTERS Pope Francis delivers a speech at the Vatican on Dec. 19, 2019, during an audience with refugees who'd arrived from the Greek island of Lesbos.\n\nAmerican Catholic groups have been heavily involved in refugee resettlement. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is one of nine volunteer agencies that contract with the federal government to resettle refugees.\n\nThis isn't the first time Abbott has tried to stop refugees from coming to Texas. After terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015, the governor and other Texas Republican officials tried to prevent the Obama administration from sending Syrian refugees to their state. Abbott claimed that Syrian refugees posed a security threat because any one of [them] could be connected to terrorism.\n\nBack then, he told the San Antonio Express-News that while individual Christians have a biblical responsibility to be charitable, the government has a different biblically mandated task ― to protect the safety and security of its people.\n\nBishop Michael Olson, who leads the Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth, suggested last week that security isn't an issue with these new refugees.\n\nThese refugees are people who have followed the legal vetting process in the United States and that President Trump has approved, Olson said in a statement on Friday. They have been screened and identified by the federal immigration administration and scheduled to arrive this year.\n\nMost new refugees have a family member or friend in the U.S. that they hope to unite with, news site Crux reports. Abbott's decision means that for the next fiscal year, refugees won't be able to initially settle near loved ones in Texas ― although they could move to Texas after first being received by another state.\n\nIn response to HuffPost's questions, John Wittman, a spokesman for Abbott, did not address the governor's apparent break with Catholic teaching. He emphasized that Abbott's decision won't prevent refugees from coming to the U.S. or stop refugees from moving to Texas after initially settling in another state.\n\nNo one seeking refugee status in the United States will be denied that status because of the Texas decision, Wittman said.\n\nMatthew Wilson, a scholar at Dallas' Southern Methodist University who is studying the political behavior of American Catholics, told HuffPost that he doesn't think Abbott will pay a political price among Catholic voters for this decision.\n\nThe refugee issue is not especially central for most voters, and American Catholics are notorious for rejecting their leaders' guidance when it comes to morally-tinged political issues, whether that guidance tries to push them leftward or rightward, he said in an email. Thus, you find large numbers of Catholics (especially less devout ones) who support legal abortion, gay marriage, the death penalty, and restrictive immigration policies, despite church teachings to the contrary.\n\nAFP Contributor via Getty Images El Paso, Texas, Bishop Mark Seitz (center) participates in a Nov. 4, 2017, mass attended by hundreds of Mexican and U.S. Catholics, held in memory of migrants killed by crossing the Rio Bravo in their attempt to reach the United States.\n\nUnder Trump's executive order, issued in September of last year, the administration requires resettlement agencies to obtain written consent from state and local officials before resettling refugees. Texas is the first state to say no. Forty-two other states have agreed to continue welcoming refugees, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThree faith-based refugee resettlement agencies have requested a preliminary injunction that would stop the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order. (The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is not a plaintiff in that case.) A federal judge in Maryland is expected to issue a decision on that matter this week.
For more than a decade, Married... With Children was a satirical ― and intentionally crude ― counterpart to squeaky-clean sitcoms like Who's the Boss? and Full House. As controversial as it was for its time, however, the Fox series also offered a progressive take on same-sex marriage well before it became the law of the land in the U.S.\n\nIn the latest episode of his Culture Cruise video series, Seattle-based writer Matt Baume breaks down a Season 5 installment of Married... With Children called The Dance Show.\n\nThe episode, which aired in October 1990, follows Peggy Bundy (played by Katey Sagal) as she and her neighbor Marcy (Amanda Bearse) meet a handsome man, Andy (Sam McMurray), at a bar. Peggy and Andy enjoy a flirtation, prompting Andy's husband, Pete (Dan Castellaneta, who also voiced Homer Simpson on The Simpsons), to track down Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) in an effort to thwart the relationship.\n\n[Some shows] went out of their way to show that same-sex couples are totally normal. It's wild that 'Married... With Children' was one of them. Seattle writer Matt Baume\n\nAs Baume points out, the show took a nuanced but forward-thinking step by having a gay male character introduce another man as his husband some 25 years before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nOf course, Baume is aware that assessment may surprise some familiar with the legacy of Married... With Children, which wrapped in 1997 after 11 seasons. In 2017, Sagal called the series very misogynistic, noting that its female characters were completely exploited.\n\nI was hired to play a part, she told HuffPost in a Build Series interview. I don't believe in censorship, and I also believe that it's my job as an actor to interpret the material — it's not my belief.\n\nAs unbelievable as it sounds, Baume says, the show's portrayal of LGBTQ life showed surprising sensitivity, especially for a time when queer characters were rarely seen in mainstream sitcoms. (McMurray and Castellenata also played a gay couple in recurring skits on The Tracey Ullman Show, which ran from 1987 to 1990.)\n\nIn 1990, a lot of TV shows were struggling with the right way to talk about marriage equality. Some shows treated it like a big joke, but others went out of their way to show that same-sex couples are totally normal, he says. It's wild that 'Married... With Children' was one of them.\n\nBaume, the author of the 2015 book Defining Marriage: Voices From a Forty-Year Labor of Love, has also broken down LGBTQ-themed episodes of The Golden Girls and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, among other iconic shows, for Culture Cruise, now in its second season. New York Times writer Margaret Lyons praised the series in the Jan. 17 installment of her weekly column, calling it a thoughtful and thorough ... look at queer representation.
Netflix is continuing its mission of overwhelming you with content as it adds over 50 movies throughout January.\n\nMany of these films were hits in past eras, such as Catch Me If You Can, Julie & Julia and Superbad. But Netflix will also debut noteworthy original movies too, including the Vanessa Kirby-starring Pieces of a Woman, about the fallout from a home birth gone awry, and The Dig, which features Ralph Fiennes, Lily James and Carey Mulligan in a story about an excavation.\n\nNetflix is also adding many shows this month, including new seasons of Cobra Kai, Disenchantment and Blown Away. I'm particularly excited for the debut of the Martin Scorsese-directed docuseries Pretend It's a City, in which Fran Lebowitz opines about New York City.\n\nCurtis Bonds Baker/Netflix Cobra Kai on Netflix.\n\nNetflix is also losing quite a few things in January, but luckily the losses aren't as bad as they were last month. In December, big shows like The Office, Gossip Girl and The West Wing left the service, along with over 50 movies.\n\nA few movies leaving in January include Mary Poppins Returns, The Master and Pineapple Express. The service is losing the popular show Waco as well.\n\nCheck out the full list of arriving and departing movies and shows below.\n\nAnd if you want to stay informed of everything joining Netflix on a weekly basis, subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HuffPost\n\nArrivals\n\nJan. 1\n\n17 Again (2009)\n\n30 Minutes or Less (2011)\n\nAbby Hatcher (Season 1)\n\nBlue Streak (1999)\n\nBonnie and Clyde (1967)\n\nCan't Hardly Wait (1998)\n\nCatch Me If You Can (2002)\n\nCloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009)\n\nCobra Kai (Season 3, Netflix Original)\n\nCool Hand Luke (1967)\n\nThe Creative Brain (2019)\n\nThe Departed (2006)\n\nDream Home Makeover (Season 2, Netflix Original)\n\nEnter the Dragon (1973)\n\nGimme Shelter (2013)\n\nGood Hair (2010)\n\nGoodfellas (1990)\n\nGothika (2003)\n\nThe Haunted Hathaways (Seasons 1-2)\n\nHeadspace Guide to Meditation (Netflix Original)\n\nInto the Wild (2007)\n\nJulie & Julia (2009)\n\nThe Minimalists: Less Is Now (Netflix Documentary)\n\nMonarca (Season 2, Netflix Original)\n\nMud (2012)\n\nMystic Pizza (1988)\n\nThe Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!

If you put self-care on the back burner in 2020, you're hardly alone. This past year was undeniably stressful, with strange event after strange event happening on the regular (a global pandemic, an election that seemed to last eons, mass unemployment ― and that's just chipping the surface).\n\nGiven all of that, many of us just focused on getting through the day. Even therapists slipped on self-care a bit. But a new year gives us a chance to reengage with healthier habits and practices that boost our mental and physical well-being.\n\nBelow, therapists share the healthy habits they're doubling down on in 2021.\n\nI'm prioritizing rest.\n\nI want to try to incorporate rest daily. This can look like a 15-minute yoga video or sitting for 10 minutes between sessions and focusing on deep breathing. This can even look like resting on the couch with my eyes closed and not napping. We tend to always be going and not think about the importance of rest. We tend to think and talk about the importance of sleep, but forget about the benefits of rest. Rest gives your mind a break. It gives your mind a chance to pause from thinking. Rest can help with stress, anxiety and focus. ― Rebecca Leslie, a psychologist in Atlanta\n\nI'm accepting that done is better than perfect.\n\nI struggle with a combination of procrastination and perfectionism (a common overlap), wherein I put things off until I have the time and space to devote to making them *just right.* While the desire for quality isn't in itself problematic, I begin to get overwhelmed when the to-do list starts getting longer and longer, which often leads to more procrastination. It's an anxiety-provoking cycle! This year I'm committed to reminding myself that no one has higher standards for myself than I do, and that the relief from finishing something in a timely matter is part of being kind to my future self. ― Kathleen Dahlen deVos, a psychotherapist based in San Francisco\n\nThe election is over. I'm unplugging!\n\nNow that the election is over I've decided to disconnect from the news and social media. There's just too much negativity and alarmism that I don't find healthy for me. This is tough to do though, and requires really being on your toes. I was looking for a YouTube video the other day and a news stream showed up in the search results giving me the latest goings-on that I just didn't need to see or think about. But cutting back on the noise is doable, and I already see a difference in my outlook and attitude because I'm doing it. ― Kurt Smith, a therapist in Roseville, California\n\nI'm not going to code switch anymore.\n\nCode switching is when a person adjusts the way they verbal and nonverbally communicate to connect with others. Code switching is often associated with Black people using very formal English and limited gestures to communicate when in predominantly white spaces.\n\nHowever, people code switch to connect interculturally as well. For instance, using slang and nonverbal communication techniques that are more common in the Black community. BIPOC are not the only people that code switch ― women do this in predominantly male spaces, doctors tend to use more jargon when speaking to peers, and members of the LGBTIA+ community also do it.\n\nCode switching can be exhausting because it requires an adjustment from the natural way of communicating. Some people even say those who code switch are being inauthentic. For me, I code switch to connect with others and to demonstrate my competence. At this point in my life, I much rather spend my limited energy on the work I am doing, rather than on showing through my communication that I can do the work. ― Dana E. Crawford, a therapist in New York City\n\nMaskot via Getty Images\n\nI'm engaging in more self-compassion practices.\n\nSelf-compassion is when we respond to our distress, challenges and perceived shortcomings with the gentleness and care we might give to someone we really want to care about. 2020 has been a challenge for most of us and 2021 isn't going to magically get easier. When we are already struggling and add self-judgment this does not support positive mental health. Being gentle with ourselves when we are struggling actually allows us to have more emotional resources to cope. Self-compassion also allows us to be gentler to others in return. I know I want to continue to support a kinder gentler world and I know it starts with me. ― Sarah Joy Park, a psychologist in San Luis Obispo, California\n\nI'm staying connected to my mind and body.\n\nIn 2021, I'm focusing on staying connected with what my brain and body need. 2020 has been an exhausting year and so often I've found myself seeking quick ways to replenish and recharge, whether that's bingeing Netflix or snacking on peanut butter M&M's. Now there's nothing wrong with either of those activities, but I'm working on getting more deeply in touch with what I need when I'm feeling depleted, rather than just noticing the emptiness. Do I need to give my brain a break and watch some TV? Do I need an energy boost from eating something delicious? Do I need to recharge by texting or calling my best friend for a chat? Or is my body asking for some sun salutations, a dance party in my living room, a steamy hot shower, or do I just want to curl up with a good book. ― Alexis Bleich, the clinic director at Kip Therapy in New York City\n\nI'm paying attention to pacing.\n\nWhen I'm feeling impatient in a relationship, job or anything else, I'm going to pay attention to pacing. That means reminding myself that everyone goes at their own pace. That should make me feel more patient and help me to match my effort and expectations to the outcomes I hope for. ― Rachel Kazez, therapist and founder of All Along, which helps people understand mental health and find therapy\n\nI'm spending more time working and playing outdoors. The mental health benefits of spending time in nature are well documented, and I was able to start enjoying those this year as I created an outdoor office to fight off my pandemic cabin fever. There's something about being surrounded by sunshine, trees and noisy songbirds that makes the workday feel a lot less monotonous. And I can literally feel the screens in my life melting off me when I take a hike in the woods. ― Sean Davis, a marriage and family therapist and a professor at Alliant International University in California\n\nThomas Barwick via Getty Images

Susan Spungen became a hand double for Meryl Streep, trussing a duck in Julie & Julia as if she were the one portraying the legendary Julia Child. Christine Tobin set off a hotel fire alarm at 4 a.m. while searing pork chops so Frances McDormand could gnaw on the bones in the HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge.\n\nWelcome to the wild world of food stylists.\n\nPay attention to the food in a movie and you'll see a hundred niceties working in near-perfect harmony. Someone, or perhaps a few someones, was responsible for each of those decisions.\n\nA profession that was once unique to advertising and magazine photography, the food stylist has become ubiquitous in Hollywood over the past few decades. The job varies from project to project, but it's always multipronged. Food stylists are historians, planners, cooks, designers, sometimes coaches and always problem solvers. Because prop handlers used to be (and sometimes still are) responsible for anything edible on movie and television sets, many food stylists didn't set out to work in showbiz. But now that it's a fruitful, union-recognized position throughout the business, food budgets have boiled over. Cuisine on-screen looks more detailed and delectable than ever.\n\nIn the early days of cinema, because film was black and white, the medium was much more forgiving, Emily Ferry explained. You could get away with a lot of stuff that you couldn't get away with once film became color. And then our food became — as a nation, as a world — much more multiethnic and much more complicated. In the '80s, when the food explosion in America happened, things got more specific.\n\nFerry is a veteran prop master — the person responsible for all the stuff seen in any given frame — whose first credit was the 1975 comedy Sixpack Annie. She says she's worked with food more and more frequently over the years, including on movies such as Ed Wood, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Memoirs of a Geisha. Like with any full-time food stylist or prop master, sometimes that work is front and center, à la the memorable chocolate cake scene in Matilda, which took roughly three weeks to shoot and required approximately 20 cakes. (It didn't help that Jimmy Karz, the young actor playing Bruce Bogtrotter, disliked chocolate.) Other times, it's more like ornamentation, one of many meticulous but barely noticed aesthetic touches.\n\nColumbia Pictures Meryl Streep in Julie & Julia.\n\nI could tell you all of the things I made for 'Mad Men' that you never individually saw, but they were there in the background as a character, as a set piece, taking you to the '60s, McSorley said. And the dishware was [period-appropriate]. Just everything.\n\nBeyond technological progress, the reasons that food now assumes outsize importance in film and TV are manifold. I talked to a handful of stylists over the past few months, and many echoed Ferry's assessment. The proliferation of America's culinary culture, they say, has spilled over to popular art — even art that's set in the past.\n\nThe launch of the Food Network in 1993 was a key development. The channel popularized the celebrity chef at the same time that Martha Stewart Living, Saveur and other publications were prioritizing sophisticated food imagery. (Spungen, a former Martha Stewart editor, went on to style Julie & Julia, It's Complicated and Eat Pray Love after friend and food writer Amanda Hesser recommended her to director Nora Ephron.) In the 2000s, the reality-TV boom gave us Top Chef, Hell's Kitchen, Man v. Food and Anthony Bourdain's globe-trotting docuseries No Reservations. Through websites like Epicurious and Food52, the internet made cooking more egalitarian. Meanwhile, a dietary fad or savory trend seemed to permeate the hoi polloi every other week. By the time the 2010s brought about glossy confections like The Great British Bake-Off and Chef's Table, food was more than a source of sustenance — it was a multibillion-dollar lifestyle commodity.\n\nFood is also an inherent marker of identity. Many movies and shows made since the '80s possess a keen understanding that the cuisine we share reflects who we are as people. The central conflict in Do the Right Thing revolves around a neighborhood pizzeria. Following lavish feasts in Eat Drink Man Woman, characters clean while gossiping about their family. Waitress finds triumph when a small-town woman trapped in an abusive marriage commercializes her pie-baking talents. The most suspenseful scene in Parasite hinges on the preparation of a dish nicknamed ram-don, meant to be an affordable comfort until the film's wealthy matriarch demands premium steak in it. Even Hannibal Lecter, a noted cannibal, garnishes his meals with fava beans and a nice Chianti.\n\nArchive Photos via Getty Images Gua Ah-leh, Sihung Lung and Sylvia Chang in Eat Drink Man Woman.\n\nAs we became more food-obsessed, so did pop culture, leading to the rise of the food stylist. Dedicated stylists mean heftier, more intricate food allocations, according to Nancy Goodman Iland, whose credits include The Good Place and Straight Outta Compton. McSorley estimates that the cuisine on a food-heavy movie like 2014's Chef, which she worked on, totals more than $35,000. Christine Tobin said one of her greatest achievements was a $20,000 banquet scene in American Hustle, replete with cooked-lobster displays, that didn't even make the final cut. Compare that to the several thousand dollars that Valerie Aikman-Smith was allotted for the entirety of 1997's Titanic, including the real caviar that James Cameron requested for the dinner scene where Leonardo DiCaprio learns how to dine like the rich.\n\nBasically, your job is to plan a menu for every week of production, said Richard Papier, a chef who lucked into employment on 21 Jump Street, 12 Years a Slave and Lee Daniels' The Butler when he returned to New Orleans a few years after Hurricane Katrina. Papier and his counterparts comb through a script to see which scenes require victuals. Then they figure out how to accommodate actors' individual food restrictions, research and shop for the necessary items (or send assistants to do the shopping, if budgets permit), prepare them so they photograph well on camera, and help finesse those scenes during the shoot, including refreshing food for retakes.\n\nSome stylists ensure the food is as delicious as anything they would assemble for, say, a catered event. When Tobin made beef stew for the nautical disaster thriller The Finest Hours, Chris Pine asked to keep leftovers in his trailer because it reminded him of his mother's cooking. Other stylists focus only on making food functional. They're not looking for four-star dining, Papier said. It's called acting for a reason.\n\nGetty Images The dinner scene in Titanic.\n\nOften they are also teachers. The average project doesn't require stylists to liaise directly with actors, but for food-intensive moments, they might find themselves training a performer to execute a recipe in real time. On the Spanglish DVD, a behind-the-scenes featurette (available on YouTube) documented celebrated California chef Thomas Keller teaching Adam Sandler to make a fancy BLT. Similarly, Tobin gave Josh Brolin a pie tutorial before he shot Labor Day with Kate Winslet. And Goodman Iland stepped in front of the camera in A Star Is Born so she and her team could add authenticity to the restaurant where Lady Gaga's character works.\n\nDespite bigger budgets and better respect within the industry, many food stylists, who are effectively freelancers hired at union-appointed salaries, still maintain ancillary business to supplement their income.\n\nMy rate hasn't changed at all in 10 years, Tobin said.\n\nIf I wasn't this far along in my career and working on so many shows that I am, I don't know if I'd be able to make it, said Goodman Iland, who started in the Golden Girls script department and began food-styling during the last four seasons of Murder, She Wrote.\n\nStylists might also offer private catering services, take editorial gigs and author cookbooks. But for the lucky few — a number that's increasing with time — food styling is becoming a viable stand-alone vocation, in demand enough to furnish a person's life work.\n\nIt's always been 12-hour days for TV shows, Goodman Iland said. Commercials are more like 10-hour days. And movies, they're all over the place. I would always have to be up an hour earlier, because I load my car with all the equipment, the ovens and the hot plates and everything that does not need to be refrigerated. And then I give myself 20 minutes to half an hour just to unload the food, if there's a lot of it. And I'm always there an hour afterwards, depending where we're at location-wise and whether we have access to sinks and a cleaning facility. So for me, it ends up being two hours longer. But you know what? I love my job so much that it doesn't really bother me.
Bride & Groom\n\nMy goal was to be single until I was 35. Not because I wanted to be overly frivolous or to date around, but because I deeply valued the importance of cultivating one's sense of self.\n\nThough I enjoyed being single, at times it was lonely. I craved the kind of comfort that only a loving partner can provide. Instead of allowing those feelings to govern my thoughts, I simply owned them and consciously chose to honor this precious time to myself.\n\nI met my husband just shy of turning 25. I wasn't looking for love but I fell head first into the most passionate relationship of my life. Things evolved -- fast -- and one day there he was down on one knee with a ring that symbolized my future.\n\nI wasn't the girl who dreamed of a great big wedding. Marriage to me was never a must and I believed in commitment without the certificate; yet I knew without a doubt that I wanted to marry this man. So I said yes.\n\nAfter we were married everything changed...\n\nThe relationship felt different. There was this intense new energy and sense of partnership. It felt really good.\n\nAs a married couple we've had our challenges. There have been ups, downs, good memories, bad ones, and everything else in between. Overall, we've grown together as a team.\n\nMy own individual soul has been broken open. Skeletons I thought I had dealt with have come to light, and the most intimate pieces of my heart have been awakened.\n\nCould all of this have happened as a non-married couple? Sure, maybe. But to me the marriage aspect of it has played a huge role. There's no running, no hiding, no burying -- you either work to be the best version of yourself or you don't. My vows have helped me to remain committed, focused, and so very in love with my husband and the process.\n\nI truly believe that the person we marry is meant to be our greatest teacher. Here's what's happened so far:\n\n1. I am less self-centered\n\nWhile I've always been a caring and thoughtful person, I've also always been able to put my needs first. In the beginning, it was hard to let go of that sense of freedom. There's this constant flow of give and take in any relationship, and I was stuck in receiving.\n\nSharing my life with my husband has made me more aware that my choices have an impact. What I think, say, and do affects others. I make more selfless decisions out of love because I truly feel the joy that comes with seeing other people happy.\n\n2. I take full accountability for the parts of me that need healing\n\nThere are parts of who I am that still contain some darkness and my husband has served as a mirror to those areas. I've come to understand that I am the root of my struggles, as we all are. I have an amazing husband and a happy marriage, and yet old themes and negative patterns of mine still creep in. Weren't those just supposed to disappear with the perfect partner?\n\nNope. In fact, they might come to the surface tenfold now that there's someone there to help us through it. I finally let go of the blame and the attachment to thinking that it was the circumstances when it's all my stuff and mine only.\n\n3. Perseverance, humility, and forgiveness have grown to a whole new level\n\nIn a marriage there's very little space for anger. No matter how mad you may be, there's still this whole life together to keep up with. And so anytime we fall, we have to humble ourselves, forgive the other, and keep on trying.\n\nI've grown into these traits as an individual. I've come to terms with not being the perfect partner. I make mistakes, mess up, and yet I try and try again. I've learned that the ideals I held myself to have no room in a successful marriage. Learning to also forgive myself has become much easier with all the practice.\n\n--\n\nMy marriage has taught me self-love and self-awareness of a completely different kind. It has raised the bar on my inner growth as a woman, and has taught me lessons I would have never learned on my own.
ORANGE CITY, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man stole an engagement ring and wedding bands from a girlfriend and used them to propose to another girlfriend, according to authorities.\n\nVolusia County Sheriff's deputies said Thursday they have issued an arrest warrant for Joseph Davis, 48, who had not been found as of Friday.\n\nTheir investigation started earlier this year when a woman from Orange City, Florida, told detectives she had discovered her boyfriend was actually engaged to someone else. When she looked up the fiancée's Facebook page, she noticed a photo of her wearing a wedding band and engagement ring that was identical to her own from a prior marriage, the sheriff's office said in a news release.\n\nWhen the Orange City woman checked her jewelry box, she found her rings were missing, as were several other pieces of jewelry, including a diamond ring that belonged to her grandmother. The total value of the stolen property was about $6,270, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nOrange City is located halfway between Orlando and Daytona Beach.\n\nThe Orange City woman reached out to the fiancee, who returned some of the items, and they both called it off with Davis, who also went by the names Joe Brown and Marcus Brown, the sheriff's office said.\n\nThe fiancee, who lives in Orlando, told detectives she had been duped too.\n\nDavis once took the fiancee to a house that actually belonged to the Orange City woman, while she was at work, and claimed it was his. He then asked the fiancee to move in with him, but he then disappeared. By that time, the fiancee discovered her laptop computer and jewelry were missing, the sheriff's office said.\n\nEven though they did not have his real name, the jilted women remembered he had a relative in North Carolina and detectives were able to track down the relative who identified Davis, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nDavis has an active arrest warrant for a hit-and-run crash with injuries in Oregon, and previously has been arrested for possession of fictitious ID, filing a false police report, domestic assault and possession of cocaine with intent to sell, the sheriff's office said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, the jail where Davis previously was booked noted he had a tattoo on his left arm that said, Only God can judge me.
There is an old saying that if you never have a quarrel in a marriage then the first time can end in divorce. So the good news is it's ok to have little spats every now and then. We have been married for over 30 years, and Inevitably there are times when one or even both of us loses it. We are, after all, very human. We've been there, done that, and collected a whole range of tee shirts! But, in all that time, what we have never done is go to bed angry with each other.\n\nWhat we soon realized is that any disagreement is less about the issue and more about the need to be right. So we try to focus on what is really going on. Anger is a powerful and complex emotion--when it grabs hold it is difficult to control ourselves. But there are often layers of conflicting feelings hidden beneath the anger, such as insecurity, grief, or fear, trying to make themselves heard. The power of rage is such that it can act as a defense mechanism that overshadows these other emotions, causing us to lose touch with ourselves and struggle to articulate what we are really feeling.\n\nGetting angry may really be a cry for contact; having lost our connectedness with both our own feelings and each other it may be expressing feelings of rejection, loneliness, or a longing to love and be loved. Often anger is saying I love you or I need you yet we are hurling abuse at each other instead.\n\nAs psychotherapist Maura Sills says,  I come from a family that was angry; it was the way we related to one another. I believed that if people had trouble with my anger, it was their problem, and I had a right to act the way I wanted. But when we express anger, we are creating more pain and suffering in ourselves than in others.\n\nTaking anger to bed is one of the most damaging things we can do. During the day we have a chance to process anger and let it go, to see what it's really saying. But at night it can become intensified and build from a simple story to a major drama. So here are five reasons why not to go to bed feeling angry:\n\n1- Anger is toxic. It floods our body and brain with chemicals, so it will disrupt our sleep and could create nightmares\n\n2- We dwell on it, making it grow into something bigger than it really is\n\n3- It can create irreparable damage with our loved one, when what we really want is to reach out and be friends\n\n4- We can wake up feeling even worse, causing us to repeat it and drag it out through the day\n\n5- Forgiveness is a far more energy-efficient option. It releases us from the drain of holding a grudge, setting us free to love and laugh again\n\nOnly by recognizing what the real emotion is behind the anger can there be more honest communication and heart opening. Forgiveness meditation can be very helpful here, as it not only invites us to witness anger but also to make friends with it. Meditation may not be a cure-all; it may not make all our challenges go away or suddenly transform our weaknesses into strengths, but it does enable us to rest in an inclusive acceptance of who we are. This does not make us perfect, simply more fully human.
Vision via Getty Images\n\nIn everyday life, most of us aren't walking around talking about our greatest sexual fantasies and desires. For sex therapists, however, such conversations are all in a day's work.\n\nTheir clients tend to bring up certain turn-ons time and time again, giving these professionals a good sense of what's popular across the board. We asked our network of sex therapists to share the fantasies their clients mention most frequently. Here's what they told us:\n\n1. Having a threesome\n\nSingles and couples alike fantasize about having three people in the bedroom. Part of the appeal is the sensual overload — so many different body parts all intertwined. A lot of couples like the idea of a threesome for bringing some spark and excitement back into the bedroom. ―Vanessa Marin, sex therapist\n\n2. Dominance and submission\n\nWe see both men and women interested in dominance and submission. While men are generally more interested in dominating and women more interested in being dominated, this isn't always the case. Some women are dominant and some men submissive. Fantasies of domination are about power, feeling like you are fully in control of an experience and that the other person will submit to your every whim. There are two super sexy things about submission: The first is the feeling that the sub has all of the attention of their dom, their full focus. The second is the feeling of letting go of control and being taken or used for the pleasure of another. ―Danielle Harel and Celeste Hirschman, sex therapists and authors of Making Love Real: The Intelligent Couple's Guide to Lasting Intimacy and Passion\n\n3. Foot play\n\nFoot and shoe fantasies are very common, with mostly men reporting them. The fantasies could include being genitally stimulated by a foot, being walked on ... usually in shoes, or just visualizing different types of shoes to get aroused. The image of a foot in a particular type of shoe is very stimulating to some people. This fantasy often starts when people are very young, and it persists. When you think about how shoes are sold and displayed, it's not surprising that some people eroticize them. It can get stronger when it's kept secret (which it often is) or when a partner is upset about it. Then the foot fantasy becomes stronger through association with shame, being forbidden fruit. ―Gracie Landes, sex therapist and marriage and family therapist\n\n4. For straight people, having sex with someone of the same sex\n\nWe tend to think of sexual orientation as binary (heterosexual or homosexual), but these categories are socially constructed concepts that may speak to our general sexual desires but miss the nuance of our innate sexual fluidity and curiosity. When we fantasize about being sexual with someone of the same sex, we get to ponder what it would be like to be touched in ways that are both foreign and familiar (when we touch ourselves) and to break free from some of the gender assumptions that we normally enact. ―Ian Kerner, sex therapist and author of She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman\n\n5. Giving your partner multiple orgasms\n\nFor heterosexual men, bar none, the most consistent fantasy I hear, year after year, is about having an enthusiastic partner who is having a genuinely good time and is freely expressive and responsive to his touch. It may be memories from a previous (particularly hot) sexual experience, or it may be images from porn, or it may be fantasy about a secret crush. But in every case, the woman is enjoying herself immensely and having multiple orgasms.\n\nThis fantasy stems from men often feeling like they need to convince their partners to have sex. Many men share that it is difficult to stay aroused when you know (or suspect) that your partner is not into it. In addition, many men share that when their partner is super turned on, it makes them even more excited, which enhances their sexual satisfaction. It also helps a guy's ego if he feels he is competent in bed. ―Kimberly Resnick Anderson, sex therapist\n\n6. Watching your partner have sex with somebody else
In the final hours of his presidency Wednesday, Donald Trump issued a pardon for Albert Pirro, a real estate development lawyer with ties to the Trump Organization who is the ex-husband of Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.\n\nA prominent GOP fundraiser, Albert Pirro served 11 months in prison after being convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion in 2000. Jeanine Pirro was the district attorney of Westchester County at the time. The couple separated in 2007 after more than 30 years of marriage.\n\nAlbert Pirro, who represented Trump in various real estate deals in the 1990s, received his pardon a day after Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people, including longtime Trump adviser Steve Bannon and rapper Lil Wayne. He told The Daily Beast he was surprised to be granted the pardon.\n\nI'm in shock, Pirro said. I went to bed last night having read the list assuming I wasn't getting a pardon. It certainly is a nice act on the part of the president. It has been 20 years since I served my time and it allows me to engage again in public companies which I haven't been able to do previously.\n\nPhoto by Timothy Fadek/Corbis via Getty Images Jeanine Pirro (left) and Albert Pirro (right) have been friends with Donald Trump for more than 20 years.\n\nAlbert Pirro has two children with Jeanine Pirro, as well as another child from an extramarital affair in the 1980s. Jeanine Pirro was investigated in 2006 for planning to illegally wiretap her husband, whom she believed was cheating on her at the time. No charges were filed.\n\nJeannine Pirro has been one of Trump's loudest cheerleaders on cable news, but Albert Pirro told The Daily Beast that he did not believe she played a role in his fortuitous pardon.\n\nI have a long association with the Trump organization as I represented them before my conviction, Albert Pirro said. I served my time. I paid my debt. I plan to make a contribution back to society. It has been a humbling experience and I'm very grateful to Donald Trump.
Despite constant speculation as to whether Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are married, Liam's brother Chris recently confirmed that the singer isn't officially his sister-in-law just yet. But he also confirmed having her around is a lot of fun.\n\nI always just expect her to put on a show, belt a few songs out. But she never does, the 34-year-old said during an interview on SiriusXM Studios' Sway in the Morning on Tuesday.\n\nI am insisting consistently, 'When is the performance coming?' But no, she's a lot of fun, he said.\n\nWhat's it like to have @MileyCyrus as a future in-law!? @chrishemsworth says his brother @LiamHemsworth's fiancée doesn't perform for the family, but she's just a lot of fun! pic.twitter.com/lX1bkUaKsg — SiriusXM (@SIRIUSXM) January 16, 2018\n\nHemsworth was asked if he ― or anyone in his family ― had any marriage advice for his brother, who is engaged to Cyrus. Hemsworth has been married to his wife, actress Elsa Pataky, since 2010. The couple have three children together.\n\nNo ... I've asked my mom about marriage and kids and [she's] said, 'Look, we've been doing it for a long, long time that if there was an answer to it, and a way to do it properly, we'd have it figured out,' the actor joked. 'There would be one book that says here's how to do it.' No, he doesn't need my advice.\n\nLiam Hemsworth and Cyrus, who were engaged once before, reconciled in 2016 after a two-year split. Since getting back together, the two are constantly bombarded with speculation about their relationship status and even occasional pregnancy rumors.\n\nCyrus shut down speculation that she was pregnant in November, after fans became suspicious of a certain Thanksgiving photo.\n\nRUDE!!!

That's how it happened for Scott, a writer in Austin, Texas: He and his on-and-off girlfriend of almost five years officially split up on Friday, March 13. A day later, he self-isolated.\n\nThe timing was purely coincidental, but the abruptness of it all made the experience so much worse.\n\nI can honestly say this is the most isolated I've ever felt, said Scott, who, like others in this article, asked to use his first name only for privacy. The weight of loneliness feels exponential: I am also carrying the sadness of the end of our relationship. This is the most difficult emotional and psychological challenge I've ever faced.\n\nHe and his ex are texting, but rarely. He can tell it's over for good.\n\nUnder normal circumstances ― say, ones that didn't involve a global pandemic ― Scott said it would have been incredibly painful to envision a future without his ex. With the coronavirus, it's hard to envision what the future looks like at all.\n\nThat's an anxiety we all share, but the breakup forces me to prepare and plan and think about a future I wasn't expecting and didn't want, he said. To come to terms with that and the future the pandemic has foisted on us, it feels impossible. It feels emotionally paralyzing.\n\nScott isn't alone in going it alone after a breakup right now. Therapists we spoke to say they have many clients struggling to navigate the strange new world of social distancing while also disentangling from a relationship.\n\nIn addition to weathering the pain of a breakup, you truly feel alone because of quarantine, said Virginia Gilbert, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles. Ordinarily you'd commiserate with friends, but everyone's at home.\n\nFor Leah, an IT project manager in Southern California, it was a triple whammy of big life changes: Her fiance left her a week before Los Angeles established stay-at-home orders across the city. She had just started a new job, too. (She was onsite for four days before having to work from home.)\n\nIt's been a major mind shift, having to be alone in a half-empty house with holes from where his stuff used to be and memories associated with the relationship, she said. Plus, to be honest, he also took all the video games, so I have nothing to do!\n\nI joked to a friend that there are two things I need to help me recover from this breakup: a hug and a bartender. Unfortunately I don't have access to either. - Scott, a newly single writer in Austin, Texas\n\nIt's not much better when you're newly single and living with family, though. That's what Jen Lee, a managing partner at a private equity firm in Washington, D.C., is currently doing.\n\nI have family in from out of town that hasn't been able to go home due to travel restrictions. So I can't even get a good cry in, she said. Can I cry myself to sleep in peace?! No, no I can't.\n\nLee's current situation ― being surrounded by family ― could be a benefit for some, especially men, said Caroline Madden, a marriage and family therapist in Burbank, California. Of her clients who are struggling with a breakup amid the pandemic, her male clients are taking it particularly hard.\n\nIn my opinion, breakups are more difficult for men during this time because they don't have access to an emotional support system, she told HuffPost. Men usually rely on their female partners for their emotional support, so when their partner or spouse breaks up with them, it is an incredible loss that isn't easily replaced.\n\nMadden said she'd normally tell her clients, both men and women, to take respite in their friendships: Go hit a bucket of balls on the golf course or take a spa day. She can't advise that now.\n\nBecause of social distancing, all you have to do is group video chat or games, she said.\n\nFor his part, Scott, the aforementioned writer from Texas, said there's nothing he'd love more right now than to hang out and commiserate with friends at a bar.\n\nI joked to a friend that there are two things I need to help me recover from this break-up: a hug and a bartender, he said. Unfortunately I don't have access to either.\n\nClearly, there's a shortage of socializing options for the brokenhearted. But there are things you can do to stay healthy and put the focus on your well-being while quarantined. Below, therapists ― and our newly single sources ― offer breakup advice they're learning on the fly.\n\nFirst, acknowledge the pain.\n\nAs with any breakup, Gilbert said she recommends her clients practice mindful awareness under these admittedly rougher-than-usual circumstances.\n\nObserve what it's like in the moment to feel un-partnered during a pandemic. Resisting those observations will actually make the breakup harder, she said. Observing the experience and practicing non-judgment will help you detach from emotional chaos so you can make thoughtful choices.\n\nHow do you act mindful about your breakup, exactly?\n\nTake the example of stalking your ex on Instagram or Twitter. That's compulsive and will just make you feel lonelier, Gilbert said. Instead, look for an alternative: Mindful choices for managing heartbreak include exercise, journaling, yoga, or therapy with a telehealth provider.\n\nMalte Mueller via Getty Images It's been a major mind shift, having to be alone in a half empty house with holes from where his stuff was, Leah, a newly single IT manager, told us.\n\nUse your time wisely. (No Instagram stalking!)\n\nYou have an excess of free time right now. As Gilbert mentioned, don't use it to stay current on what your ex is up to on social media. (For starters, you already know they're doing the exact same thing as everyone else: Staying at home, going on the occasional walk and maybe taking selfies in their new Etsy face mask. No need to see that.)\n\nMy number one piece of advice is definitely to stop virtually stalking your ex, Madden said.\n\nInstead of torturing yourself with your ex's Instagram stories, Madden suggests some reading.\n\nDownload and read some books on relationship dynamics, Madden said. Not 'how to get the girl/guy' type books but books that explore why relationships are good in the beginning but then you end up breaking up. I highly recommend 'Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love' by Amir Levine. It's a book about how our attachment styles influence how we form relationships, for better or worse.\n\nLean into your work and healthy activities as a distraction.\n\nInstead of dwelling too much on the breakup, Lee said she's leaning into her work life. Emails and jumping on Zoom calls are a welcome distraction right now, she said.\n\nThat's what's allowing me to keep it all together right now — maintaining normalcy through running my business' day-to-day operations, she said.\n\nIf your work life is tenuous right now ― maybe you've been laid off or furloughed ― focus on the good in your life (your family and friends, for instance), and activities that put the focus on your well-being. I've also started back my rigorous race training schedule with running, Lee said. It's been helpful for me ― maintaining my fitness as a means of self-care and mental wellness. (For tips and routines that can help you stay physically and mentally healthy during the coronavirus outbreak, head here.)\n\nCSA Images via Getty Images Journaling is a great way to gauge how you're doing since the start of self-quarantine and your breakup, Gilbert said.\n\nJournal to measure your growth. Scott, the writer from Austin, said one of the things he's struggling with most is not having any way to gauge the progress he's made in moving on from his ex. Usually, going out and being around old friends helps him measure his recovery, he said. At least then, you can ask yourself: Are you feeling depressed around other people, or are you noticing yourself starting to smile again? Am I wholly uninterested in the women in the room, or does the one over there look interesting? Do I feel good about myself? he said. Without being around other people, I can't tell. There are no measuring sticks for my recovery. Gilbert understands that angst. But there's not a total absence of ways to measure your growth post-split, the therapist said. One way to do that during this pandemic is to keep a gratitude journal: Each day, write down 5-10 things you're grateful for (a hot shower, food in the refrigerator) and reflect on those things, she said. After a while, if you do this practice consistently, you'll notice that you're able to more easily shift your focus from what you don't have to the positive things you do have. Gilbert also stressed that healing from a breakup doesn't necessarily mean that you don't feel pain. Healing, she said, means that you learn to stop reacting unskillfully to your problem narrative ― 'I'll be alone forever!' ― and start focusing on positive thoughts.\n\nConsider the alternates: Social distancing with your ex could have been pretty terrible. Let go of the pipe dream that self-quarantining with your ex would have brought you closer together or fixed any longstanding issues you had. Stressful times don't usually lend themselves to positives like that. Madden said she has a few clients who are still living together post breakup because they hadn't moved out before stay-at-home orders were established. It's generally not pleasant. Some are even co-parenting and homeschooling together, she said. It's not easy: My advice to them is to create your own space if possible ― and move out as soon as you can. If you are still living together, it's especially hard if one ex suspects their former partner is talking to someone new: You can't ask any questions about new partners without looking jealous, even if you're legitimately asking because of COVID-19 concerns, Madden said. It's not a good situation. Recognize that this gives you an opportunity to make a clean break. Take the time to process the myriad emotions and feelings you have now. Fall out of love, if you haven't already. Mourn the relationship, good and truly. But eventually, make a concerted effort to see the few upsides there are to a breakup during a time like this. Sometimes I do wish my ex was here, usually for reasons other than the breakup and pandemic, Lee admitted. But I'm starting to see the distance and space as a means for a clean break. Slowly, Lee said, she's embracing the quarantine time frame as a blessing in disguise for her healing process. My ex and I been through so many cycles and whenever we hit a rough patch, he'd still always answer the phone and come over ― we'd always met up when we needed each other, she explained. But now, we can't do that. If social distancing makes for a cleaner break for us, all the better.
Courtesy of Erika Girardi We're all creative in our own ways, and either that part of you gets nurtured or you ignore it, says Erika Jayne.\n\nIt's hard to believe it's been over 10 years since Erika Girardi unleashed her alter ego, the no-fucks-giving singer and performer Erika Jayne, to have her way with our collective pop consciousness. Since then, she's made the most of her time living among us mere mortals by piling up nine No. 1 hits on the Billboard Dance Chart, playing shows around the world and instructing her fans on the finer points of approaching life with unapologetic self-love ― not to mention how to properly pat the puss.\n\nFresh off her New York Times best-selling memoir, Pretty Mess, and the release of her new single Cars, the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star recently chatted with HuffPost about the musical moments that have had the biggest effect on her life and made her the fearless performer she is today.\n\nWhen I reach back in search of my earliest musical memory, I see myself at 3 or 4 years old dancing on top of the coffee table in my family's living room while the theme song to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood or Romper Room played.\n\nMusic was always playing in my house as a child, thanks to my mom — she was truly my first musical influence. She was a classical pianist who taught piano, and I learned to love all kinds of different music from her, from Barbara Streisand and Nat King Cole to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and Rod Stewart.\n\nThe first song I remember being truly obsessed with was Stewart's Do Ya Think I'm Sexy when I was 7. My mom used to wear Daisy Dukes and Dr. Scholl's and when we would go driving in her red 442 Cutlass, I would bounce in the passenger seat while we sang that song back and forth to each other as she drove.\n\nI didn't know what that song was really about then — or what it meant to be sexy — but from the time I was little, I've always had a big personality. I was really friendly and I would walk up to just about anyone and engage them. Flirty isn't the right word to describe it — I was just a completely open kid who loved to smile and put on a show.\n\nMy life as a performer in the more traditional sense began at an early age. I started dance class when I was 5 years old, and then I started doing children's theater and musicals soon after that. It was really my dance teachers who deserve a lot of the credit for my taste in music because that's where I first heard the kind of music that was being played in the clubs. I remember being 10 years old and listening to Sylvester's Do You Want To Funk while doing stretches in class.\n\nMadonna came to Atlanta with her Virgin Tour when I was 13, and my friend Kim's older sister had an extra ticket, so my mom let me go to the show. It was the first time I saw the marriage of what I was learning in my dance classes with pop music and musical theater — truly telling a story on stage through music — with incredible fashion and her incredible personality and I just thought, My God! That's it!\n\nI knew right there and then that that was what I wanted to do. It was everything I loved — or was starting to understand that I loved — combined into one unbelievable performance. I got to see her right when she was really breaking through into the music industry and I'll never forget that. It's like when I saw Prince perform in the '80s — I was just like, Get the fuck out of here! You can't compare anyone or anything to the kind of moments those artists created, and it inspired me and changed the way I thought about what I wanted to do with my career — and my life!\n\nBy the time I was attending Northside School of Performing Arts in Atlanta, a whole new world of culture and music had opened up around me. After I graduated, I moved to New York City and found myself auditioning for these girl groups that were popular at the time. It wasn't long before I fell in love and had a baby and then got a divorce and moved to Los Angeles.\n\nI know it's a little unusual to rediscover your creative self at 35, and it's definitely even more unusual to still be doing it at 46, but that also makes the success I've had that much sweeter. Erika Jayne\n\nI was still working and auditioning when I got married again to my second husband, Tom Girardi, who is a very well-known and very successful attorney. Almost instantly, I assumed his life and was suddenly living the life of a very prominent lawyer's wife. It was very comfortable and really great and I was experiencing the best of everything, but at the same time, I was in a kind of a coma because I wasn't creating anything. I was learning a lot from Tom about the law at its highest level — he's an incredible teacher and a scholar — but it was a totally new kind of education and a totally new life for me.\n\nOne day, I got an invitation to a show from a woman I knew who was also married to a lawyer and I thought it was interesting that we were in such similar situations, but even more interesting to me was that at the bottom of the invitation was the name of the show's director and he happened to be a friend of mine from high school. So I called him up and I said, What are you doing? and he said, No, more importantly, what are you doing? I said, Nothing — except shopping and going to dinner. And he said, I think it's about time you started creating again, and that's how Erika Jayne was born. From there, it was just about me putting one foot in front of the other, and it's taken me where I am today.\n\nCourtesy of Erika Girardi I was in a kind of a coma because I wasn't creating anything, Erika Jayne said of her comfortable life before she became a performer.\n\nFrom the beginning, I knew if I was going to create, I was going to do it with no limits and no rules and no regulations. I wanted to create from the heart. The three words I was using when I first started my career as Erika Jayne were fantasy, love and escape, and that's what the Pretty Mess album was all about. Later I added glitz, glamour and fun. Those are the six words I use to describe Erika Jayne.\n\nObviously, when you start out on a project, you're finding your way — it's the beginning of something. As you go further and further along, you start to develop as an artist and you feel more in touch with everything that you're doing and it explodes from there.\n\nBefore we go any further, let's be clear about something: Erika Jayne is 100 percent me. She's obviously a stage persona — a larger-than-life, over-the-top stage persona — but she's still, at her heart, me. I think there's a little bit of a showman in all of us, and it's just a matter of whether or not you bring that out of yourself — or allow it to show itself. We're all creative in our own ways, and either that part of you gets nurtured or you ignore it. I know it's a little unusual to rediscover your creative self at 35, and it's definitely even more unusual to still be doing it at 46, but that also makes the success I've had that much sweeter.\n\nThe sexual, sex-positive side of Erika Jayne is really who I am at my core. Erika Jayne is an act of rebellion — so when people tell me, No, I push back a little harder. I love a challenge, because it makes me want to take it even further. When people criticize me for being sexual and say, You're too old or You should act your age or You shouldn't be wearing that, then I look at those people and think, Uh huh. Sure. Of course YOU would say something like that. [Laughs.]\n\nIt's very easy to stand on the sidelines and talk about people who are doing things and creating things. It's much harder to actually go out there and do something or make something and risk something — whether that's your livelihood or your reputation. So, I've decided I'll live my life this way and you can live your life whatever way you want. When people are coming for you, you just have focus on the positive things that are happening in your own life. Let people be miserable without you — they can handle their misery all by themselves. You don't need to have any part of that poisonous nonsense.\n\nBut you do need people who will support you and offer you advice and sometimes call you on your shit. I learned a lot from my mom. Tom has been an incredible mentor in many ways, but he doesn't ask me my opinion on his legal cases, so I certainly don't ask him how he feels about Erika Jayne's creative choices. Maybe that sounds a little harsh, but we're very supportive of each other and he trusts that I can handle my creative life — just like I trust that he can handle his legal life.\n\nWhen people criticize me for being sexual and say, 'You're too old' or 'You should act your age' or 'You shouldn't be wearing that,' then I look at those people and think, Uh huh. Sure. Of course YOU would say something like that.\n\nAnd, truth be told, a lot of my mentors were gay. I grew up around a lot of gay people, and they were the ones who were responsible for introducing me to club music, which obviously changed my life forever. I feel less judged around gay men than many of the women I know and associate with. My gay friends accept me for who I am. They understand where I'm coming from and what I'm trying to do and they're able to separate the showgirl from the reality. They give me total acceptance, which, believe me, is not something you come by every day. I have these outrageous parts of my personality and they celebrate me for them. Other people in my life have told me or — worse — told others about me, Well, you know, I don't really approve… It's like, really? You don't approve? Well, guess what? Fuck you! But I don't have to worry about that with my gay friends.\n\nGay people have really had to fight hard to be accepted, and there's a sense of understanding in that community and they have no interest in judging me for being anything other than myself. I'm thankful for that and thankful for the courage they've given me. As easy as it may seem to be me when you're looking in at my life from the outside, the courage to be totally and unapologetically myself doesn't come easy. Here I am, a 46-year-old woman who will not apologize for who she is or what she does, and that can make people uncomfortable. But I refuse to alter Erika Jayne in any way to make anyone else feel comfortable. That's just never going to happen. So having these men in my life who have inspired me by taking the same stand and saying the same things about themselves — This is who I am and that's not going to change for you or anyone else — makes me feel incredibly grateful.\n\nAs far as the future goes, there are so many things I still want to do, but it all comes back to performing. That's my true love. There's absolutely no feeling in the world like when the house lights go down and you pop up on stage and everyone goes fucking berserk. In those seconds before the show starts, I'm like a racehorse in the starting gate. Everything is electric. I still get nervous — if you don't have a little bit of nerves, then you've quit caring about your job. Nerves are a sign that I still care about what I'm doing. But there's really nothing that compares to that rush of adrenaline that crashes over you the second you hit the stage. You could maybe compare it to a billion dollars or a really good game of craps or the best sex of your life — those four things are pretty hard to beat.\n\nBut for me, for now, it's about the performance. It's always about the performance. I feel like I've been given such an unusual opportunity at this point in my life, so as long as I'm here, I'm going to grab it and live it and make it the most it can be.\n\nThis piece has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nDo you have a personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost?

Two brides got to experience a real-life fairy-tale moment on their wedding day. Now their sweet story is capturing the internet's heart.\n\nOn Feb. 14, bride Bea Webster-Mockett posted a now-viral tweet about a heartwarming interaction she and her wife, Emma, had with a little boy and his mom during their Nov. 10 nuptials in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nKirsty McLachlan The brides met the young boy and his mom at Glasgow Botanic Gardens.\n\nThe newlyweds were taking pictures with their photographer, Kirsty McLachlan, at the Glasgow Botanic Gardens when they heard the boy shout, Look at those princesses!\n\nMy wife and I decided we had to speak to him, Emma Webster-Mockett told HuffPost.\n\nWhen they walked over, the boy asked, Did one of you get married? to which Emma replied: We married each other!\n\nTwo princesses then? the little boy asked. His mom explained, Yes, two princesses can marry each other!\n\nWee boy: LOOK AT THOSE PRINCESSES!\n\nBoy's mum: He thinks you both look like princesses\n\nWee boy: Did one of you get married?\n\nEmma: We married each other!\n\nWee boy: 😲 Two princesses then?\n\nBoy's mum: Yes, two princesses can marry each other!\n\nWee boy: 😲🤯🤩\n\n\n\nHappy 2 years my love ❤️ pic.twitter.com/LbuFdBV1HT — Bea Webster (@bea_p_webster) February 14, 2019\n\nAccording to the couple, the boy's mind seemed blown in the most delightful way. They, too, were moved by the brief-but-memorable encounter.\n\nI nearly cried! Emma said. My wife was just over the moon. And we were both delighted that the boy's mother didn't hesitate and just stepped right in and normalized same-sex marriage.\n\nKirsty McLachlan The reaction of Emma Webster-Mockett (right) says it all.\n\nIt was something we will never forget, she added. And it made our day a bit more magical.\n\nBea shared the story on Twitter as a way to commemorate the couple's second anniversary of dating (they originally got together on Valentine's Day 2017) but never thought her little tweet would go viral. Now that it's gained traction, Emma said she hopes their story will inspire others to be as loving and open-minded as the little boy.\n\nI hope that people see that if a child could understand two women marrying each other, then why can't lawmakers and people who have the power to make a difference see that too? she said. And give the LGBTQIA+ community the same rights and treatment as heterosexual people.
Tuan Tran via Getty Images Many parents of adults simply want to feel useful. No one wants to feel irrelevant and unneeded, therapist Kurt Smith said.\n\nEstablishing healthy boundaries with parents as you get older is one of the most important things you can do for your mental health. Your parents don't need to weigh in on your romantic life, your weight, your career path, your parenting style or any other segment of your adult life.\n\nBut for many people, the meddling continues well into adulthood, in spite of efforts to distance ourselves.\n\nKurt Smith, a therapist in Roseville, California, said he hears about this issue quite often. Clients tell him of friendly enough conversations that slowly veer into critiques: You should have done this instead. That will never work. Are you sure you're with the right person? I think you may be out of your depth here.\n\nWhy do some parents feel at liberty to weigh in on nearly every facet of their adult children's lives?\n\nI think many parents of adults suffer with feelings of irrelevancy and uselessness, and as a result make a practice of offering unsolicited advice and instruction in an effort to stay important to their children and family, Smith told HuffPost. They may also have a genuine belief that their own experiences mean they truly do know what's best.\n\nParental criticism and overstepping may be well-intentioned (though certainly not always), but more times than not, such comments prove divisive and damaging to the relationship.\n\nHow do you politely tell a parent to put a lid on unnecessary commentary so your relationship with them doesn't suffer? Below, Smith and other therapists share the advice they give clients dealing with this issue.\n\nClarify to yourself what your boundaries are before interacting with your parents.\n\nWhat are you comfortable sharing with your parents and what would you rather keep under wraps? Give some thought to that question before your next conversation with them, and then establish those boundaries.\n\nSetting an explicit boundary takes three steps, according to Sarah Joy Park, a psychologist in San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nFirst, be behaviorally specific about what you would like and the consequences if that boundary is crossed, she said. Maybe you tell your parent, 'Look, your comments about my weight are hurtful. If you comment on my weight in any way, I don't want to continue this conversation.'\n\nSecond, be consistent with reinforcing boundaries. Park said it's common for people to react poorly at first to newly established boundaries, but if you stay consistent, most people will adjust.\n\nThirdly, she said you have to accept the fact that people will make their own choices about how to respond to a boundary. In other words, unfortunately, you don't get to choose how your parent reacts to your new rules.\n\nGeorgijevic via Getty Images Set boundaries for conversations with your parents, and be firm in enforcing them.\n\nFill your parents in on why you made certain decisions (when you feel comfortable doing so).\n\nMany parents argue with their grown children about life choices because deep down, they're simply concerned and feel in the dark about their children's lives. If the topic at hand is something you don't mind delving into a little with your parent, talk them through why you made that particular judgment call: I decided to take a pay cut at a new company in Seattle because that's ultimately where my partner and I want to start a family. That just may be enough to satisfy them, said Ibinye Osibodu-Onyali, a marriage and family therapist in Murrieta, California.\n\nDraw them into your world, so they can understand you better, she said. Once they understand that you're making informed decisions, they are less likely to nag you.\n\nAfter you've offered your explanation, leave it at that. Do your best to steer the conversation away from an argument or a debate about whether your choice was the best choice.\n\nHelp your parents understand that as an adult, you can take care of yourself and chart your own course, Osibodu-Onyali said.\n\nWhen they criticize, share what you need from them instead.\n\nDon't just sit back and roll your eyes when your parent makes yet another rude, imposing remark about your personal life. Use it as a cue to share with them what you need from them instead of criticism, said Alexis Bleich, the clinic director at Kip Therapy in New York City.\n\nShe advised:\n\nLet's say you just got a new outfit and are wearing it on a Zoom call with your parents. Before you even say hello, your dad says, 'Well, it's a good thing you're social distancing so no one can see that get-up.' You might feel like rolling your eyes or snapping back about his lack of style, but if you can take a deep breath and say, 'Dad, I'm trying out something new and I feel comfortable and good about it! Please feel free to give me a compliment on my new outfit ― or if you don't like it, I'll definitely take a compliment on my hair or sparkling personality.'\n\nAsk for what you need ― moral support, recognition of a job well done, a compliment on your appearance ― and you might just get it, Bleich said.\n\namriphoto via Getty Images If your parent is constantly criticizing you, tell them what you need instead: support.\n\nThank them and move on.\n\nAnother smart diversion tactic, according to Smith, is to thank your parent for doing such a good job raising you. Complimenting them may be the last thing that you want to do after they criticize you, but this compliment is a bit self-serving: By giving them credit for teaching you how to make your own decisions (and learn from any potential mistakes), you're telling them they can relax and let you take the wheel.\n\nParents generally want to feel like they've been successful in raising their children. They want to know they've been a good mom or dad, Smith said. One measure of this is seeing their children become independent and self-sufficient, with the ability to make good decisions. Remind them they've done all that.\n\nRemind yourself that a parent's judgment says more about them than it does about you.\n\nMore often than not, undue criticism is a reflection of how someone feels about themself, not a reflection of you or your worth. That's true in the case of judgmental parents, too, said Sean Davis, a marriage and family therapist and a professor at California's Alliant International University.\n\nTheir desires and timeline for your life probably stems in part from their insecurities and unlived life, but resolving that is their responsibility, not yours, he said. As long as you make it your responsibility, you're delaying living your own authentic life.\n\nRemember that their view is just one opinion, one of many directions to take your life in. Just because they want something for you doesn't mean it's the right move.\n\nYou do not have to sacrifice your standards or preferences just to win your parent's approval, Davis said.\n\nIf you're feeling generous ― or, more importantly, want to lessen the resentment you may be feeling toward your parent ― try to understand some of the deeper reasons why they've encouraged what they've encouraged, Smith said. Maybe they always wanted to follow a certain career path and that's why they're pushing it on you. Or maybe they just want to feel that their opinion is worthy of respect.\n\nMany parents of adults simply want to feel useful. No one wants to feel irrelevant and unneeded, he said. Try to think about how you might feel when you're their age and what it means to them to be still heard and respected.\n\nFinding empathy for them within yourself is likely to result in a more positive, compassionate response the next time you and your parents are at odds. That said, they should be approaching you with just as much empathy.
What do you mean I won't get married until I'm older?! I have to get married or I will just die!\n\nBeads of sweat plop down onto my phone. I wish I had better lighting; the glare of my cell phone's flashlight makes the palm lines hard to see. I wonder how many drinks this man's downed. Considering this is Australia and it's $10 for all-you-can-drink, it's a miracle that he's still standing.\n\nI had been studying abroad in Australia for about a month, and one of my friends had announced to a group of pub mates that I could read palms.\n\nWell, according to your marriage lines, you will get married later in life, I tell him. I hope that this will stop his sweating. But I wouldn't worry about it too much. Remember, this is just for fun!\n\nHe pulls his hand up and squints at the faint lines. I have to get married before I'm 30. Everyone in my family does. I'll be an outcast if I don't! Please tell me I'll get married sooner!\n\nYou control your own fate, I give him my go-to-line. Your palm doesn't control your fate, you do.\n\nHe opens his mouth to respond when a woman wearing an Australian flag around her shoulders shoves him.\n\nYe had your turn! She thrusts her palm under my eyes. Tell me my future!\n\n***\n\nI have been able to read palms since I was 17. My grandma taught me. She used to read palms at parties, until at one gathering she sensed that someone was a murderer. This didn't stop her from teaching me, although she never read my palm, nor anyone in our family out of fear of what she might see.\n\nAs a palm reader, I don't actually tell the future. I am an entertainer. I also sometimes become a shoulder to cry on, a keeper of secrets, or a friend you have just met.\n\nI have never read palms professionally. For me, it's a fun, quirky hobby that brings people joy. Like my grandma, I have adopted palm reading as my own party trick. What often begins as a weird fact about myself can result in me being treated as a small-time celebrity.\n\nIt's not uncommon to have dozens of fans engulf me, their eyes on my fingers as I run them over lines, crests, fingers, and bumps, attempting to tell when the person will get married, if they will travel and if they have any musical talent. No matter what I say, people will shake their head in furious agreement, even if it is something as vague as You're close to your family, or You've had some heartbreak in your life.\n\nAt one party I perched myself on the edge of a sofa as guests treated me as though I were Cleopatra. Drinks and snacks magically appeared before me as they mused over my predictions, each person coming up with more questions than the last.\n\nWhat does this little line mean?\n\nThat's a scar.\n\nDo scars have meaning?\n\nNo.\n\nDo my short stubby fingers mean anything? I hate them.\n\nActually it means that you are a very down-to-earth person and a good friend. They're lovely.\n\nReally? I think they are so gross. I ―\n\nCan you read toes?\n\nI wasn't sure why such folks found me so tantalizing. I couldn't tell their entire future, nor which stocks to invest in, or if they would marry Idris Elba. But I was treated as though I could.\n\nIn terms of Western palm reading, there are three major lines that cross your hand: the heart, the head and the life line. The heart is the first line that horizontally curves across your hand, followed by your head line and your life line. Your heart line focuses on how you love, your head line on how you think and your life line on what your life will be like (but not the length of it).\n\nThere are a number of other lines that your palm can have such as your fate line, your health line, your logic line and your will line. Bumps, mounds and the shape of your fingers also factor into who you are and who you will become.\n\nI first learned how to read palms using my own palm despite the inherent bias of doing so. To make matters more difficult, reading my own palm is difficult because I am ambidextrous. Your dominant hand is what informs your future while your less dominant hand informs your past (or what you were born with). When you're ambidextrous, it's hard to tell which side is more prevalent.\n\nAfter months of study and practicing on my close friends, I was able to successfully read a palm. I could tell how many significant relationships one would have in their life, how much they would travel, what kind of musical talent they had, if they were free-spirited or if they were workaholics, if they had any business sense and whether they had been arrested. I understoodwhat the different bumps, lines, curves and lengths of the fingers meant.\n\nSince palms can contain so much, reading them can actually be quite tiring. The curve or depth of a line, as well as the placement on the palm, can completely alter the meaning. For instance, if your heart line curves toward your middle finger, it means that you give too much of yourself in relationships without getting enough back. However, if it curves towards the ring finger, it means you are hopeless romantic (but it doesn't connote that your relationships are rough). These are the minute differences you have to keep an eye out for, and after reading about 10 different palms, my vision will tend to blur and these differences can slip past me.\n\nAlthough palm reading can be exhausting, I find it fascinating. It's not the different curves and bumps that intrigue me―it's what people will reveal about themselves. Since what I tell people is often fairly vague, they often feel the need to elaborate on what I do tell them. This sometimes leads to rather shocking facts being revealed.\n\nOne time a woman divulged (after I noted that she would have two significant relationships in her life) that she did not think that her husband was the one.\n\nI'm glad you told me that, she took back her hand and flexed her fingers. I've been thinking about leaving him anyway. I figured there was someone else out there for me.\n\nWell, remember that this is just for fun. I sincerely hoped that she wouldn't actually leave her husband. Don't take this too seriously.\n\nNo, I've been wanting to leave him for a while now. He's bad in bed. I think this was the confirmation I needed.\n\nTo this day I have no idea whether she followed through with her plan. I certainly hope she didn't, but this is part of the power and curse of being able to read palms.\n\nAlthough intense personal secrets are sometimes revealed, I have also learned fun facts about people. As I read one man's palm at a coffee shop (he approached me after watching me read my friend's palm), he explained that he did indeed have musical talent — he had been playing with the Los Angeles Orchestra for the last five years.\n\nI don't read palms just at parties. I have found that it is a useful skill to have in supremely boring situations that need entertainment. After a flight was postponed for yet another three hours out of JFK Airport in New York, the entirety of the plane decided to have me read their palms (after seeing me read my sister's).\n\nOnce again, I was treated as a minor celebrity, as fans brought me candy and trashy magazines for reading their palms. As we waited two hours to board the plane, I became the de facto entertainment.\n\nI may not be able to tell your entire future (or your past or your full present), but I can tell how open you are and how skeptical you are. I can tell what some of your darkest fears are and what some of your craziest secrets are. I can make you smile and remind you of moments you have long since forgotten. I can convince you to finally take that trip or to start playing the violin again.\n\nA fortune teller doesn't always tell the future, but they can illuminate who you truly are.\n\nDo you have a personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost?

DETROIT ― It was extremely unusual for Robert Beaupre to feel unwell.\n\nHe was 67, but he took no medicines and didn't have any chronic health problems, except for a little arthritis in his fingers that he noticed when he played classical guitar, one of his many passions. He was healthy and active.\n\nSo Beau, as most of his friends called him, dismissed the slight fever he developed on March 14.\n\nHe was just kind of annoyed to get sick,'' said Linda, his wife of 35 years. Their daughter-in-law, 34, was about to have surgery in Arizona for an aggressive type of colon cancer, and Linda was planning to fly there to help with the grandkids.\n\nWhen Beaupre woke up the next morning, he told his wife he felt terrible and was going to the emergency room.\n\nHis choice to drive there alone underscored that he didn't consider it serious. He assured his wife, I'm fine. I just have a fever. It's no big deal,' she recalled.\n\nAscension Providence Rochester Hospital, a large community hospital four miles from their home, in Rochester Hills, an upscale suburb north of Detroit, quickly saw Beaupre, and a chest X-ray found his lungs were clear. He was sent home with instructions to quarantine himself.\n\nSeth Herald for HuffPost Linda Beaupre gazes out a window of her home on Wednesday. She lost her husband of 35 years to COVID-19.\n\nThe hospital gave him a sheet listing nine symptoms, and it said if any return, to come back to the ER, Linda said. The only symptom of the nine that he had was a fever.\n\nHe was not tested for COVID-19 because he had no cough or sore throat, two of its hallmark symptoms. We totally understood that they were so scarce that they were just being saved for people who had specific symptoms,'' Linda said.\n\nHis fever kind of came and went for the next few days, she said. He'd feel really, really bad when his fever went up, but then it would go back down. His appetite was off, and he had chills and aches. But there was no cough.\n\nThey watched Law and Order reruns and played with their rescue St. Bernard, Annie. Mostly Beaupre napped. Four days went by. Linda canceled her trip to Arizona. By Friday, he was more or less the same.\n\nA Rapid Shift\n\nOn March 21, he awoke coughing. Linda insisted they go back to the hospital. He said, 'OK.' He looked so exhausted.''\n\nThis time, Linda drove. It was chilly and windy, with a hint of snow flurries. At the ER, they took his temperature, put a mask on him and brought him through the lone entrance, typically used for ambulances. Linda couldn't even hug him goodbye.\n\nThey first diagnosed him with pneumonia. By Sunday, tests confirmed he had COVID-19.\n\nEarly on, Beau texted his wife, likely with help from the hospital's nursing staff. I have just been moved to the ICU ostensibly as a precaution as they try to get my O2 and fever under control. Room 823. Actually, I feel pretty good.\n\nShe called him a few times, but he'd say things to me, but I couldn't understand. He didn't have the energy to enunciate well. I had to keep asking, what did you say? I'm sorry I can't hear you.\n\nBy Tuesday, texts from Beau were difficult and brief. He didn't have the energy. She sent him a few pictures of their dog, Annie. The nurses at the 8th Floor ICU nursing station also told her to call when she needed to talk. They were just amazing and so compassionate when they were frustrated by what they didn't know yet, Linda said. And, you know, they were doing everything that they were able to do.''\n\nHis vital signs were good Tuesday. But that night he started to decline. The staff decided to intubate him.\n\nHer phone pinged at 7 a.m. Wednesday with a text from her husband, likely sent by a nurse. Had the absolute worst night of my life, it read. 4 nurses came in and helped regulate my breathing … and got my oxygen elevated. Sweetie ― I was really afraid I wasn't going to make it.\n\nThe text was a blow to the gut for Linda. Ventilators in my mind are for people who are not going to make it. This is kind of one step before they die. But then I thought, OK, I've read stuff about this before …. There were still reports of people that were vented for a couple of weeks and were able to come off.\n\nCourtesy Linda Beaupre Texts from Robert to Linda while he was being treated at a hospital. This was the only way he could communicate with his wife during that time.\n\nLinda texted him back: I wish for you to be able to feel my love and the love of SO MANY PEOPLE who are thinking, praying, and worrying for and about you. I'm so scared and wish I was with you. You have to get better please.\n\nShe called the nurses' station and was told he was resting comfortably. He'd been sedated, but his vital signs remained good. The nurses told her the ventilator would allow his lungs to rest ― it would give his body the strength to fight the virus.\n\nThen she got a note from Chadd Mowry, a cardiac nurse at Ascension Rochester and a friend and hockey teammate of her youngest son. He spent so much time at the Beaupre home growing up he was almost like a son, Linda said, but they hadn't seen him since the boys graduated from high school in 2007.\n\nHe'd happened to see Beau's name on a list of patients, and he texted Linda a photo of the note he left for him: Hi, Mr. Beaupre. It's Chadd Mowry . . . I came in to check on you and let you know you are in my thoughts and prayers. Hang in there. I look forward to talking to you after you beat this virus. You got this!\n\nThey kept texting, and Mowry became Beau's biggest advocate inside the hospital. I feel so bad about this, Mowry wrote. Mr. Beaupre was always so great to me. We loved being at your house. Hang in there.''\n\nCourtesy Linda Beaupre Chadd Mowry, an ICU nurse and family friend, communicated with Robert through handwritten signs.\n\nAs her husband's health deteriorated, the hospital let Linda visit. She was taken to a secured area, given a large protective cover-all, a helmet-like head covering and double masks and gloves, and was instructed on how to properly suit up and protect herself. She was told not to touch anything in the room, or him, so she sat bedside, talking to him.\n\nHe was unconscious by then, with his hands tucked under a sheet. She sat next to his bed and talked to him for nearly an hour. When she got home, she wrote down more things she wanted to say to her husband ― about their life together, their four sons, hockey, and his love of sailing, woodworking and cabinetry.\n\nHis brother, Dave Beaupre, is 18 months older. He said his brother could do almost anything he put his mind to. He was an actor, but he also built the sets at the now-defunct Manchester theater where he met Linda. He wrote and acted in a one-man play, Hem, about Ernest Hemingway.\n\nThe breadth of his talents just astonished people, said Dave, who lives just a few miles away from his brother. They talked or texted almost daily, and he last saw his brother two weeks before he was hospitalized.\n\nHe never got to say goodbye, but he sent Beau a last text: I love you bro.''\n\n'What Would You Want To Be Done?'\n\nAs Beau's health declined, Linda asked Mowry if there was someplace else he should be.\n\nThey were doing everything they can, she said, but she asked Mowry, What if this were your dad? What would you want to be done?\n\nMowry said he'd want him transferred to the University of Michigan's University Hospital, which had technology most other hospitals don't. Beau's doctor agreed to a transfer.\n\nBut almost three days went by, and Linda heard nothing about the transfer. In the meantime, the hospital tried adjusting his medicines. By then, Beaupre had developed heart issues and his kidneys were beginning to fail; his doctors had tried giving him the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has helped some COVID patients, but caused heart problems in others.\n\nAbout 10:30 p.m. that Saturday ― seven days after his March 21 admission ― the hospital called to say Beaupre's transfer had been approved if he could be stabilized and undergo dialysis to shore up his failing kidneys.\n\nLinda awoke Sunday to a text from Mowry saying the transfer could not happen, even though they'd tried for several hours to stabilize him. That afternoon, a hospital staffer called and invited her to visit again. She stayed for six hours, talking to him about their family and friends, things they'd laughed about over the years, and their plans.\n\nAt one point I said, 'I'm really sorry that you have to just listen to me talk,' she said. It's a running joke in our marriage that I talk a lot.\n\nShe already knew it was unlikely she'd be with her husband when he died. The few times I let myself think he might not survive this, I thought it would be the absolute lottery to be there with him when he died.''\n\nShe went home, and when she awoke the next morning around 5:30 a.m., she had missed a call from the hospital. Her husband had died at 4:35 a.m. on March 30.\n\nSeth Herald for HuffPost Linda standing outside her home on Wednesday.\n\nNow Linda mourns at home, alone, except for their St. Bernard. She remains under quarantine and hopes she and her two youngest sons, who live in the area and had seen their father before he was hospitalized, can get a COVID-19 test. Until then, she talks at a distance from her driveway to those who stop by.\n\nOne friend left a hockey stick with a blue ribbon and Beau's name on her front porch. Someone else tied a blue ribbon with a Bows for Beau sign around a tree in her front yard.\n\nShe hasn't decided what to do with her husband's ashes. She looks forward to having a proper memorial when she can. She's found talks with friends and family therapeutic, as well as writing about her husband. In his obituary, she listed his many interests, including buying, repairing and selling vintage clocks; reading books in French and listening to a French-speaking Windsor, Ontario, radio station; sailing; and practicing his repertoire of more than 60 songs on his classical, finger-style guitar three to four hours a day.\n\nThe soundtrack of my life is quiet now, Linda wrote in the obituary. I will so miss his robust and abiding sense of humor.''\n\nThe family mourns virtually, in Zoom meetings, calls and texts. They recall Beaupre's bursting laugh and large, inquisitive personality.\n\nHe'd talk to everyone,'' said his brother, Dave. It doesn't matter if you were 8 or 98. He was one of the funniest people you'd ever know.\n\nWhat gives them some relief is Beaupre himself ― that his life had an impact, that he brought love and joy to everyone left behind.\n\nA HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus
ASSOCIATED PRESS Oprah Winfrey's wisdom on how to reframe career loss has stayed with me.\n\nWhen Oprah Winfrey gives career advice, she gets me to listen. As a master orator, the media executive, former daytime talk show host and self-made billionaire makes a living out of finding divine meaning in mundane questions, like the difference between a job and a calling, or what you would tell your younger self.\n\nFor me personally, though, what has encouraged me through a layoff, career disappointment and unreasonable managers is her advice on how to handle challenging career losses that feel overwhelming.\n\nOprah Winfrey taught me to reframe career setbacks as learning moments\n\nOne grim winter, when I was unemployed after a layoff and worried I was unemployable, I encountered a YouTube clip from Winfrey's 2014 lecture to Stanford Graduate School of Business students, in which she shared the one piece of career advice she wanted to leave with them.\n\nAs soon as I watched it, I was transfixed by her ability to make the career story of failure I had been telling myself into a much bigger story about life:\n\nThere is a supreme moment of destiny calling on your life. Your job is to feel that, to hear that, to know that. And sometimes when you're not listening, you get taken off track. You get in the wrong marriage, the wrong relationship, you take the wrong job, but it's all leading to the same path. There are no wrong paths. There are none. There is no such thing as failure really, because failure is just that thing trying to move you in another direction. So you get as much from your losses as you do from your victories, because the losses are there to wake you up.\n\nHer speech gave me the permission I needed to put those hard months into wider perspective. Yes, a layoff was a job loss, but it was not a failure in Winfrey's eyes ― and shouldn't be in mine, either. Winfrey said that when you understand that losses are there to wake you up, you don't allow yourself to be completely thrown by a grade or by a circumstance, because your life is bigger than any one experience.\n\nThat job I hated? Instead of seeing it as a waste of time, I could be kinder to my younger self and see those draining final months as the push I needed to move toward a role that would energize me. The layoff I experienced? It was a necessary reset after overstaying at a comfortable job out of complacency.\n\nHer speech was a reminder to listen to what my body is telling me. When you are not at ease with yourself, Winfrey said, that's your cue to move in a different direction. It's an intuition I listen to more now. I did the best I could with the knowledge I had at the time, and now I'm going to learn from this moment, I now think to myself, instead of obsessing over should-haves.\n\nFeelings may not always be facts, but they do carry important messages if you regularly wake up in the morning dreading work. That's a barometer I have used, and you can, too.\n\nInstead of worrying about one big task, ask yourself: What's the next right move?\n\nWinfrey's approach to managing challenges is one I apply all the time when I multitask. As part of her career advice on how to get through hard times, Winfrey tells the Stanford students, The way through the challenge is to get still and ask yourself, What is the next right move? Not thinking about, 'Ohh, I got all of this to —.' What is the next right move?\n\nIt's a helpful question I use to break down large tasks with many moving parts. Whenever there's a work project that is starting to overwhelm me, I take a breath, go for a walk, talk to a friend, make a cup of tea, bake a dessert —activities that I know force me to interact with the world outside of my head and outside of my phone. Once I'm in that centered space, I give myself permission to not solve the huge task all at once. That allows me to stay on course with a task instead of going off on detours to my anxiety. Then I think about what the next right move is, and the next right move, and proceed more strategically from there.
Johnny Depp has a taste for the finer things in life, endless Pirates of the Caribbean sequels aside. Court documents obtained by The Hollywood Reporter claim the recently divorced actor has maintained a grandiose, often $2-million-per-month lifestyle that he allegedly can't afford.\n\nA lawyer for Depp's former managers, whom he is suing, listed in the documents filed Tuesday many of the actor's expenses observed over his 17-year stint as a client.\n\nAccording to his ex-managers, Depp spent $75 million on 14 residences including a chateau in France, a chain of islands, many homes around Los Angeles and a functioning horse farm in Kentucky. Depp also spent $18 million on a 150-foot luxury yacht, millions acquiring and maintaining 45 luxury vehicles, millions on his art collection featuring pieces by Andy Warhol, Gustav Klimt and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and over $3 million to blast from a specially-made cannon the ashes of author Hunter Thompson over Aspen, Colorado, according to the group.\n\nAnd, yes, they claim he spent $30,000 per month spent on wine that he had flown to him around the world for personal consumption.\n\nAll of those expenses came in addition to salaries of his staff (40 people around the world) and some living expenses of his mother and sister.\n\nThe actor sued his former management company, The Management Group, for $25 million last month with claims that it collected fees he'd never agreed to. In the cross-complaint published by THR, a lawyer for The Management Company claims the group had repeatedly warned the actor to stop spending so much and sell off things he didn't really need.\n\nDepp lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford, attorney Michael Kump wrote in the cross-complaint.\n\nDepp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today.\n\nLast month, the actor was granted a divorce from Amber Heard. That settlement requires him to pay $7 million to the actress, who accused Depp of physically and verbally abusing her throughout their marriage.
Getty Images\n\nThe stress of planning a wedding can bring out the best or the worst in a couple.\n\nIf the pair has a strong foundation, they'll work through any stressors they encounter as a team and doing so will bring them closer together. If there are already cracks in their foundation, though, preparing for the big day will often put even more of a strain on the relationship.\n\nJust ask wedding coordinators. Below, event coordinators from across the country share signs a couple is all but fated to divorce, based on pre-wedding behavior.\n\n1. They barely know each other and are rushing into the marriage\n\nIt's a bad sign when folks who met six months ago get engaged within the first 60 days or so. They're in a rush to get married in a matter of months, because 'They just met their soulmate!' I'm sorry, I just don't get it. How do you know if this person you're marrying pays their bills? How do you know if they are trustworthy? How do you know if they don't have a massive gambling problem? How do you know if you are going to be able to put up with this person for the rest of your life? You just don't. Not in that amount of time, at least. My advice would be to enjoy dating the person until you have an idea of who they really are. Spend at least a year being engaged and see how you both handle the stress of planning a wedding. ― Emily Reno, owner of Weddings & Events by Emily in Las Vegas\n\n2. One spouse smashes a piece of cake in the other's face, despite being asked not to\n\nWedding cakes can be trouble. During the wedding planning for one of my clients, the bride asked the groom multiple times in a serious manner to not smash the cake into her face during the cake cutting. The day finally came and ... he did it. She annulled the marriage soon after that. ― Anita Dybala, founder and lead planner at Anita Dybala Events in New Jersey and New York\n\n3. The couple couldn't care less about planning the wedding\n\nIt's a bad sign when someone doesn't seem excited about their wedding planning process at all. It's normal for the bride-to-be to be a little more into the details than the groom but when neither laugh or smile the entire time, you can just tell it's heading down the wrong road already. Most couples have little jokes with each other or laugh about things the other wants at the wedding, and when there's none of that, it's like you can feel the tension in the room. Usually not a sign of everlasting love. ― Trené Bambrough, co-owner of Great Expectations Weddings and Events in Las Vegas\n\n4. One of the partners thinks the wedding is all about them\n\nOne of the first signs that things aren't going to last? When the bride or groom is extremely into themselves. This person is usually very attention-seeking and not in a 'yay, it's my big day!' way. With some brides, they make faces like they're posing for pictures even during a regular conversation. They usually are overly touchy with their fiancé as well and those two things together usually indicate it's just putting on a show. Most couples who are genuinely in it for the long haul are more into each other than themselves.  ― Rachel Abolafia, co-owner of Great Expectations Weddings and Events in Las Vegas\n\n5. They're going into debt for the wedding\n\nListen, weddings are how I make a living so telling couples not to dish out cash for their wedding is sort of unwise on my part. However, I do believe spending money you don't have and going into debt over your wedding before starting a life as a married couple is extremely risky. ― Reno\n\n6. They treat their wedding vendors poorly\n\nI offered to coordinate one wedding for free. The bride asked me to place some ready-made, simple centerpieces on the tables as she was a DIY kind of bride. During our meetings she assured me that all I had to do is place ready-made bouquets into the vases. When the day finally came, I couldn't find the mentioned bouquets, only the tightly packed shipping boxes. Inside, I found roses with thorns and leaves on, uncut and unprepared. I had only one hour to create 15 centerpieces and I did it because I knew my reputation was at stake. I left pretty traumatized that day. The bride didn't even say 'thank you.' I don't suppose their relationship is built on a strong foundation because of that. If they treat others badly, you can expect they will treat each other the same way. ― Dybala\n\n7. They make sneak decisions about the wedding behind the other's back\n\nOne of the most obvious red flags is lack of compromise for even the most trivial of details. Sadly, I have so many examples of the frustration this can cause. On one occasion, I had a bride change half of the music directly with the band instead of going with the list that the groom had compiled with her help. The groom was so upset thinking the band had played the wrong song for their first dance, he walked off the dance floor to yell at the vendor. This, of course, ruined the moment and the photos. It was only then that he realized his wife had gone behind his back to make those changes. It just goes to show how important listening and allowing for flexibility is ― you'll have to make compromises in your marriage, too. ― Regina Young, owner at Meant2Be Events in Scottsdale, Arizona\n\n8. They cant agree on wedding decisions ― or anything, for that matter
Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, started at a job this week teaching art at Immanuel Christian School in Northern Virginia. It's not a school where everyone is welcome.\n\nIn a parent agreement posted online, the school says it will refuse admission to students who participate in or condone homosexual activity, HuffPost learned through an investigation into discriminatory admissions policies. The 2018 employment application also makes candidates sign a pledge not to engage in homosexual activity or violate the unique roles of male and female.\n\nMoral misconduct which violates the bona fide occupational qualifications for employees includes, but is not limited to, such behaviors as the following: heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites, says the application.\n\nThe application says that the school believes marriage unites one man and one woman and that a wife is commanded to submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ. The application asks potential employees to explain their view of the creation/evolution debate.\n\nThe parent agreement asks parents to cooperate in its biblical morality policy. Under this policy, parents are to acknowledge the sanctity of marriage as a strictly heterosexual practice. Families who condone, practice or support sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bi-sexual activity go against the principles of the school, per the document.\n\nKaren Pence has been married to Mike Pence since 1985. In response to requests for comment on the school's hiring practices and admissions policies, a spokesperson for Mrs. Pence noted that she also previously taught at the school for 12 years, while her husband was in Congress. The couple's daughter Charlotte Pence attended the school, according to the school's website.\n\nIt's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, said Kara Brooks, spokeswoman for the second lady.\n\nImmanuel Christian School, which is private, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Karen Pence will reportedly teach at the school twice a week until May.\n\nI am excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do, Pence said in a statement, per USA Today. I have missed teaching art.\n\nHowever, at least one LGBTQ rights group has already slammed the news of Pence's employment at Immanuel Christian.\n\nWhy not teach at a school that welcomes everyone, instead of choosing one that won't serve LGBTQ kids, kids of LGBTQ parents? said JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs at the Human Rights Campaign, in a statement to HuffPost. The Pences never seem to miss an opportunity to show their public service only extends to some.\n\nThis article was updated to reflect additional information about the school's admissions policies and comment from Karen Pence's office.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas' new Democratic governor on Tuesday reinstated a ban on anti-LGBT bias in state agencies' employment decisions that a Republican predecessor had repealed, and she also expanded the policy to cover government contractors.\n\nGov. Laura Kelly's executive order was her first official action since taking office Monday and fulfilled a promise she made repeatedly during her successful campaign last year. It bars state agencies from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity when hiring workers or deciding whether to promote, discipline or fire them.\n\nThe move came after a historic wave of victories by LGBT candidates across the nation. In Kansas, Sharice Davids won a congressional seat and state Reps. Susan Ruiz and Brandon Woodard were elected as the Legislature's first openly lesbian and gay members. All three are Kansas City-area Democrats.\n\nKelly's order will apply to departments under Kelly's direct control, which have about 19,000 employees. But she also extended the policy to companies that have contracts with the state, telling reporters later that if they do work for the state, they ought to follow its rules.\n\nIn a perfect world, we wouldn't need executive orders like this, Kelly told reporters during a Statehouse news conference. It's important that, until we become a perfect world, that we make sure that we've got the kinds of things in place that move it towards perfection.\n\nKelly's move instantly drew praise from national LGBT-rights groups. It came after new Democratic governors in Michigan and Wisconsin issued such orders, as well as Ohio's new GOP governor.\n\nThey can be open an authentic about who they are, about who their families are and who their loved ones are without fear of retribution of losing their employment, said Tom Witt, executive director of the LGBT-rights group Equality Kansas, saying he personally knows of seven state workers who lost jobs after previous protections were rescinded.\n\nBut extending the anti-discrimination policy to government contactors could prompt a backlash in the Republican-controlled Legislature. House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., a conservative Kansas City-area Republican, said lawmakers will probably review the order because it applies to private businesses.\n\nI absolutely think that is a decision the Legislature should be making, said conservative Rep. Blake Carpenter, a Wichita-area Republican.\n\nKelly reinstated a policy against anti-LGBT bias in state government that Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius imposed in 2007 through an executive order.\n\nRepublican Gov. Sam Brownback, a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, rescinded Sebelius' order in 2015, arguing that state lawmakers should set such a policy. It was clear at the time that the GOP-dominated Legislature and its conservative leaders would not.\n\nThe Kansas law barring discrimination in housing and private employment doesn't cover bias based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nHalf a dozen local governments have enacted their own anti-LGBT bias policies, including two Kansas City-area suburbs in December, but the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA's law school focusing on sexual orientation and gender identity policy, said only 12 percent of Kansas residents fall under them.\n\nWoodard and Ruiz said after Kelly's news conference that they are drafting a bill that would expand the state's anti-discrimination law.\n\nBut expanding the state's anti-discrimination laws is likely to be a hard sell in the Legislature.\n\nSome conservatives have argued that such an expansion would be used only as a legal club against conservative people of faith. They've also questioned whether such a law is necessary and whether anti-LGBT bias is pervasive in employment and housing.\n\nState Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook, a conservative Kansas City-area Republican, called Kelly's order anti-liberty and said it is degrading to reduce individuals to their sexual inclinations.\n\nThese laws cause divisions in communities and can have serious detrimental and unintended consequences because of their subjective nature, she added.\n\nFormer Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer replaced Brownback last year when Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom and signed a measure providing legal protections to adoption agencies that cite faith-based reasons for refusing to place children in homes that violate their religious beliefs.\n\nThe legislative debate centered on agencies that won't place children in LGBT homes. Supporters saw it as religious liberties measure, but Kelly has called it an adoption discrimination law and has said she will see whether she legally can avoid enforcing it.\n\nDemonstrating social conservatives' influence, the Kansas Republican Party adopted a platform last year that declares, We believe God created two genders, male and female. The platform also called for an amendment to the U.S constitution barring same-sex marriage, drafted so judges and legislatures cannot make other arrangements equivalent to it.\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .
Steve Beyatte and Christina Brady-Smith were eight days into their hike across the Himalayas when Brady-Smith's mother texted the couple warning them the airports were going to close and they needed to leave fast.\n\nThe San Francisco-based couple had spent the last 10 months traveling across the world to celebrate their marriage in lieu of a traditional wedding. They'd arrived in Nepal in February, and planned to travel around the country.\n\nThey managed to get back to Kathmandu, the nation's capital, on March 23 to fly to the U.S. the next day. But that night, they got a call from hotel staff telling them the country would be following a shelter-in-place order the next day, and their flights were canceled.\n\nBeyatte and Brady-Smith are among many people stuck away from home as the coronavirus pandemic spreads around the world and countries take increasingly drastic measures to slow the outbreak. In Nepal alone up to 10,000 tourists are stranded after the government sealed its borders and suspended all international flights.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy there has done little to help, said Beyatte, a 33-year-old web developer.\n\nHe and Brady-Smith were staying at a hotel with a number of other foreigners when they learned they were stuck. They watched as the British, German and Australian embassies communicated and reassured their own nationals. But when they tried to contact the U.S. Embassy for help, they didn't get anywhere.\n\nThey're absolutely atrocious with communication, Beyatte said. It's a nightmare.\n\nOn Friday, Germany retrieved more than 300 people from Nepal on a rescue flight, the same day a number of French nationals were flown out of Lukla, at the base of Mount Everest. The British and Australian embassies assured their citizens that a ferry flight was in the works to assist with their return.\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, seems to have done little to help Americans stuck in Nepal, to Beyatte's frustration.\n\nThe United States Embassy has been so uncommunicative about what's going on, about what they're doing or about how they're helping anything, he said. They just aren't putting anything out. I've called them a million times. They're just not responsive at all.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told HuffPost that it is closely monitoring the situation around the world, including U.S. citizen passengers on more than 50 cruise ships still at sea.\n\nSerious obstacles remain as we seek to carry out an unprecedented effort to repatriate thousands of Americans from across the globe, said the spokesperson, who also noted that as of March 24, the agency had brought home more than 9,000 American citizens from 28 countries.\n\nWe continue to urge American citizens to utilize commercial transportation options where available. Where these options no longer exist, our teams are exploring all possible means to help Americans get home, including charter flights where appropriate, the spokesperson added.\n\nAnil Bagale / Photo provided by John Arns John Arns, a 47-year-old Oakland resident who is also stranded in Nepal and is a member of the Americans Stuck in Nepal Facebook group.\n\nBeyatte and his wife have tried to get home on commercial transport but to no avail. They have booked seven different flights back to the U.S.; four have been canceled and the remaining three are likely to be. Due to the lack of information from official channels, Beyatte said he is in large part relying on a Facebook group where fellow travelers stranded in Nepal share information about their communications with the embassy, hotel openings and lockdown updates.\n\nThe Facebook group is good because everybody's sharing what they're learning, but that's the embassy's job to send out an email to everybody or update the damn webpage, said John Arns, a 47-year-old Oakland, California, resident who is also stranded in Nepal and regularly reading the Americans Stuck in Nepal Facebook group.\n\nArns arrived in the country in February after spending six months in India. He was due back to India last week but his March 22 flight was canceled. (On Wednesday, India announced its own lockdown after more than 600 individuals tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. It had suspended flights to and from Europe and the U.S. a week earlier.)\n\nInstead, Arns decided he'd return home to the U.S. to care for his elderly parents, who he worries might contract the virus. But those plans were also thwarted after his March 26 flight was canceled. Left with no choice, he extended his Nepali visa and for now, he's stranded in Nepal.\n\nHe tried to register for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a State Department service that allows U.S. travelers to receive the latest security updates, but the website was not working. Discouraged and left with no other options, he turned to the Facebook group for help.\n\nI don't have the confidence that my government's going to take care of me, said Arns.\n\nPhoto provided by Walk Zink Walt Zink, a 44-year-old photographer and bartender from Boston, arrived in Nepal on March 10 to hike through the Everest region and take a series of portraits of people in the region.\n\nOutside of Nepal's capital, nearly 500 trekkers are stranded in mountains after they were unable to make it down from their trails before the lockdown went into effect. Earlier this month, the Nepali government called off this year's hiking season — which includes treks to Mt. Everest — because of the coronavirus outbreak, hoping to deter the more than 700,000 tourists that visit the mountains every year.\n\nWalt Zink, a 44-year-old photographer and bartender from Boston arrived in Nepal on March 10 to hike through the Everest region and take a series of portraits of people in the region. When he heard about the lockdown of the trails, he caught the last flight from Lukla to Kathmandu on March 23, in order to catch a flight from the capital back to the U.S., but he was too late. Zink had missed the last flight out of Kathmandu.\n\nZink, who is now staying with a friend, is monitoring that same Facebook group, hoping for good news.\n\nIt's hard not to look at other nations and their swift action and feel defeated.\n\n[Those governments] are actually treating people like humans, said Beyatte. We're humans too.\n\nA HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus
Juno star Elliot Page filed for divorce Tuesday from Emma Portner after three years of marriage, Entertainment Tonight reported, citing court records it obtained.\n\nPage submitted the documents in Manhattan about two months after he came out as transgender, according to TMZ.\n\nThe spouses confirmed the report in a joint statement, per People: After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce following our separation last summer. We have the utmost respect for each other and remain close friends.\n\nPage, a regular on The Umbrella Academy, wrote on Dec. 1 how happy he was to be his authentic self. I love that I am trans, he wrote.\n\nPortner, a dancer and choreographer, chimed in that she was proud of Page. I also ask for patience and privacy but that you join me in the fervent support of trans life every single day, she commented. Elliot's existence is a gift in and of itself. Shine on sweet E. Love you so much.\n\nThe two married in January 2018. Page previously came out as gay in 2014.\n\nHuffPost did not immediately hear back from Page's rep in a request for comment.
SIPA USA/PA Images Get used to this mug. Eric Murphy, 39, is gonna be a U.S. circuit court judge for a long, long time.\n\nWASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Eric Murphy to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, meaning a 39-year-old lawyer who repeatedly led efforts to make it harder for people to vote will now be a lifetime federal judge.\n\nMurphy, who has been the solicitor general of Ohio since 2013, was confirmed 52-46. Every Republican voted for him. Every Democrat voted against him. Two senators, Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.), did not vote.\n\nDemocrats criticized Murphy's nomination for several reasons. He argued in 2015 that same-sex marriage would be disruptive … to our constitutional democracy in a brief he filed in the Obergefell v. Hodges marriage equality case before the Supreme Court. In 2014, he argued against women's access to contraception in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby.\n\nBut Murphy is perhaps best known for defending Ohio's notorious voter purge law before the Supreme Court in 2018, arguing that the state should be able to drop people from its voter rolls if they don't vote for six years and don't respond to a postcard asking them to confirm their address. The court upheld the law in a contentious 5-4 decision, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing in her dissent that the law will disproportionately make it harder for minority, low-income, disabled, homeless, and veteran voters to cast a ballot.\n\nThat same year, Murphy argued in favor of upholding the so-called perfection requirement, allowing Ohio to discard ballots because of minor clerical errors.\n\nIn 2014, Murphy defended the elimination of Ohio's Golden Week, a five-day period in which voters could register and vote at the same time. The state created the period in response to the 2004 election, when many Ohio voters were forced to wait in line for up to 12 hours to vote. The 6th Circuit ruled in favor of getting rid of the period, but Judge Jane Stranch wrote in her dissent that it would impose a disproportionate burden on African Americans and was linked to social and historical conditions of discrimination that diminish the ability of African Americans to participate in the political process.\n\nIn fiery remarks on the Senate floor, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) tore into Murphy's nomination and said what is most despicable about his confirmation vote is that it comes on the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, when civil rights marchers were beaten and tear-gassed as they marched in Selma, Alabama.\n\nI can't imagine my Republican colleagues came from Georgia and Kansas … thinking, 'I'm going to take the oath of office and you know what one of the things is I'm going to do? I'm going to vote to restrict voting rights,' he said. 'I'm going to vote to tell gay people they can't marry. I'm going to vote to take away worker rights. I'm going to vote for judges that put their thumb on the scale of justice.' ... I can't believe that's why any of you came.\n\nThe Ohio senator said the judicial selection process has become painfully partisan under President Donald Trump. Whether it was George W. Bush or George H.W. Bush, Republican presidents used to nominate wise, prudent lawyers who believed in public service to be lifetime judges, he said.\n\nThey didn't believe in some far-right agenda where they put their thumb on the scale of justice, said Brown. They picked picked middle-of-the-road, thoughtful workers that actually believed in civil rights. Shocking.\n\nMurphy is the third of three U.S. circuit court nominees who Republicans confirmed this week. All three are young, right-wing ideologues who are members of the conservative Federalist Society, which has been driving Trump's judicial selection process by funneling anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ prospective nominees to the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Allison Jones Rushing, 36, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. She worked for the anti-LGBTQ group Alliance Defending Freedom and has argued that there were moral and practical reasons for banning same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Chad Readler, 46, to the same court as Murphy. Readler played a leading role in the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nThis week's votes are part of a broader effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to dramatically reshape federal courts while Trump is in the White House. He has made circuit court confirmations his top priority, as circuit courts are often the last word in federal court cases. The Supreme Court hears only about 100 to 150 appeals of the more than 7,000 cases that come before the nation's 13 circuit courts each year.\n\nWith Murphy's confirmation, Trump has now gotten 34 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices confirmed. Trump has gotten so many circuit judges confirmed ― more than any other president by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts is now filled by a Trump nominee. CORRECTION: A previous version of the story incorrectly gave Murphy's age as 40 and Rushing's as 37.
Kaley Cuoco is calling out her ex-husband, former professional tennis player Ryan Sweeting, for nearly ruining marriage for her.\n\nI honestly thought I wouldn't get married again, the Big Bang Theory star says in the May issue of Cosmopolitan. My ex ruined that word for me. I married someone the first time who completely changed.\n\nThe person I ended up with was not the person I originally met, she went on. And that wasn't my fault ― that was his. I knew how much I had to give and how much I wanted to receive.\n\nCuoco and Sweeting met in 2013. The two got engaged in September of that year, just three months after they were first spotted together. They married a few months later in a whirlwind ceremony on New Year's Eve.\n\nHowever, after 21 months of marriage, Cuoco filed for divorce in 2015. The 32-year-old confessed the two just weren't a match shortly after the split.\n\nBarry King via Getty Images Ryan Sweeting and Kaley Cuoco at the the premiere of The Wedding Ringer on Jan. 6, 2015.\n\nI knew even deep down, I know this is just not the right thing. The right thing is coming for me, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, she said during an appearance on The Talk in 2016.\n\nI think even when I went through my big breakup, even my friends that know me so well, I might have said things like, 'I'm never going to love again. I'm never going to get married again,' she said at the time. But the people that know you best, they know my heart and that's just not me.\n\nSweeting himself has said little publicly about the divorce.\n\nAfter splitting from Sweeting, Cuoco began dating professional equestrian Karl Cook in April 2016. The two got engaged this past November. The Big Bang Theory star told Cosmo she can't wait to marry her new fiancé.\n\nI knew I just had to be patient, she told the magazine. I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl.\n\nAlberto E.

Are you upset? he asked.\n\nHonestly, I was.\n\nI was on a three-person date with a handsome Argentine whom I had been tasting Buenos Aires with for one wonderful month. Sure, I'd been forewarned that his friend Valentina was coming along that night to finally make my acquaintance. I'd been told that her motivations lay in practicing her English with a tea-loving Brit. In reality, it was a ruse to orchestrate a threesome. That very moment, I decided I was done with dating.\n\nMan drought, dating diet or self-imposed celibacy; whatever you choose to call it, I was going to say yes to #NoMan2019.\n\nIn fact, a trio of factors led me down this dry path. It dawned on me that I had invested so much time chasing the highs of dating that I failed to realize the heart-twisting terror that it actually caused me: assaults on the self-esteem, anxiety, drained energy and hours wasted in the throes of sorrow when things didn't pan out.\n\nThe year before, I'd been deserted in the cruelest fashion by a partner of six months. From one day to the next, he simply never spoke to me again. The thing about ghosting is that it's tricky to get closure because you're not really sure why, what or when to grieve.\n\nSecondly, I had never truly been single. To be frank, searching for a man who was willing to promise forever was my preferred pastime. Despite my success professionally and with platonic relationships, my inability to locate Prince Charming somehow meant I'd failed ― a lifestyle narrative that still plagues many women.\n\nAs such, I was always somewhere in the dating life cycle: in the heat of passion, recovery or hunting once more for those dizzy, eclectic times. Each relationship was effectively a rebound, as I never gave myself time to heal or self-reflect. Without carving out crucial breathing space, I'd keep wearing the habits of yesteryear's loves and tarring every man with the same brush.\n\nNot to mention, I'd grown bored of the monotony of the dating process and bogged down by the mental clutter that came with it. There had to be a better use for my time than feigning interest in Suitor X and his life story. Simply put, dating was no longer fun.\n\nThe rules of the ban were simple: Friendship was all I could offer anyone, and I deleted my dating apps. All and any men who approached me were swiftly informed of the rules, which was actually a fabulous exercise in communicating my boundaries and desires.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I went out into the world with my green light switched off and felt freer and lighter as a result; the pressure to snag the prize was off.\n\nWhile I might have expected life without the pursuit of romantic relationships to bring up feelings of sadness or loneliness, all of this actually culminated in a mind shift whereby I stopped viewing solitude as calamitous. I could give up my subscription to the Must Have a Man Association and life would still go on; it could even be great. Accordingly, recent reports from the American Time Use Survey show that, surprisingly, unmarried women are actually the happiest population subgroup.\n\nLooking back, 2019 has been remarkable and fulfilling, and my decision to detox from dating yielded some significant takeaways.\n\nCourtesy Of Rosie Bell During my man-free year, I danced at Rio carnival and learned the secrets of flamenco.\n\nI relished in my singledom\n\nYou can do or be whatever you want when you're single. It's also a prime opportunity to have fun discovering what you want your life to be about. I'd come across this advice before but I needed to experience it firsthand to get it.\n\nBeing happily single is only possible when you've fully recovered from the pain of a previous breakup, something I never let myself do until now. Throwing myself into someone else's arms as soon as the sheets were cold was never going to alleviate underlying heartbreak; it's essentially panic buying. Not devoting sufficient time to recovery also meant I'd be stepping into any new relationship with unduly low expectations, which is unfair to any new partner.\n\nI also developed an appetite for alone time. I understood that solitude is not sadness just as much as marriage isn't sure-fire satisfaction. Being able to withstand just myself for company meant I wasn't desperate for anybody else's. When you're happy on your own, you'll wait for the right people and be selective about who you let infringe on your precious alone time. I'm not anti-men, I'm just pro-me. Extended periods of solitude stop us from being commitment-hungry and mentally marrying any old person with a Colgate smile.\n\nMy passions and pursuits were all mine to explore\n\nThe time I clawed back from romancing helped me fall in love with the world again. I'm not usually one for unashamed country counting, but this year alone I've fraternized with Manneken Pis, Christ the Redeemer, the Eiffel Tower, Chicago's Bean and the Panama Canal. I took a scenic ride on one of the world's highest high-altitude trains through the depths of Salta's Lerma Valley, went salsa dancing in Cuba and signed up for flamenco lessons. I felt absolutely zero guilt about wanting my life to be about my wishes because I realized just how delicious that could be.\n\nMy (platonic) relationships thrived\n\nBecause I invested more in self-care, I ultimately became a better, more well-rounded person to show up for the people in my life. I could be present for them when they had problems because I wasn't reeling from another bout of heartbreak.\n\nI got such deep satisfaction from spending time with my old friends and made numerous new ones. Studies of thousands of people around the world reveal that single people have more robust social networks than their coupled-up counterparts. They are far from alone and do more to maintain relationships. On a whim, I flew from Argentina to London to pay my sister a surprise visit and I didn't have to check that a partner could make the trip, too.\n\nCourtesy of Rosie Bell Solitude is not sadness, as I discovered.\n\nI was regularly interrogated about the deadline\n\nMany refused to believe I could genuinely be happy without the prospect of love; you'll always invite criticism when you start to question societal norms. Did I sniff pity? Most certainly. I also spent a lot of time fending off questions about when I would finally bake a cake in my womb oven.\n\nHaving a partner is prestigious and a traditional marker of success. Even the most accomplished women are deemed pitiful if they don't have a better half. When friends told me they hoped I'd meet someone soon, I know they meant well. However, it's apparent that singledom is still perceived as a problem to be solved hastily particularly for women in their pursuit of self-worth.\n\nMy business soared\n\nWhereas dating had always been my project, my priorities shifted and I had fire in my belly career-wise. I spent time really fine-tuning my voice as a writer and the powers that be listened. My dream publication reached out to me and I wrote for some of the biggest names in media including Lonely Planet, the BBC and Shondaland. I was featured as a travel expert on NBC News and was invited to become an instructor on Skillshare where I've since launched various classes on all things writing.\n\nSometimes I still pinch myself when I remember that I'm a full-time travel writer, published author and receive remuneration for the miscellaneous thoughts in my head. My book Escape to Self is a life design guide that one reader kindly described as an empowering wake-up call (thank you). I also started stitching together the proposal to expand my travel and lifestyle brand, Club Elsewhere. In 2020 we'll be launching a booking platform to cater to a growing niche in wellness tourism.\n\nMy year without men has undoubtedly been my most productive to date. This isn't to say that we can't have love as well as ludicrous success; it's the dating game itself that can hinder productivity and siphon one's zeal. Sifting through candidates and conducting interviews is a job in itself.\n\nTime and space are magnificent healers and this break ultimately freed me from the burden of viewing a life sans partner as a wholly wasted one. Coupled up or self-partnered, I have all the etchings of a full life. The term spinster doesn't define me, nor does it rile me up.\n\nCourtesy of Rosie Bell In my most productive year yet, I worked with some of the biggest names in travel.\n\nThe future beckons and perhaps the gates to my heart will reopen next year. The next person to walk into my life won't simply be a cog in the wheel though; he'll be someone I decide is worthy of spending time in my world, as I now know that's a great place to be.\n\nRosie Bell is a roving travel writer, editor and author of Escape to Self. She's been fortunate to visit over 100 global destinations but feels most at home under the sun. Her writing has appeared in Forbes Travel Guide, the BBC, Fodor's and Lonely Planet.

Illustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost Photos: Getty\n\nHigh-profile men like Ed Sheeran, Skylar Astin and Michael Bublé have all publicly sported engagement rings, but it's still not the mainstream choice in the U.S. these days for most men (specifically, straight ones).\n\nThat said, there are many engaged guys who have chosen to wear a ring anyway — because they want a more egalitarian partnership, because their significant other proposed to them, because they wanted something to symbolize their commitment or for any other number of reasons.\n\nAnd yes, they may get the occasional sideways glance or pesky question, but that doesn't deter them.\n\nI, for sure, got a lot of questions but mostly from my parents' generation, Ryan Avery of Denver told HuffPost. Men would question my decision and women would think it was 'cute' or say, 'Ah, good for you. My husband would never have done that!' Really? Why not? There were a lot of other people who were for it. But I don't know too many ― if any ― of my male friends who wore or wear engagement rings.\n\nBack in the 1920s, U.S. department store L. Bamburger & Co., which later became Macy's, launched an advertising campaign for male engagement rings, but the idea never really stuck. In other countries like Chile and Sweden, however, it's commonplace for both men and women to wear engagement rings.\n\nIn 2018, many engaged fellas are choosing to do what feels right for them, whether it's trendy or not. Below, seven men on why they proudly sport an engagement ring.\n\nJamie Raines, 24\n\nAfter I proposed to my fiancée, she did a second 'proposal' of sorts while we were on holiday. She said she wanted me to have a ring to show off too, and I see my ring as a sign of being equal with my fiancée Shaaba. I haven't 'claimed' her with the ring. We both wear one to show our commitment to each other.\n\nJames Bull, 26\n\nMadeByBlink Bull told HuffPost he enjoys wearing an engagement ring as a symbol of his commitment.\n\nI really respect the clear and simple symbolism. It's like a testament to a person's commitment, it shows intention and I didn't see any reason to wait until we were married to start wearing it. My thought is, I'm engaged too, why don't I get to wear a ring? She's an amazing woman, and I think this relationship that we've poured so much into is something to be proud of and something to be excited about. This is a little symbol of that. When I put it on, everything about our marriage seems just a little bit more immediate and tangible.\n\nSelig Stoney, 27\n\nCourtesy of Selig Stoney In addition to the engagement ring, Stoney and his now-wife also have matching tattoos on their ring finger that read trust.\n\nI wanted to do something that was non-traditional, in a sense. I feel that love and marriage is a two-way street and that both parties can express their excitement with rings along with announcing proudly to the world that they are happily taken before they get married.\n\nJose Rosales, 34\n\nBrooke Miller Photography Rosales told HuffPost that a few of his fiancée's friends didn't understand why he was wearing an engagement ring. But I just told them it was something special between us, he said.\n\nAfter I got engaged to Staci, we had a conversation about how it wasn't fair that only she gets to wear an engagement ring. We were on a hiking trip in Utah when I proposed, and before our flight back home, we were killing time in Las Vegas and stumbled into a jewelry store. Next thing you know, I had a ring too!\n\nRyan Avery, 31\n\nCourtesy of Ryan Avery The Averys took this ring photo together right after they got engaged.\n\nWhy would I not want to show the world I am taken too? Especially in our culture where rings symbolize you are with someone. For me, engagements are not a test run ― they are the moment we decide to be together forever. If Chelsea was going to show people she was taken, I wanted the world to know too and feel very proud to tell people.\n\nTyson Clyburn, 34\n\nCourtesy of Tyson Clyburn I decided to wear one because why do women get to wear the cool jewelry and we don't until marriage? Clyburn told HuffPost.\n\nAt first it felt a little weird, but I had bought a rubber ring in every color to match whatever I was wearing and so I kept wearing them. I get questions all the time! No one really understands it and they all think my fiancée put me up to it. She didn't even know about it until I posted a picture. People think it's either the dumbest thing they've ever heard of or really sweet.\n\nMichael Correll, 28\n\nCourtesy of Michael Correll Together, the Corrells decided they both wanted to wear rings during their engagement. I didn't feel like my wife should be the only one who got to show off that she was getting married. I was just as engaged as she was but I didn't have a symbol for that, Correll told HuffPost.
Many little girls, often daydream of walking down the aisle, on the most joyous day of their life – their wedding day. Heart racing, nervous smile plastered across her glowing face, never once thinking that the man she's walking towards is hiding a secret that he's too afraid to share.\n\nMany young men envision meeting their soulmate, sharing their life with the person of their dreams, having a family, and living the life that's expected of them – married to a beautiful woman and being a supportive husband and father. Yet some men are torn apart inside by the secret they keep that leads to heart wrenching guilt, shame, and fear of failing everyone they know.\n\nRegardless of the scenario, whether it's a man or a woman hiding their secret, at some point, the pain of pretending to be someone they're not becomes greater than the transparent truth of living and being who they're meant to be.\n\nIn that moment, all the years of love, parenting, and life building are diminished to a rubble of memories. Tortured wails of How could you do this to me? by an unsuspecting spouse, are just the tip of the betrayal iceberg that sinks the life once known by all concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, many couples in a mixed orientation marriage bravely join forces, standing tall in love, vowing to get support for overcoming the wicked temptation of same-sex attraction. Prayer, therapy, retreats, hard work, and tear-stained conversations litter the landscape of a marriage in defense mode, all in the name of make it work, just make it work! However, even the most resolute attempts to stay afloat in the life ring of Until death do us part, find many couples surrendering to the truth that fixing the same-sex attraction, or fixing it enough, as Matt the husband your about to meet said in his TEDx talk, isn't going to happen. To quell the truth of a spouse embittered in their own internal tug of war with who they are vs. who the rest of the world expects them to be, is practically a death sentence in and of itself.\n\nWhile both in-the-know spouses may give a mixed orientation marriage a fair shake, many are faced with the harsh reality, that denying the truth of the same-sex attraction only leads to deeper levels of guilt, shame, anxiety, depression, and more often than not ugly embittered relationships that lead to divorce. Matt and Luanne Nightingale are trying to walk the road less traveled, one of gratitude and hope, for unraveling their 25-year relationship.\n\nGranted, it's a common, and a completely acceptable, rationale human emotion to want to lash out, be angry, and desire the betrayer, pay, pay, pay for the lies they've laden into a 23-year marriage, that never really was the storybook version of the storybook marriage they thought they were living. However, by changing perspectives a little and dramatic shifts of thought, one begins to see the beauty of diversity, if one chooses to do so.\n\nEven though the wounds are still freshly cut, and like many heterosexual spouses, Luanne is getting the raw end of the deal (a justifiable feeling that most heterosexual spouses feel) by having her little girl dreams of happily ever after shattered, the question remains, Why me, why now, why to begin with? As understanding, compassionate, and loving as she can be, it doesn't take away the gut wrenching blow to the heart, self-esteem, and trust that Luann built in her marriage to the man that she loved.\n\nWhen faced with the harsh truth, Luann and Matt faced eerily similar circumstances and questions that thousands of other same sex couples caught in this mixed-orientation marriage turmoil have faced. Heart-wrenching questions like, Do we try to make this work? or How do we undo the damage, un-tell the lies? and the ever so popular, What does the future hold for either of us, our kids, our family? Yet, they found a path.\n\nThrough open, honest, transparent communication, Matt and Luanne have chosen to accept the truth of Matt's same-sex attraction – him a little more easily, her a little more painfully. Leaning into their relationship built on love, respect, support and brutal honesty, they're now, in their own words, Trying to do this well. The This well being, creating an environment for themselves and their children where the family thrives rather than survives as their marriage unravels – she as a single, pained and saddened heterosexual mother, he as a single, excited yet sorrowful, gay father.\n\nWhile brutal honesty and truth often slice deep into the jugular of life, transparency for being known for who you are is a blessing that eradicates guilt, shame, and self-loathing, opening one's self, and hopefully others to the light of living truth for truths sake. In the light of Matt's truth, his real truth, he and Luanne are building a new foundation that embraces the reality that who you are is who you are even though at times it hurts and brings up anger and confusion. However, both Matt and Luann have found that any attempt to fight your truth only compounds the darkness, hurt and pain which in turn, eventually manifests as a person living a pretend life having pretend relationships.\n\nOn Saturday, November 6, 2016 Matt and Luanne bravely, both in their own unique way, took the stage at TEDx Sonoma County to share their story, their journey, and their truth - a truth that demonstrates with respect, support, honesty, and a deep dive into forgiveness and understanding that both of them are trying to navigate the waters of unraveling a marriage of deception and lies, with dignity and love.\n\nSelecting gratitude and hope as their guideposts, Matt and Luanne's TEDx talk demonstrates their ability to find common ground in what could easily be a chaotic war of love gone wrong. Yes. This is their path of choice, but it does beg the question, What's possible when gratitude and hope are chosen over bitterness and you done me wrong thoughts?
Michael Tran via Getty Images Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux sit together at the Hollywood Walk of Fame on July 26, 2017.\n\nActors Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have officially ended their relationship after two-plus years of marriage.\n\nThe couple announced that they had separated late last year in a joint statement obtained by HuffPost on Thursday.\n\nThe breakup, which Aniston and Theroux had intended to keep private at least for a while, was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year, according to the couple. They decided to publicly announce the split in an attempt to reduce any further speculation and gossip.\n\nWe are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship, the couple said in their statement.\n\nNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.\n\nAniston and Theroux met on the set of Tropic Thunder in 2007 and got engaged five years later. They were married on Aug. 5, 2015.\n\nThe actors do not have kids together, but they intend to stay friends and maintain their deep respect and love for each other, according to the couple.\n\nAniston, a hot topic for celebrity gossip sites, has previously criticized tabloid culture and the media's obsession with her private life. In a 2016 essay for HuffPost, the actress said she was fed up with the incessant focus on her body, her personal decisions and whether or not she was pregnant. Last August, nearly a year after that commentary was published, she told Vogue that the gossip surrounding her personal life hadn't let up.\n\nRead Aniston and Theroux's full statement about their separation below:\n\nIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.
So you've vowed to be healthier this year. That typically means less fast food, and more exercise. But what are you doing for your mental health?\n\nExperts say a great place to start is by tackling your toxic thoughts. We experience thousands of thoughts per day. Some of these thoughts can be negative and thus detrimental to your well-being. In fact, some research has even suggested negative thinking could be linked to physical ailments such as heart disease.\n\nTipping the scale to have more positive thoughts in your day can work wonders for your mind and overall health. Here are 14 toxic thoughts that experts say you need to banish if you want to be happier:\n\n1. I'll do it later.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images\n\nCatching up on your favorite Netflix show might sound like your most appealing option when you have some free time, but putting off something you need to get done is likely to lead to more stress.\n\nCreating motivation and adding structure to your routines can help you ward off the urge to stall, said Lucas D. Saiter, a psychotherapist in New York City.\n\nChecklists are very effective at motivating individuals and there is research that shows this, he said. Make attainable goals, write them down and go get them.\n\n2. Any type of catastrophic thinking\n\nOne bad thing does not always lead to another. But when something doesn't go your way, it's easy to let your mind delve deep into the dark side.\n\nWhen we think things are worse than they are, or assume that because one bad thing happened that more bad things will happen, it can cause a lot of emotional turmoil, said Robyn Gold, a psychotherapist in private practice in New York City.\n\nGold cited the following as a catastrophic thought process that can quickly get out of control: I failed a pop quiz in class. This means I'm going to fail the whole class, and then that means I'll never graduate. Then I won't ever get a job and I'll be living in my parents' home for the rest of my life.\n\nTo combat this type of thinking, Gold suggested asking yourself what all the possible outcomes are ― including the positive ones. For example, in this situation you could take more control by telling yourself that you have the power to do better next time and use that thought process instead to motivate you to succeed, she said.\n\n3. I'm inadequate.\n\nThis type of thinking can quickly impair your ability to succeed in the workplace and within your personal relationships. Lynn Whitbeck, the founder of online women's career mentoring site petite2queen.com, has developed the acronym YASS to help her clients overcome a case of feeling not good enough:\n\nY = Why you. Remember, you add value. A = Allowed to fail. Give yourself permission to fail. When you fall, you always get back up. S = See success. Breathe and reframe your mindset. S = Surge forward. Take a leap of faith, because if you don't ask, you don't get.\n\n4. Self-care is selfish.\n\nA flight attendant will always tell you to put on your own oxygen mask before assisting someone else. This should be a metaphor for life, according to Shainna Ali, a licensed mental health counselor in Orlando, Florida.\n\nBut we often feel guilty if we place our own needs ahead of things we feel obligated to do. That can end up backfiring: Not only do you get burned out, you also won't have energy to spend on people you care about.\n\nTaking care of yourself is an investment that you benefit from, but your loved ones, colleagues, neighbors and community do as well, Ali said. So it's OK to say 'no' to baking homemade treats for the neighborhood bake sale if you feel that you'd benefit by soaking in a bubble bath instead.\n\n5. Their life is so much better than mine.\n\nPeopleImages via Getty Images\n\nIt's easy to scroll through Instagram and assume everyone else is leading a life far superior to your own. But this is often far from the truth, according to Ree Langham, a psychologist and writer at ParentingPod.com.\n\nWhat you see is only the outer shell of what may be happening within. In other words, people put out what they want others to see, Langham said.\n\nYou may think your life sucks because someone else has a fancy car, a couple of kids, a nice job, a good-looking spouse, a cute dog, an expensive house and white-picketed fence, but you don't know what happens behind closed doors, Langham added. That person you think has the best life may be miserable when people aren't looking.\n\n6. I'll be happy when...\n\nTying your happiness to an achievement in the future ― such as losing 15 pounds, falling in love or getting a promotion ― is a dangerous game. Nicole Issa, a psychologist who serves clients in New York and Massachusetts, recommended changing your thinking pattern so you are not always willing your circumstances to change.\n\nInstead, think about what you imagine will be different when you move, lose weight, find love, etc., and how you will then be happy and try to cultivate some of those things right now, she said.\n\nIssa suggested reminding yourself that you can be happy right now if you try to work on these things through small changes, and that you will have a greater probability of getting where you want to be if you are happy. Take the first step by eating a healthy meal or signing yourself up for a dating app. Revel in those tiny steps, which can add up quickly.\n\n7. I shouldn't feel this way.\n\nJudging yourself for your emotions is like judging yourself for your body temperature. It's not in your control, said Tina Gilbertson, a Denver-based psychotherapist and the author of Constructive Wallowing: How to Beat Bad Feelings by Letting Yourself Have Them. It's common to believe we can choose our emotions, but if you think about it, that's nonsense. If we could choose our feelings, why wouldn't everyone be happy all the time?\n\nAbby Thompson, a licensed marriage and family therapist in California, agreed, adding that feelings can act as a barometer for what's going on inside of us.\n\nWe'd all feel a lot better if we let them happen, she said.\n\n8. This kind of thing always happens to me.\n\nToo often when a car cuts someone off, they end up in a line that isn't moving, their luggage gets lost, their flight is delayed, or they end up receiving an item that comes broken or destroyed, their first negative impulse is to say that this always happens to them. Really? Always? said Toni Coleman, a psychotherapist, relationship coach and divorce mediator in McLean, Virginia.\n\nColeman said this type of thinking should be banished because it paints an individual as a victim of unfair circumstances, which just reinforces a negative attitude about how the world treats them.\n\nWhen these types of thoughts arise, Coleman suggested stopping yourself mid-thought and substituting something like, Bummer, I will be a little late today but it's a fluke and no big deal in the grand scheme of things.\n\nJust substitute any positive ― humorous is better ― thought and move on, Coleman said.\n\n9. I wish I looked more like him or her.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images\n\nIt's easy to flip through a page of a magazine and covet the body of your favorite celebrity. But nothing about this practice is healthy or beneficial to your happiness, Thompson said.\n\nWhile exercise and eating nutritious foods is always a good idea, wishing our bodies looked dramatically different is often a way to procrastinate living our best lives, she said. If we decide to live fully now, no matter how much we weigh, how amazing would things be?\n\nIt's human nature to be hard on your physical appearance, but self-compassion can help.\n\nOur minds like to throw lots of thoughts at us all the time and many of them are pretty unhelpful, Thompson said. One way to respond is to acknowledge it and say to that thought 'Thanks, but I'm choosing to think about this differently this year.'\n\n10. I should have.\n\nI would like to send these little words to the moon in a spaceship and remove them from every person's vocabulary, said Jennifer Hunt, chair of pathology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and founder of a leadership development program for women called Unlocking the Authentic Self.\n\nShould have creates more toxicity than almost any other phrase, she said.\n\nAlmost anything that follows 'should have' reflects a disappointment, a missed opportunity, an unhealthy comparison between an ideal and reality, and constant glancing in the rearview mirror, Hunt said.\n\nHunt said these ought statements can become toxic and eat away at self-confidence.\n\n11. I'm such an idiot.\n\nSelf-deprecating thoughts can batter your self-esteem, self-worth and self-confidence, said Karen Donzaldson, a communication and body language expert and certified confidence coach in Toronto.\n\nOver time, you become your biggest critic, stop taking action, start making excuses when people speak to you the same way you speak to yourself, you stop sharing and you start to live like you're not enough, she said.\n\nTry replacing a self-deprecating thought with something more supportive. Donaldson suggested making a list of three things you do really well and three things you love about yourself.\n\nEvery time a self-deprecating thought shows up, replace it with one of [these] six things, she said.\n\n12. I'll try.\n\nEMS-FORSTER-PRODUCTIONS via Getty Images\n\nUsing the word try gives us a safety net to fail and does not communicate full commitment to ourselves or others, said Melissa Wolak, a holistic mindset and transformative coach and speaker in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThoughts and words are powerful and affect our actions and our energy when completing tasks or addressing challenges, Wolak said. Instead of using try, she suggested saying: I will do it, I will do my best, I can do this.\n\n13. If it's not perfect, it's not worth doing.\n\nIf you only do things you think you can do perfectly, you'll never get anything done, said Jude Treder-Wolff, a licensed clinical social worker and certified group psychotherapist in Smithtown, New York.\n\nTreder-Wolff said this type of thinking is harmful because it eliminates that essential learning phase of a new role or skill when we must be free to flail and flounder as we figure it out. Recognizing this thought as toxic is an important step, as is replacing it with new, healthy thoughts ― try: Everything worth doing requires the freedom to flail and flounder, Everything I put a good effort into will result in learning to do something better and better or Everything I put a good effort into changes my brain.\n\n14. I don't know how.\n\nThe secret to getting starting on a seemingly impossible task is to focus on what you do know how to do at the moment, take things one step at a time and learn as you go.\n\nWhen you're focused on trying to know steps 1 through 50, you get way ahead of yourself and this keeps you from making any progress at all, said Sumayya Essack, a mindset and life coach in Boston. Big goals like changing careers and starting businesses don't have paint-by-numbers formulas, so you can't actually know all the steps.\n\nIf you feel stuck, Essack suggested telling yourself: I'll figure out the next step and take it.
Looks like someone is going to tie a Just Married sign to the back of their classic car.\n\nTom Jackson, a beloved contestant from Netflix's Queer Eye revival, announced on Twitter Monday that he and his ex-wife Abby are going to give marriage another shot.\n\nIt's official, Abby and I are engaged.

Motherhood. The great world of pretenders. You want Golden Globes and Academy Awards - ask us overachieving mothers. The ones who try to do it all, make it all, and fix it all. Because that's what mothers do isn't it? We pretend. We hide. Or we fall apart; I don't know very many in between moms. And I'm one of those great pretenders. Or I use to be.\n\nI walked into 2017 with one resolution. To stop pretending. To stop looking like I had everything together. To fall apart more publicly and create space in my life for imperfection. To genuinely stop chasing this high of having it all together. Because this is me over here trying to show you how great I am. It's really about control - isn't everything? But before I acknowledge that; let me humbly share my home-made gluten free vegan muffin recipe that I make each night; or pictures of my home in which I'm organized and have Konmari-ed the shit out of every drawer. There's nothing wrong with any of those things; it's the motive behind it. What's driving us? Who sent us all this stupid memo with these expectations that slowing down is the devil's handiwork and that upping one another on how much we are doing is the new conversation piece at playgroup.\n\nSeriously. All we are is a bunch of tired mothers doing the best we can. That's it. That's what it boils down to. And we can't seem to figure out how to measure success in this crazy world of trying to have it together. The emotional climate of parenting we hate, yet continue creating. When is being ok good enough?\n\nMaya Angelou once said that Success is liking yourself. Liking what you do and how you do it. So, that's become my new mantra and measuring stick. I hold everything up against that (and invite you to do the same).\n\nAt some point we forgot about how it was ok to not be perfect. And began pretending we were. We don't hold our children to the same expectation or reality; because that would be insane. And not attainable. Yet here I am trying to control how I look and come across on facebook and instagram. Because that's the root of it all. If we can control enough. Pretend enough. And be perfect enough; we won't have to face reality. The reality that control is an abstract promise that isn't ever going to come through. We can push and pull certain ropes in this puppet show of parenting and of life; but we really have very little control of the outcome.\n\nHere is the real kicker: we all know we are full of shit. Yet we go along with the fake smiles and stories because we are all playing the same game with the same pieces. No one wants to be the one to shout uncle first.\n\nSo, I'm out. I'm done. I could hair flip and gracefully lay down my super mom cape, but then I would be pretending again. And full of it. I promised myself I would stop. My house gets messy. I yell at my kids. My marriage isn't perfect. I am often terribly insensitive. I over analyze my body. I use boxed mixes when baking 50% of the time. Ok 75%. I hire house cleaners and then pretend I do it all. And more. So much more BS I can't see straight.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Wednesday lamented about what his show's chyron described as men in decline. During one segment, he claimed there was more drug and alcohol abuse and higher incarceration rates in areas where women earn more money than their male counterparts.\n\nCarlson — whose show lost sponsors in December after he said immigrants make America dirtier ― proclaimed all that remained in many places following the decline of manufacturing and male-dominated industry were the schools and hospitals that traditionally employ women, which meant that in many areas, women suddenly made more than men.\n\nBut rather than applaud it as a victory for feminism, Carlson asked viewers to consider some of the effects. He then cited unnamed studies that claimed women generally don't want to marry men who earn less than them.\n\nOver big populations this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow. More drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation, he added in the clip shared online by Media Matters:\n\nCarlson's comments sparked ire on Twitter:\n\n@JennyCraig Please cease advertising on the Tucker Carlson show. He continues to advocate for outmoded ideas that are used to repress women.Throughout history,women have fought and struggled for the right to vote, to be paid equal wages and not be victimized. — joan 🌹 (@jbinnie7) January 3, 2019\n\nYea @TuckerCarlson the real problem with society is empowered women. https://t.co/NZIke6GVWK — Sherron Meinert (@sherron_meinert) January 3, 2019\n\nTucker Carlson is a misogynist afraid of economically secure women who can't be dominated by cash https://t.co/3JIjzudNQS — Scott D AKA CaptainCanuk (@kelownascott) January 3, 2019\n\nHoly blazing shitballs. I have heard it all. They don't want to listen to scientists on global warming...but by God, those women making more money than a man is a disaster to society 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️ I can't with these people anymore...@TuckerCarlson kick rocks, you misogynistic windbag. https://t.co/I3dm8tS18h — S (@StephanieSaxto2) January 3, 2019\n\nHere's a clip of deplorable @TuckerCarlson talking about how women becoming successful is bad for society. pic.twitter.com/8kDnpzXYMZ — The Resistance (@NightlyPolitics) January 3, 2019
This proposal is fit for a couple of dinosaurs lovers.\n\nChelsea Pearson of Spokane, Washington wore a T. Rex costume to a local restaurant last week to ask Andrew Dunlap, her boyfriend of two years, for his claw, er, hand in marriage.\n\nSomeone once told me: 'Never be ordinary, Be different. You only get one life so make the most of it,' Pearson told The Huffington Post.\n\nDunlap, 27, said yes, and then attempted to hug her in the inflatable outfit.\n\nStoryful\n\nThe two have known each other for 11 years are raising a 7-year-old and a two-month-old together.\n\nWe both love dinosaurs and we have two boys, Pearson said. I wanted the boys to be able to have a story they will remember forever.\n\nThe costume didn't make the proposal any less nerve-racking, though.\n\nI was so nervous, I almost cried, she said. It was hot in the costume and there were so many people there I forgot what to say.\n\nPearson said her 7-year-old was very impressed.\n\nHe still likes to watch [the video] before bed, she said. My two-month old? He doesn't really care right now.\n\nPearson and Dunlap, who are planning to wed in July 2018, hope to include the dinosaur outfit in the ceremony.\n\nI also want to have my boys in dinosaur costumes, she said.\n\nT.Rex costumes have been garnering a lot of viral attention as of late.
Really American's video received more than a half-million views in its first eight hours on Twitter.\n\nThe PAC, which describes itself on YouTube as a group of passionate Americans who want to ensure the United States remains an inclusive and welcoming country for generations to come, released multiple viral spots attacking Trump before the 2020 election.\n\nSince Biden's victory, the group has pivoted to attacking Trump's enablers and allies in Congress and elsewhere.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, facing a growing recall campaign, got his first major GOP challenger on Tuesday: former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer.\n\nFaulconer, a Donald Trump supporter who finished two terms as mayor last year, announced his plans to run in the 2022 election but will run earlier if the current effort to recall Newsom takes off and lands on the next ballot.\n\nThe ex-mayor kicked off his announcement with an appeal to voters who are upset with Newsom's closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNo science behind it. It needs to be based on science, Faulconer said, referring to outdoor dining and playground closures in recent months, which have since been lifted across the state.\n\nLike each of you, my family knows what it's like to have our lives turned upside down, he said. My wife's business was devastated by the pandemic.\n\nFaulconer spent much of his announcement expressing his outrage that California's public schools were still closed to in-person learning while private ones have been allowed to open, blaming Newsom for the decision. But the issue is more complicated than that. Public school closures have been largely driven by teachers unions, which don't want their members to return until everyone has been vaccinated. Newsom has said that benchmark might not be realistic.\n\nNewsom's chief strategist, Dan Newman, dismissed Faulconer as an opportunist.\n\nTrying to exploit a global pandemic to advance a political career exposes his craven ambition, as does making the same 'I'm running!' announcement at the start of each month, waiting in vain for people to pay attention, he said, referring to hints Faulconer has made in recent months about his plans to run.\n\nNewman also knocked Faulconer for the high rate of coronavirus cases in San Diego.\n\nWhile Faulconer and other Trump supporters like John Cox and Michael Cernovich compete in the Republican primary, Newman said of others planning to run against Newsom, we'll stay focused on distributing the vaccine and providing relief and recovery to families and small businesses harmed by the virus.\n\nFaulconer has painted himself as a centrist, saying Tuesday that someone outside the Democratic Party needed to step up. Our problem isn't with our people, he said. Our problem is with our government, with one-party rule that is out of touch with reality.\n\nFaulconer has left-leaning viewpoints on many key issues in the state. He supports marriage equality, believes in human-caused climate change and supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But his comments on those issues may ring empty to voters when they find out he voted for Trump in November, saying that he thought Trump was going to be the best for the economy.\n\nFaulconer and other challengers with their eyes set on a recall election have the benefit of a California electorate that's increasingly critical of Newsom. He's now contending with voters who are angry about business shutdowns, voters who are angry about the recent reopenings amid high case counts and voters from both of those groups who are angry about the stalled COVID-19 vaccine rollout. His legacy also continues to be haunted by an ill-fated trip he took to the French Laundry restaurant late last year when coronavirus cases were increasing.\n\nThere's been a big shift in public sentiment from last year when large majorities approved of the job Newsom was doing, a University of California, Berkeley, poll revealed Tuesday. Currently, the poll found, fewer than half of voters initially say they would vote to endorse Newsom if a recall election is held later this year.\n\nThe campaign to recall Newsom says it has collected 1.3 million signatures so far. It has until mid-March to hit 1.5 million, the required threshold to qualify the proposal for the ballot.
1 / 20 It's not just about the 'American Dream'\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that most Latin American migrants who come to the United States are looking for a better life, inspired by the American Dream. And it's hard to deny that there's a lot of truth in that. <br> <br> But there's another side to the story. People leave Latin America because life there can be very hard. Poverty, political instability and recurring financial crises often conspire to make Latin American life more challenging than in the U.S., a wealthy country with lots of job opportunities. <br> <br> Living on the northern side of the U.S.-Mexico border, it's easy to view Latin America as another world, isolated from the United States. But the truth is that the U.S. government has historically made life in Latin America harder by overthrowing democratically elected governments, financing atrocities and pushing trade policies that undermine Latin American industries, dealing blows to local economies. Perhaps instead of building walls, the United States should focus on being a better neighbor. <br> <br> <strong>Here are 19 ways the U.S. government has helped spur immigration by making life harder in Latin America.</strong>\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS

Over You singer Miranda Lambert has moved on with a new husband.\n\nThe country star on Saturday revealed that she secretly married Brendan McLoughlin.\n\nI met the love of my life, she wrote in the Instagram post.

Businessmen at a Strip Club\n\nBy Alex Alexander\n\nI was working the day-shift as a dancer in a very high-class gentlemen's club downtown. The daytime girls were different than the nighttime girls; we weren't there for the drunken buddies, bikers or creepy wandering perverts.\n\nWe were the girls next door, America's sweethearts -- classy and sassy but well-behaved. All sorts of men came through the door during the day. There were locals, lobbyists, politicians, attorneys, out-of-towners, and businessmen who wrote off strip-clubs as a business expense.\n\nOne Friday shift, a group of about twenty men came in and asked a few of us to work a bachelor party later that night.\n\nThe guys were absolute sweethearts, total gentlemen and great fun. I knew I'd be safe and could work with dignity and not be expected to do any more than show up and stand on a table while putting on my show.\n\nOne of the men in the bachelor party turned out to be absolutely charming and we got to know each other very well. I asked him about his marriage and he told me he was on his second. He said wasn't sure if marrying the second time was a good idea but his wife had given him an ultimatum.\n\nHe had hoped getting married would would make their problems go away, but four years later, that hadn't proved to be true and they were in the midst of a divorce.\n\nI had a crush on him immediately.\n\nEvery time he came in, I tried to find an excuse to spend time with him but he was completely oblivious. I found it hilarious that he could be so obtuse and the fellow strippers and I plotted behind his back, trying to find ways to get him alone with me.\n\nI finally managed to successfully trap him in the guest bathroom right after midnight when the music and moonlight had done their work. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nI stayed at the club for almost another year while we were dating before I quit the profession entirely. His friends, who still frequented the club a few times a week, couldn't have been more gracious and charming about it; after all, I was still their favorite stripper! (Plus, my future husband wasn't a man you'd want to get into a bar brawl with, so they never said a rude or unkind word to me.)\n\nWe made it to all the way to the altar with dignity, good wishes and grace and I'm proud to say that I've been his wife for the last thirty years and we share five wonderful children together.\n\nAnd someday, who knows, we just might tell them how we met.\n\nThis article originally appeared on YourTango.\n\nMore from YourTango:\n\nAlso on HuffPost:

A few days before alleged gunman Robert Bowers murdered 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue last October, he promoted a post by a well-known racist user of Gab, a social media platform that caters to white supremacists. The user had a Pepe frog avatar and a distinctly offensive moniker — Grandpa Lampshade, a reference to an apocryphal story about a Nazi woman who made lampshades from the skin of Holocaust victims.\n\nOn Gab, where Bowers appears to have been radicalized, Grandpa Lampshade has published thousands of messages designed to stoke hatred of Jews. Like the one Bowers reposted:\n\nGab\n\nBut there were many posts that were worse. Many that might inspire a person to scream All Jews must die! before shooting up a synagogue because he'd bought into alt-right propaganda falsely claiming that Jews had orchestrated a migrant caravan heading toward the United States. Messages like this:\n\nGab\n\nAnd this:\n\nGab\n\nBut Grandpa Lampshade's efforts to spread hate weren't limited to Gab and didn't stop at anti-Semitism. During his weekly Thoughts of the Day podcast on Radio Aryan, which he said reached thousands of listeners, he ranted about the hordes of black and brown invaders he claimed were displacing white people.\n\nHe often made it sound like violence was the only appropriate response.\n\nOn one podcast a few weeks before the Pittsburgh shooting, Grandpa Lampshade said that whites are not gonna outbreed all of these blacks and browns and that the answer might involve a whole lotta killin'. After the Oct. 27, 2018, massacre, he suggested that murdering 11 random Jews in a synagogue might not be the best approach, because of the scrutiny it attracted to the white supremacist movement and its chosen propaganda platforms. Better, he said, for the killin' to focus on strategic targets.\n\nThere was a twang to his voice and some grizzle in his chosen handle — they were clues to his identity. Grandpa Lampshade fretted about being exposed, but he'd been sloppy in covering his tracks. He used the name oilylizzard in one email address to collect donations and in another email linked to his real name. His wife advertised his now-defunct Grandpa Lampshade Twitter account in memes she'd posted years ago.\n\nAnd people were looking for him. His rapid rise to prominence in the white nationalist community had brought him to the attention of anti-fascist activists. Watchdog groups and journalists were looking for him, too. Grandpa Lampshade had gone big-time. The podcast had played on the Daily Stormer, the internet's main hub for neo-Nazi content, from where he solicited bitcoin donations. (He has raised and spent almost $7,000 in bitcoin, according to information security researcher John Bambenek, who tracks neo-Nazi bitcoin transactions.)\n\nGrandpa Lampshade also forged connections with prominent white supremacists such as Andrew Anglin, Christopher The Crying Nazi Cantwell, Robert Azzmador Ray and David Duke — just a few of the extremists who helped organize or participated in the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade was, undoubtedly, a problem. In a bygone era, he might have donned a hood and burned a cross in a remote field. But he likely would have been little more than a local malignancy. In the social media age, however, he could reach through his keyboard and contact the world. The neo-Nazi next door could be your neighbor. Your own kid could be listening to Grandpa Lampshade. And the anonymity of the internet allowed him to operate without hindrance or consequence.\n\nUntil now.\n\nBehind the Pepe mask and the Nazi pseudonym is a very average 51-year-old who represents how commonplace racism is in America. He lives about an hour outside Fort Worth, Texas, in a small town called Granbury. He works at an auto parts store. He likes motorcycles. He used to chew Red Man tobacco. He got married. He had a son. He got divorced. He remarried in blue jeans. He supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nMeet Daniel Kenneth Jeffreys:\n\nInstagram\n\nJeffreys is an unremarkable man who has attained a position of influence thanks simply to an internet connection and an appetite for hate. He is the aggrieved white Everyman, a middle-aged schlub exalted and radicalized through social media at a time when the president has seemingly given every racist in America the feels.\n\nHe once worked as a youth activities supervisor at the now-shuttered Texas Youth Commission, the state's notorious juvenile corrections agency. (In 2007, long after Jeffreys had left his job, local media revealed that hundreds of troubled kids had been abused by agency employees. There is no evidence that Jeffreys was involved in the abuse.)\n\nHis journey to extremism does have an atypical arc. Unlike most of his alt-right fellow travelers, Jeffreys doesn't appear to have fully radicalized until later in life, when he was exposed to online propaganda created by millennial neo-Nazis. (Bowers, another Gen-Xer, also appears to have been radicalized later in life.)\n\nWe are not publishing Jeffreys' address or contact information — we are not doxing him. We are exposing him. Left untreated, the racism he represents festers and metastasizes. And he is not a passive racist. He is a preacher of hate with a national reach — and as an undercover propagandist, he was a hidden threat within his own community.\n\nFrom Yahoo Comments To The Daily Stormer\n\nJeffreys has been fascinated with Nazi Germany since he was a kid, he told listeners of his podcast in March 2016. He liked seeing people who looked like him accomplishing these great things, he said. Jeffreys grew up mirroring the conservative politics of his parents, who supported Ronald Reagan. He eventually ditched the Republican Party out of loyalty to Pat Buchanan, a Holocaust-denying commentator — and a source of inspiration for members of the alt-right — who twice failed to secure the GOP presidential nomination. Jeffreys then dabbled in the conspiratorial libertarianism of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, another mainstream politician who has served as a conduit to white nationalism.\n\nIn 1991, when Jeffreys was 24, he started working at the Texas Youth Commission. He would mention the job years later in an episode of his show with Anglin as part of his argument that American blacks are really like spoiled children. Jeffreys falsely claimed on the show that a huge majority of the inmate population were blacks. Jeffreys resigned voluntarily in 1996, according to Brian Sweany, a spokesman at the agency that replaced the Youth Commission.\n\nBy then, Jeffreys had married his first wife. Years later, that marriage ended in divorce. In 2003, Jeffreys got a job at an auto parts store, according to bankruptcy filings. The following year, he remarried. His wedding photos, which his mother-in-law posted to Facebook, show Jeffreys in jeans, with a handlebar mustache.\n\nFacebook\n\nJeffreys' new wife shared his enthusiasm for automobiles as well as his racist tendencies. She posted offensive content on Twitter under an account named Gothmamba, which public records indicate is registered to her.\n\nTwitter\n\nMoney was in short supply for the couple. They filed for bankruptcy the year after they married. Dan Jeffreys listed a shotgun, a pistol and two rifles as assets. He was nearly $130,000 in debt and earned about $2,100 a month, according to bankruptcy records.\n\nJeffreys eventually worked his way up to manager at another auto parts store in a nearby town. It was, as he'd later say on a Grandpa Lampshade podcast, a normie job where he interacted every day with different people, including Mexicans and niggers. His wife opened an auto body paint shop specializing in Custom painting, Flames Etc. She posted hundreds of pictures of her bright orange muscle car on Instagram. Her business's Twitter account follows Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.\n\nJeffreys might have carried on in this vein forever, the down-home racist slinging crankshafts and crackpot ideas, a bigot indistinguishable from any other in the area. But one day while clicking through the comments on a Yahoo news story, he spotted another reader's recommendation to check out a website called the Daily Stormer. So he did.\n\nThe troll-y online gathering place for today's millennial neo-Nazi movement, the Daily Stormer has featured numerous posts calling for the genocide of Jews. A few years ago, it surpassed Stormfront — an older white nationalist message board that Jeffreys has said didn't grab him — as the leading hate site on the internet. The Daily Stormer's founder and editor, Andrew Anglin, has perfected a humorous meme-laden style of blogging that makes the lies and hate he pushes appealing to a younger audience already steeped in internet culture. But the Daily Stormer, which has also celebrated violence against minorities, journalists and women, appeals to older racists, too. Jeffreys, a middle-aged, working-class Texan, thought the site was funny and kept coming back.\n\nEventually, his Daily Stormer-inspired self-indoctrination led him to The Greatest Story Never Told, a six-hour-long revisionist film from 2013 about Adolf Hitler. Jeffreys was blown away by the film.\n\nThe light then completely shone on me, he said.\n\nJeffreys went on to read Mein Kampf and started hanging out in Daily Stormer chat rooms, where Anglin's readers plan real-world gatherings and in-person activism through his Daily Stormer Book Club network — from attending far-right rallies to posting neo-Nazi flyers in cities around the country. On the Daily Stormer, Jeffreys befriended Sven Longshanks aka Steve Stone. Stone is a British Hitler fanatic and host at Radio Aryan, a white nationalist online radio network that is based in the United Kingdom and broadcasts from a secret location. British government regulators have been unable to police the neo-Nazi network because it transmits over the internet. Jeffreys pressed Stone to let him record his own show on the network; eventually, Stone agreed.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade's Thoughts of the Day podcast debuted in February 2016. Jeffreys launched his Semitic Truth Center blog shortly afterward. Within months, he had become an influential neo-Nazi propagandist.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade Finds His Fans\n\nSome of the best-known members of the white supremacist community were soon talking with Jeffreys. He recorded shows with Duke, the former KKK grand wizard; Robert Azzmador Ray, an Anglin associate and longtime racist from east Texas who yelled, Death to the enemies of the white race! hours after the Charlottesville rally; Gabriel Sohier Chaput, a Canadian neo-Nazi recruiter who goes by Zeiger; Chris Cantwell, who cried over an arrest warrant and then pleaded guilty to assaulting counterprotesters at Charlottesville — and even Anglin himself.\n\nYours is one of my favorite podcasts. I'd say it's in the top three, Anglin told Jeffreys in June 2016 when he appeared as a guest on Jeffreys' show.\n\nJeffreys' message is virtually indistinguishable from the conspiratorial ravings of his colleagues: White people, he claims, are the victims of a world order controlled by the Jews, who are actively replacing white Americans with black and brown invaders. This is the central and most hackneyed of white supremacist conspiracy theories, one that gives aggrieved race warriors an eternal enemy to rail against and blame for their own shortcomings. Jeffreys faults Jewish people for everything from Communism to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nWe're being served now with a cake that's been poisoned. Cake with ingredients such as feminism, this racial demographic, multicultural time bomb, Jeffreys said on his show last October. All of these ingredients have been baked into this cake. And the baker is a hook-nosed rat Jew.\n\nWhat sets Jeffreys apart from his fellow neo-Nazi podcasters is his oddly pleasant demeanor. Unlike the jabbering Cantwell, who has the on-air presence of Archie Bunker on meth, Jeffreys delivers his sales pitch with a sing-song Southern drawl that belies the inherent violence of his worldview. He prefaces Holocaust-denying rants with a perfunctory My gosh!\n\nUnlike most of his alt-right colleagues, Jeffreys also brings an authentic working-class Christian flavor to his racism. He has a recurring segment on his podcast that he calls The Church of the Lampshade, in which he preaches about the devil being the father of Jews. He is the traditionalist so many white nationalists aspire and fail to be, a family man who likes to talk about how he lovingly imparts his racist views to his son — just like Jeffreys' father once did with him.\n\nI mean, the best thing I can say is, you know, just make 'em as Jew-wise as you can. Best safety advice you can give 'em boils down to 'when around blacks, never relax,' Jeffreys once said of his conversations with his son. My dad has said, you know, he doesn't believe blacks are a separate race, he believes they're a separate species — and the older I get, the more I realize that, you know, he was closer to the truth than any college professor, he continued.\n\nThroughout these last few years of hate-mongering screeds, Jeffreys has made a deliberate effort to stop just shy of instructing his fans to commit violence against enemies of the white race. It's not that he's a peace-loving hipp[y], he said — he just doesn't want to get kicked offline and end up in prison for endorsing bloodshed too explicitly.\n\nJust look at the amount of effort our enemies go through to try and choke out the Daily Stormer through limiting fundraising ability, he said in January 2017. What do you think would happen if we gave them the opportunity to declare us all as being a part of some sort of terrorist organization or something? At the very least, we would not have our platforms anymore ― and at the worst, we would all be bunking up in a federal prison somewhere.\n\nBut some Grandpa Lampshade fans don't think like that. The Pittsburgh shooter, at least, was willing to act on the violent ideology Jeffreys promoted.\n\nGab\n\nJeffreys didn't feel bad for the 11 people killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue, he said on his show a week after the attack. But he was upset about the backlash. Internet service providers abandoned Gab, forcing it to go offline temporarily. Wordpress took down Jeffreys' blog after a commenter posted a battle plan on the site: Shooting of Jews every week ― until normies start to wonder why people hate Jews so much and start doing their research.\n\nWordpress Archive\n\nJeffreys implored his listeners to be more strategic in choosing which Jews to murder. He knew some of his listeners were half a step away from being the next Bowers, he said, but he wanted them to make sure their attack would be worth it.\n\nNow if you're gonna get the death penalty and your grievance is that the Jews are doing all of these things and you're willing to take action that is going to result in the death penalty … if you're gonna do this, why are you gonna go kill some random Jews when you have these high-profile Jews? he asked.\n\nThis is hardly a disavowal of the violence that is foundational to white nationalism. It is, rather, a horrific suggestion from Jeffreys that targeted killings might be a more effective way to spark the white ethnostate Nazis dream of. A far safer way to feed the white nationalist movement, as Jeffreys knows, is to maintain a footprint on the platforms that give him and other neo-Nazis such far-flung reach. Platforms like Gab or Radio Aryan or the Daily Stormer. Or Twitter. Platforms that can turn a racist nobody hawking auto parts into a somebody selling hate around the world.\n\nLast week, HuffPost called the auto parts store where Jeffreys works and asked to speak with him. Whoever answered the phone hung up quickly. Hours later, Grandpa Lampshade announced that he was quitting his Radio Aryan show. He told his listeners that he wanted to spend more time with his family living the 14 words.\n\nBut it was clear that Jeffreys knew people were onto him. He was on guard.\n\nUnder The Mask, The Everyman Racist\n\nGranbury is an ordinary town of about 8,000 people southwest of Fort Worth. Cows and llamas graze in nearby pastures. The downtown is centered around a courthouse, surrounded by a few restaurants. Fox News plays in the lobby of the Holiday Inn. Though Granbury was named for a Confederate general, it was hard to imagine a neo-Nazi cranking out propaganda for a national audience from this bland little burg.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jeffreys was at his job at the auto parts store several miles up the highway, his wife's bright orange muscle car parked outside. When HuffPost reporters approached him to confirm his identity and ask about his racist alter ego, he agreed to talk outside on the store's front steps. He was visibly nervous.\n\nWho's doxing me? he asked, holding a paint can and using the far-right's preferred term for any journalism that exposes extremists.\n\nHe was worried about anti-fascist activists in the area and claimed he had received death threats. He didn't want to lose his job. He said he'd ended his show and wanted to be left alone to take care of his family. He claimed that he'd never called for violence on the podcast — but he had, several times.\n\nI mean we may have some killin' involved, but maybe not a whole lotta killin', he said on his podcast in October, weeks before the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.\n\nWhen asked about the podcast episode after that massacre, the one where he questioned the purpose of killing random Jews instead of high-profile Jews, Jeffreys said that people bent on violence can't be swayed with appeals to morality. Better, he said, to talk strategy.\n\nI'm not responsible for crazy people doing crazy shit, he said.\n\nAfter speaking with HuffPost, Jeffreys took old episodes of his show offline. But he is still responsible for promoting an ideology in which violence against Jewish and non-white people is not only justified but ultimately required.\n\nLike most alt-right podcasters, Grandpa Lampshade spoke with a swaggering confidence about racially transforming the country. Social media had made him important. Made him a leader. Anonymity made him unaccountable. There was no telling how many angry white men he'd helped push further down the path to extremism. Grandpa Lampshade mattered. He had influence.\n\nBut Dan Jeffreys is just Dan Jeffreys. And he is anonymous no longer.
Linda Brown, the young girl at the center of the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case, died on Monday at the age of 76.\n\nBrown's sister, Cheryl Brown Henderson, confirmed the death to the Topeka-Capital Journal. Peaceful Rest Funeral Chapel of Topeka independently confirmed Brown's death with HuffPost.\n\nSixty-four years ago a young girl from Topeka brought a case that ended segregation in public schools in America, Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer tweeted Monday. Linda Brown's life reminds us that sometimes the most unlikely people can have an incredible impact and that by serving our community we can truly change the world.\n\nCarl Iwasaki via Getty Images The children involved in the landmark civil rights suit Brown v. Board of Education: Vicki Henderson, Donald Henderson, Linda Brown, James Emanuel, Nancy Todd and Katherine Carper.\n\nIt was Brown's father, Rev. Oliver Brown, who sued the Topeka school board to allow his daughter the right to attend an all-white school in the Kansas capital city. Four other school segregation cases were combined with Brown's to be heard by the Supreme Court, but the justices' unanimous ruling was named for Brown.\n\nBrown, who was also known as Linda Carol Thompson after her marriage in the mid 1990s, was forced to attend an all-black school far away from her home even though an all-white school was only blocks away.\n\nCarl Iwasaki via Getty Images Linda Brown (left) with her parents, Leola and Oliver, and little sister Terry Lynn in front of their house in Topeka, Kansas, in 1954.\n\nBrown told MSNBC in 2014 that she remembered the embarrassment of being separated from her neighborhood friends and the long walk to the bus stop.\n\nI remember a couple of times turning around and going back home because I — you know, it was a small town, she said. I got really, really cold and would get home and be crying. And mother would, you know, she would try to warm me up and tell me it would be all right and everything.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of Brown. In its decision, the court overturned the 1896 separate but equal ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson, marking the case as one of the biggest legal victories of the civil rights era. It was due to Brown v. Board of Education that the federal government could force states to integrate schools, allowing children of color the opportunity for an equal education to white children.\n\nBrown credited her father and the other families who took their cases to court for removing the stigma of not having a choice during a 1985 interview for the PBS documentary series Eyes on the Prize.\n\nI feel that after 30 years, looking back on Brown v. The Board of Education, it has made an impact in all facets of life for minorities throughout the land, Brown said during the interview. I really think of it in terms of what it has done for our young people, in taking away that feeling of second class citizenship. I think it has made the dreams, hopes and aspirations of our young people greater, today.\n\nEven with the decision, it took years of protest and legal battles before segregation would end. Only three years after the Brown case, nine black students had to be escorted by federal guards in order to safely attend the previously all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill , president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, called Brown heroic for her role in helping to end ultimate symbol of white supremacy.\n\nThe life of every American has been touched by Linda Brown, Ifill said in a statement released to HuffPost. This country is indebted to her, the Brown family, and the many other families involved in the cases that successfully challenged school segregation.\n\nNew York Post Archives via Getty Images Linda Brown (center left) in 1984.
PHILIP FONG via Getty Images As a transgender pastor of a Hong Kong church that welcomes everyone, Marrz Balaoro wants to conduct religious marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A transgender pastor has vowed to officiate same-sex marriages in Hong Kong despite a legal challenge failing to provide assurances that he will not face arrest.\n\nMarrz Balaoro was arrested in 2017 for holding ceremonies in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Straight (LGBTS) Christian Church which he founded in the global financial hub in 2014. Charges were eventually dropped.\n\nThe 62-year-old Filipino domestic helper, who moved to Hong Kong in 1981 and began living as a boy aged 12, filed a judicial review case with the High Court in May last year hoping to win the right to marry same-sex couples.\n\nIn its ruling earlier this month, the High Court rejected his application based on the right to freedom of worship, ruling it did not have the power to free him from the threat of prosecution but added that Balaoro had done nothing illegal.\n\nI can still do (same-sex marriages) and I will continue to do so, Balaoro told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding he had one ceremony planned for the first two weeks of April.\n\nThe court said that I did nothing wrong or illegal - that is my assurance that I won't get arrested, Balaoro added.\n\nBefore his court challenge, Balaoro had conducted same-sex weddings in secret to avoid being arrested in Hong Kong which decriminalized homosexuality in 1991.\n\nPHILIP FONG via Getty Images Prior to his court challenge, Balaoro had conducted same-sex weddings in secret to avoid being arrested in Hong Kong.\n\nThe legal bid was the latest in a series of challenges to laws that discriminate against LGBT+ people in the former British colony which last year upheld a ban on same-sex civil partnerships despite having a lively gay scene and Pride parade.\n\nA victory in court would have allowed Balaoro to conduct same-sex marriages but they would not have had legal weight.\n\nOther challenges, however, have resulted in gradual progress for LGBT+ people, including the right to obtain visas for dependents and spousal benefits for same-sex partners.\n\nEarlier this month, a Hong Kong court ruled that married same-sex couples have the right to apply for public housing.\n\nBalaoro said he and his lawyers decided against an appeal but he would now discuss with his church group whether to link up with other LGBT+ activists to lobby lawmakers into bringing about same-sex marriage changes through the legislature.\n\nI would love to express my willingness to help other local groups - so we can do lobbying together - but I'm not sure how soon that will happen, he said.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; Editing by Belinda Goldsmith Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.

Petri Oeschger via Getty Images To avoid divorce later on, don't wear blinders while dating.\n\nHere's a little-known secret: Divorce attorneys give surprisingly good dating advice, not just legal advice.\n\nWe recently asked divorce lawyers around the country to share the big red flags they think singles should be aware of when dating. Of course, no one is perfect ― there's a good chance people you date will tick one or two of these boxes. If they check most of them, though, proceed with caution.\n\n1. They're talking marriage or the next big step.\n\nChris Pratt revealed in a 2009 interview that he knew soon after meeting his now-ex-wife Anna Faris that he 'wanted to marry her pretty soon' after he met her. 'It took a while for me to admit it, because it would be crazy to be like, I want to marry you' the first day I met her. But I could have!' Turns out, that kind of certainty doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship is built to last. It may be an indicator, instead, that this person feels familiar, like old patterns, old obsessions and old problems. If you want someone who brings out the best in you, that might not be the person who fits like an old glove. It might be healthier in the beginning of a relationship to feel uncertain and tenuous about the new person in your life. ― Liat Sadler, a specialist in family law in San Francisco\n\n2. Claims in their dating profiles are exaggerated.\n\nBe wary if your date's online dating profiles turn out to be mostly fiction. It's not unusual for people to pump up their dating profiles a little bit in order to make themselves look good. But when you find out that a person's profile is so exaggerated that it borders on being made up — run! If someone isn't honest with you right from the beginning, they're not going to be honest with you ever. ― Karen Covy, an attorney and divorce coach based in Chicago\n\n3. They paint themselves as the victim of all of their past relationships.\n\nIf your date describes every single one of their exes as 'crazy,' it's a sign that they cannot take responsibility for their role in relationships. It's a strong red flag that they won't own their share of a relationship with you. Relationships take investment from both people. Someone who refuses to own their mistakes is not likely to fully invest, and you may end up being the one trying to make the relationship work. ― Morghan Richardson, a divorce attorney in New York City\n\n4. There's no physical spark.\n\nIn the beginning of a relationship, the sex or physical connection doesn't have to be mind-blowing to indicate that the relationship has staying power. There's often awkward fumbling as you and the other person get to know one another. But if there is no sense of excitement at the beginning regarding getting to know one another intimately, there won't be any excitement later. That might be fine if neither person requires sexual intimacy as part of a successful relationship. Some people stay in these relationships because they enjoyed the other person's companionship and their friendship. A relationship with uninspiring intimacy may bring beautiful children into the world, and it may end on amicable terms because the friendship was always the strongest part of the relationship. But for many couples, the lack of sexual intimacy may lead one person to eventually seek it elsewhere, and that can spell the end of the marriage. ― Sadler\n\n5. They've been divorced multiple times.\n\nWe have a saying, 'Sometimes it's not the ex, it's you that's the problem.' Unfortunately, we see repeat customers. Those who frequently marry are often quick to commit and quick to leave. For some, being married, just being married, makes them feel like they fit in. ― Randall Kessler, a divorce attorney in Atlanta\n\n6. They hint that their financial life is a mess.\n\nWatch out if your date sends you mixed messages about their financial stability. Maybe he likes to treat you to dinners or gifts, but then his electricity gets shut off. Or she's constantly waiting for that one financial break that will get her 'all caught up' on her bad financial decisions. How does this play out once you have a family? How will you feel shouldering the financial burden of a marriage, especially if you decide to have kids? One of my clients was constantly having to manipulate the family finances to cover for her ex-husband's overspending. The result was her trying to enforce limits on his spending, resentment building between them and a messy divorce over debt. ― Richardson\n\n7. They're technically married but separated.\n\nIt's an obvious red flag if they don't tell you they're married. Yes, this happens. It's also bad if they don't tell you until late into the date or even the second or third date. Then they explain that they're 'technically married but separated.' Well, that means they're married. It's bad news. At a minimum, they are having trouble concluding their divorce, which means either they or their spouse (or both) is angry or fighting or incapable of reaching agreement. At a maximum, they are lying about being separated. ― Kessler\n\n8. They drink. A lot.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with having a drink or two at dinner. But if you're dating someone who consistently has many drinks, especially many strong drinks, every time you see them, that's not necessarily a good sign. It doesn't matter that the person doesn't ever seem to get drunk. In the early stages of alcoholism, a person's tolerance goes up. If someone drinks a lot, the fact that they can 'hold their liquor' often means they're just well on their way to becoming an alcoholic. Be mindful of that drink count. ― Covy\n\n9. They want to spend every waking moment together.
It's a brand new year, which means we will all face brand new challenges. But before you decide to bury your head in defeat, here are five ways to win in 2016 from a Biblical perspective.\n\n1. Exercise Faith: What is faith? Faith is when you take God at His word. It is when you believe that you will receive those things which you have been praying for. What are you hoping to accomplish in 2016? Do you want to live a healthier lifestyle? Does your financial situation seem hopeless? The good news is, God can do exceedingly and abundantly more than you could ever ask or think. Whatever it is that you long for, big or small, it is going to take faith to receive it. You must be determined to walk by faith and not by sight. In Matthew 14, Peter, one of the twelve apostles, defied the laws of gravity and walked on water, for as long as his eyes were fixed on Jesus. I wonder what monumental feats you will be able to accomplish and overcome through faith in 2016. Remain steadfast. Make 2016, the year that you believe God to do the impossible.\n\n2. Fear Not: We are commanded numerous times in the Bible to fear not. In John 16:33, Jesus warns that trials and tribulations will come, but to be of good cheer. Why? Because He has overcome the world. We live in a fallen world, where it can be easy to give in to fear and panic. But do not be moved. Go ahead and start that new business venture. Give love another chance. Go back to school if that is what you desire. Do not allow the what ifs to hold you hostage. Live your best life in 2016, with no regrets. When challenging circumstances arise and try to paralyze you, stand on this promise from Isaiah 41:10: Fear not, for I am with you. Be not dismayed. For I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will help you, and I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. That means whatever you face in 2016, God will be there with you every step of the way. He will protect you, give you peace and will calm your heart in the midst of the storm.\n\n3. Fight On: Whether you realize it or not, you are a fighter and you were born to win. You are an overcomer and more than a conqueror. But being victorious is not going to be easy. You will need to fight. So ready yourselves for battle, now. Put your war clothes on and refuse to waive the white flag. Fight for your marriage, fight for your children, fight for that business, fight for everything that is valuable to you and keep fighting until the battle is won. But choose your battles wisely. Ask God for wisdom. Some battles you will win without saying a word. Allow God to fight for you. Do your part by praying, believing and standing on the word of God. Be still and trust that He is working behind the scenes on your behalf. It is through faith and patience, that you will receive the promises of God.\n\n4. Follow Jesus: It seems simple, but it really isn't. Following Jesus doesn't mean that you simply know Him. It means that you know him intimately. It means that your heart is in sync with His heart. It means that you obey Him, you trust Him, and that you allow Him to lead you, even when you do not understand the journey. You will never go wrong by following the One who will never lose His power, credibility or popularity. Allow Him to be your spiritual navigation system as you learn to discern His voice. Let His Word be a light unto your feet and a lamp unto your path. Do not worry about making unplanned or unexpected detours. God has a way of getting you back on His divine path. And when the road gets hard and lonely, He promises to never leave you or forsake you. When you feel too weary to continue the journey, let Him carry you. Trust in Him with all your heart, do not lean on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him and watch Him make your paths straight.\n\n5. Forgive Daily: We have all been hurt and betrayed at one time or another. In fact, as long as we are on this earth, there will always be an opportunity and need to forgive. Extending forgiveness is not easy, but it is necessary. It is a difficult and sometimes painful process. However, you must find room in your heart to forgive. No, that person does not deserve your forgiveness. Yes, they were wrong. But how much more do we deserve to be forgiven by our heavenly Father? Let us not forget that we are not perfect. We all have fallen short in the eyes of God. By refusing to forgive, we are unintentionally agreeing to keep ourselves enslaved to the past.\n\nForgiveness is not just for those who have trespassed against us. We must also be willing to extend an olive branch to ourselves for our own trespasses. Let 2016 be the year that you walk in total freedom from guilt, shame and blame. Stop reliving your mistakes. Stop replaying those memories. You cannot change the past. But you can live with it and learn from it. Forgive yourself. Let it go. Move on and make it part of your life story. God has forgiven you. He loves you. End of Story. Psalm 103 tells us that God is merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. Learn to love yourself enough to forgive and make it a daily occurrence in 2016.
VATICAN CITY (AP) — Retired Pope Benedict XVI has reignited debate about the wisdom of having a reigning and retired pope living side-by-side, reaffirming the necessity of priestly celibacy at the precise moment that Pope Francis is weighing whether to ordain married men to address the Catholic priest shortage.\n\nBenedict co-authored a bombshell book, From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church, along with his fellow conservative, Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah, who heads the Vatican's liturgy office and has been a quiet critic of Francis.\n\nThe French daily Le Figaro published excerpts of the book late Sunday; The Associated Press obtained galleys of the English edition, which is being published Feb. 20 by Ignatius Press.\n\nBenedict's intervention is extraordinary, given he had promised to remain hidden from the world when he retired in 2013, and pledged his obedience to the new pope. He has largely held to that pledge, though he penned an odd essay last year on the sexual abuse scandal that blamed the crisis on the sexual revolution of the 1960s.\n\nHis reaffirmation of priestly celibacy, however, gets to the heart of a fraught policy issue that Francis is expected to weigh in on in the coming weeks, and could well be considered a public attempt by the former pope to sway the thinking of the current one.\n\nThe implications for such an intervention are grave, given the current opposition to Francis by conservatives and traditionalists nostalgic for Benedict's orthodoxy, some of whom even consider his resignation illegitimate.\n\nIt is likely to fuel renewed anxiety about the wisdom of Benedict's decision to call himself emeritus pope, rather than merely a retired bishop, and the unprecedented situation he created by deciding to live in the Vatican gardens and wear the white cassock of the papacy.\n\nIn that light, it is significant that the English edition of the book lists the author as Benedict XVI, with no mention of his emeritus papal status on the cover.\n\nThe authors clearly anticipated the potential interpretation of their book as criticism of the current pope, and stressed in their joint introduction that they were penning it in a spirit of filial obedience, to Pope Francis. But they also said that the current crisis in the church required they not remain silent.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this photo taken on June 28, 2017, Pope Francis embraces Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, at the Vatican.\n\nFrancis has said he would write a document based on the outcome of the October 2019 synod of bishops on the Amazon. A majority of bishops at the meeting called for the ordination of married men to address the priest shortage in the Amazon, where the faithful can go months without having a Mass.\n\nFrancis has expressed sympathy with the Amazonian plight , though it is not clear how he would come down on the issue. While he has long reaffirmed the gift of a celibate priesthood in the Latin rite church, he has stressed that celibacy is a tradition, not doctrine, and therefore can change, and that there could be pastoral reasons to allow for a exception in a particular place.\n\nThe Catholic Church already has married priests in its eastern rites, and Benedict himself made it easier for Anglicans to convert to Catholicism — including married Anglican priests who are allowed to remain married. But he has long held that Latin, or Roman rite priests, must be celibate.\n\nBenedict addresses the issue head-on in his chapter in the brief book, explaining in scholarly and biblical terms what he says is the necessary foundation for the celibate priesthood that dates from the times of the apostles.\n\nThe priesthood of Jesus Christ causes us to enter into a life that consists of becoming one with him and renouncing all that belongs only to us, he writes. For priests, this is the foundation of the necessity of celibacy but also of liturgical prayer, meditation on the Word of God and the renunciation of material goods.\n\nMarriage, he writes, requires man to give himself totally to his family. Since serving the Lord likewise requires the total gift of a man, it does not seem possible to carry on the two vocations simultaneously. Thus, the ability to renounce marriage so as to place oneself totally at the Lord's disposition became a criterion for priestly ministry.\n\nThe jointly written introduction and conclusion of the book makes the case even stronger, acknowledging the crisis of the Catholic priesthood that it says has been wounded by the revelation of so many scandals, disconcerted by the constant questioning of their consecrated celibacy.\n\nDedicating the book to priests of the world, the two authors urge them to persevere, and for all faithful to hold firm and support them in their celibate ministry.\n\nIt is urgent and necessary for everyone — bishops, priests and lay people — to stop letting themselves be intimidated by the wrong-headed pleas, the theatrical productions, the diabolical lies and the fashionable errors that try to put down priestly celibacy, they write.\n\nIt is urgent and necessary for everyone — bishops, priests and lay people — to take a fresh look with the eyes of faith at the Church and at priestly celibacy which protects her mystery.\n\nThe book is being published at a moment of renewed interest in — and confusion about — the nature of the relationship between Francis and Benedict, thanks to the Netflix drama, The Two Popes.\n\nThe film, starring Anthony Hopkins as Benedict and Jonathan Pryce as Francis, imagines a days-long conversation between the two men before Benedict announced his historic resignation Feb. 11, 2013 — conversations in which their different views of the state of the church become apparent.\n\nThose meetings never happened, and the two men didn't know one another well before Francis was elected pope. But while the film takes artistic liberties for the sake of narrative, it gets the point across that Francis and Benedict indeed have very different ideas — which the new book bears out .\n\nCatholic social media was abuzz Monday after Benedict's bombshell, with Francis' supporters saying it showed the problems of having an emeritus pope seemingly undermining the current pope, and suggesting that Benedict — at age 92 and increasingly feeble — was being manipulated by his conservative entourage.\n\nThe book was published just a week after Benedict's frailty was on full display in a German documentary, which showed him barely able to speak above a whisper and his longtime secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, doing most of the talking.\n\nNot only there is no canon law concerning the situation created by an incapacitated pope, tweeted Villanova theolgian Massimo Faggioli. The Catholic Church evidently also needs a law concerning the situation created by an incapacitated 'pope emeritus' and his entourage.\n\nMark Brumley, the president of Ignatius Press, however, denounced such conspiracies and said Benedict isn't being used.\n\nWhy some folks choose to interpret the new book by Pope Emeritus Benedict and Cardinal Sarah in anti-Pope Francis ways speaks volumes, he tweeted. Let's pray for healing for the critics that they can rejoice in a new work from two great churchmen of our time, including a major theologian.
