try not to get too annoyed or frustrated with this person, even though it can be taxing to deal with, said jessica baum, a psychotherapist in palm beach, florida. remind yourself that the other person might have low self-esteem or that maybe they feel out of place and could be unaware of their behavior. patience is really important here.
the body image wrestle and win. while the age at which this occurs is different for all of us, there comes a time in every woman's life where she decides that she is going to love her body. i am lucky that this age for me came early on in my life. of course i have wrestled with certain things i don't like about my appearance, and things i wish i could change, as we all have. but i have been blessed with people in my life who encourage me in this area, most especially my husband. i think the wrestle ended before we even got married. what really drove it home was coming to the place where i knew that god created me this way, just how he wanted me to be, no more and no less. he wanted every detail about my appearance to be there. once i accepted this, i was awestruck by the truth of it. thinking of who wanted me to be this way, blew my mind. i can honestly say that i don't struggle with my body-image now. of course some days are better than others, and there are days in every woman's life where she feels average, plain, not pretty. but there is something about this stage of life that just makes us throw our hands up and say i'm done. we throw out all of the lies. we get tired of hearing that we're not perfect. so we take you're too____. and you're not____enough.

my gold charm is lovely to look at with its many lucky charms embedded into its circular disc. a four leaf clover, an elephant, a horseshoe, an evil eye, the arabic good luck sign, a heart and a number 13. i don't feel strongly about it but i figure, every bit of luck helps. i am very attached to a tiny gold chai (meaning long life in hebrew) hanging on the same connecter, a gift from my brother, scott, brought back from jerusalem. my good luck pieces feed my spirit. they do not bring me luck.
the duchess, 39, is suing associated newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over five february 2019 articles in the mail on sunday and on the mailonline website that published portions of a handwritten letter to her father, thomas markle, after her marriage to britain's prince harry in 2018.
this new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he continued.
the above leads me to the reason for the pregnancy test in the first place. i really had no idea how much my cycle would change after getting married. it was very difficult to adapt. i'm sure it has to do partly with getting older and into my upper twenties, but i know marriage plays a role as well. my cycles had been like clockwork since the very beginning. from age 12, i always knew exactly when to expect their arrival, and never once were they missed or late. i do not exaggerate when i say i never missed a period, even during my early twenties when i was constantly traveling, changing time zones, and alternating my sleep schedules from day-shift to night-shift and then back again. the thing was a rock that wouldn't budge. fast forward to my life as a new wife, and pair that with turning 26, and you get a recipe for disaster. well, not really disaster. maybe just extreme stress. several times during my first year of marriage, my period was late. not just a few days. late, as in 2 weeks, sometimes 3. what do you think this resulted in? me rushing out for pregnancy tests. oh my gosh, why is it so late? it's never late! i've got to be pregnant! nope, not pregnant. just late. this left me very frustrated. not only did this change occur, i also noticed changes with symptoms, intensity, and other variables.

when i brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. he questioned why i had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. for starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.
gabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.

that's because money also is a sort of emotional currency in relationships. it can be a vehicle for communicating certain messages that are not being put into words between two people. when misused, money can be a bid for power, control or punishment. spending can also be used as a stand-in for other unmet needs.

luckily, some work relationships work out great, edmonds said. i met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. you just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. pda or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.

don't come on too strong or corner the person, and ideally, approach them outside of work or in the communal area, marzolph said. try to keep your approach light; be ready to give the person an easy out if they're not interested, so you both can continue working together without tension.

money is a complicated beast in the therapy room, and in real life. it is a charged topic that is, for many, taboo, said joy lere, a psychologist with a practice focused on the merger of money and mindset. it is more than simple math … differences in money management and unspoken rules about how it is discussed (or not) can lead to significant friction or fracture in a relationship.
months have passed since that fateful reading and my parents have come around with their blessing and are now happily participating in our wedding planning. i thank my lucky stars that, despite some serious moments of doubt, they are supporting us. i realize that deviating from the comfort and certainty that astrology has brought them is a process in itself.
she's able to keep her emotions in check under stress, she (usually) makes excellent judgments, and she knows how to work as part of a team -- this is what makes her great zombie-killing and co-parenting alike.
still, as determined as we were, i will admit our astrological reading did give me temporary anxiety. this was the first time i would deviate from what astrology told me to do and for a moment, i wondered if i was going to jinx my marriage.

i stopped listening to what she was saying and instead focused on ringing up her purchases, while i listened for the beeps. i didn't want to double-scan any items or go too slowly. i could be friendly or i could be conscientious ― i wasn't capable of both. this, i realized, was the reason for my slow ring times, so i'd have to give the customer less of me and give the scanner more. i couldn't believe how awful i was at this.

here is something i was not even close to being prepared for after getting married. i had no idea that being married would bring out so much of who i am as a person, to the point where i now feel more like myself than ever before. i believe this has everything to do with marrying a very good man. the right person will always enable you to flourish in your self-esteem, self-care, hobbies, interests and passions. i found myself moving towards things i'd always wanted to do, exploring my passions with great zeal for life, and completing tasks and projects i'd always meant to finish. being with the right person has a way of giving you that zoom of strength you need to be fully and 100% yourself. the knowledge that someone not only loves and accepts, but also genuinely enjoys, you as a person, brings a steadiness to the heart like never before. i grew to a place where it didn't really matter anymore who thought what about me. i felt no shame in being 100% myself. i believe that a good and solid marriage does this for both people.

i've spent years making money and saving it. when life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), i feel like i have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. it might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but i think it's the opposite. we've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.
in my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. when you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. so many of the issues i see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: people who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. a few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― ryan howes, a psychologist in pasadena, california

being in a ldr has created a stronger level of communication than i think would have developed if we were in a 'traditional' relationship. at any given point, we had a 14-to-16-hour time difference between us, sometimes more if i traveled out west. this worked really well for me because i worked overnight shifts, so most of the time we were both awake at the same time. on days off, one of us either woke up early or stayed up late to ensure that we could talk to each other.

but there were surprising losses, too. (this excludes the works that were completely snubbed in nominations, like ava duvernay's stellar when they see us, lupita nyong'o's performance in us and zendaya coleman's role in euphoria.) eddie murphy's comeback performance in dolemite is my name failed to garner recognition; he lost to taron edgerton for rocketman, and dolemite was shut out altogether. billy porter of pose (unsurprisingly) lost the best actor in a tv series - drama award to industry juggernaut brian cox of the wildly popular succession. and, in one of the biggest snubs of the night, odds-on favorite jennifer lopez — dressed in gold — lost the best supporting actress in a motion picture award to laura dern's wonderful albeit glorified cameo performance in marriage story.

this was the problem with these well-meaning people in a nutshell. when beth gets upset, or fights larry on an idea, he withdraws. i'm not sure if he's protecting himself or her, but my guess is that it's a bit of both. and even though beth says she wants a relationship of equals with two strong voices, she has a subtle way of appearing to be the expert. she says she wants an equal, but a real equal partnership will challenge her status as exclusive expert, especially on the kids. i'm not sure she's ready for that.

one small example of a benefit: when i'm home sometimes i wear a kerchief on my head that makes me feel like i look like a less than attractive peasant from the old country. so i was happily surprised when during the appreciation part of one of our weekly marriage meetings, my husband complimented me for looking cute wearing the kerchief. this gave me a warm feeling inside and an outward smile. we've been holding these meetings for twenty-seven years. i practice what i preach!

some of you may wonder why i harp so much on donald trump. there are a few reasons, not the least of which is that i detest everything he stands for. it just goes against all i believe in and hold dear. plus, if he continues to head down this same path he's currently headed on, i believe he will put america -- and very possibly other countries, canada included -- in danger.

she noted that budget constraints could hinder the law's effectiveness. what is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence, martin said. we are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence. cases of emotional abuse far exceeded reported cases of physical abuse in ireland in 2017, according to data obtained by women's aid. that year alone, there were 15,833 reports of domestic violence. of those, 10,281 were cases of emotional and psychological abuse, and 3,502 were cases of physical abuse. additionally, there were 1,443 reported cases of financial abuse and 607 reported cases of sexual abuse.

while i had begun the year exhausted by stress and financial worry, i felt a shift in my mentality after the first week of january. i realized how unexpectedly kind people can be. it's so hard to see sometimes because most people don't have the means to help others, and i don't just mean financially. people are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined. i certainly was caught up in mine.

if all else failed, i'd offer to wipe down the registers or handle returning items to the shelves, which, of course, was also risky. there was always the possibility of running into someone i knew in the aisles. then i would be forced to listen as they droned on about their latest vacation, or worse, asked me where something was. i'd have to admit i often didn't know because i worked at the front of the store instead of in the center.

regardless of having slapped christmas together, the whole vibe of the holidays was off, at least for me. i was so consumed by stress, i hadn't felt like myself. i had been catching myself too overwhelmed to offer a smile to a stranger, or do the things i would normally do, like drop change in a bucket or make a donation to an important charity or take a hat out of my glove compartment and give it to someone on the street ― things i like to do but this year felt i couldn't. emotionally and financially, i was maxed out, and that meant i wasn't in the spirit of helping others, even though i wanted to.

i was capable of more than ringing and bagging his groceries, i wanted to shout, hopefully jarring him from a call too important to allow him to acknowledge a fellow human being ― me. instead, i looked at my growing line and thought of my ring times. i'd just have to make the next customer understand: i was not just a cashier. this was not a real job for me. i pushed the button to move their items down the belt and allowed myself to get lost in the hum of the store.

none of my friends have ever openly talked about getting a prenup before their marriage and if they did get one, they kept that secret and swallowed the idea of releasing that information to their close friends. some people feel the decision is private, but society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life ― the actual wedding day.
in a perfect world, such objective (or gesturing toward objective) criteria for nominations would be the norm. but in hollywood, it's not always about quality in determining who gets nominated and who wins. politics, the power of a good narrative and diversity — not only of the performers, directors and others, but those who are doing the nominating — are also key drivers in who ultimately nabs the statue.

it was not a grand display of wailing and moaning. instead, i cried silently as i pushed the metal carts. i slid one into another, creating a chain that i jammed into the nearest corral while weaving in between customers and cars. it was mother's day and i'd forgotten to put in for the day off. people rushed past me in their cars, the rain lifting off the pavement and soaking the day-glo vest i was forced to wear whenever i did cart duty. how the hell did i wind up here, i asked myself as i wiped at the tears i tried to pass off as rain on my face.

i felt my financial struggles gaining on me, so i picked up extra jobs wherever i could, bargain-shopped and sold items that were sitting in my garage. i tried hard to get ahead of it. still, i wondered if january 2020 would be the year that it all came crashing down. for a while, it was all i could think about. i wondered how anyone, especially single parents, was able to financially survive in modern times. personally, i felt like i was constantly underwater.
nevertheless, i continue to wear my red string and my gold charm around my neck. my red kabbalah string is truly comforting; guards and protects me (in my mind) and reminds me to always 'be aware' of the force of luck lurking around my corner. it makes me listen to my inner feelings.

for a period of time i was an astronomy professor at a university and also took students on field trips to check out regional geological phenomena. as a professor i was respected and people generally followed my lead. i soon became accustomed to having whatever i wanted and however i wanted it. in short i pretty much always got my way. this is what men like.
certain things ― a root canal, a conversation with a relentless one-upper ― are easier to deal with if you just accept it's going to be rough going. if you're in regular conversation with a one-upper, just think of their habit as part of the package. maybe even learn to laugh at it. (i wonder how many times they'll respond with a brag this time; last time, i think the count was four.)

i love traveling and seeing other parts of the world, which is coincidentally how we met. since we started dating, i have been to australia two more times and my husband has come to america four times before moving here. during those trips, we were able to play tourist in our respective homes and even see bits of each other's countries. in between those visits, we also got to travel together to vietnam and peru together. he proposed at machu picchu, which is something i will never forget. we figured that seeing each other would always require a flight on one end or the other, but we could break it up and meet each other somewhere, and then experience a new country together. — eames

i am quite certain you have looked at another person and said to yourself, she is so lucky. well maybe she is but so can you be lucky because i think we all get a chance to get lucky in life.
she had no idea how much it meant, though. with this gift, i'd finally be able to get out of the hole i had basically been in for two years since getting separated. i'd be starting 2020 with a clean slate, rather than yet another late mortgage payment. it was maybe the most meaningful gift i'd ever gotten and it came from someone i'd never met or even spoken to before online.

although i'm not religious or an avid believer in astrology, i didn't argue with my parents' reliance on the astrologer's recommendations because it was just easier than trying to dispute the accuracy of his claims. they found solace in knowing that the universe was somehow supportive of key milestones for me, and for most of my life, my personal pursuits seemed to be reinforced by the cosmic world they believed in, so i chose not to rebel.

this year's globes infamously shut out women in the best director category, despite the abundance of critically acclaimed, money-making films by female directors including lulu wang, lorene scafaria, greta gerwig, mati diop and celine sciamma. their lack of nominations doesn't magically erase the brilliance of the movies they made.

but there was a downside. i came to a point where i was sure i knew more than anyone else. in my mind no one was as intelligent as me and i was not terribly shy about sharing my knowledge. when my future wife and i were dating this side of my personality showed up. repeatedly. but she knew exactly how to handle it. she simply broke up with me. seven times! every time i got out of line she dropped me. it was some pretty hard core training, but i eventually learned.

after sharing our spreadsheets, we decided to reach out and get help. a lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. we both had different ideas about how to go about doing this; i wanted us to live on a tight budget to increase our savings and my partner wanted us to invest more now.

her declaration of resignation as eldest daughter-in-law changed almost everything. her husband, whom she moved in with again after knee surgery in september 2017, finally began to listen to her, and the annual ancestral rites and holiday ceremonies, which had been a source of immense strain and stress, were simplified. she and her husband grew in respect for one another, and ended up not divorcing. the change that occurred in her daily life was significant enough that she has called it amiracle, even a small revolution.

diversity is all well and good, but there's also a question of taste, of discernment. award ceremonies are supposed to be the purveyors of what's next, what's exciting, what's enriching the culture as a whole. so-called diverse filmmakers and actors shouldn't win or be nominated for awards just by virtue of existing, no. but when genuinely stellar work by these creators goes unnoticed for the sake of lauding the same revolving cast of characters, it raises a singular question.
i thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more i researched that, the more i realized i was wrong. essentially, prenups are something for anyone to consider, regardless of how much money you have to your name, who wants protection or a legal game plan of what will happen if the marriage ends. why argue about all of the assets you came into the marriage with, when the marriage is crumbling and on its final leg? why not get that out of the way beforehand. the idea of a prenup or a legal financial document started to sound more and more attractive.

this was one of the most emotionally exhausting experiences of my life. while i was aware that home pregnancy tests always need to be confirmed by a doctor, i really didn't realize that false positives were very much of a possibility. the instructions even say that false negatives are more likely than false positives, and that both are extremely rare. the over 99 percent accuracy that is advertised on all hpts leads one believe that they are trustworthy. imagine the toll on my emotions when, after taking a test one day, i peeled back the shower curtain to discover a little blue plus sign. shock, excitement, fear, anxiety, and general head-spinning were in order. i stared at the test for a good five minutes before bringing it outside, taking a few pictures in different lighting to make sure it wasn't all in my head, all in between a pounding heartbeat and clasping my hand over my mouth and wondering how in the world i was going to tell my husband. would he be worried since this was before we had decided to get pregnant? how would we pay for all of this? how would i continue working during the dreaded vomiting of the first trimester? i immediately ran out to the store and picked up different brands of tests to confirm. i waited until the next morning to test again, only to be greeted by only one pink line, not two. the test was negative.

contrary to popular belief i don't want to rock the boat, but the boat is fucking rocked, he continued, pivoting his speech to address everyone in the room.
how can i possibly explain the confusion that washed over me after a night of extreme emotional ups and downs? i could barely concentrate at work, and ended up asking my boss if i could leave early to go to the doctor. was i pregnant or not? needless to say, i really wish someone would have told me about false positives, and how they are apparently more common than we are all lead to believe. this entire experience caused a very unnecessary roller coaster of emotions that, when paired with an already hormonal time of the month, absolutely wore me out.

i used to love christmas, but this past year, as soon as all the gifts were unwrapped and i'd polished off the last sugar cookie while standing over the sink, all i felt was relief. there had been arguing with my estranged husband about holiday plans, and a sad, toxic mediation session that took place just a few days before christmas. i had burst out crying in the first five minutes. in an effort to stand up for myself and my kids, i yelled and raged, and i left feeling angry and broken, wondering why on earth we had decided to schedule mediation so close to the holidays. but mostly, what kept me up at night was a heavy, consuming financial stress that had been building for months.

it's unclear if she still holds that belief. attempts by huffpost to reach her were unsuccessful.
coffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? steinberg said. plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' if you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.

there were photos circulated that led us to suspect that there had been physical action taken against the suspects, misbahul munauwar, a spokesman for aceh police, said. the national police chief has instructed us to investigate those photos and to determine if there was any...procedural or ethical violation.
meghan denies collaborating with the authors — though she acknowledges allowing someone close to her to speak to them — and the book is expected to feature prominently in the trial.
that awkwardness is worth exploring a little: most of us can read the room if we're coming across as braggy: if we jump on someone's sentence before they can finish getting it out or use their story as a jumping-off point for our own humblebrag, we'll notice that there's an awkward pause from the rest of the group once the interaction is through. we'll spot the occasional eye roll and realize, oh, my gosh, i'm a thunder-stealing monster! and change our ways.

to say that debt is ever a blessing is probably a huge stretch. however, it can serve as a tool for helping couples learn how to work together.
after trying to reason that astrology is imperfect and would provide no tangible assurance about the strength of my future marriage, i realized it was time to say what i was really thinking. at that moment, i didn't care that the cosmic bodies had determined that my marital union would be doomed. i was willing to take the risk of spending the rest of my life with my chosen partner, confident that we could overcome any obstacles ― cosmic or otherwise ― together.
we spent full day in silence after a conversation about how to split our money and wages went south after discussing the potential scenario of having kids. i would have to temporarily stop working for a few months, and we both freelance so there's no such thing as paid maternity or paternity leave for us. we didn't reach a resolution.
we have learned a lot about sexual assault and other violence against women in the intervening decades, she said. the person who is most likely to sexually assault a woman is a man she knows — and resistance takes a different form when it's someone you know.

i'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. that means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― zach brittle
beth fell for larry shortly after she left a really turbulent relationship with her bi-polar-ish first husband. beth felt responsible for him, and said she hung on much longer than she should have. devastated and emotionally drained following her break-up, this handsome, capable and calm larry felt like just the ticket. they dated for several years, during which time they each pursued professional degrees. beth remembered that they fought rather intensely during periods of separation from each other, but had long months where they enjoyed a close and loving connection.

you may say, that's the same as before, isn't it? but it isn't. the difference is my actions are now voluntary. no matter how good a duty of obedience is, no one enjoys doing it. it feels demeaning. but it's not unpleasant to do it voluntarily in a balanced relationship. now the holidays have become a fun time to meet and talk about current events for hours, as well as cook and eat delicious food together.
london (ap) — lawyers for the duchess of sussex asked a british judge on tuesday to settle her lawsuit against a newspaper before it goes to trial by ruling that its publication of a deeply personal letter to her estranged father was a plain and a serious breach of her rights of privacy.

she hadn't been politically active in the past, but 2020 really got me, and the pandemic took the cake, she said. i couldn't believe what i was seeing. when trump started talking about a third term and then started a chant at a rally of '12 more years,′ i thought: 'that's it. that's a dictator.'
things i really wanted to do had been removed from my priority list when i was living as a daughter-in-law ― but during those months alone, i lived fully and enjoyed it. that's when i wrote the book.

black hair defined is all about letting people tell their stories about their hair journeys, erin evans, a senior enterprise editor at huffpost who commissioned the articles for this project, told me from new york.
i knew getting my finances under control wouldn't happen without effort. still, my two kids were finally both full-time in school. i saw an opportunity to push further in my career than i'd ever been able to do as a mom at home with the kids. i was excited to sink my teeth into new and exciting work, and i did. i scrimped and saved and cut back on expenses. i put just enough gas in the car to get the kids to school and get back home. but no matter what i did, i'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. i'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.
i remained employed at the store for three years and only left because i eventually took a job in a local school working in special education. recently, i popped in to pick up some groceries and saw an old manager.
some people resist the idea of a formal meeting with their spouse. they think it sounds like work. why not just talk about things as they come up? talking on the fly sounds very nice, and that is fine if you are able to do this effectively.
as a person who's been through two years of transatlantic dating — and going on six years of marriage — i believe that it's healthy to retain some level of distance in a relationship, even for couples who do live under one roof. maybe that's a weekend away with your girlfriends while he's fishing with his friends. distance helps each of you stay self-sufficient and makes it easier to maintain respect towards each other. — olga baker
as all these changes happened in your family after you submitted your resignation, you clearly played a big role in this transformation.

members of the association of certified family law specialists in june testified before a california senate committee that they opposed the bill because cases of marital dissolution and legal separation already face significant delays and issues of contention in court, particularly surrounding child custody.
sure, date nights are great. but we actually find ordinary life together downright magical. morning hugs in the kitchen. going to the grocery store together. just seeing his toothbrush next to mine. swoon! — cris gladly
that completely caught her off guard, sarantakis said. she never would have guessed it was something he wanted. she believed that the purpose of asking for the dog was to gain power and ask for other things. luckily the case got resolved, and she kept the dog.
less than a year after legalizing marriage equality, bermuda passed a law last month to ban same-sex marriage once again.
a wonderful land or cruise vacation is not guaranteed by luck. you have to do your research. i suggest not using some travel agent behind a computer who has probably traveled less than you. ask traveled friends for the name of their travel agent. if you enjoy the same type of travel ask friends or acquaintances, you respect, for restaurant and hotel suggestions. my southern friend, norma jean, taught me how to persuade the clerk, in every hotel, how to get 'a room with a view.' we are never too old to ask and never too old to learn, dear readers. just use your brains.

sarantakis said the pet custody cases can sometimes become more emotional than disagreements over children.
i first want to thank all the generous readers who wrote in to share their own stories in response to last week's newsletter on gender dynamics in marriage. some readers said gender imbalances in relationships appear to be shifting in a positive direction in many cultures, including in the u.s., but that there's still a long way to go. self-love and self-work, including seeking counseling for both partners, is key to enacting change in a relationship, a pennsylvania-based clinical social worker and family therapist suggested in her email to me.
i have my regrets. i also regret not quitting sooner. had i acted at an earlier date, i could have created a more equal and respectful environment for my children. at the time, my husband's family felt like this insurmountable, enormous rock, and it was scary. but then i realized that i too am a person with power.

i worked mostly nights and sundays. sundays were the worst because they were the hardest days to hide. it seemed like every family i knew shopped after church or their kid's sporting events. and it was on a sunday that i broke down.
i couldn't sleep for weeks leading up to dec. 25. i stayed awake refreshing my bank account on my phone to see if my paycheck had cleared. it finally did on the evening of the 23rd, and i frantically went out and did all of my shopping ― for my two kids and everyone else ― on christmas eve. mostly, i crafted and made cookies and wrote heartfelt notes to teachers and people i wanted to do more for but couldn't, financially.
