There may be another way to counter his revolution of hate and it's Valentine's Day that's made me think of it. Maybe it's time we -- and by we I mean the world -- had a revolution of our own. Maybe it's time for another love-in.
Whole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats, according to its website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version.
Then Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks.
Smeal said she was especially concerned with Goessling's record on guns. In 2008, Goessling authored an amicus brief arguing that firearms help protect women from violent attacks, and quoted a researcher who wrote that women who are confronted with a sexual assault are significantly less likely to experience a completed rape if they resist with a weapon.

Trilingual, Pérez de Cuéllar read French, English and Spanish literature.
However, Sweitzer points out that communication is much more than simply airing your grievances to each other. It's seeking to understand the other person and the many factors that shaped them, he said. For instance, how did the person with the debt get in that situation in the first place? What did they learn from childhood about managing money and the ethics of debt? Did they learn to cope with emotional difficulties by spending, by depriving themself?
Ireland just expanded the legal definition of domestic violence to include emotional and psychological abuse.
Meanwhile, the one-uppers' co-workers are thinking: Could this guy be any more of a bragger? Must be nice to up and quit your job. His parents probably paid for that.
No, I actually think the letter was just a spark, a small starting point for change rather than a major personal achievement. It could've gone in a completely different direction. I am grateful to my family for having worked toward building the balanced and peaceful relationship we have now.
Almost immediately, a member responded. I was excited because I didn't know if the message would get overlooked completely or if maybe someone had a quick writing or copyediting job to offer. The group member sent me a private message. She asked me what my Venmo name was. I responded immediately, assuming she wanted to connect for future payment, after I completed whatever work she had to offer, maybe transcribing something that wouldn't take too much time. I had said I was open to anything. Instead, my phone dinged immediately ― it was the sound of a Venmo payment coming through. This complete stranger had sent me $350 ― the amount I had specified that I was needing to earn in the next few days to make up the gap.

She said she regretted the views she previously held and noted her recent support of LGBTQ legislation. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey, she said in January.
The way this is different is that [Harry] is not in the direct line of succession, royal expert and officer of arms Alastair Bruce told Town & Country. He is a member of the royal family. This is a family wedding which is taking place not in public, not out of the public eye, but within the castle, which is much less visual.
The children can vocalize. With the dog, you don't know what they want, she said. She noted that sometimes judges award custody of pets in the same manner as children — when the kids go with mom, for example, so does the pet.
Pérez de Cuéllar's death ends a long diplomatic career that brought him full-circle from his first posting as secretary at the Peruvian embassy in Paris in 1944 to his later job as Peru's ambassador to France.
She had no idea how much it meant, though. With this gift, I'd finally be able to get out of the hole I had basically been in for two years since getting separated. I'd be starting 2020 with a clean slate, rather than yet another late mortgage payment. It was maybe the most meaningful gift I'd ever gotten and it came from someone I'd never met or even spoken to before online.
He needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.
A company that sponsors or hosts non-work events and activities may be an example of a culture that's much more tolerant or even supportive of relationships in the workplace, Marzolph said.
Goessling did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.
Truthfully, I was starting to panic. I whispered affirmations to myself. I brainstormed ways to make up the money. I sold my engagement ring for $250, picked up freelance assignments and I reached out on a Facebook community where fellow writers and editors often discuss work opportunities. In a moment of panic, I wrote a quick note about my situation and let members know I was available for some quick jobs if anyone had anything to toss my way.
California repealed the law against consensual sex between same-sex adults in 1975, and in 1997 created a way for those individuals to be removed from the California Sex Offender Registry. But neither step changed the original convictions.

No matter, because some gleeful Twitter users enjoyed another opportunity to chortle at an apparent Trump gaffe. Amid the religious right's efforts to limit such rights as abortion access and same-sex marriage, others concluded that the president may have seen the light.
[Laughs.] Is that so? We have three generations. My parents' generation, my husband and my generation, and our son's generation. When we meet, we talk about social issues. We all have different ideas and perspectives. Nevertheless, we don't ignore others, and we don't say, you don't know any better. By listening carefully, we can at least understand where others' ideas stem from ― even if we don't necessarily share those opinions.
The last time Congress officially declared war was Dec. 8, 1941, the day that the United States entered World War II, she said at a news conference. Ever since, Congress has failed to uphold this constitutional responsibility and has ceded this power to the president ― presidents of both parties.
Sure, you may be aware that female wedding guests don fancy hats and fascinators for the ceremony (a British custom not just reserved for royals). Who could forget the bold headwear Princess Beatrice of York wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge? But there's probably quite a few traditions you've never heard of before.

Considering that months would often pass before we could see each other again, communication was all we had. In turn, I found that we were both very open about our emotions, how we felt about each other and how we felt about our situation moving forward. From almost day one, we have been very open and transparent with each other, and I think that made us stronger as a couple. — Eames
If the person declines, remember that this is a risky proposition, she explained. Your co-worker might have otherwise said 'yes' if you hadn't met at work. Many are averse to dating co-workers as a personal policy.
Colin said he gets lots of calls and interest after a political banner appears in the news. People on Twitter have responded to tweets about the banners offering to happily chip into a GoFundMe site for more anti-Trump missives.

While some couples may view debt as a deal breaker, Rollo said that for most, it's dishonesty. I've had several clients present to couples counseling because they feel deceived by their partner. They share they did not realize their partner's debt burden until they were already married or engaged, Rollo said.
4. You make the most of whatever time you have together.
Women have equaled and outperformed men in almost every sphere, he said. It is time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential.
Consequently, it's easy to develop unrealistic, fantasy-based expectations about marriage. Many of us spend more time maintain a car -- checking tire pressure, changing the oil, and getting the recommended inspections, and son on -- than we spend on keeping our most important relationship in good working order.

If confirmed, as the head of the Office on Violence Against Women, Goessling would have a large influence over which domestic violence and sexual assault programs get funding, Smeal said, and which issues take priority.
Part of me felt like sending the money back. It was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. I'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason. But I realized, this woman really wanted to help, and clearly she was able to. She didn't seem to need a lot of thanks or even acknowledgment ― she didn't want anything at all. It was hard to find the right words to express my gratitude.
Many people who like to 'story top' are not aware of what they are doing. They're simply enjoying sharing their story and feeling like they are one of the gang with a similar experience, she said. These who are unaware are getting a good feeling, as if they are popular and well-liked.

Clearly, they weren't exactly persuasive, and Republican senators on Saturday acquitted Trump of incitement of insurrection for the storming of the Capitol last month.
It was not a grand display of wailing and moaning. Instead, I cried silently as I pushed the metal carts. I slid one into another, creating a chain that I jammed into the nearest corral while weaving in between customers and cars. It was Mother's Day and I'd forgotten to put in for the day off. People rushed past me in their cars, the rain lifting off the pavement and soaking the Day-Glo vest I was forced to wear whenever I did cart duty. How the hell did I wind up here, I asked myself as I wiped at the tears I tried to pass off as rain on my face.

After the emotional episode aired, Mariah thanked viewers for their support on Twitter.
These were the people that I worked with. They brought me bags of their leftover school supplies for my kids. They offered me advice on marriage and parenting. They shared my love of horror movies. And it killed me to realize that the whole time, while I tried to profess my merits to customers who judged me, I had judged my co-workers.
Associated Newspapers is contesting the claim, and the full trial is due to be held in the autumn at the High Court in London.
While Weisz has many new films on the horizon, Craig is also gearing up to return for his fifth film in the 007 franchise after previously joking he'd rather slash my wrist than play the character again.
However, the United States under Trump has pushed to remove such language from new U.N. resolutions. The Trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund because it believed it was linked to an abortion program, but the U.N. said that was an inaccurate perception.

At its heart it's a very straightforward case about the unlawful publication of a private letter, he said Tuesday at the start of a two-day hearing, held remotely because of coronavirus restrictions.
We spent full day in silence after a conversation about how to split our money and wages went south after discussing the potential scenario of having kids. I would have to temporarily stop working for a few months, and we both freelance so there's no such thing as paid maternity or paternity leave for us. We didn't reach a resolution.
Some of you may wonder why I harp so much on Donald Trump. There are a few reasons, not the least of which is that I detest everything he stands for. It just goes against all I believe in and hold dear. Plus, If he continues to head down this same path he's currently headed on, I believe he will put America -- and very possibly other countries, Canada included -- in danger.

A national police spokesman confirmed that police chief Tito Karnavian had ordered the investigation.
I remained employed at the store for three years and only left because I eventually took a job in a local school working in special education. Recently, I popped in to pick up some groceries and saw an old manager.

Touting his personal love of transportation, he said: Travel in my mind is synonymous with growth, with adventure, even love ― so much so that I proposed to my husband Chasten in an airport terminal.
ASSOCIATED PRESS U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were also being diluted or rolled back.
Two years ago, after eight years of marriage, my husband moved out and even though the change was good and long overdue, financially it was utterly devastating. I had two kids to take care of, a mortgage to pay and bills that never seemed to stop coming. While part of me was excited to tackle it all on my own, I had only worked part-time while caring for my kids. In that sense, I'd never done it all on my own. I was terrified.
The Domestic Violence Act 2018 also criminalizes forced marriage, allows restraining orders for couples who do not live together and restricts media coverage in cases of gender-based violence.

She said she has had constituents tell her about contentious divorce fights that end up costing them tons and tons in legal fees over the pets. She maintained her bill would smooth the process by setting out criteria by which judges could make the determinations on pet custody.
These people offered their service every single day to so many people who judged them unfairly, who judged them based on their titles of cashier and bagger without seeing who they were ― working single mothers, kind-hearted retirees, teenagers saving for college, middle-aged college grads down on their luck. The people who served us our food, rang up our groceries and made it possible for us to do what we needed to every single day aren't so different from us. They were more similar than I ever knew. I was just too wrapped up in myself and my own privilege to ever realize it ― until I became one of them.

While Colin confirmed S arranged the latest banners, two earlier messages over Mar-a-Lago — Trump You Pathetic Loser Go Back to Moscow and Trump Worst President Ever — were ordered by a guy, whom he declined to name.
The ease of confident self-care. This ties right in with the above. I wish someone would have told me how much the opinions of my husband regarding my appearance would bring me to a place of self-acceptance that I never knew before. This played out in the simplest of things such as shaving my legs. Of course my goal is always to be well-kept, but I am amazed just how much insecurity regarding how I look has been lost. I just don't really care anymore. This is not to say that I no longer care about keeping up with my appearance. Quite the opposite - my husband's affirmation of my looks and him telling me regularly that I am beautiful gives me the extra boost of confidence I need to care just enough. Not too much to where I obsess over my appearance, but not too little to where I become lazy and unkempt. While I love how good and confident it feels to be well-kept, I also know that my husband just doesn't care if it's been 4 days since I shaved my legs, or if I wake up and decide not to do my hair. This is one of the best and most beneficial things I've found about marriage so far. And I do know that some husbands can have the opposite affect on their wives, based on how they affirm, or how they cut down.
Michael McCormack, 53, on Monday took up the post as Australia's new deputy prime minister after the previous occupant, Barnaby Joyce, quit following weeks of controversy over his affair with a former staffer.
So many of our customers did this without knowing whom they were talking to. And as I handed her the receipt without meeting her eyes, it hurt me to know that I was once one of them. No, I never belittled them or acted rudely, but I did think I was better than them. Maybe it was the education or the house in the affluent town, the one I could barely afford.

I find it pretty strange that the United States is mobilizing so hard on this issue ... because if you look at the bigger picture is the main threat to the world today abortions? Or is it an assertive China? A Russia that is expansionist? Let's just get our focus right here, said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

There was a family gathering at the end of last year .… That day was winter solstice, and my father-in-law bought red bean porridge, my mother-in-law boiled the cabbage soup, my sister-in-law went grocery shopping, and my husband's brother and his wife washed all the vegetables while others grilled the meat. I brought side dishes from home. My husband washed all the dishes.
I waved without explaining that this job was not a way to escape my kids, but a necessity. It allowed me to work nights and make money I desperately needed to pay bills. Like many of the affluent customers we served, I don't think she could understand.
When a one-upper brags, they misjudge how the story will play for others. If I tell my co-workers about how I quit my first job at 22 to backpack through Europe for a whole year, they'll think it's romantic and cultured sounding! the one-upper thinks.Maybe they'll want to join me on my next smaller trip.
Still, as determined as we were, I will admit our astrological reading did give me temporary anxiety. This was the first time I would deviate from what astrology told me to do and for a moment, I wondered if I was going to jinx my marriage.

Other than in states with the new laws, pets are generally considered property to be divided between warring couples. That didn't make sense to Rhode Island state Rep. Charlene Lima, a married Democrat who authored a best interests of the pet bill last year.
You may say, That's the same as before, isn't it? But it isn't. The difference is my actions are now voluntary. No matter how good a duty of obedience is, no one enjoys doing it. It feels demeaning.

Now the holidays have become a fun time to meet and talk about current events for hours, as well as cook and eat delicious food together.

I first want to thank all the generous readers who wrote in to share their own stories in response to last week's newsletter on gender dynamics in marriage. Some readers said gender imbalances in relationships appear to be shifting in a positive direction in many cultures, including in the U.S., but that there's still a long way to go. Self-love and self-work, including seeking counseling for both partners, is key to enacting change in a relationship, a Pennsylvania-based clinical social worker and family therapist suggested in her email to me.
That awkwardness is worth exploring a little: Most of us can read the room if we're coming across as braggy: If we jump on someone's sentence before they can finish getting it out or use their story as a jumping-off point for our own humblebrag, we'll notice that there's an awkward pause from the rest of the group once the interaction is through. We'll spot the occasional eye roll and realize, Oh, my gosh, I'm a thunder-stealing monster! and change our ways.

Let me explain: Marriage, or any duet or intimate partnership needs plenty of caring, lots of tolerance and acceptance and enough humor to take the edge off. But a pattern of too much politeness or caution in one or both partners kills the spark, and pretty soon the marriage is limping along, barely alive, or, sometimes, so turbulent that it can break apart.
Indian philosophy views marriage not only as a long-term commitment between two people but as a union of cosmic energy and permanent stability. Generations have relied on horoscope matchmaking (especially for arranged marriages) to get assurance that the married couple would enjoy a life of bliss, stability and health.

This was one of the most emotionally exhausting experiences of my life. While I was aware that home pregnancy tests always need to be confirmed by a doctor, I really didn't realize that false positives were very much of a possibility. The instructions even say that false negatives are more likely than false positives, and that both are extremely rare. The over 99 percent accuracy that is advertised on all HPTs leads one believe that they are trustworthy. Imagine the toll on my emotions when, after taking a test one day, I peeled back the shower curtain to discover a little blue plus sign. Shock, excitement, fear, anxiety, and general head-spinning were in order. I stared at the test for a good five minutes before bringing it outside, taking a few pictures in different lighting to make sure it wasn't all in my head, all in between a pounding heartbeat and clasping my hand over my mouth and wondering how in the world I was going to tell my husband. Would he be worried since this was before we had decided to get pregnant? How would we pay for all of this? How would I continue working during the dreaded vomiting of the first trimester? I immediately ran out to the store and picked up different brands of tests to confirm. I waited until the next morning to test again, only to be greeted by only one pink line, not two. The test was negative.
Over dinner with another engaged couple, we talked about the P word and the only thing they could share with us was that they are concerned we're approaching our engagement journey in a negative way, by planning for the worst.

Their lack of nominations doesn't magically erase the brilliance of the movies they made.
Here is something I was not even close to being prepared for after getting married. I had no idea that being married would bring out so much of who I am as a person, to the point where I now feel more like myself than ever before. I believe this has everything to do with marrying a very good man. The right person will always enable you to flourish in your self-esteem, self-care, hobbies, interests and passions. I found myself moving towards things I'd always wanted to do, exploring my passions with great zeal for life, and completing tasks and projects I'd always meant to finish. Being with the right person has a way of giving you that zoom of strength you need to be fully and 100% yourself. The knowledge that someone not only loves and accepts, but also genuinely enjoys, you as a person, brings a steadiness to the heart like never before. I grew to a place where it didn't really matter anymore who thought what about me. I felt no shame in being 100% myself. I believe that a good and solid marriage does this for both people.
The hurricane, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached Tupelo, left no permanent mark on the city, which is best known as the birthplace of Elvis Presley. However, the disappearance of 13-year-old Leigh Marine Occhi did, and it still hangs like a thick cloud over the city.
Since I know what it was like before, I feel like the present situation with my husband's family is a sort of miracle. Actually, I feel more intimate with them after submitting my resignation letter. I've grown to think of them as actually really good people.
Touting his personal love of transportation, he said: Travel in my mind is synonymous with growth, with adventure, even love ― so much so that I proposed to my husband Chasten in an airport terminal.

Yarborough was named a person of interest at the time, but no charges were ever filed against her.
But before we get into that, did you know that the Feast of Saint Valentine (or Valentine's Day) wasn't always about couples expressing their love for each other?
Despite the police department's belief that Leigh was murdered, her mother was unwilling, in 2009, to give up the hope that her daughter was still alive.
When he began his tenure as U.N. secretary-general on Jan. 1, 1982, he was a little-known Peruvian who was a compromise candidate at a time when the United Nations was held in low esteem.
I wondered why she had done it. Had she once been a struggling single mother? Had she recently read something that made her want to pay it forward? Had the note I'd quickly jotted asking for an odd job, or any job, struck a nerve? Did she just go around doing things like this for others all of the time? I didn't know the answer and I'd probably never get it. Still, regardless of the reason, her action filled me with gratitude.
Upset with what he viewed as member states' reluctance to pitch in to help the world body out of a financial crisis, he told the New York Times in September 1986, I don't see any reason why I should preside over the collapse of the organization.

He said the sad intricacies of a family relationship … is not a matter of public interest.
Shelton, meanwhile, has been dating Stefani for nearly three years after the fellow Voice judges bonded over mutual heartbreak. In 2015, the former No Doubt singer was also going through a divorce from her husband of nearly 13 years, Gavin Rossdale, who reportedly cheated on her with the family's nanny.
In July 1986, Pérez de Cuéllar underwent a quadruple coronary bypass operation, putting in question his availability for a second term. From the outset, Pérez de Cuéllar had insisted that he would be a one-term secretary-general.
I often share a folksy old saying with my clients: 'It's best to fix the roof when the sun's shining.' We all know that when we're in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. Maybe you've noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. The wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. It's OK to go to counseling when things seem 'fine' so that you are more resilient when they aren't. Even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it's good to be equipped when they come. ― Ryan Howes
We actually find ordinary life together downright magical. Morning hugs in the kitchen. Going to the grocery store together. Just seeing his toothbrush next to mine. - Cris Gladly
If he does wear military garb for the ceremony, Harry will likely change out of it afterward, as his brother, William, did at his 2011 wedding.
I remember that day I'd pushed a couple of coupons I intended to use under a bag of rice, hiding them, when I saw this woman approach. I hated that I had moved to the other side of the register and was now serving her.

Whole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats, according to its website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version.

The few policies still in existence often focus on relationships that put the company as risk, such as a romantic relationship between a manager and their employee, or one that runs contrary to the checks and balances that exist within the company ― like quality assurance and customer service or finance and sales, Marzolph told HuffPost.

In the 12 years Marzolph has worked in human resources, sexual harassment complaints have almost always been about how someone went about asking, not the fact that they had asked.
The divorce court judge was frustrated. The husband, in tears. The wife, adamant. The couple's love for each other had ended, but each professed to love and want the dog. How would the judge decide?
Nicole? I heard a customer say at the beginning of my next shift. The tan woman placed her groceries on the black belt, a mix of party goods ― drinks, paper plates and snack foods.

What a great way to get out of the house and away from the kids for a bit, she said.
She quit her job and worked as a daughter-in-law, mother and wife for decades. But after 24 years, she felt she'd done enough ― and decided to live the life she actually wanted before it was too late.

In New York, where we plan to get married, the money you make becomes marital. Which means, it's shared. Money or assets from the past become marital, too, unless you protect them with a prenup or don't add any money to your savings account, investments or assets.
If he does wear military garb for the ceremony, Harry will likely change out of it afterward, as his brother, William, did at his 2011 wedding.
Noting that she had very close LGBTQ friends, Robyn added, All adults should be able to choose who they love, and how they structure their family.
In a perfect world, such objective (or gesturing toward objective) criteria for nominations would be the norm. But in Hollywood, it's not always about quality in determining who gets nominated and who wins. Politics, the power of a good narrative and diversity — not only of the performers, directors and others, but those who are doing the nominating — are also key drivers in who ultimately nabs the statue.

Once when preparing to leave for yet another field trip my wife came to me in tears. Our time together had been dwindling and her heart was breaking. She asked me not to leave. I so very much wanted to go on this particular trip. But I didn't fight or argue. Given the option of seeing and studying beautiful rock formations vs loving and caring for my beautiful wife I chose the latter.

His impeccable democratic credentials lent credibility to an interim government whose mandate was to deliver free and fair elections. Eight months later, newly elected President Alejandro Toledo asked him to serve as Ambassador to France.
This was one of the most emotionally exhausting experiences of my life. While I was aware that home pregnancy tests always need to be confirmed by a doctor, I really didn't realize that false positives were very much of a possibility. The instructions even say that false negatives are more likely than false positives, and that both are extremely rare. The over 99 percent accuracy that is advertised on all HPTs leads one believe that they are trustworthy. Imagine the toll on my emotions when, after taking a test one day, I peeled back the shower curtain to discover a little blue plus sign. Shock, excitement, fear, anxiety, and general head-spinning were in order. I stared at the test for a good five minutes before bringing it outside, taking a few pictures in different lighting to make sure it wasn't all in my head, all in between a pounding heartbeat and clasping my hand over my mouth and wondering how in the world I was going to tell my husband. Would he be worried since this was before we had decided to get pregnant? How would we pay for all of this? How would I continue working during the dreaded vomiting of the first trimester? I immediately ran out to the store and picked up different brands of tests to confirm. I waited until the next morning to test again, only to be greeted by only one pink line, not two. The test was negative.

6. Belief. Believe in yourself. Your inner strength, your resiliency.
Thicke is denying the allegations. His lawyer responded to the documents, telling People in a statement, Paula never reported any domestic violence until she was in a position of contempt by violating the custody orders. DCFS asked both Paula and Robin to drug test. Robin agreed and submitted to his test, but Paula refused to test. Infidelity has nothing to do with custody. She is attempting to throw anything at him to hurt him, but Robin's focus is their son.

As is evident from the pages of the novel itself, Liz Bennet is no slouch when it comes to laying down the law. In short: Don't mess with her. She'll end you.
You OK? one of my co-workers asked. She had worked her entire career in the store and could tell that I wasn't remotely OK. Don't let the customers get to you, she said, placing an arm around my shoulder and leading me toward the break room. There's free pizza and salad today. You look like you could use some.

Try not to get too annoyed or frustrated with this person, even though it can be taxing to deal with, said Jessica Baum, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach, Florida. Remind yourself that the other person might have low self-esteem or that maybe they feel out of place and could be unaware of their behavior. Patience is really important here.
Faced early in his first term with a threatened U.S. cutoff of funds in the event of Israel's ouster, he worked behind the scenes to stop Arab efforts to deprive the Jewish state of its General Assembly seat. There was muted criticism from the Arab camp that he had given the Americans the right of way in the Middle East.
That's because money also is a sort of emotional currency in relationships. It can be a vehicle for communicating certain messages that are not being put into words between two people. When misused, money can be a bid for power, control or punishment. Spending can also be used as a stand-in for other unmet needs.
But she had no regrets. She felt like nothing would change before she died unless she acted on her decision. There was nothing to lose.
As I stood in the parking lot, soaking wet, I was finally able to admit what I'd tried so hard to hide ― both from others and myself: I was embarrassed by my job. A job that was supposed to be a bump in the road for me. I was 40 years old and had a family at home. After spending thousands of dollars earning my degrees, I never imagined I'd end up pushing carts in the pouring rain. I shopped at this store ― I wasn't supposed to work here! I took my vest off and headed inside.

I knew getting my finances under control wouldn't happen without effort. Still, my two kids were finally both full-time in school. I saw an opportunity to push further in my career than I'd ever been able to do as a mom at home with the kids. I was excited to sink my teeth into new and exciting work, and I did. I scrimped and saved and cut back on expenses. I put just enough gas in the car to get the kids to school and get back home. But no matter what I did, I'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. I'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.
Our ultimate goals are simple but far-reaching, Velez-Jackson told The Huffington Post.

Amy Rollo, a psychotherapist and owner of Heights Family Counseling in Houston, agreed. As a couples therapist, it is actually rare for money stress to be the biggest issue.

I'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. That means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. Couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. Therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― Zach Brittle

For a while, I didn't think getting a prenup was something we needed to do. Neither of us were walking into this marriage with major assets.

Beth fell for Larry shortly after she left a really turbulent relationship with her bi-polar-ish first husband. Beth felt responsible for him, and said she hung on much longer than she should have. Devastated and emotionally drained following her break-up, this handsome, capable and calm Larry felt like just the ticket. They dated for several years, during which time they each pursued professional degrees. Beth remembered that they fought rather intensely during periods of separation from each other, but had long months where they enjoyed a close and loving connection.
It's a cute enough joke, but it also distills the beginning and ending of so many diversity and inclusion conversations that we've had in recent years.

It seemed to be becoming a lot more sensitive to things such as exercise, sickness, and general life, whereas before, the thing did not falter during times of extreme physical, mental and emotional changes. I thought, Now is not the time for my periods to become irregular - they've had nearly 15 years to be irregular. Now is the time to be consistent and trustworthy, so I can properly carry out married life without the stress of trying to prevent pregnancy or become pregnant. Sadly, this was not the case. After visiting my doctor, I received the wisdom that I wish I would have received before this started happening. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. You are very healthy. You are older now, so your body is changing. This is is your new normal. As frustrating as this was, I was comforted by this being my new normal. I just so wish I would have been told to expect my cycle to change, as this would have saved so much unnecessary stress.

When I brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. He questioned why I had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. For starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.

In response, Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against Clinton, alleging the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee lied about Gabbard with obvious malicious intent to hurt her 2020 presidential campaign.
While I had begun the year exhausted by stress and financial worry, I felt a shift in my mentality after the first week of January. I realized how unexpectedly kind people can be. It's so hard to see sometimes because most people don't have the means to help others, and I don't just mean financially. People are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined. I certainly was caught up in mine.

Gabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.
I didn't really sacrifice anything to have an amazing marriage. Everything I let go has been repaid back many times over the years in terms of peace, harmony and love. What did I give up? Strife, anger, pain and suffering. What did I gain? A marriage beyond anything I could have ever imagined.
Staci found out that he had filed for divorce because a friend called her after seeing it in a local newspaper, a source told E! News. Staci wasn't even served with divorce papers so she filed her divorce papers a couple weeks after finding out that Evan filed. He never communicated that to her.

Although I'm not religious or an avid believer in astrology, I didn't argue with my parents' reliance on the astrologer's recommendations because it was just easier than trying to dispute the accuracy of his claims. They found solace in knowing that the Universe was somehow supportive of key milestones for me, and for most of my life, my personal pursuits seemed to be reinforced by the cosmic world they believed in, so I chose not to rebel.

I felt my financial struggles gaining on me, so I picked up extra jobs wherever I could, bargain-shopped and sold items that were sitting in my garage. I tried hard to get ahead of it. Still, I wondered if January 2020 would be the year that it all came crashing down. For a while, it was all I could think about. I wondered how anyone, especially single parents, was able to financially survive in modern times. Personally, I felt like I was constantly underwater.
I'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. That means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. Couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. Therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― Zach Brittle
PeopleImages via Getty Images Money is rarely just about numbers, said psychologist Joy Lere. But it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker.
I've heard of many. There was a middle-aged man whom I met at a reading. He said he was shocked after reading my story. He had never thought about it that way and began worrying about his own wife resigning. He said he had a mental breakdown and decided he needed to change before his own wife quit. He said that he had got rid of all the unnecessary things for holiday preparations and went to the movies with his wife after almost 20 years of marriage, which made them both very happy.

Recognize and capitalize on the good choices you make while realizing and mitigating the bad choices you make.

I've not always been a virtuous man. I'm learning so much and so many of you in this room have given me opportunities to try to get it right and I'm deeply grateful. But I think together, hopefully, we can be unified and actually make some changes. It's great to vote, but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves, Phoenix continued, pointedly adding that his fellow actors don't need to be taking private jets to Palm Springs.
Months have passed since that fateful reading and my parents have come around with their blessing and are now happily participating in our wedding planning.

None of my friends have ever openly talked about getting a prenup before their marriage and if they did get one, they kept that secret and swallowed the idea of releasing that information to their close friends. Some people feel the decision is private, but society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life ― the actual wedding day.
Do we need to get married or can we just ditch the legal document?
However, the United States under Trump has pushed to remove such language from new U.N. resolutions. The Trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund because it believed it was linked to an abortion program, but the U.N. said that was an inaccurate perception.

However, if you struggle to see finances in the same way, or have different values when it comes to money, it can be helpful to work with a couples therapist. Counseling can help each person learn how to express their needs, while also providing validation and empathy for their partner's needs and viewpoint, according to Rollo. The way we view money can be such a personal thing … this is why it is important for each partner to really get to the root with empathy and respect, she said.

In my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. Like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. When you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. So many of the issues I see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: People who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. Couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. Couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. A few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California

Couples who reach out earlier for support when things are amiss often head off a caustic, ugly pattern of hurting each other in ways that are hard to forget or forgive. Marriage therapists should be able to help partners identify the ways they express themselves when they are hurt or angry and to recognize how they may unintentionally put their partners on the defensive.― Linda Lipshutz, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida

What about Jyoti, who got married against the astrologer's recommendation? Now they're getting divorced! my mom exclaimed about a distant cousin whose five-year marriage ended mutually due to noncosmic reasons. My parents listed other examples of couples with unsuccessful marriages, neglecting the many other reasons those relationships failed besides astrological incompatibility. It was clear they didn't want me to become another horror story or the classic I told you so example that other parents would end up telling their children.
Marie Sarantakis, a family law attorney in Illinois, one of the other states with a pet custody law, said she has handled divorces in which one spouse uses a pet as leverage.

I think that the evidence needs to be gathered, and, as I have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such, Gabbard said at a CNN town hall in March.
As a person who's been through two years of transatlantic dating — and going on six years of marriage — I believe that it's healthy to retain some level of distance in a relationship, even for couples who do live under one roof. Maybe that's a weekend away with your girlfriends while he's fishing with his friends. Distance helps each of you stay self-sufficient and makes it easier to maintain respect towards each other. — Olga Baker

But there was a downside. I came to a point where I was sure I knew more than anyone else. In my mind no one was as intelligent as me and I was not terribly shy about sharing my knowledge. When my future wife and I were dating this side of my personality showed up. Repeatedly. But she knew exactly how to handle it. She simply broke up with me. SEVEN TIMES! Every time I got out of line she dropped me. It was some pretty hard core training, but I eventually learned.

Unlike his predecessor, Kurt Waldheim who was regarded as a workaholic and who spent long hours in his office, Pérez de Cuéllar liked to get away from it all. He is very jealous of his own privacy, a close aide said.

Alas, your tiny hope is not to be in vain! This Friday marks the release of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, a rather wily take on the Jane Austen classic, adapted from the book of the same name. In this zany flick you get all the wit and wisdom of Austen, and all the apocalyptic gore of zombies, in one awesome package. If you did have plans for this weekend, they're obviously all now going to be taking a backseat to seeing this movie.

She's able to keep her emotions in check under stress, she (usually) makes excellent judgments, and she knows how to work as part of a team -- this is what makes her great zombie-killing and co-parenting alike.

This was the problem with these well-meaning people in a nutshell. When Beth gets upset, or fights Larry on an idea, he withdraws. I'm not sure if he's protecting himself or her, but my guess is that it's a bit of both. And even though Beth says she wants a relationship of equals with two strong voices, she has a subtle way of appearing to be the expert. She says she wants an equal, but a real equal partnership will challenge her status as exclusive expert, especially on the kids. I'm not sure she's ready for that.
[Laughs.] Is that so? We have three generations. My parents' generation, my husband and my generation, and our son's generation. When we meet, we talk about social issues. We all have different ideas and perspectives. Nevertheless, we don't ignore others, and we don't say, you don't know any better. By listening carefully, we can at least understand where others' ideas stem from ― even if we don't necessarily share those opinions.

Nevenka: Breaking the Silence (Netflix Documentary)
I understand my parents' intentions regarding the horoscope matchmaking were nothing but positive. Throughout my life, my respect for them and my culture had dissuaded me from making decisions they might not agree with. I had silently complied with their need for astrological affirmation because it had never deterred me from what I wanted for myself. But this was where I drew the line. I did not feel comfortable with any of the astrologer's recommendations for fixing our problem.
Remember we had to get out of our current home soon and we had searched and searched until we found just the right place. My male need to be in control wanted to just brush her off for having unnecessary anxiety. But we are people of faith and I trusted her intuition in spiritual matters. So I called off the deal. She was right. Not long after I received an offer for a better paying job that required moving out of that area. Had I not listened to her we would have been locked into a 12 month lease.

Legend has it that way back in the third century the Roman Emperor Claudius II was building up a military and thought single men made better soldiers. So he outlawed marriage for young men. A priest, named Valentine, disagreed and thought the ban was unfair, and he continued to perform marriage ceremonies secretly.
After trying to reason that astrology is imperfect and would provide no tangible assurance about the strength of my future marriage, I realized it was time to say what I was really thinking. At that moment, I didn't care that the cosmic bodies had determined that my marital union would be doomed. I was willing to take the risk of spending the rest of my life with my chosen partner, confident that we could overcome any obstacles ― cosmic or otherwise ― together.
Don't take it personally if your crush is just not that into you, Taylor said.
At our last session, I wondered about Larry's quiet demeanor. This followed my umpteenth observation that Larry appears to be a caring, engaged guy who loves his family and wants to make things better. That's worth a lot. When I asked Larry what keeps him so polite with Beth, he responded, I'm afraid of offending her. She easily gets offended. On a roll now, he described how he had been sleeping on the couch for a couple of years-!-because his wife was committed to co-sleeping with the kids. He didn't like the idea, he wanted his bed-and his wife-back, but, according to him, she became offended when he tried to bring this up. Wow!

However, if you struggle to see finances in the same way, or have different values when it comes to money, it can be helpful to work with a couples therapist. Counseling can help each person learn how to express their needs, while also providing validation and empathy for their partner's needs and viewpoint, according to Rollo. The way we view money can be such a personal thing … this is why it is important for each partner to really get to the root with empathy and respect, she said.
That completely caught her off guard, Sarantakis said. She never would have guessed it was something he wanted. She believed that the purpose of asking for the dog was to gain power and ask for other things. Luckily the case got resolved, and she kept the dog.
I know that not everybody understands that O'Hare can be a romantic place, but it absolutely can, Buttigieg said Monday.

We have learned a lot about sexual assault and other violence against women in the intervening decades, she said. The person who is most likely to sexually assault a woman is a man she knows — and resistance takes a different form when it's someone you know.

Some people resist the idea of a formal meeting with their spouse. They think it sounds like work. Why not just talk about things as they come up? Talking on the fly sounds very nice, and that is fine if you are able to do this effectively.

Love Dot Com: The Social Experiment (2019)
Certain things ― a root canal, a conversation with a relentless one-upper ― are easier to deal with if you just accept it's going to be rough going. If you're in regular conversation with a one-upper, just think of their habit as part of the package. Maybe even learn to laugh at it. (I wonder how many times they'll respond with a brag this time; last time, I think the count was four.)
Abercrombie pointed to Gabbard's present votes and frequent absences from the Hill as examples of this imbalance.

Daughters-in-law are often required to speak deferentially to their husband's family members. The language contains respect. But there's not much respect for the names of women. It is a problem that my generation does not dare to touch, but I think that it will change in the next generation.
A roomful of adults of different generations. It sounds like a recipe for squabbling!

She hadn't been politically active in the past, but 2020 really got me, and the pandemic took the cake, she said. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. When Trump started talking about a third term and then started a chant at a rally of '12 more years,′ I thought: 'That's it. That's a dictator.'
But she had no regrets. She felt like nothing would change before she died unless she acted on her decision. There was nothing to lose.

Strive for Agape, the unconditional love despite flaws and demonstrated by your behavior towards another person. Love yourself and your ex for what you once had - the good and the bad.

Long distance was not always ideal. It came with struggles, loneliness, longing and then a pandemic happened and made it a bit harder for a short time in our situation, Eames told HuffPost. That being said, the nature of our relationship has left us with tons of memories and experiences that are irreplaceable.
As I stood in the parking lot, soaking wet, I was finally able to admit what I'd tried so hard to hide ― both from others and myself: I was embarrassed by my job. A job that was supposed to be a bump in the road for me. I was 40 years old and had a family at home. After spending thousands of dollars earning my degrees, I never imagined I'd end up pushing carts in the pouring rain. I shopped at this store ― I wasn't supposed to work here! I took my vest off and headed inside.

You may say, That's the same as before, isn't it? But it isn't. The difference is my actions are now voluntary. No matter how good a duty of obedience is, no one enjoys doing it. It feels demeaning. But it's not unpleasant to do it voluntarily in a balanced relationship. Now the holidays have become a fun time to meet and talk about current events for hours, as well as cook and eat delicious food together.

I love traveling and seeing other parts of the world, which is coincidentally how we met. Since we started dating, I have been to Australia two more times and my husband has come to America four times before moving here. During those trips, we were able to play tourist in our respective homes and even see bits of each other's countries. In between those visits, we also got to travel together to Vietnam and Peru together. He proposed at Machu Picchu, which is something I will never forget. We figured that seeing each other would always require a flight on one end or the other, but we could break it up and meet each other somewhere, and then experience a new country together. — Eames

She noted that even though the law aims to take pets out of the property split in a divorce, the statute is in the property division section of the law, not in the family code section. But, she said in a phone interview, it's in a section that deals with unusual provisions, in what is generally a community property state where marital assets are divided equally. That puts the pet question in a special category.
Sister Wives viewers will just have to wait until the show's Jan. 8 episode to see how the family comes to terms ― or doesn't ― with Mariah's sexuality. Of course, their devout faith could be an issue. As Fundamentalist Mormons, the family still practices polygamy, which has been explicitly rejected by the mainstream Mormon church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
Canadian resident and Wuhan native Debbie Lu shares her perspective on the coronavirus outbreak. So many Westerners only know Wuhan in the context of the [virus], she laments. They don't know that we have famous authors and scholars and actors, or great street food, or hot summers. They don't know that we're known for our schools. So when people share negative opinions over social media about my home, because of coronavirus, I wish I could show them its better side — the side of Wuhan that I know and love.
Frankly, none of these solutions worked for me.

I couldn't sleep for weeks leading up to Dec. 25. I stayed awake refreshing my bank account on my phone to see if my paycheck had cleared. It finally did on the evening of the 23rd, and I frantically went out and did all of my shopping ― for my two kids and everyone else ― on Christmas Eve. Mostly, I crafted and made cookies and wrote heartfelt notes to teachers and people I wanted to do more for but couldn't, financially.
Many of my clients harbor an enormous amount of guilt for their failed marriage. Let go of guilt. William Pinsof (president of the Family Institute at Northwestern University) reported in The Death of Till Death Do Us Part: The Transformation of Pair-Bonding in the 20th Century, that, for the first time in the human history, divorce has replaced death as the most common endpoint of marriage. This unprecedented shift in patterns of human coupling and uncoupling requires a new paradigm, that is, a more humane approach for social policy, family law and marital therapy. (Remember Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin consciously uncoupling). By seeking a more humane approach to navigating your divorce and post-divorce life, it's easier to forgive yourself and your ex.
Or you're single and loving life... or single and wishing you had a husband.
I listen to what they have to say, then I explain that we do banners from both sides. One guy was telling me how irresponsible it was to inflame political attitudes with the anti-Trump messages. I'm listening politely, but I'm thinking to myself, 'What the hell? Your side just stormed the Capitol.'
Fairy tales promote the effortless happily-ever-after marriage myth when we are at an impressionable age. Later we view romantic movies and read novels with happily-ever-after endings.
A fruitcake was originally a symbol of wealth and prosperity because of its precious ingredients such as dried fruits, alcohol and spices, London pastry chef Chris Dodd told Vogue. Furthermore, the cake, in a way, represented the vastness of the British empire, using ingredients from far-flung corners of the globe. A wedding was, and is to this day, a time of celebration, and as such it calls for a cake to match the occasion.

However, Susan Sorenson, a gun violence researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that Goessling's brief relied in part on research that is more than 30 years old.
I used to love Christmas, but this past year, as soon as all the gifts were unwrapped and I'd polished off the last sugar cookie while standing over the sink, all I felt was relief. There had been arguing with my estranged husband about holiday plans, and a sad, toxic mediation session that took place just a few days before Christmas. I had burst out crying in the first five minutes. In an effort to stand up for myself and my kids, I yelled and raged, and I left feeling angry and broken, wondering why on earth we had decided to schedule mediation so close to the holidays. But mostly, what kept me up at night was a heavy, consuming financial stress that had been building for months.

You can share your take on their behavior and do so in a loving way, she said. If the one-upping is hindering your relationship, it's OK to speak up and share that you need them to listen to you more, because you want to connect with them and feel that they care about your experiences, too.
On the issue of dating for those of you widowed or divorced or never married... you are your own good luck charm. Don't turn down a date. You may meet someone other than your blah date that evening. Keep yourself fit, informed and spirited and most importantly...be a good picker. Don't rush. It is the most important decision you will make in your life. Use your brains.

In dealing with human rights issues, he chose the path of discreet diplomacy. He refrained from publicly rebuking Poland for refusing to allow his special representative into the country to investigate allegations of human rights violations during the Warsaw regime's 1982 crackdown on the Solidarity trade union movement.
Since I know what it was like before, I feel like the present situation with my husband's family is a sort of miracle. Actually, I feel more intimate with them after submitting my resignation letter. I've grown to think of them as actually really good people.
It's become an inevitable game, of sorts, every awards season for the last several years (particularly in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite in 2015), for us to tally up so-called diversity and inclusion wins.

When I can, I read everything but United Nations documents, Pérez de Cuéllar confided to a reporter. Once on a flight to Moscow, an aide observed that in the midst of it all, the secretary-general had time for splendid literature.
Perhaps one of the best things about a long-distance relationship is the space that you have. You have lots of time for the things you love, for yourself, for missing each other. You get the benefits of being in a relationship, but can still enjoy your free, independent life.
Police conducted multiple ground and aerial searches, but found no sign of Leigh. The case was coming to an abrupt standstill when, on Sept. 9, 1992, Yarborough contacted police and told them she'd received a package in the mail containing Leigh's missing eyeglasses. They'd been delivered in an 8-inch envelope, addressed in block letters to B Yarborough. The return address was the same as the mailing address.

Girl, you got this. You're strong, brave and beautiful. You are a powerful woman who is fully capable of rocking out this adulthood thing. You're in your twenties - maybe single, maybe married, maybe soon to be - and you are simply amazing. Don't worry. Stay close to your Father, and your sisters, and rock some red lipstick when you feel down. I'm here for you. Go kick some a**!
Coffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? Steinberg said. Plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' If you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.
The average couple that comes in for therapy has been struggling for about six years. This means they've been unhappy for much longer than they needed to be. One reason to get into therapy early is to get ahead of the curve and address issues before they become problems. ― Zach Brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter
I have my regrets. I also regret not quitting sooner. Had I acted at an earlier date, I could have created a more equal and respectful environment for my children. At the time, my husband's family felt like this insurmountable, enormous rock, and it was scary. But then I realized that I too am a person with power.

These people offered their service every single day to so many people who judged them unfairly, who judged them based on their titles of cashier and bagger without seeing who they were ― working single mothers, kind-hearted retirees, teenagers saving for college, middle-aged college grads down on their luck. The people who served us our food, rang up our groceries and made it possible for us to do what we needed to every single day aren't so different from us. They were more similar than I ever knew. I was just too wrapped up in myself and my own privilege to ever realize it ― until I became one of them.

But you might want to mention something when your partner is watching television, reading a book, or is otherwise occupied. You might be waiting for a right time that never comes. And if you do bring up a sensitive matter when it's the last thing your spouse is in the mood to discuss at the moment, you might feel like you have entered a minefield.

7. Curiosity. Be curious about everything. Be an explorer.
The ease of confident self-care. This ties right in with the above. I wish someone would have told me how much the opinions of my husband regarding my appearance would bring me to a place of self-acceptance that I never knew before. This played out in the simplest of things such as shaving my legs. Of course my goal is always to be well-kept, but I am amazed just how much insecurity regarding how I look has been lost. I just don't really care anymore. This is not to say that I no longer care about keeping up with my appearance. Quite the opposite - my husband's affirmation of my looks and him telling me regularly that I am beautiful gives me the extra boost of confidence I need to care just enough. Not too much to where I obsess over my appearance, but not too little to where I become lazy and unkempt. While I love how good and confident it feels to be well-kept, I also know that my husband just doesn't care if it's been 4 days since I shaved my legs, or if I wake up and decide not to do my hair. This is one of the best and most beneficial things I've found about marriage so far. And I do know that some husbands can have the opposite affect on their wives, based on how they affirm, or how they cut down.

One possible remedy was an ancient practice called Kumbh Vivah, a ritual whereby a woman first symbolically marries an earthen pot or banana tree to remove the horoscopic error, something my mother had done herself. The objective was to neutralize the negative influence of Mars in an effort to transfer the bad luck that would otherwise befall her future husband to the artificial groom (the tree, pot, etc.), thereby allowing the bride to have a peaceful future marriage.

A wonderful land or cruise vacation is not guaranteed by luck. You have to do your research. I suggest not using some travel agent behind a computer who has probably traveled less than you. Ask traveled friends for the name of their travel agent. If you enjoy the same type of travel ask friends or acquaintances, you respect, for restaurant and hotel suggestions. My southern friend, Norma Jean, taught me how to persuade the clerk, in every hotel, how to get 'a room with a view.' We are never too old to ask and never too old to learn, dear readers. Just use your brains.
As a person who's been through two years of transatlantic dating — and going on six years of marriage — I believe that it's healthy to retain some level of distance in a relationship, even for couples who do live under one roof. Maybe that's a weekend away with your girlfriends while he's fishing with his friends. Distance helps each of you stay self-sufficient and makes it easier to maintain respect towards each other. — Olga Baker

Alas, your tiny hope is not to be in vain! This Friday marks the release of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, a rather wily take on the Jane Austen classic, adapted from the book of the same name. In this zany flick you get all the wit and wisdom of Austen, and all the apocalyptic gore of zombies, in one awesome package. If you did have plans for this weekend, they're obviously all now going to be taking a backseat to seeing this movie.
She had no idea how much it meant, though. With this gift, I'd finally be able to get out of the hole I had basically been in for two years since getting separated. I'd be starting 2020 with a clean slate, rather than yet another late mortgage payment. It was maybe the most meaningful gift I'd ever gotten and it came from someone I'd never met or even spoken to before online.

It's easy to let your sexual relationship fall to the wayside when you're with your partner every single day, especially during a pandemic. But a thriving sex life takes work and commitment. In LDRs, people are forced to nurture aspects of their relationships that they might not have otherwise — this is especially true with sex. We don't have a playbook for LDR sex lives so we can get creative with it. It can become a multimedia erotic love fest between nude pics, FaceTime sex, mutual masturbation and sexting. — Gigi Engle, author of All The F*cking Mistakes: A Guide to Sex, Love, and Life
So many of our customers did this without knowing whom they were talking to. And as I handed her the receipt without meeting her eyes, it hurt me to know that I was once one of them. No, I never belittled them or acted rudely, but I did think I was better than them. Maybe it was the education or the house in the affluent town, the one I could barely afford.

Sorenson said she is unaware of any current research that supports the idea that a woman who resists with a weapon is less likely to be sexually assaulted.

Smeal said she was especially concerned with Goessling's record on guns.

This tradition dates back to the 19th century when Prince Albert's grandmother gave Queen Victoria some myrtle ― a symbol of good fortune in love and marriage ― which Victoria then planted in her garden at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She cut a sprig from that plant when her oldest daughter, Princess Victoria, got married in 1858. Since then, Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana and Kate have all carried a bouquet with myrtle from Victoria's garden. The same bush is still thriving.
According to Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre, investigators became suspicious and asked Yarborough to take a lie detector test. She was polygraphed three different times ― once by a local polygraph examiner and twice by the FBI – and failed it three times, the chief said in a 2009 interview with this author.
We realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. These were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.
Before continuing any financial conversation together, we decided to spend time separately going through our finances. We each created a spreadsheet with the current state of our bank accounts, our investments our retirement funds, and our debt. We also decided to write down what we both felt we were comfortable combining and what we wanted to keep separate (to be used for a potential future prenup).
When my wife and I got married I knew there would be some things I would be giving up. Most men worry about never sleeping with another woman again or not having the freedom to go out with the guys. I'll grant you that the first absolutely applies. The second? Not necessarily.
I think that the evidence needs to be gathered, and, as I have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such, Gabbard said at a CNN town hall in March.
Her declaration of resignation as eldest daughter-in-law changed almost everything. Her husband, whom she moved in with again after knee surgery in September 2017, finally began to listen to her, and the annual ancestral rites and holiday ceremonies, which had been a source of immense strain and stress, were simplified. She and her husband grew in respect for one another, and ended up not divorcing. The change that occurred in her daily life was significant enough that she has called it amiracle, even a small revolution.
Part of me felt like sending the money back. It was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. I'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason. But I realized, this woman really wanted to help, and clearly she was able to. She didn't seem to need a lot of thanks or even acknowledgment ― she didn't want anything at all. It was hard to find the right words to express my gratitude.

If the one-upping is hindering your relationship, it's OK to speak up and share that you need them to listen to you more, because you want to connect with them and feel that they care about your experiences, too. - Jessica Baum, psychotherapist in Palm Beach, Florida
What if every time he points fingers, we give hugs.
The new law recognizes that the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship, Ireland's Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan, said in a statement on Wednesday.
Before making the decision, we decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date, to talk about what kinds of terms we could include in a prenup and what we could potentially add to it later on. This felt like a smart and proactive choice to help protect us from outcomes we weren't necessarily ready for since we weren't planning for them to happen.
He served 50 days in Los Angeles County jail and had to register as a sex offender before returning to his home state of New York. He died in 1987.
That has never been a bother to me, she told this author.
Additionally, Lere said that the circumstances and spirit under which the debt was accumulated can color the impact it has on a couple. If a disproportionate amount of debt belongs to one person (whether it was accumulated before or during the relationship), it can lead to feelings of resentment if the repayment requires deep sacrifice of a partner.
Two years ago, after eight years of marriage, my husband moved out and even though the change was good and long overdue, financially it was utterly devastating. I had two kids to take care of, a mortgage to pay and bills that never seemed to stop coming. While part of me was excited to tackle it all on my own, I had only worked part-time while caring for my kids. In that sense, I'd never done it all on my own. I was terrified.
Phoenix has previously been nominated for Globes five times over his career for films like Her and Gladiator, but has only taken home the award once before for his role in Walk the Line, which also scored him an Oscar nod.
Authorities determined the package had been mailed from Booneville, a small city located roughly 30 miles north of Tupelo. The envelope was sent to the state crime lab in Jackson for handwriting analysis and DNA testing, but nothing of evidentiary value was found.

The hurricane, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached Tupelo, left no permanent mark on the city, which is best known as the birthplace of Elvis Presley. However, the disappearance of 13-year-old Leigh Marine Occhi did, and it still hangs like a thick cloud over the city.
As the next few weeks went by, I did my best to bring up my ring times and even tried to memorize some of the produce codes. My co-workers helped, including the young supervisor. But I still found myself hiding when mothers I knew walked by. While I couldn't shut my light off and pretend my lane was closed, I did other things.
She noted that budget constraints could hinder the law's effectiveness. What is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence, Martin said. We are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence. Cases of emotional abuse far exceeded reported cases of physical abuse in Ireland in 2017, according to data obtained by Women's Aid. That year alone, there were 15,833 reports of domestic violence. Of those, 10,281 were cases of emotional and psychological abuse, and 3,502 were cases of physical abuse. Additionally, there were 1,443 reported cases of financial abuse and 607 reported cases of sexual abuse.
When I was born in a dingy hospital in Ahmedabad, India, 29 years ago, my parents were handed two documents: a birth certificate and a natal chart. The doctor informed my mom that the latter, also known as a birth chart, was an astrological map that revealed how the position of the sun, moon, planets and other celestial bodies at the time I was born would influence my behavioral tendencies, character traits and life purpose.

COVID has kept so many loved ones apart. But being in a long-distance relationship prepared me and my husband well. We already know exactly what to do to keep love strong and alive while apart. We've been doing those things for years! — Gladly
Gabbard's announcement comes as the coronavirus pandemic drastically changes the presidential race and other 2020 campaigns. The leading Democratic candidates — Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have been forced to suspend typical campaign fixtures such as rallies and door-to-door campaigning as cases of the disease have been reported in all 50 states.
Don't let anybody tell you that O'Hare isn't romantic, he quipped.
In the last two decades, there have been plenty of maybes and what ifs, but the complete portrait of the crime has remained blurred. Now, 25 years after the fact, WTVA News promises to reveal new twists, turns and developments in the long-dormant case, though it's unclear whether there will be any answers.
1. Go into the conversation expecting it.
I could hear the soft tapping of keys as the astrologer input our data to determine if our marriage would be suitable. The room was filled with palpable tension. ... We all understood that this analysis was a make-it-or-break-it moment for my parents. 'Sixteen,' he answered moments later. 'Not compatible. The marriage will not work.'

These brands and their business leaders should demonstrate true leadership and stand for those customers they've courted by helping to combat this harmful decision, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement.
Frankly, none of these solutions worked for me.
On March 14, two months ahead of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, the queen gave her formal blessing for the nuptials in an official letter that read: I declare my consent to a contract of matrimony between my most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle.
The hateful rhetoric against the LGBT community that is being cultivated seemingly for cynical political purposes will only deepen their suffering and create unnecessary divisions, he said.
In 2009, the same year the police chief revealed the alleged results of the lie detector tests to this author, Yarborough said she was well aware they'd considered her a person of interest.
None of my friends have ever openly talked about getting a prenup before their marriage and if they did get one, they kept that secret and swallowed the idea of releasing that information to their close friends. Some people feel the decision is private, but society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life ― the actual wedding day.
I'm a writer, I told a random man one day, though he never asked. He was purchasing an expensive bottle of liquor. Please don't put the bread on the bottom of the bag, he said and returned to his phone call. He never looked at me, not once, throughout the entire transaction.

This was a mutt they got at the pound, and it wasn't worth money, said family attorney Erin Levine of Oakland, California, who represented the husband and said the judge gave her grief for not settling the dispute out of court in the 2015 case. There was no way we weren't going to litigate this; they were so attached to the dog.

So, what if you or your partner is dealing with a load of debt? Is it a death sentence for the relationship?
More and more I hear Canadians making mean and disparaging comments about those who disagree or have different points of view. I also hear racist remarks, which is terribly distressing. It's not who we are as a nation. Some of the things said after the shooting at the Mosque in Quebec made me feel like I was at a Trump rally.

3. The newlyweds serve fruitcake at the reception.
If all else failed, I'd offer to wipe down the registers or handle returning items to the shelves, which, of course, was also risky. There was always the possibility of running into someone I knew in the aisles. Then I would be forced to listen as they droned on about their latest vacation, or worse, asked me where something was. I'd have to admit I often didn't know because I worked at the front of the store instead of in the center.

Prior to his chat with Meyers, Buttigieg briefly alluded to his personal connection to O'Hare in December, while accepting the nomination to serve as transportation secretary under President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, Pete and Chasten's love story will soon be making its way to the small screen. On Monday, Amazon Studios announced plans to release Mayor Pete, a documentary directed by Jesse Moss that will examine Buttigieg's 2020 campaign as the first openly gay presidential hopeful from a major party.
My gold charm is lovely to look at with its many lucky charms embedded into its circular disc. A four leaf clover, an elephant, a horseshoe, an evil eye, the Arabic good luck sign, a heart and a number 13. I don't feel strongly about it but I figure, every bit of luck helps. I am very attached to a tiny gold Chai (meaning long life in Hebrew) hanging on the same connecter, a gift from my brother, Scott, brought back from Jerusalem. My good luck pieces feed my spirit. They do not bring me luck.
That is not an exceptionally high priority of this administration, he said.
1. Forgive yourself (and your ex)
Now, a pack of celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres, Tegan and Sara and Patricia Arquette, are calling to boycott the vacation hot spot ― at least until its residents make equality the law of the tiny land.
A lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. We both had different ideas about how to go about doing this.

1. Go into the conversation expecting it.
For more than two decades, authorities have dissected and combed through the evidence. Theories and suspicions abound, but the teenager has yet to be found.
Sarantakis said the pet custody cases can sometimes become more emotional than disagreements over children.
When a one-upper brags, they misjudge how the story will play for others. If I tell my co-workers about how I quit my first job at 22 to backpack through Europe for a whole year, they'll think it's romantic and cultured sounding! the one-upper thinks.Maybe they'll want to join me on my next smaller trip.
I Don't Know How She Does It (2011)
We realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. These were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.
After sharing our spreadsheets, we decided to reach out and get help. A lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. We both had different ideas about how to go about doing this; I wanted us to live on a tight budget to increase our savings and my partner wanted us to invest more now.
Noting that she had very close LGBTQ friends, Robyn added, All adults should be able to choose who they love, and how they structure their family.
This is Dominique, back on the newsletter this week — this time from sticky, sweltering Singapore, where the streets have been disquietingly empty as people have battened down the hatches and taken shelter out of fear of getting ill with the novel coronavirus. Below, a native of Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the sickness, shares her perspective on the virus terrifying the globe — but let's not dwell on that for the time being.
Everyone from all three generations prepared the dinner and washed the dishes together. My son bought coffee after he finished eating, and everyone was very happy to have coffee and tea together. I felt so content because I felt a great sense of cooperation and equality. I realized again that my ordinary life had changed like a miracle.
4. When you do ask, don't make it weird.
If that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers, a longtime Whole Foods store employee in Austin told Yahoo Finance. That's what makes Whole Foods Market different from our competitors.
But there was a downside. I came to a point where I was sure I knew more than anyone else. In my mind no one was as intelligent as me and I was not terribly shy about sharing my knowledge. When my future wife and I were dating this side of my personality showed up. Repeatedly. But she knew exactly how to handle it. She simply broke up with me. SEVEN TIMES! Every time I got out of line she dropped me. It was some pretty hard core training, but I eventually learned.
Gwen saved my life, Shelton later explained. Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can't even imagine the similarities in our divorces.
On the issue of dating for those of you widowed or divorced or never married... you are your own good luck charm. Don't turn down a date. You may meet someone other than your blah date that evening. Keep yourself fit, informed and spirited and most importantly...be a good picker. Don't rush. It is the most important decision you will make in your life. Use your brains.

The Big Bang Theory actor admitted in a 2019 interview with E! News that the two have an unconventional marriage, but it suits them.
There's no doubt that being in a long-distance relationship comes with its challenges: trying to coordinate time to talk across different time zones, making plans to see each other when your work schedules or finances (or the current pandemic) don't allow for it and going long stretches of time without that coveted face-to-face connection.
This is something I think you could see creeping up in statehouses across the country, said Crystal Moreland, California state director for the Humane Society of the United States. Once California gets involved in something, you tend to have a national effect.
Months before, we'd greeted each other in the checkout line as we discussed a school fundraiser she was organizing. She didn't need to work. Her family appeared to live well as a single-income family. I remember that day I'd pushed a couple of coupons I intended to use under a bag of rice, hiding them, when I saw this woman approach. I hated that I had moved to the other side of the register and was now serving her.
In honor of the original and the unmatched Pride and Prejudice as well as this refreshingly irreverent take on feminism and great literature, here are a few things we ALL can learn from P&P heroine Elizabeth Bennet -- the old and the new.

6. Belief. Believe in yourself. Your inner strength, your resiliency.
But Gabbard lagged behind much of the crowded 2020 field in polling over the past year, failing to win even 1% of the vote in Iowa or New Hampshire, the first two states to hold primaries.
While practicing patience and empathy is usually the best approach, that can be difficult when you're close to the one-upper and their bad habit is starting to chip away at your goodwill toward them. In this case, healthy and kind communication is a big step in the right direction, Baum said.
The film about the titular Batman supervillain went on to gross over $1 billion worldwide, becoming the first R-rated film in history to do so.
Murder Among the Mormons (Netflix Documentary)
Can I run to the ladies' room? I'd ask the supervisor on duty. I tried to flag down another shopper so they'd get into my line before the lawyer mother I knew who had just returned from a weekend of skiing did. I didn't want to ring up her organic dragon fruit or imported cheese.
Certain things ― a root canal, a conversation with a relentless one-upper ― are easier to deal with if you just accept it's going to be rough going. If you're in regular conversation with a one-upper, just think of their habit as part of the package. Maybe even learn to laugh at it. (I wonder how many times they'll respond with a brag this time; last time, I think the count was four.)
They say the course of true love never runs smooth and, for us, the biggest impediment was astrology.
Some of you may wonder why I harp so much on Donald Trump. There are a few reasons, not the least of which is that I detest everything he stands for. It just goes against all I believe in and hold dear. Plus, If he continues to head down this same path he's currently headed on, I believe he will put America -- and very possibly other countries, Canada included -- in danger.
Some audience members at this year's annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington likely did a double take when President Donald Trump hailed people of faith for their abolition of civil rights.
Last summer, I got engaged to a British Indian man. He, like me, is a product of a liberal upbringing but understands the need to respect certain facets of our culture.
In January, she invited Felker's band to join her on her Livin' Like Hippies tour. At the time, the frontman was reportedly still married to wife Staci Nelson, who later filed for divorce in February, according to People.

She has to be named with the 'P' rashi [moon sign], he told her before handing over the paperwork. Don't lose this.
Despite the police department's belief that Leigh was murdered, her mother was unwilling, in 2009, to give up the hope that her daughter was still alive.
Being in a LDR has created a stronger level of communication than I think would have developed if we were in a 'traditional' relationship. At any given point, we had a 14-to-16-hour time difference between us, sometimes more if I traveled out west. This worked really well for me because I worked overnight shifts, so most of the time we were both awake at the same time. On days off, one of us either woke up early or stayed up late to ensure that we could talk to each other.

Losing my wife 3 times in the grocery store and having her paged by customer service each time is why I get to stay home while she shops now
The world is consumed with problems, James Corden lamented on The Late Late Show Monday night.
How to deal with a chronic one-upper:
I was capable of more than ringing and bagging his groceries, I wanted to shout, hopefully jarring him from a call too important to allow him to acknowledge a fellow human being ― me. Instead, I looked at my growing line and thought of my ring times. I'd just have to make the next customer understand: I was not just a cashier. This was not a real job for me. I pushed the button to move their items down the belt and allowed myself to get lost in the hum of the store.

Still, as determined as we were, I will admit our astrological reading did give me temporary anxiety. This was the first time I would deviate from what astrology told me to do and for a moment, I wondered if I was going to jinx my marriage.
This quarantine has forced us to actually move in together, Cuoco said in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel Live From His House in April. It's been great for our relationship. And we like each other, we realized, which is even better!
But Marx said much is still up to the judge's discretion and that couples with pets get very differing receptions from the judges depending on how judges feel about pets. Some are sympathetic and some are 'why are you wasting my time?'
Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population but Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, is the only province that enforces Islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.
You may think from these stories that I'm a pushover and never have anything I desire. My friend, nothing could be further from the truth. I live in a home filled with joy and have a wife who always looks forward to spending time together. She loves me dearly and does whatever she can to give me the things I want.
Whether or not the Browns would adhere to any of the mainstream Mormon church's stances on LGBTQ issues in any way is unclear. In a 2013 HuffPost Live interview, however, the family said they supported marriage equality. We have established our family the way we've chosen to, we've organized it the way we wanted to, Kody Brown said in that interview, which can be viewed below. We believe that all people should be allowed to have that right.

I listen to what they have to say, then I explain that we do banners from both sides. One guy was telling me how irresponsible it was to inflame political attitudes with the anti-Trump messages. I'm listening politely, but I'm thinking to myself, 'What the hell? Your side just stormed the Capitol.'

Members of the Association of Certified Family Law Specialists in June testified before a California Senate committee that they opposed the bill because cases of marital dissolution and legal separation already face significant delays and issues of contention in court, particularly surrounding child custody.
I don't feel that she has the empathy or the emotional experience to do a good job in this role, she said. Once again, we are looking at another Trump nominee that will do the exact opposite than what is required of the position.
Shannon Lee Goessling, a Republican, is under consideration to lead the Office on Violence Against Women, which administers grants to support victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Advocates say Goessling has limited experience working in the domestic violence field, and has a history of opposing rights for LGBTQ people and immigrants.
In addition to distributing grants, the Office on Violence Against Women is meant to give victims a voice on the national stage, said Richard Gelles, professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
There is a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights, Guterres said. Women's sexual and reproductive rights are under threat from different sides.
But the road to box office glory was paved with much controversy, as some vocal critics have labeled the film dangerous and irresponsible over its empathy toward an angry white man who essentially becomes a self-radicalized domestic terrorist.
She expects the new law will encourage more of them to go before the judge, now that they know what criteria might be taken into consideration. With more people, especially millennial couples with no children, treating their pets like kids, she said, cases are about to get very complicated.

While Guterres did not name and shame, President Donald Trump's administration has led a push at the U.N. against the promotion of sexual and reproductive health services for women because the administration sees that as code for abortion.
I am quite certain you have looked at another person and said to yourself, She is so lucky. Well maybe she is but so can you be lucky because I think we all get a chance to get lucky in life.
Almost immediately, a member responded. I was excited because I didn't know if the message would get overlooked completely or if maybe someone had a quick writing or copyediting job to offer. The group member sent me a private message. She asked me what my Venmo name was. I responded immediately, assuming she wanted to connect for future payment, after I completed whatever work she had to offer, maybe transcribing something that wouldn't take too much time. I had said I was open to anything. Instead, my phone dinged immediately ― it was the sound of a Venmo payment coming through. This complete stranger had sent me $350 ― the amount I had specified that I was needing to earn in the next few days to make up the gap.
Sure, you may be aware that female wedding guests don fancy hats and fascinators for the ceremony (a British custom not just reserved for royals). Who could forget the bold headwear Princess Beatrice of York wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge? But there's probably quite a few traditions you've never heard of before. Below, we delve into some of the lesser-known ones.
When it comes to couples with debt, the money alone is not the root cause of relationship problems. It's the pressure and conflict that often arises from dealing with that debt that can bring to light other issues in the relationship.

She also came under fire for her former anti-LGBTQ views. Gabbard worked with her father at The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, a political action committee aimed at opposing lawmakers and legislation that promoted gay rights.
After trying to reason that astrology is imperfect and would provide no tangible assurance about the strength of my future marriage, I realized it was time to say what I was really thinking. At that moment, I didn't care that the cosmic bodies had determined that my marital union would be doomed. I was willing to take the risk of spending the rest of my life with my chosen partner, confident that we could overcome any obstacles ― cosmic or otherwise ― together.

But the road to box office glory was paved with much controversy, as some vocal critics have labeled the film dangerous and irresponsible over its empathy toward an angry white man who essentially becomes a self-radicalized domestic terrorist.

In October, judge Mark Warby agreed to Meghan's request to postpone the trial, scheduled to begin this month, until October or November 2021. He said the reason for the delay should remain secret.
More and more I hear Canadians making mean and disparaging comments about those who disagree or have different points of view. I also hear racist remarks, which is terribly distressing.

When issues remain unresolved, resentment can create a large and ugly divide between two people. This often manifests as lack of empathy, disinterest and at times, even disrespect. Go to therapy before arguments seem insurmountable because one or both of you have become apathetic. ― Talia Wagner, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California
I get to live like a local in two cities on opposite sides of the planet. We have friends in both places. Favorite hangouts and coffee shops in both places. Two vastly differently environments now feel equally like home. — Gladly
After I saw how my small actions prompted big change within my family, I realized that it wasn't just them that had needed to change ― but I had needed to change first.
Meghan, an American actress and star of TV legal drama Suits, married Harry, one of the grandsons of Queen Elizabeth II, in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born the following year.
Brad Pitt, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood
I've heard of many. There was a middle-aged man whom I met at a reading. He said he was shocked after reading my story. He had never thought about it that way and began worrying about his own wife resigning. He said he had a mental breakdown and decided he needed to change before his own wife quit. He said that he had got rid of all the unnecessary things for holiday preparations and went to the movies with his wife after almost 20 years of marriage, which made them both very happy.
The last time Congress officially declared war was Dec. 8, 1941, the day that the United States entered World War II, she said at a news conference. Ever since, Congress has failed to uphold this constitutional responsibility and has ceded this power to the president ― presidents of both parties.

To make their vision a reality, the pair are enlisting a diverse cast of queer performers from around New York City.
Oneupmanship can be born from all kinds of inner struggles. Sometimes it's rivalry, low self-esteem masked by bravado, an actual problem with lying or just having an awkward social presence, Rutherford explained.

The feature, which seeks to amplify Black conversations about Black hair, tells the stories of 18 people and their relationship with their kinky, curly, straight, dreadlocked and even hairless heads.
As all these changes happened in your family after you submitted your resignation, you clearly played a big role in this transformation.
Here is something I was not even close to being prepared for after getting married. I had no idea that being married would bring out so much of who I am as a person, to the point where I now feel more like myself than ever before. I believe this has everything to do with marrying a very good man. The right person will always enable you to flourish in your self-esteem, self-care, hobbies, interests and passions. I found myself moving towards things I'd always wanted to do, exploring my passions with great zeal for life, and completing tasks and projects I'd always meant to finish. Being with the right person has a way of giving you that zoom of strength you need to be fully and 100% yourself. The knowledge that someone not only loves and accepts, but also genuinely enjoys, you as a person, brings a steadiness to the heart like never before. I grew to a place where it didn't really matter anymore who thought what about me. I felt no shame in being 100% myself. I believe that a good and solid marriage does this for both people.

That is not an exceptionally high priority of this administration, he said.
Even though I grew up in a broken home my parents gave me one very important characteristic. They repeatedly told me I could accomplish anything I put my mind to. I loved it and reveled in how much they believed in me.

If an awards show in 2020 shuts out several brilliant female directors as nominees in favor of predictable male directors, if it completely snubs one of the best miniseries of last year, When They See Us, is it even relevant anymore?
Later in February, Arquette also called on followers to boycott Bermuda.
Your workplace is just that: a workplace, not a bar or a dating app for download. None of the HR experts we spoke to encouraged actively looking for love at the office, but they acknowledged it happens. And while it's less common for businesses to enforce or even have a non-fraternization policy, it's still important to determine if your company has one, said Teresa Marzolph, founder of Culture Engineered, a human capital consulting firm in Phoenix.

A few notable Netflix films debut throughout the month, including the documentary Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell and the prank comedy Bad Trip. Bad Trip stars Eric Andre, Tiffany Haddish and Lil Rel Howery, and was supposed to come out right as the pandemic started last year but got postponed from a theatrical run indefinitely. Netflix ultimately bought the rights, and now you get to see it.

At the age of 80, Pérez de Cuéllar emerged from retirement in Paris and returned to Peru to take on the mantle of foreign minister and cabinet chief for provisional President Valentin Paniagua.
That last question has stuck with me for quite some time. My fiancé and I have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. We've discussed topics like having kids, raising kids with a certain religion and our future career and relationship goals. We've always found ourselves seamlessly getting on the same page.
Two years after that initial 2015 exchange, the couple were visiting O'Hare before embarking on a vacation, where Buttigieg had planned to propose. And as it turns out, air travel turned out to be a fitting metaphor for their relationship.
To avoid becoming an office-wide pariah, be mindful of your surroundings and your body language when floating the idea of a date, Marzolph said.
You can share your take on their behavior and do so in a loving way, she said. If the one-upping is hindering your relationship, it's OK to speak up and share that you need them to listen to you more, because you want to connect with them and feel that they care about your experiences, too.
Phoenix has previously been nominated for Globes five times over his career for films like Her and Gladiator, but has only taken home the award once before for his role in Walk the Line, which also scored him an Oscar nod.
If the person declines, remember that this is a risky proposition, she explained. Your co-worker might have otherwise said 'yes' if you hadn't met at work. Many are averse to dating co-workers as a personal policy.

That completely caught her off guard, Sarantakis said. She never would have guessed it was something he wanted. She believed that the purpose of asking for the dog was to gain power and ask for other things. Luckily the case got resolved, and she kept the dog.
They say the course of true love never runs smooth and, for us, the biggest impediment was astrology.
Dear readers of mine, we will all continue to wear or carry are good luck objects. They are our comfort, like crossing our fingers when we need luck or praying please dear God let all be well in our family. We all want a little bloomin' luck.' So wear your good luck pieces but when glancing at them, think about your lifestyle and how 'you' can add another dimension of luck to your life.
And I'm not ashamed, or afraid, to say I don't like it.
Members of the Association of Certified Family Law Specialists in June testified before a California Senate committee that they opposed the bill because cases of marital dissolution and legal separation already face significant delays and issues of contention in court, particularly surrounding child custody.
Staci found out that he had filed for divorce because a friend called her after seeing it in a local newspaper, a source told E! News. Staci wasn't even served with divorce papers so she filed her divorce papers a couple weeks after finding out that Evan filed. He never communicated that to her.
Paradise PD (Part 3, Netflix Original)
There's a lot of apparent coincidence in this tale, WTVA's Jason Lee Usry says in the preview episode of the podcast, which can be found on iTunes or SoundCloud. A lot of coincidence, a great deal of mysterious behavior, and somewhere within one of the players in this story, a terrifying level of cruelty.
Bayard Rustin was a confidant of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a key organizer of the March on Washington in 1963. He also helped plan other nonviolent protests and boycotts to end racial discrimination.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's governor announced Wednesday that he is posthumously pardoning a gay civil rights leader while creating a new pardon process for others convicted under outdated laws punishing homosexual activity.
Similarly, your spouse may want to discuss a concern when you are busy. It is easy to take one's partner for granted, to forget to express appreciation. Chores can pile up or not be handled well. You may forget to plan dates and other enjoyable activities. By scheduling a time for a marriage meeting, you will get to reconnect every week.
Weber said the pardon helps leave Rustin's legacy in the civil rights movement uncompromised.

Publisher Mills & Boon, a romance imprint of British publisher Harlequin UK, said the story is based on Sarah's ancestor, Lady Margaret Montagu Douglas Scott, who fled an arranged marriage and the confines of polite society.
A week before the Indian engagement ceremony, my parents, brother, fiancé and I sat in our living room in Queens, New York, huddled around a phone to learn the astrologer's assessment of our compatibility. Kundali matching is a popular method in which the prospective bride and groom's horoscopes are compared under an obscure system that counts 36 points among the two horoscopes. If 18 or more points match, that's a match literally made in Heaven. Fewer than 18 matches means your marriage is not approved by the stars.
Nailed It!: Double Trouble (Netflix Original)
No, I actually think the letter was just a spark, a small starting point for change rather than a major personal achievement. It could've gone in a completely different direction. I am grateful to my family for having worked toward building the balanced and peaceful relationship we have now.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's big day is fast approaching, which got us thinking about all of the British royal wedding traditions we may (or may not) see on May 19.

Marriage therapy only works if both partners are committed to the process. But by the time some couples schedule an appointment, one or both partners has already checked out.
Gabbard, who has spoken out against interventionist wars in the past, was heavily criticized for a 2017 meeting with Assad on what her office called a fact-finding mission. She said had not initially planned to speak with Assad but when the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so, because of the possibility of achieving peace, Gabbard told CNN's Jake Tapper in 2017.

My fiancé and I are hoping to get married in London this coming September, once the global pandemic is over (or at least much less severe) and we can have our big fat Indian wedding safely in the presence of our close family and friends. There are still a lot of unknowns ahead of us but there's one thing I do know for sure: Astrology won't be on our guest list.

His son, Francisco Pérez de Cuéllar, said his father died Wednesday at home of natural causes. Current U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Peruvian diplomat a personal inspiration.
The nomination failed to win Senate approval. There was no public debate, but congressional sources in Lima said opposition came from Javier Alva Orlandini, Peruvian vice president and leader of the ruling Popular Action Party. The sources said Orlandini resented Pérez de Cuéllar's participation in the swearing in of the military junta that overthrew Belaunde Terry in 1968.
It's a cute enough joke, but it also distills the beginning and ending of so many diversity and inclusion conversations that we've had in recent years. Much of the Hollywood establishment believes that the point of contention is always about whether there are too many white people, or too many men and so on.
Appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers this week, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor shared select anecdotes about his nearly three-year marriage, including the reason he opted for a somewhat unlikely location ― Chicago's O'Hare International Airport ― to pop the question in 2017.
The famously private couple, who've been married for seven years, already co-parent two children from previous relationships. Weisz shares an 11-year-old son Henry with Mother! director Darren Aronofsky, while Craig has a 25-year-old daughter, Ella, with the actress Fiona Loudon.
In my work with couples, I've found debt can negatively impact a relationship, but doesn't have to, said Brent Sweitzer, a marriage counselor in Cumming, Georgia. Family therapist Virginia Satir famously said, 'Problems are not the problem. It's the coping.' I see this truth play out daily in couple interactions and communications.
Try not to get too annoyed or frustrated with this person, even though it can be taxing to deal with, said Jessica Baum, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach, Florida. Remind yourself that the other person might have low self-esteem or that maybe they feel out of place and could be unaware of their behavior. Patience is really important here.
In 2018, Gabbard introduced the No More Presidential Wars act, a resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from Congress in order to engage the military against any enemy. She also introduced a resolution that would make a presidential war an impeachable offense.

Now that you know most one-upping is fueled by the inability to read the room and relate to others, hopefully you'll respond differently the next time your pal does it. It's not them, it's their social awkwardness!
Like all questions of progress when it comes to diversity and inclusion, actually quantifying forward advancement, or using award shows to gauge that movement, is tenuous at best. Progress usually comes in stops and starts. One year, Moonlight may win the coveted Best Picture Academy Award. Another year, the white savior buddy movie Green Book may inexplicably take the top prize.
Love Dot Com: The Social Experiment (2019)
Just as I typically do ― or, at least, typical as things have been since I submitted my letter of resignation in 2013. After my letter, I didn't go to my husband's parents' home for two to three years. Then, when I did go, there again, I didn't cook ― as I normally would've done ― and we ordered in. But the food wasn't as good as home-cooked meals, so we started cooking one dish at home, and since last year, we've been cooking just enough jeon [Korean pancake] for our family to eat.
As the next few weeks went by, I did my best to bring up my ring times and even tried to memorize some of the produce codes. My co-workers helped, including the young supervisor. But I still found myself hiding when mothers I knew walked by. While I couldn't shut my light off and pretend my lane was closed, I did other things.
She also contends that Thicke endangered her with his infidelity and says the singer admitted to having unprotected sex with seven other women.
I needed to find a job that I could do at night once my husband came home. That way we'd eliminate our child care costs entirely and I would still bring in some extra money to help ease our other financial burdens. That's what I was offered by a grocery store located in the affluent town we could barely afford to live in.
7. And ultimately, life is too short to be miserable in your marriage.
Nevertheless, I continue to wear my red string and my gold charm around my neck. My red kabbalah string is truly comforting; guards and protects me (in my mind) and reminds me to always 'be aware' of the force of luck lurking around my corner. It makes me listen to my inner feelings.
The parliamentary commission drawing up recommendations has still to finalize its proposals, but a draft seen by Reuters includes measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated.
The above leads me to the reason for the pregnancy test in the first place. I really had no idea how much my cycle would change after getting married. It was very difficult to adapt. I'm sure it has to do partly with getting older and into my upper twenties, but I know marriage plays a role as well. My cycles had been like clockwork since the very beginning. From age 12, I always knew exactly when to expect their arrival, and never once were they missed or late. I do not exaggerate when I say I never missed a period, even during my early twenties when I was constantly traveling, changing time zones, and alternating my sleep schedules from day-shift to night-shift and then back again. The thing was a rock that wouldn't budge. Fast forward to my life as a new wife, and pair that with turning 26, and you get a recipe for disaster. Well, not really disaster. Maybe just extreme stress. Several times during my first year of marriage, my period was late. Not just a few days. Late, as in 2 weeks, sometimes 3. What do you think this resulted in? Me rushing out for pregnancy tests. Oh my gosh, why is it so late? It's never late! I've got to be pregnant! Nope, not pregnant. Just late. This left me very frustrated. Not only did this change occur, I also noticed changes with symptoms, intensity, and other variables.
I believe, in 99% of instances, you and I must make our own good luck.
The children can vocalize. With the dog, you don't know what they want, she said. She noted that sometimes judges award custody of pets in the same manner as children — when the kids go with mom, for example, so does the pet.
I'm referring, of course to Valentine's Day. And what a blessed relief it is to hit the pause button, take a break from hatred and celebrate love. I can't remember a time we needed it more.

Rustin was stripped of his leadership post at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist organization involved in the civil rights movement, after U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina read Rustin's arrest file into the Congressional Record.
But as people in LDRs will tell you, there are also some positive aspects to the experience that you may not have considered before.
Shortly after he proposed to me, our families decided to recognize our engagement in the traditional Hindu way, or as we colloquially call it, the coconut ceremony. During this ceremony, my fiancé and I would be given coconuts, money and other gifts from both sides of the families as a token of good luck as we formalized our commitment before God.
Avoid going from zero to 100 by establishing a friendship first, said Lynn Taylor, a workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job. This way, you'll find out early on whether you have anything in common besides mutual disgust of your boss' Tupperware lunches.
Australian's overwhelmingly voted yes in the national survey, and same-sex marriage was legalised in December last year.
What about Jyoti, who got married against the astrologer's recommendation? Now they're getting divorced! my mom exclaimed about a distant cousin whose five-year marriage ended mutually due to noncosmic reasons. My parents listed other examples of couples with unsuccessful marriages, neglecting the many other reasons those relationships failed besides astrological incompatibility. It was clear they didn't want me to become another horror story or the classic I told you so example that other parents would end up telling their children.
He emphasized that Aerial Messages is nonpartisan. The company flew several pro-Trump banners in Florida in the 2016 election paid for by Chinese and Russian entities, he noted. Flying banners usually cost $950 an hour, which includes two to four flyovers, depending on the distance from an airport.
To have an amazing marriage sometimes you need to give up your manly need to be in control and trust your wife.
Yarborough later said she'd heard there were tornado watches in the area and decided to call from work and check on Leigh at about 8:30 a.m. Nobody answered. Concern turned to worry, prompting Yarborough to drive home, according to the report.
6. The royal family member must receive the queen's formal permission to tie the knot.
But he said judges and family lawyers were concerned about how long it would take to settle pet custody in already-time-consuming divorce cases and that the new law might give spouses another avenue for revenge.
If you are going to have an amazing marriage then you'll need to let go of your male pride.
4. You lose empathy for your spouse the longer you stay bitter.
It's different for a one-upper. What sets them apart is their failure to relate to others and read social cues, said Amanda Deverich, a marriage and family therapist in Williamsburg, Virginia.
When I spent $100,000 earning two degrees, I never imagined I'd end up working as a cashier at my local grocery store but I needed the job.
We are informed by doctors we should have a yearly mammogram, a once a year body skin check with our dermatologist, a yearly physical and a routine chest x-ray. You initiate your own luck by being proactive. Your life is in your hands. Use your brains.
However, Gabbard reversed her public position on LGBTQ rights.
Weekly meetings foster direct, positive communication that addresses concerns at a time when both of you are likely to be receptive. You get to feel appreciated and valued, gain a smoother-running household by coordinating chores, and add romance by planning dates. Issues are resolved and challenges are met before they escalate into crises and grudges. Romance can continue throughout your marriage, but this usually will not happen automatically.
You may think from these stories that I'm a pushover and never have anything I desire. My friend, nothing could be further from the truth. I live in a home filled with joy and have a wife who always looks forward to spending time together. She loves me dearly and does whatever she can to give me the things I want.
I worked mostly nights and Sundays. Sundays were the worst because they were the hardest days to hide. It seemed like every family I knew shopped after church or their kid's sporting events. And it was on a Sunday that I broke down.
The husband offered thousands of dollars to his soon-to-be-ex for the pit bull terrier mix named Sweet Pea. The wife wouldn't accept the compensation, and insisted the dog was hers — a gift, in fact, from her husband.

She noted that even though the law aims to take pets out of the property split in a divorce, the statute is in the property division section of the law, not in the family code section. But, she said in a phone interview, it's in a section that deals with unusual provisions, in what is generally a community property state where marital assets are divided equally. That puts the pet question in a special category.
Still, there is hope for resolution. The case is now being analyzed in a new podcast, titled 13: The Search for Leigh Occhi, which is being released episodically by local NBC affiliate WTVA News.

You get the benefits of being in a relationship, but can still enjoy your free, independent life. - Olga Baker
Last week, my daughter and I gave a ride to a woman whose car had broken down. It took us five minutes out of our way ― it didn't cost a thing. This gift that was given to me, even though it was financial, helped me remember the tons of ways we can help one another and that we should do them as often as we can, despite our income bracket. The truth is that most people genuinely want to help. When we do, it creates a space for us to keep paying it forward in whatever ways we can. Easing someone's burden gives them the ability to help ease someone else's.
How would our relationship change once we got married?
She added: My parents immigrated from Cuba in the 1960s. They know what a dictator looks like. Trump and his supporters are authoritarian, completely offensive; they stand for what's completely contradictory to this country's ideals.
Debt can serve a stand-alone stressor, but when superimposed on other relational strain can amplify problems in a relationship, Lere said. Issues such as secrecy about spending, disagreements on how to handle finances and varying levels of comfort carrying a balance can all be sources of tension.

An entire coffee shop of people stared at me as I yelled and cried one afternoon while we went over our credit card statements and talked about the kind of purchases we could cut back on. I found myself feeling strong and sensitive about the fact that I've been single and independent for most of my twenties and have worked hard for my money. Though I've made money mistakes along the way, I was proud of my accomplishments, and at times, exposing my errors to my fiancé made me feel weak.

But there were surprising losses, too. (This excludes the works that were completely snubbed in nominations, like Ava DuVernay's stellar When They See Us, Lupita Nyong'o's performance in Us and Zendaya Coleman's role in Euphoria.) Eddie Murphy's comeback performance in Dolemite Is My Name failed to garner recognition; he lost to Taron Edgerton for Rocketman, and Dolemite was shut out altogether. Billy Porter of Pose (unsurprisingly) lost the Best Actor in a TV Series - Drama award to industry juggernaut Brian Cox of the wildly popular Succession. And, in one of the biggest snubs of the night, odds-on favorite Jennifer Lopez — dressed in gold — lost the Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture award to Laura Dern's wonderful albeit glorified cameo performance in Marriage Story.
When asked if Whole Foods will add consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola, Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said, As you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don't meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there's always that consideration. Amazon declined to comment.

The Hawaii representative was the only member of the House to vote present on the two articles of impeachment during the December vote to impeach President Donald Trump. She later explained that she could not in good conscience vote either yes or no on the two articles.
My parents, of course, met this decision with some resistance.
His first step was to shake the house with a highly critical report in which he warned: We are perilously near to a new international anarchy.

She noted that budget constraints could hinder the law's effectiveness. What is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence, Martin said. We are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence. Cases of emotional abuse far exceeded reported cases of physical abuse in Ireland in 2017, according to data obtained by Women's Aid. That year alone, there were 15,833 reports of domestic violence. Of those, 10,281 were cases of emotional and psychological abuse, and 3,502 were cases of physical abuse. Additionally, there were 1,443 reported cases of financial abuse and 607 reported cases of sexual abuse.

In the sessions, the most striking quality of this couple is Larry's reticence with Beth. He's a really smart guy, thoughtful, a well-regarded environmental specialist, but he seems dumb with his wife. While she threatens to give him the boot, he looks unruffled. But he's clearly hurt, and at our initial meeting he acknowledged not being able to sleep because of worry that Beth would leave.
I very quickly realized I was being irrational. My relationship with my partner was built on a foundation of mutual understanding, communication and real-life work. It is this same approach that we will rely on as a married couple, with no space for the Universe's opinion. For me, love is not a mystical phenomenon ― it is a manifestation of the respect and unconditional care that two people have for each other and that makes them want to spend forever with each other.

A year earlier, I'd left my corporate marketing job. While working there, it seemed as if I was working to pay for child care and little else. I also struggled to be there for my kids' sick days and school events. But my year off had nearly broken our family financially, and I needed to return to work.
We all have that friend: the one who one-ups you in conversation every chance they get. Sometimes it's a co-worker or family member, but what they all have in common is that anything you can do they can do categorically better.
Science backs this up. A 2015 study found that braggarts overestimated the extent to which their audiences would feel proud and happy, and underestimated their annoyance.

One of the perks was the memories we got to make when we'd see each other. On my weeklong trips to visit Dan in Portugal or Colombia, it was like a constant back-to-back date night because we had to pack it all in before I had to fly home again. We look back on those trips knowing that we spent such excellent quality time together in only seven days that it turned out to be like more quality time in total than the time that couples have together in a regular month living in the same place. — Becca of @Halfhalftravel

Whole Foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can't scale and be profitable, says Brittain Ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant. Amazon doesn't want to maintain the status quo. They can't see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in Whole Foods.
From January 1, 2019, women must feel change quickly. It must be positive, it must be practical and it must make them and their children safer from abuse, she said in a Tuesday statement.
However, Sweitzer points out that communication is much more than simply airing your grievances to each other. It's seeking to understand the other person and the many factors that shaped them, he said. For instance, how did the person with the debt get in that situation in the first place? What did they learn from childhood about managing money and the ethics of debt? Did they learn to cope with emotional difficulties by spending, by depriving themself?
I didn't imagine that it would be smooth sailing, Phoenix told Vanity Fair about the polarizing response to the film. It's a difficult film. In some ways, it's good that people are having a strong reaction to it.
Another solution was to have a puja, a ceremony initiated by a priest whose chants and prayers would ward off the inauspicious energy.

LONDON (AP) — Sarah, the Duchess of York, has landed a book deal for her debut novel for adults, a historical romance fictionalizing the life and loves of her great-great-great aunt.
What a great way to get out of the house and away from the kids for a bit, she said.
A healthy sense of self-esteem can make you near bulletproof to one-uppers, Deverich said. Resist competing with the bragger in your life; it's a waste of time, plus, there will always be someone who's done, seen and accomplished more than you have. Our goals are so highly personal and individualistic, what's the point of comparing?
That awkwardness is worth exploring a little: Most of us can read the room if we're coming across as braggy: If we jump on someone's sentence before they can finish getting it out or use their story as a jumping-off point for our own humblebrag, we'll notice that there's an awkward pause from the rest of the group once the interaction is through. We'll spot the occasional eye roll and realize, Oh, my gosh, I'm a thunder-stealing monster! and change our ways.
I told him [marriage] would be a lot like being in the airport, Buttigieg recalled. Life with me would be hard to steal private moments, but also full of adventure. Luckily for me, he said yes.
Nailed It!: Double Trouble (Netflix Original)
When my wife and I got married I knew there would be some things I would be giving up. Most men worry about never sleeping with another woman again or not having the freedom to go out with the guys. I'll grant you that the first absolutely applies. The second? Not necessarily.
I had initially regarded myself as too small and meager in comparison to such a huge rock ― and I felt I didn't have a voice. But after submitting my resignation letter and filing for divorce, I realized how much power I possess.

Beth and Larry, a mid-30's couple with two young daughters, came to see me on the verge of divorce. At least, Beth is on the verge of divorcing her mild-mannered husband. From the first visit, Beth was large and in-charge. This attractive woman, who runs a child-developement center, indicated that she felt let down by Larry in every way. He was no longer affectionate with her, he argued with her over what she considered petty things, and Beth had begun making plans to, as she put it, work on becoming effective co-parents-i.e., she was giving up on the marriage. This was her second marriage, by the way.

That only happened later, first in the 14th-century, when Geoffrey Chaucer incorporated Saint Valentine's Day into his love poem, The Parliament of Fowls and then, in 18th-century England, when lovers began giving flowers, confectionary and sent greeting cards.

I thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more I researched that, the more I realized I was wrong. Essentially, prenups are something for anyone to consider, regardless of how much money you have to your name, who wants protection or a legal game plan of what will happen if the marriage ends. Why argue about all of the assets you came into the marriage with, when the marriage is crumbling and on its final leg? Why not get that out of the way beforehand. The idea of a prenup or a legal financial document started to sound more and more attractive.

I love traveling and seeing other parts of the world, which is coincidentally how we met. Since we started dating, I have been to Australia two more times and my husband has come to America four times before moving here. During those trips, we were able to play tourist in our respective homes and even see bits of each other's countries. In between those visits, we also got to travel together to Vietnam and Peru together. He proposed at Machu Picchu, which is something I will never forget. We figured that seeing each other would always require a flight on one end or the other, but we could break it up and meet each other somewhere, and then experience a new country together. — Eames
Phoenix delivered an at times rambling, expletive-laden speech from the Golden Globes stage, first thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for making the evening's meal entirely plant-based before paying tribute to his fellow nominees.
Additionally, Lere said that the circumstances and spirit under which the debt was accumulated can color the impact it has on a couple. If a disproportionate amount of debt belongs to one person (whether it was accumulated before or during the relationship), it can lead to feelings of resentment if the repayment requires deep sacrifice of a partner.

For a period of time I was an Astronomy professor at a university and also took students on field trips to check out regional geological phenomena. As a professor I was respected and people generally followed my lead. I soon became accustomed to having whatever I wanted and however I wanted it. In short I pretty much always got my way. This is what men like.
To say that debt is ever a blessing is probably a huge stretch. However, it can serve as a tool for helping couples learn how to work together.

Police conducted multiple ground and aerial searches, but found no sign of Leigh. The case was coming to an abrupt standstill when, on Sept. 9, 1992, Yarborough contacted police and told them she'd received a package in the mail containing Leigh's missing eyeglasses. They'd been delivered in an 8-inch envelope, addressed in block letters to B Yarborough. The return address was the same as the mailing address.

I learned very early on that Vedic astrology ― the kind of astrology practiced in India, which differs from Western astrology ― served as a guidepost in my parents' household. Their trusted astrologer was on speed dial, despite living in India, and they frequently referred to my star alignment before I was allowed to make monumental decisions.

One possible remedy was an ancient practice called Kumbh Vivah, a ritual whereby a woman first symbolically marries an earthen pot or banana tree to remove the horoscopic error, something my mother had done herself. The objective was to neutralize the negative influence of Mars in an effort to transfer the bad luck that would otherwise befall her future husband to the artificial groom (the tree, pot, etc.), thereby allowing the bride to have a peaceful future marriage.
3. You become pros at communicating.
Perhaps one of the best things about a long-distance relationship is the space that you have. You have lots of time for the things you love, for yourself, for missing each other. You get the benefits of being in a relationship, but can still enjoy your free, independent life.
Months have passed since that fateful reading and my parents have come around with their blessing and are now happily participating in our wedding planning.

Amy Rollo, a psychotherapist and owner of Heights Family Counseling in Houston, agreed. As a couples therapist, it is actually rare for money stress to be the biggest issue.

Beth fell for Larry shortly after she left a really turbulent relationship with her bi-polar-ish first husband. Beth felt responsible for him, and said she hung on much longer than she should have.

They dated for several years, during which time they each pursued professional degrees. Beth remembered that they fought rather intensely during periods of separation from each other, but had long months where they enjoyed a close and loving connection.

The above leads me to the reason for the pregnancy test in the first place. I really had no idea how much my cycle would change after getting married. It was very difficult to adapt. I'm sure it has to do partly with getting older and into my upper twenties, but I know marriage plays a role as well. My cycles had been like clockwork since the very beginning. From age 12, I always knew exactly when to expect their arrival, and never once were they missed or late. I do not exaggerate when I say I never missed a period, even during my early twenties when I was constantly traveling, changing time zones, and alternating my sleep schedules from day-shift to night-shift and then back again. The thing was a rock that wouldn't budge. Fast forward to my life as a new wife, and pair that with turning 26, and you get a recipe for disaster. Well, not really disaster. Maybe just extreme stress. Several times during my first year of marriage, my period was late. Not just a few days. Late, as in 2 weeks, sometimes 3. What do you think this resulted in? Me rushing out for pregnancy tests. Oh my gosh, why is it so late? It's never late! I've got to be pregnant! Nope, not pregnant. Just late. This left me very frustrated. Not only did this change occur, I also noticed changes with symptoms, intensity, and other variables.
What if we respond to every nasty act of his, by being considerate.
No matter, because some gleeful Twitter users enjoyed another opportunity to chortle at an apparent Trump gaffe. Amid the religious right's efforts to limit such rights as abortion access and same-sex marriage, others concluded that the president may have seen the light.
Detectives investigated Leigh's step-father, but ultimately cleared him, police said. Other suspicions ― directed at a man who was known to Leigh's family and later incarcerated for similar crimes ― failed to pan out.
Lawyers for the duchess say Thomas Markle, a retired television cinematographer, caused anguish for Meghan and Harry before their May 2018 wedding by giving media interviews and posing for wedding-preparation shots taken by a paparazzi agency. In the end he did not attend the wedding ceremony after suffering a heart attack.
I understand my parents' intentions regarding the horoscope matchmaking were nothing but positive. Throughout my life, my respect for them and my culture had dissuaded me from making decisions they might not agree with. I had silently complied with their need for astrological affirmation because it had never deterred me from what I wanted for myself. But this was where I drew the line. I did not feel comfortable with any of the astrologer's recommendations for fixing our problem.
The revisions have broad support in parliament, where few politicians have stood up for LGBT rights for fear of alienating a largely conservative voter base ahead of legislative and presidential elections next year.
I thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more I researched that, the more I realized I was wrong.
That's not to say that dealing with a massive amount of debt isn't stressful on its own. Debt is a major burden that makes it difficult to spend on activities and shared goals as a couple. But when it comes to the relationship, it shouldn't be something that tears you apart unless there are other factors, such as communication and coping skills, that need some work, too.

She got married in 1989 to the eldest son of the eldest son in a large extended family, which meant she had to become a manmyeoneuri, or the eldest daughter-in-law. It was a role that would long consume her life.

Generations of LGBT people — including countless gay men — were branded criminals and sex offenders simply because they had consensual sex, Wiener said in a statement praising Newsom's actions. This was often life-ruining, and many languished on the sex offender registry for decades.

Before continuing any financial conversation together, we decided to spend time separately going through our finances. We each created a spreadsheet with the current state of our bank accounts, our investments our retirement funds, and our debt. We also decided to write down what we both felt we were comfortable combining and what we wanted to keep separate (to be used for a potential future prenup).

Shortly after he proposed to me, our families decided to recognize our engagement in the traditional Hindu way, or as we colloquially call it, the coconut ceremony. During this ceremony, my fiancé and I would be given coconuts, money and other gifts from both sides of the families as a token of good luck as we formalized our commitment before God.
It all centered on preparation and cooking. It took two to three days to buy all the groceries. I had to go to traditional markets, big supermarkets and even small shops when I needed a specialty item.
The case, which this author first covered on the Criminal Report Daily blog nine years ago, began on Aug. 27, 1992. As torrential rains and gusting winds began to hit Tupelo, the alarm clock at the Yarbrough home went off at about 6:45 a.m.

Months before, we'd greeted each other in the checkout line as we discussed a school fundraiser she was organizing. She didn't need to work. Her family appeared to live well as a single-income family. I remember that day I'd pushed a couple of coupons I intended to use under a bag of rice, hiding them, when I saw this woman approach. I hated that I had moved to the other side of the register and was now serving her.

While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart's 25% and Kroger's 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June.

Gov. Gavin Newsom pardoned Rustin for his arrest in 1953 when he was found having sex with two men in a parked car in Pasadena. He was in town as part of a lecture tour on anti-colonial struggles in West Africa.
I remained employed at the store for three years and only left because I eventually took a job in a local school working in special education. Recently, I popped in to pick up some groceries and saw an old manager.
I find it pretty strange that the United States is mobilizing so hard on this issue ... because if you look at the bigger picture is the main threat to the world today abortions? Or is it an assertive China? A Russia that is expansionist? Let's just get our focus right here, said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Our ultimate goals are simple but far-reaching, Velez-Jackson told The Huffington Post. We want to provide healing during the current political climate, as well as redefine family entertainment while being subversive and radically inclusive. We also wish to redefine what a concert and dance performance can be and how they function. During this process, we happily skewer pop culture.
Australian's overwhelmingly voted yes in the national survey, and same-sex marriage was legalised in December last year.
Let me explain: Marriage, or any duet or intimate partnership needs plenty of caring, lots of tolerance and acceptance and enough humor to take the edge off. But a pattern of too much politeness or caution in one or both partners kills the spark, and pretty soon the marriage is limping along, barely alive, or, sometimes, so turbulent that it can break apart.
I stopped listening to what she was saying and instead focused on ringing up her purchases, while I listened for the beeps. I didn't want to double-scan any items or go too slowly. I could be friendly or I could be conscientious ― I wasn't capable of both. This, I realized, was the reason for my slow ring times, so I'd have to give the customer less of me and give the scanner more. I couldn't believe how awful I was at this.
Indian philosophy views marriage not only as a long-term commitment between two people but as a union of cosmic energy and permanent stability. Generations have relied on horoscope matchmaking (especially for arranged marriages) to get assurance that the married couple would enjoy a life of bliss, stability and health.
Zeid, a member of the Jordanian royal family who has been in the U.N. post since 2014, said Indonesia was among the most progressive states in Southeast Asia on human rights.
Le ton fait la chanson, he was fond of saying, meaning that melody is what makes the song and not the loudness of the singer.
There was a family gathering at the end of last year .… That day was winter solstice, and my father-in-law bought red bean porridge, my mother-in-law boiled the cabbage soup, my sister-in-law went grocery shopping, and my husband's brother and his wife washed all the vegetables while others grilled the meat. I brought side dishes from home. My husband washed all the dishes.
In a truly amazing marriage the most challenging things for guys to give up have nothing to do with surface stuff. You may even get to do more guy type things. In fact I've done jumping over fire and swimming through mud that was five feet deep...with my wife right by my side.

He just meant 'I can't think about this today,' having just done one, she said. He was just tired. He needed a really long nap and a glass of wine. It would be like if you asked someone who just had a baby, 'Do you want another one that day?' They'd just go, 'NO!'
Lere put it this way: Money is rarely just about numbers. For a couple to solve financial issues that may be leading to strain in the relationship, they need to develop insight into their own relationships with money and figure out the psychological reasons behind the mismanagement.

When police arrived on the scene, they observed blood stains in the hallway and bathroom, and a bloody stain containing strands of hair on a door frame facing the kitchen area. Authorities said there were indications that someone had attempted to clean up the blood in the bathroom. In Leigh's room, a bloody blue nightgown and bra were discovered. The only items missing were the teen's shoes, reading glasses and underclothes.
But the more I thought about the word marriage and the legal bindingness of it, the more I began to panic. I knew I had to talk to my fiancé about our financial game plan and perhaps even about getting a prenup.

Everyone from all three generations prepared the dinner and washed the dishes together. My son bought coffee after he finished eating, and everyone was very happy to have coffee and tea together.

Sometimes one-upping is motivated by a competitive streak, too, but a sophisticated, competitive person knows story-topping generally is impolite, off-putting and disenfranchising, Deverich said. It doesn't actually secure your position at the top of the social hierarchy. The intelligent, competitive person will save the topping story for the most advantageous moment.

That's probably not exactly how the president intended to put it.
The body image wrestle and win. While the age at which this occurs is different for all of us, there comes a time in every woman's life where she decides that she is going to love her body. I am lucky that this age for me came early on in my life. Of course I have wrestled with certain things I don't like about my appearance, and things I wish I could change, as we all have. But I have been blessed with people in my life who encourage me in this area, most especially my husband. I think the wrestle ended before we even got married. What really drove it home was coming to the place where I knew that God created me this way, just how He wanted me to be, no more and no less. He wanted every detail about my appearance to be there. Once I accepted this, I was awestruck by the truth of it. Thinking of Who wanted me to be this way, blew my mind. I can honestly say that I don't struggle with my body-image now. Of course some days are better than others, and there are days in every woman's life where she feels average, plain, not pretty. But there is something about this stage of life that just makes us throw our hands up and say I'm done. We throw out all of the lies. We get tired of hearing that we're not perfect. So we take You're too____. and You're not____enough.
Photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who shot Harry and Meghan's engagement photos, has been named the official photographer for their wedding.
I've spent years making money and saving it. When life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), I feel like I have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. It might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but I think it's the opposite. We've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.

Luckily, some work relationships work out great, Edmonds said. I met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. You just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. PDA or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.
I've not always been a virtuous man. I'm learning so much and so many of you in this room have given me opportunities to try to get it right and I'm deeply grateful. But I think together, hopefully, we can be unified and actually make some changes. It's great to vote, but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves, Phoenix continued, pointedly adding that his fellow actors don't need to be taking private jets to Palm Springs.

A fruitcake was originally a symbol of wealth and prosperity because of its precious ingredients such as dried fruits, alcohol and spices, London pastry chef Chris Dodd told Vogue. Furthermore, the cake, in a way, represented the vastness of the British empire, using ingredients from far-flung corners of the globe. A wedding was, and is to this day, a time of celebration, and as such it calls for a cake to match the occasion.

At our last session, I wondered about Larry's quiet demeanor. This followed my umpteenth observation that Larry appears to be a caring, engaged guy who loves his family and wants to make things better. That's worth a lot. When I asked Larry what keeps him so polite with Beth, he responded, I'm afraid of offending her. She easily gets offended. On a roll now, he described how he had been sleeping on the couch for a couple of years-!-because his wife was committed to co-sleeping with the kids. He didn't like the idea, he wanted his bed-and his wife-back, but, according to him, she became offended when he tried to bring this up. Wow!

Eventually we came across what appeared to be a perfect home. Closer to my work, fair rental price and owned by a sweet Christian woman. The day came to sign the lease. I was a man on a mission headed to seal the deal. But out of the blue my wife called and told me this just doesn't feel right.
Many of my clients harbor an enormous amount of guilt for their failed marriage. Let go of guilt. William Pinsof (president of the Family Institute at Northwestern University) reported in The Death of Till Death Do Us Part: The Transformation of Pair-Bonding in the 20th Century, that, for the first time in the human history, divorce has replaced death as the most common endpoint of marriage. This unprecedented shift in patterns of human coupling and uncoupling requires a new paradigm, that is, a more humane approach for social policy, family law and marital therapy. (Remember Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin consciously uncoupling). By seeking a more humane approach to navigating your divorce and post-divorce life, it's easier to forgive yourself and your ex.
Perry also posted a picture on Thursday celebrating happy mushy gushy day.
Daughters-in-law are often required to speak deferentially to their husband's family members. The language contains respect. But there's not much respect for the names of women. It is a problem that my generation does not dare to touch, but I think that it will change in the next generation.
In my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. Like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. When you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. So many of the issues I see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: People who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. Couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. Couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. A few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California

Whatever happens, Edmonds recommends keeping your personal policy on interoffice romances as simple as possible.
Still, in November 2015, the Mormon Church adopted new, rigid guidelines on same-sex couples. Under those guidelines, any Mormon in a same-sex marriage would be deemed an apostate, or having abandoned the religion, and subjected to disciplinary hearings that could lead to excommunication.

A 2015 study found that braggarts overestimated the extent to which their audiences would feel proud and happy, and underestimated their annoyance.
While I had begun the year exhausted by stress and financial worry, I felt a shift in my mentality after the first week of January. I realized how unexpectedly kind people can be. It's so hard to see sometimes because most people don't have the means to help others, and I don't just mean financially. People are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined. I certainly was caught up in mine.

I am sure there are many examples of others who did not heed the advice of their astrologer and still went on to experience successful marriages. We plan on joining those ranks.
A wife who attended one of my Marin County, California marriage meeting workshops, continued to hold weekly meetings with her husband. She reports: At first the process felt contrived, but after a few meetings we got used to the meeting's structure. I learned that it's much better to communicate with intention than to communicate without intention.
Beth and Larry, a mid-30's couple with two young daughters, came to see me on the verge of divorce. At least, Beth is on the verge of divorcing her mild-mannered husband. From the first visit, Beth was large and in-charge. This attractive woman, who runs a child-developement center, indicated that she felt let down by Larry in every way. He was no longer affectionate with her, he argued with her over what she considered petty things, and Beth had begun making plans to, as she put it, work on becoming effective co-parents-i.e., she was giving up on the marriage. This was her second marriage, by the way.
I could see the color drain from my parents' faces. My mom immediately went into problem-solving mode, inquiring what remedies were available to undo the cosmic block. She was determined to find a comfortable solution without defying the stars. After all, she and my dad had been married for over 30 years and she was convinced that it was due to their astrologer's prediction.
In the sessions, the most striking quality of this couple is Larry's reticence with Beth. He's a really smart guy, thoughtful, a well-regarded environmental specialist, but he seems dumb with his wife. While she threatens to give him the boot, he looks unruffled. But he's clearly hurt, and at our initial meeting he acknowledged not being able to sleep because of worry that Beth would leave.
Shelton went on to retweet a fan's response to the tweet with a lyric from girlfriend Gwen Stefani's song This Is What The Truth Feels Like.
A CrowdJustice campaign has raised 25,000 pounds (about $35,000) of a 50,000-pound goal (about $70,000) to finance efforts to reclaim marriage equality in Bermuda.

The Golden Globes, of course, are fun, but they aren't the Academy Awards. They aren't even much of an indicator of who may get an Oscar; there's no overlap between Golden Globes voters and Academy members.

Consequently, it's easy to develop unrealistic, fantasy-based expectations about marriage. Many of us spend more time maintain a car -- checking tire pressure, changing the oil, and getting the recommended inspections, and son on -- than we spend on keeping our most important relationship in good working order.
You're excited about getting married soon.
More than half of millennials in relationships agree that they don't want to get married until their finances are in order, according to a survey by Credit Karma. Forty-two percent say transparency about a partner's finances is key to a healthy relationship, while 71% say it's at least somewhat important their partner's finances be up to certain standards before marriage.
Amazon could add private label products as soon as March, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from Whole Foods, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Less than a year after legalizing marriage equality, Bermuda passed a law last month to ban same-sex marriage once again.
He issued an executive order creating what he called a new clemency initiative to identify those who might be eligible for pardons and swiftly consider those applications. He encouraged Californians to apply for clemency for people they believe meet that criteria.

I used to love Christmas, but this past year, as soon as all the gifts were unwrapped and I'd polished off the last sugar cookie while standing over the sink, all I felt was relief. There had been arguing with my estranged husband about holiday plans, and a sad, toxic mediation session that took place just a few days before Christmas. I had burst out crying in the first five minutes. In an effort to stand up for myself and my kids, I yelled and raged, and I left feeling angry and broken, wondering why on earth we had decided to schedule mediation so close to the holidays. But mostly, what kept me up at night was a heavy, consuming financial stress that had been building for months.
A week before the Indian engagement ceremony, my parents, brother, fiancé and I sat in our living room in Queens, New York, huddled around a phone to learn the astrologer's assessment of our compatibility. Kundali matching is a popular method in which the prospective bride and groom's horoscopes are compared under an obscure system that counts 36 points among the two horoscopes. If 18 or more points match, that's a match literally made in Heaven. Fewer than 18 matches means your marriage is not approved by the stars.
With the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and with conflicts raging in Afghanistan and Cambodia and between Iran and Iraq, he complained to the General Assembly that U.N. resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored by those that feel themselves strong enough to do so.
I've spent years making money and saving it. When life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), I feel like I have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. It might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but I think it's the opposite. We've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.
Diversity is all well and good, but there's also a question of taste, of discernment. Award ceremonies are supposed to be the purveyors of what's next, what's exciting, what's enriching the culture as a whole. So-called diverse filmmakers and actors shouldn't win or be nominated for awards just by virtue of existing, no. But when genuinely stellar work by these creators goes unnoticed for the sake of lauding the same revolving cast of characters, it raises a singular question.
For me, this project really resonated as a true exploration of how people think deeply about their relationship to their hair, Erin added. I rock a curly 'fro because I love how it looks, whether the curls are defined, frizzy or tangled. And as a Black woman, I think there's so much beauty and power in being able to embrace my curls and coils no matter what anyone else may think.
What if we respond to every nasty act of his, by being considerate.
And yet Sunday's awards were a great microcosm of the interesting place Hollywood now finds itself in, five years after #OscarsSoWhite, three years after #MeToo. The host of the night, Ricky Gervais, made a few pithy attempts at jokes about diversity, calling the HFPA (who vote for the winners) racist, and calling out the lack of female director nominees.
Marie Sarantakis, a family law attorney in Illinois, one of the other states with a pet custody law, said she has handled divorces in which one spouse uses a pet as leverage. In one case, she represented the wife, who had a beagle that she'd owned before the relationship. Out of the blue, Sarantakis said, the husband filed for divorce and asked for the dog.
It's that kind of messy pet custody case that a new California law is supposed to help solve. Former Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, owner of two first dogs, corgi mix Lucy and bordoodle Cali, signed the bill, which took effect Jan. 1.
When I was born in a dingy hospital in Ahmedabad, India, 29 years ago, my parents were handed two documents: a birth certificate and a natal chart. The doctor informed my mom that the latter, also known as a birth chart, was an astrological map that revealed how the position of the sun, moon, planets and other celestial bodies at the time I was born would influence my behavioral tendencies, character traits and life purpose.

We all love our good luck pieces, as we should. But we must be frank with ourselves: We cannot wait for good things to happen to us. I do believe, as stated above, we make our own good luck.
If you don't start offending your wife, I don't think you're going to have a marriage. I heard these words come out of my mouth at a recent session with a couple in my office. I imagined that they were thinking, This family therapist is crazy. But I was pretty sure I was right.

When it comes to couples with debt, the money alone is not the root cause of relationship problems. It's the pressure and conflict that often arises from dealing with that debt that can bring to light other issues in the relationship.

Black Hair Defined is all about letting people tell their stories about their hair journeys, Erin Evans, a senior enterprise editor at HuffPost who commissioned the articles for this project, told me from New York.
It also would be something that could calm my pre-marriage anxiety, which I find normal. You're about to legally bind a lot of yourself to another person, shouldn't that feel a little scary? We decided to educate ourselves on what a prenup would mean and in the process, figuring out the best moves for ourselves individually and as a couple.
Patton and Thicke's nine-year marriage ended in 2014, and they finalized their divorce in May 2015. But their custody battle rages on.
I'm not the same person I was before I took my job at the grocery store. I now know what it's like to be on both sides of the register and I understand how hard that job ― and facing all of the judgments and misconceptions that come with it ― truly is, and it changed me. And I hope that no matter where I'm working or what I'm doing, I'll remember what I've learned from that experience and all of the incredible people who shared so many of their days and nights and stories with me so I can continue growing and approaching and understanding the world in new ways.

As I stood in the parking lot, soaking wet, I was finally able to admit what I'd tried so hard to hide ― both from others and myself: I was embarrassed by my job.
A wife who attended one of my Marin County, California marriage meeting workshops, continued to hold weekly meetings with her husband. She reports: At first the process felt contrived, but after a few meetings we got used to the meeting's structure. I learned that it's much better to communicate with intention than to communicate without intention.
In June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon, love at first sight. And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members.
In a perfect world, such objective (or gesturing toward objective) criteria for nominations would be the norm. But in Hollywood, it's not always about quality in determining who gets nominated and who wins. Politics, the power of a good narrative and diversity — not only of the performers, directors and others, but those who are doing the nominating — are also key drivers in who ultimately nabs the statue.
Guns are, indeed, known to make domestic violence incidents more deadly. One study found that victims are five times more likely to be killed if their abuser has access to a gun.
After all, higher levels of debt ― particularly student loan debt ― are becoming the norm for millennials entering relationships and starting families, according to Sweitzer. What seems to make the difference for couples that are able to navigate it successfully and even get closer through managing debt is how they communicate about it, he said.
In California and across the country, many laws have been used as legal tools of oppression, and to stigmatize and punish LGBTQ people and communities and warn others what harm could await them for living authentically, Newsom said in a statement. He thanked those who pushed for Rustin's pardon and encouraged others in similar circumstances to seek a pardon to right this egregious wrong.

Assad was accused by the United States and its allies of using chemical weapons to attack civilians during Syria's civil war. Gabbard, however, said she didn't think there was enough evidence to hold Assad responsible then and still doesn't now.
My gold charm is lovely to look at with its many lucky charms embedded into its circular disc. A four leaf clover, an elephant, a horseshoe, an evil eye, the Arabic good luck sign, a heart and a number 13. I don't feel strongly about it but I figure, every bit of luck helps. I am very attached to a tiny gold Chai (meaning long life in Hebrew) hanging on the same connecter, a gift from my brother, Scott, brought back from Jerusalem. My good luck pieces feed my spirit. They do not bring me luck.
I learned very early on that Vedic astrology ― the kind of astrology practiced in India, which differs from Western astrology ― served as a guidepost in my parents' household. Their trusted astrologer was on speed dial, despite living in India, and they frequently referred to my star alignment before I was allowed to make monumental decisions. Going out of state for college? Consult the planetary placement first. Picking a career in law? Make sure the zodiacs are on board. Looking to get married? Ensure the celestial bodies don't have any concerns.

I didn't imagine that it would be smooth sailing, Phoenix told Vanity Fair about the polarizing response to the film. It's a difficult film. In some ways, it's good that people are having a strong reaction to it.
Just as I typically do ― or, at least, typical as things have been since I submitted my letter of resignation in 2013. After my letter, I didn't go to my husband's parents' home for two to three years. Then, when I did go, there again, I didn't cook ― as I normally would've done ― and we ordered in. But the food wasn't as good as home-cooked meals, so we started cooking one dish at home, and since last year, we've been cooking just enough jeon [Korean pancake] for our family to eat.
Being in a LDR has created a stronger level of communication than I think would have developed if we were in a 'traditional' relationship. At any given point, we had a 14-to-16-hour time difference between us, sometimes more if I traveled out west. This worked really well for me because I worked overnight shifts, so most of the time we were both awake at the same time. On days off, one of us either woke up early or stayed up late to ensure that we could talk to each other.
Even though I'd recently gotten a more steady job as an editor and had been picking up other work as much as I could, a gap in my income still meant I couldn't pay my January mortgage. Because I'd made late payments before, it wasn't good. I was about one late payment away from serious repercussions. I had to fill the income gap, and fast.

It's almost as if one-uppers have the belief that if your light shines, theirs is dimmed, said Margaret Rutherford, a psychologist in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and the author of Perfectly Hidden Depression.

Before that Valentines was anything but loving.
I first want to thank all the generous readers who wrote in to share their own stories in response to last week's newsletter on gender dynamics in marriage. Some readers said gender imbalances in relationships appear to be shifting in a positive direction in many cultures, including in the U.S., but that there's still a long way to go. Self-love and self-work, including seeking counseling for both partners, is key to enacting change in a relationship, a Pennsylvania-based clinical social worker and family therapist suggested in her email to me.

But he did come back for a second term after a groundswell of support for his candidacy, including a conversation with President Ronald Reagan, who — in the words of the U.N. chief's spokesman — expressed his personal support for the secretary-general.
Weber said the pardon helps leave Rustin's legacy in the civil rights movement uncompromised.
Transferring to the United Nations in 1975, he was appointed by Waldheim as the secretary-general's special representative in Cyprus. During his two years on the divided island he helped to promote intercommunal peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
He was ambassador to Switzerland and then became Peru's first ambassador to the Soviet Union while concurrently accredited to Poland. Other assignments included the post of secretary-general of the Peruvian Foreign Ministry and chief delegate to the United Nations.
He just meant 'I can't think about this today,' having just done one, she said. He was just tired. He needed a really long nap and a glass of wine. It would be like if you asked someone who just had a baby, 'Do you want another one that day?' They'd just go, 'NO!'

She filed for divorce in 2012 and submitted a letter of resignation to her parents-in-law just before the 2013 Chuseok holidays, a major harvest festival in South Korea. Her loved ones complained and asked how she could do such a thing.
Along with the payment she wrote a note. Happy new year to a badass single mama ― no strings attached. I was completely blown away. Are you kidding me!? I wrote her back, my fingers flying on keyboard. We chatted briefly. I thanked her profusely but I was stunned. I didn't know what action to take.

So, you're 23 and rocking it.
I often share a folksy old saying with my clients: 'It's best to fix the roof when the sun's shining.' We all know that when we're in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. Maybe you've noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. The wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. It's OK to go to counseling when things seem 'fine' so that you are more resilient when they aren't. Even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it's good to be equipped when they come. ― Ryan Howes
Questions are increasingly being raised now about the honorific titles and other language used in familial relationships and in the marital setting in Korea. Like, why is it that a woman needs to use formal terms like miss or young master when referring to her husband's family members? What do you think about these terms?
A wonderful land or cruise vacation is not guaranteed by luck. You have to do your research. I suggest not using some travel agent behind a computer who has probably traveled less than you. Ask traveled friends for the name of their travel agent. If you enjoy the same type of travel ask friends or acquaintances, you respect, for restaurant and hotel suggestions. My southern friend, Norma Jean, taught me how to persuade the clerk, in every hotel, how to get 'a room with a view.' We are never too old to ask and never too old to learn, dear readers. Just use your brains.

Gabbard also clashed with Hillary Clinton shortly before a Democratic primary debate in November. The former secretary of state suggested the congresswoman was being groomed by Russia. In response, Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against Clinton, alleging the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee lied about Gabbard with obvious malicious intent to hurt her 2020 presidential campaign.
Ironically, my birth certificate got misplaced, but the natal chart remained accounted for and intact in its laminated form. When we moved to the United States, it traveled with us and eventually found a permanent and secure home in my dad's safe.
Long distance was not always ideal. It came with struggles, loneliness, longing and then a pandemic happened and made it a bit harder for a short time in our situation, Eames told HuffPost. That being said, the nature of our relationship has left us with tons of memories and experiences that are irreplaceable.
Whether that was a story about hair loss, or about embracing natural hair as a Black trans woman or even a few fun pieces that looked iconic hairstyles in film, music, politics and sports — it was important for there to be a variety of perspectives and voices since Black hair is beautiful and versatile in all its many forms, Erin said.
She added, I saw blood right there splattered on the walls and then I screamed ... and dialed 911.
Debt can serve a stand-alone stressor, but when superimposed on other relational strain can amplify problems in a relationship, Lere said. Issues such as secrecy about spending, disagreements on how to handle finances and varying levels of comfort carrying a balance can all be sources of tension.
She added: My parents immigrated from Cuba in the 1960s. They know what a dictator looks like. Trump and his supporters are authoritarian, completely offensive; they stand for what's completely contradictory to this country's ideals.
I worked mostly nights and Sundays. Sundays were the worst because they were the hardest days to hide. It seemed like every family I knew shopped after church or their kid's sporting events. And it was on a Sunday that I broke down.
Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith, Trump declared in his speech Thursday.

Amazon's plan to change Whole Foods' shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant's initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon.

We decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date.
It seemed to be becoming a lot more sensitive to things such as exercise, sickness, and general life, whereas before, the thing did not falter during times of extreme physical, mental and emotional changes. I thought, Now is not the time for my periods to become irregular - they've had nearly 15 years to be irregular. Now is the time to be consistent and trustworthy, so I can properly carry out married life without the stress of trying to prevent pregnancy or become pregnant. Sadly, this was not the case. After visiting my doctor, I received the wisdom that I wish I would have received before this started happening. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. You are very healthy. You are older now, so your body is changing. This is is your new normal. As frustrating as this was, I was comforted by this being my new normal. I just so wish I would have been told to expect my cycle to change, as this would have saved so much unnecessary stress.

The national police chief has instructed us to investigate those photos and to determine if there was any...procedural or ethical violation.
Perry, 34, has dated the 42-year-old British The Lord of the Rings actor on-and-off since 2016. Perry's first marriage to British actor and comedian Russell Brand ended in 2012. Bloom shares a son with supermodel Miranda Kerr, with whom he split in 2013.
A roomful of adults of different generations. It sounds like a recipe for squabbling!
I very quickly realized I was being irrational. My relationship with my partner was built on a foundation of mutual understanding, communication and real-life work. It is this same approach that we will rely on as a married couple, with no space for the Universe's opinion. For me, love is not a mystical phenomenon ― it is a manifestation of the respect and unconditional care that two people have for each other and that makes them want to spend forever with each other.
Listening to others and being proactive has saved my life more than a few times. Did I look at my red string, the charm around my neck and ask God to bless me. I sure did. But it was my brains that thrust me into my luck, not my good luck pieces.
Just as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women's inequality should shame us all in the 21st. Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid, Guterres said in a speech to The New School in New York.
We've also talked a lot about our finances, disclosing to each other what our cash situation looks like and what kind of money mistakes we've made in the past. But one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word ― prenup.
Months after the split, Lambert found love with singer Anderson East, whom she dated for two years. Multiple outlets confirmed earlier this month that the two were no longer a couple.
Netflix adds a few dozen movies to the service throughout March, including more than a dozen on March 1.

This year's Globes infamously shut out women in the Best Director category, despite the abundance of critically acclaimed, money-making films by female directors including Lulu Wang, Lorene Scafaria, Greta Gerwig, Mati Diop and Celine Sciamma. Their lack of nominations doesn't magically erase the brilliance of the movies they made.

It's unclear if she still holds that belief. Attempts by HuffPost to reach her were unsuccessful.
So life wasn't exactly what you had in mind. Liz Bennet would tell you, quite rightly, to get your s*** together and slay some zombies.
I believe, in 99% of instances, you and I must make our own good luck.
J'ai perdu mon corps, Jérémy Clapin et Marc du Pontavice
That's not to say that dealing with a massive amount of debt isn't stressful on its own. Debt is a major burden that makes it difficult to spend on activities and shared goals as a couple. But when it comes to the relationship, it shouldn't be something that tears you apart unless there are other factors, such as communication and coping skills, that need some work, too.
His funeral will be held Friday.
Dozens of protesters on Friday staged an anti-LGBT rally outside a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh.
I lived in my parents' house before marriage, and I lived as a wife, a mother and a daughter-in-law after marriage. It was the first time in my life that I'd spent 24 hours totally alone.
A woman who works for an aircraft company on the West Coast happened to be looking outside her window recently when she thought: Wouldn't it be funny to skywrite a giant message attacking Donald Trump?
If no guidelines exist, Marzolph recommends gauging the workplace culture around you: Have you heard of other office relationships developing in the past? Does the company encourage after-hours camaraderie among the staff?
I stopped listening to what she was saying and instead focused on ringing up her purchases, while I listened for the beeps. I didn't want to double-scan any items or go too slowly. I could be friendly or I could be conscientious ― I wasn't capable of both. This, I realized, was the reason for my slow ring times, so I'd have to give the customer less of me and give the scanner more. I couldn't believe how awful I was at this.
Six months after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon (AMZN) is working on reorganizing Whole Foods shelves by first adding Amazon private label products and, soon, it may add popular consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola. Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned.
It's painful, but Whole Foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail told Yahoo Finance. There are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and Amazon is helping Whole Foods in that direction.
In July 1986, Pérez de Cuéllar underwent a quadruple coronary bypass operation, putting in question his availability for a second term. From the outset, Pérez de Cuéllar had insisted that he would be a one-term secretary-general.
This was the problem with these well-meaning people in a nutshell. When Beth gets upset, or fights Larry on an idea, he withdraws. I'm not sure if he's protecting himself or her, but my guess is that it's a bit of both. And even though Beth says she wants a relationship of equals with two strong voices, she has a subtle way of appearing to be the expert. She says she wants an equal, but a real equal partnership will challenge her status as exclusive expert, especially on the kids. I'm not sure she's ready for that.
That's because money also is a sort of emotional currency in relationships. It can be a vehicle for communicating certain messages that are not being put into words between two people. When misused, money can be a bid for power, control or punishment. Spending can also be used as a stand-in for other unmet needs.
Rustin's close friends knew he was gay, but his religious and political associates distanced themselves after his arrest, Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblywoman Shirley Weber told Newsom on behalf of the caucuses.

The two are preparing to welcome their first child together, Weisz revealed in a New York Times interview about her upcoming film Disobedience with Rachel McAdams, who reportedly gave birth to a baby of her own recently.
Women have equaled and outperformed men in almost every sphere, he said. It is time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential.
I'm an avid walker, and I had a family member who would tell others that they walked just as much or farther than me when all of us knew they'd never walked for exercise. Ever, she said. It's quite sad.
But the more I thought about the word marriage and the legal bindingness of it, the more I began to panic. I knew I had to talk to my fiancé about our financial game plan and perhaps even about getting a prenup.
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar was born in Lima on Jan. 19, 1920. His father a modest businessman, was an accomplished amateur pianist, according to the former secretary-general. The family traced its roots to the Spanish town of Cuéllar, north of Segovia.
We've also talked a lot about our finances, disclosing to each other what our cash situation looks like and what kind of money mistakes we've made in the past. But one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word ― prenup.

If both people can seek to understand, they can both feel understood, Sweitzer said. Then debt could be a catalyst for connecting at a deeper level and uncovering solutions to problems that each person wouldn't have come up with on their own.
I Don't Know How She Does It (2011)
Just as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women's inequality should shame us all in the 21st. Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid, Guterres said in a speech to The New School in New York.
I thought that each of us should be free and independent for a healthy marital relationship, and a lot has changed. After I left, my children also became independent, and my husband was alone. When I came back after my surgery, I saw him cleaning the house and watering the flower pots. [Laughs.] Now we do everything together, from start to finish, when we cook.
Weekly meetings foster direct, positive communication that addresses concerns at a time when both of you are likely to be receptive. You get to feel appreciated and valued, gain a smoother-running household by coordinating chores, and add romance by planning dates. Issues are resolved and challenges are met before they escalate into crises and grudges. Romance can continue throughout your marriage, but this usually will not happen automatically.
While practicing patience and empathy is usually the best approach, that can be difficult when you're close to the one-upper and their bad habit is starting to chip away at your goodwill toward them. In this case, healthy and kind communication is a big step in the right direction, Baum said.
What if we smile at strangers on the subway, in the elevator, on the street, in restaurants and cafes and supermarkets.
Gabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.
I get to live like a local in two cities on opposite sides of the planet. We have friends in both places. Favorite hangouts and coffee shops in both places. Two vastly differently environments now feel equally like home. — Gladly
While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart's 25% and Kroger's 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June.
The United States has received support for its stance from countries including Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Guatemala, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan, Uganda, Poland and Hungary.

He also said that he was committed to making changes to things that need to be changed from now on, which made me very happy.
Sarantakis said the pet custody cases can sometimes become more emotional than disagreements over children.
In the documents, Patton also claims that she observed Thicke having inappropriate contact with the masseuse and says he became so enraged that I had interrupted his 'massage' that he broke down the locked door. Patton goes on to explain that Thicke became physically violent with me. He pushed me down and kicked me.
This week, we'll be pivoting our focus to something quite different but similarly compelling: Exploring this interactive feature on Black hair, created by HuffPost U.S. and published in honor of Black History Month.

A national police spokesman confirmed that police chief Tito Karnavian had ordered the investigation.
But before we get into that, did you know that the Feast of Saint Valentine (or Valentine's Day) wasn't always about couples expressing their love for each other?
Below, marriage therapists around the country share seven reasons to head to therapy sooner than later.
When I brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. He questioned why I had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. For starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.
Florence Pugh, Les filles du docteur March
Regardless of having slapped Christmas together, the whole vibe of the holidays was off, at least for me. I was so consumed by stress, I hadn't felt like myself. I had been catching myself too overwhelmed to offer a smile to a stranger, or do the things I would normally do, like drop change in a bucket or make a donation to an important charity or take a hat out of my glove compartment and give it to someone on the street ― things I like to do but this year felt I couldn't. Emotionally and financially, I was maxed out, and that meant I wasn't in the spirit of helping others, even though I wanted to.
Taking this step not only allowed us to both organize any outstanding financial mess (like the need to merge an old 401(k) into a SEP IRA) but also have all our assets documented in an easy to consume way.
The unusual provisions section addresses situations such as when one spouse receives a personal injury award during a marriage, allowing courts to award that spouse the entire amount. Similarly, a pet could be considered the property of one person, she said.
It's unclear if she still holds that belief. Attempts by HuffPost to reach her were unsuccessful.
Currently, Indonesian law does not regulate homosexuality, except in the ultra-conservative Islamic province of Aceh.
Turning to an expert helped us power through a difficult set of conversations about basic finance and how things will work once our money is merged and the money we make becomes shared. Once we knew what we were both bringing into the relationship, and were close to agreeing on how to implement shared money habits, we decided it was time to think about whether or not we wanted a prenup. While I always thought prenups were for people who had millions of dollars in assets, it turns out I was wrong.
She quit her job and worked as a daughter-in-law, mother and wife for decades. But after 24 years, she felt she'd done enough ― and decided to live the life she actually wanted before it was too late.
Lawyers for the duchess say Thomas Markle, a retired television cinematographer, caused anguish for Meghan and Harry before their May 2018 wedding by giving media interviews and posing for wedding-preparation shots taken by a paparazzi agency. In the end he did not attend the wedding ceremony after suffering a heart attack.

There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, Gabbard said on CNN when she announced her run for office in January.
Couples who reach out earlier for support when things are amiss often head off a caustic, ugly pattern of hurting each other in ways that are hard to forget or forgive. Marriage therapists should be able to help partners identify the ways they express themselves when they are hurt or angry and to recognize how they may unintentionally put their partners on the defensive.― Linda Lipshutz, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida
According to Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre, investigators became suspicious and asked Yarborough to take a lie detector test. She was polygraphed three different times ― once by a local polygraph examiner and twice by the FBI – and failed it three times, the chief said in a 2009 interview with this author.
Two weeks after I started, the shift supervisor came over.

But you might want to mention something when your partner is watching television, reading a book, or is otherwise occupied. You might be waiting for a right time that never comes. And if you do bring up a sensitive matter when it's the last thing your spouse is in the mood to discuss at the moment, you might feel like you have entered a minefield.
Rushbrooke said Meghan's letter, sent in August 2018, was a message of peace whose aim was to stop him talking to the press.
Whether that was a story about hair loss, or about embracing natural hair as a Black trans woman or even a few fun pieces that looked iconic hairstyles in film, music, politics and sports — it was important for there to be a variety of perspectives and voices since Black hair is beautiful and versatile in all its many forms, Erin said.
I have been through all of it, and I'm currently just a little bit past it, but not too far ahead. The 20s are a very formative decade, and come with so many changes it's hard to keep your head on straight sometimes. After I got married at age 26, I began to settle in and adjust to my new life, and realized there were a lot of things no one ever told me about this specific time. While it is different for everyone, just between us girls, here are several things I wish someone would have told me about that would have been extremely helpful in navigating this season:
5. Trust. Trust people. Listen and learn and then act.
Films joining on the first of the month include Crazy, Stupid, Love, Dances with Wolves, I Am Legend, Training Day and the first two Christopher Nolan Batman movies: Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.

Mr. Pérez de Cuéllar played a crucial role in a number of diplomatic successes — including the independence of Namibia, an end to the Iran-Iraq War, the release of American hostages held in Lebanon, the peace accord in Cambodia and, in his very last days in office, a historic peace agreement in El Salvador, said Guterres.
You OK? one of my co-workers asked. She had worked her entire career in the store and could tell that I wasn't remotely OK. Don't let the customers get to you, she said, placing an arm around my shoulder and leading me toward the break room. There's free pizza and salad today. You look like you could use some.
Le Mans 66, Paul Massey, David Giammarco et Steven A. Morrow
Before making the decision, we decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date, to talk about what kinds of terms we could include in a prenup and what we could potentially add to it later on. This felt like a smart and proactive choice to help protect us from outcomes we weren't necessarily ready for since we weren't planning for them to happen.
Ironically, my birth certificate got misplaced, but the natal chart remained accounted for and intact in its laminated form. When we moved to the United States, it traveled with us and eventually found a permanent and secure home in my dad's safe.
Belaunde Terry, restored to power in 1980, reaffirmed his confidence in Pérez de Cuéllar by recommending him for nomination as U.N. secretary-general.
Along with the payment she wrote a note. Happy new year to a badass single mama ― no strings attached. I was completely blown away. Are you kidding me!? I wrote her back, my fingers flying on keyboard. We chatted briefly. I thanked her profusely but I was stunned. I didn't know what action to take.
He issued an executive order creating what he called a new clemency initiative to identify those who might be eligible for pardons and swiftly consider those applications. He encouraged Californians to apply for clemency for people they believe meet that criteria.
I wondered why she had done it. Had she once been a struggling single mother? Had she recently read something that made her want to pay it forward? Had the note I'd quickly jotted asking for an odd job, or any job, struck a nerve? Did she just go around doing things like this for others all of the time? I didn't know the answer and I'd probably never get it. Still, regardless of the reason, her action filled me with gratitude.
Even though I'd recently gotten a more steady job as an editor and had been picking up other work as much as I could, a gap in my income still meant I couldn't pay my January mortgage. Because I'd made late payments before, it wasn't good. I was about one late payment away from serious repercussions. I had to fill the income gap, and fast.
The Golden Globes, of course, are fun, but they aren't the Academy Awards. They aren't even much of an indicator of who may get an Oscar; there's no overlap between Golden Globes voters and Academy members.
Months after the split, Lambert found love with singer Anderson East, whom she dated for two years. Multiple outlets confirmed earlier this month that the two were no longer a couple.
This tradition began in 1923 with the Queen Mother as a way to honor her late brother Capt. Fergus Bowes-Lyon, who was killed during World War I.
He served 50 days in Los Angeles County jail and had to register as a sex offender before returning to his home state of New York. He died in 1987.
How can I possibly explain the confusion that washed over me after a night of extreme emotional ups and downs? I could barely concentrate at work, and ended up asking my boss if I could leave early to go to the doctor. Was I pregnant or not? Needless to say, I really wish someone would have told me about false positives, and how they are apparently more common than we are all lead to believe. This entire experience caused a very unnecessary roller coaster of emotions that, when paired with an already hormonal time of the month, absolutely wore me out.
I am not going to accept anything for sure, she said. I am not going to do that ... I have to keep focused on factual things ... or I wouldn't be able to cope very well.
LDRs are not an easy feat. They take work, no matter how serious or mutually casual the relationship. These kinds of relationships make you answer the very nerve-wracking question: What do I want from this and am I willing to do the work to make it happen? This is a terrifying aspect of romance that many millennials and Gen Z babes avoid in the never-ending quest to try and be 'chill.' LDRs don't really have room for 'chill' and force us to figure out our values and get clear about what we want. Ultimately, that can leave you with a relationship (or relationships) that sustain you and benefit you in the long-term. — Engle
As with so many character traits that are annoying, what's helpful is to expect the response ahead of time, Rutherford said. If you're talking about your own accomplishments, assume the one-upper will do the same. They have to stick their two cents in, whether what they're saying is truth or fabrication. If you expect it, it has less impact on you. It can even make you smile.
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino
Sorenson said she is unaware of any current research that supports the idea that a woman who resists with a weapon is less likely to be sexually assaulted.

In a promotional video posted Wednesday on her Twitter account, the former Sarah Ferguson said the novel, titled Her Heart for a Compass, is set in the Victorian era and is about daring to follow your heart against the odds.
When you get down to it, the root of most problems between couples is communication. If debt is placing undue stress on you or your partner and it's leading to conflict, there's a good chance that your communication about the problem needs some work ― or isn't happening at all.
The door was unlocked, and I opened the house and it was all dark, so I didn't see Leigh anywhere, Yarborough told detectives. I said, 'Leigh,' like that, and nobody answered me, and then I went in.
It's no secret that money problems are a leading cause of stress in relationships. And for a significant portion of Americans, debt is a major source of money strife that doesn't bode well for their love lives.
But what does the dog want?
Diversity is all well and good, but there's also a question of taste, of discernment. Award ceremonies are supposed to be the purveyors of what's next, what's exciting, what's enriching the culture as a whole. So-called diverse filmmakers and actors shouldn't win or be nominated for awards just by virtue of existing, no. But when genuinely stellar work by these creators goes unnoticed for the sake of lauding the same revolving cast of characters, it raises a singular question.
In honor of the original and the unmatched Pride and Prejudice as well as this refreshingly irreverent take on feminism and great literature, here are a few things we ALL can learn from P&P heroine Elizabeth Bennet -- the old and the new.
These brands and their business leaders should demonstrate true leadership and stand for those customers they've courted by helping to combat this harmful decision, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement.
I was appalled. I wanted to tell her that the particular man she was belittling had escaped a war-torn nation to come here for new opportunities. She was looking down on him and it wasn't right.
In the documents, Patton also claims that she observed Thicke having inappropriate contact with the masseuse and says he became so enraged that I had interrupted his 'massage' that he broke down the locked door. Patton goes on to explain that Thicke became physically violent with me. He pushed me down and kicked me.
It was not a grand display of wailing and moaning. Instead, I cried silently as I pushed the metal carts. I slid one into another, creating a chain that I jammed into the nearest corral while weaving in between customers and cars. It was Mother's Day and I'd forgotten to put in for the day off. People rushed past me in their cars, the rain lifting off the pavement and soaking the Day-Glo vest I was forced to wear whenever I did cart duty. How the hell did I wind up here, I asked myself as I wiped at the tears I tried to pass off as rain on my face.
But food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods. Last year, Bloomberg reported PepsiCo's Frito-Lay developed organic Doritos marketed under the name Simply, which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in Whole Foods. Industry experts said Whole Foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base.
From the beginning, recognize that this is an imperfect dating situation. Asking a colleague out isn't simply about two people getting together ― it almost always complicates the workplace dynamic, said S. Chris Edmonds, a human resources expert and founder of The Purposeful Culture Group.
There's so many different ways of looking at it, he continued. You can either say here's somebody who, like everybody, needed to be heard and understood and to have a voice. Or you can say this is somebody that disproportionately needs a large quantity of people to be fixated on him. His satisfaction comes as he stands in amongst the madness.
The Tin Man singer seemingly made mention of her recent relationship struggles in an ACM Awards speech earlier this month as she accepted the trophy for Female Vocalist of the Year.

ASSOCIATED PRESS U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were also being diluted or rolled back.
She's able to keep her emotions in check under stress, she (usually) makes excellent judgments, and she knows how to work as part of a team -- this is what makes her great zombie-killing and co-parenting alike.
During the November debate, Democrats piled on Gabbard over her support for nationalist and authoritarian foreign leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, as well as her close ties to Fox News, Trump's favored news network.
An entire coffee shop of people stared at me as I yelled and cried one afternoon while we went over our credit card statements and talked about the kind of purchases we could cut back on. I found myself feeling strong and sensitive about the fact that I've been single and independent for most of my twenties and have worked hard for my money. Though I've made money mistakes along the way, I was proud of my accomplishments, and at times, exposing my errors to my fiancé made me feel weak.
But Marx said much is still up to the judge's discretion and that couples with pets get very differing receptions from the judges depending on how judges feel about pets. Some are sympathetic and some are 'why are you wasting my time?'
There's no doubt that being in a long-distance relationship comes with its challenges: trying to coordinate time to talk across different time zones, making plans to see each other when your work schedules or finances (or the current pandemic) don't allow for it and going long stretches of time without that coveted face-to-face connection.

I miss working with you, she said as she organized a display. I miss you too, I told her. And I meant it.
Embrace the opportunity to reinvent yourself and your love life. I encourage my clients to leave their history in the past where it belongs. It best to use the past to help craft a better future. Be present and choose behaviors today that will positively impact your tomorrows. Separate the person from the problem. Recognize that we are all innately good and prone to make bad choices. Recognize and capitalize on the good choices you make while realizing and mitigating the bad choices you make.
The more I talked to friends about this and told them I might want to get one, the more I felt judged. Some friends even texted me asking if I was having second thoughts about marrying my fiancé. I'm not. I truly feel like marrying this person is the best decision but that doesn't mean I should feel shamed for wanting to figure out how I will walk out of the marriage, financially, if it ever comes to that. The wedding day will be a great day in our lives, but it's the marriage that's the most important ― and this includes discussing our finances.
Films joining on the first of the month include Crazy, Stupid, Love, Dances with Wolves, I Am Legend, Training Day and the first two Christopher Nolan Batman movies: Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
So life wasn't exactly what you had in mind. Liz Bennet would tell you, quite rightly, to get your s*** together and slay some zombies.
For a while, I didn't think getting a prenup was something we needed to do. Neither of us were walking into this marriage with major assets. We just figured we'd keep our separate bank accounts, for a while, and figure out how to split bills and financially plan together, while keeping some things separate.
Have you ever regretted the letter?
The Big Bang Theory actor admitted in a 2019 interview with E! News that the two have an unconventional marriage, but it suits them.
6. Crisis is a horrible time to work on things.
Last week, my daughter and I gave a ride to a woman whose car had broken down. It took us five minutes out of our way ― it didn't cost a thing. This gift that was given to me, even though it was financial, helped me remember the tons of ways we can help one another and that we should do them as often as we can, despite our income bracket. The truth is that most people genuinely want to help. When we do, it creates a space for us to keep paying it forward in whatever ways we can. Easing someone's burden gives them the ability to help ease someone else's.
While pleased that the new law attempts to ease what she said is a challenging and emotional issue for a lot of people, California family law attorney Deborah Marx, immediate past president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers chapter in Northern California, is skeptical that it will make a difference in divorce cases.
After leaving the U.N. Pérez de Cuéllar made an unsuccessful bid for Peru's presidency in 1995 against the authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, whose 10-year autocratic regime crumbled in November 2000 amid corruption scandals.
I'm not the same person I was before I took my job at the grocery store. I now know what it's like to be on both sides of the register and I understand how hard that job ― and facing all of the judgments and misconceptions that come with it ― truly is, and it changed me. And I hope that no matter where I'm working or what I'm doing, I'll remember what I've learned from that experience and all of the incredible people who shared so many of their days and nights and stories with me so I can continue growing and approaching and understanding the world in new ways.
Thank you guys so much for sharing my broken heart with me, she said onstage.
8. Proactive. Stay healthy by being proactive.
Mixed race woman taking broken paper heart
Bermuda's Supreme Court ruled in May 2017 that a registrar's decision to deny a marriage license to a same-sex couple was discriminatory, legalizing marriage equality in the socially conservative Atlantic territory.
Coffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? Steinberg said. Plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' If you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.
This tradition dates back to the 19th century when Prince Albert's grandmother gave Queen Victoria some myrtle ― a symbol of good fortune in love and marriage ― which Victoria then planted in her garden at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She cut a sprig from that plant when her oldest daughter, Princess Victoria, got married in 1858. Since then, Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana and Kate have all carried a bouquet with myrtle from Victoria's garden. The same bush is still thriving.
Your workplace is just that: a workplace, not a bar or a dating app for download. None of the HR experts we spoke to encouraged actively looking for love at the office, but they acknowledged it happens. And while it's less common for businesses to enforce or even have a non-fraternization policy, it's still important to determine if your company has one, said Teresa Marzolph, founder of Culture Engineered, a human capital consulting firm in Phoenix.

Dorie Rogers, family law specialist in Southern California and associate director of the family law association, said her members were worried that clients would have one more thing to fight over.
We tend to think that we are close to our family, but we don't actually know their thoughts, who they really are, or even their likes and dislikes. I spoke to Kim about how we can feel happiness in our relationships with our family, how her own family has changed and self-care.
To try to address those concerns, Quirk amended his bill to make courts' special consideration in pet custody cases voluntary rather than mandatory.
Contrary to popular belief I don't want to rock the boat, but the boat is fucking rocked, he continued, pivoting his speech to address everyone in the room.
And in her Instagram stories, singer shared this sweet image of her beau:
Amazon's plan to change Whole Foods' shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant's initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon's takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier — the biggest in two years.

Things took a surprising turn on the Jan. 1 episode of Sister Wives when a member of the TLC reality show's polygamist family announced she was a lesbian.
Canadian resident and Wuhan native Debbie Lu shares her perspective on the coronavirus outbreak. So many Westerners only know Wuhan in the context of the [virus], she laments. They don't know that we have famous authors and scholars and actors, or great street food, or hot summers. They don't know that we're known for our schools. So when people share negative opinions over social media about my home, because of coronavirus, I wish I could show them its better side — the side of Wuhan that I know and love.
We met with a financial trainer who asked us questions about what our individual and joint financial goals were, analyzed our assets and helped us determine how much we should budget and save for our ideal retirement and investment plans.

Religious police and vigilantes in the ultra-conservative province often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.
Money is a complicated beast in the therapy room, and in real life. It is a charged topic that is, for many, taboo, said Joy Lere, a psychologist with a practice focused on the merger of money and mindset. It is more than simple math … Differences in money management and unspoken rules about how it is discussed (or not) can lead to significant friction or fracture in a relationship.
If both people can seek to understand, they can both feel understood, Sweitzer said. Then debt could be a catalyst for connecting at a deeper level and uncovering solutions to problems that each person wouldn't have come up with on their own.
It's easy to let your sexual relationship fall to the wayside when you're with your partner every single day, especially during a pandemic. But a thriving sex life takes work and commitment. In LDRs, people are forced to nurture aspects of their relationships that they might not have otherwise — this is especially true with sex. We don't have a playbook for LDR sex lives so we can get creative with it. It can become a multimedia erotic love fest between nude pics, FaceTime sex, mutual masturbation and sexting. — Gigi Engle, author of All The F*cking Mistakes: A Guide to Sex, Love, and Life
Formula 1: Drive to Survive (Season 3, Netflix Original)
To say that debt is ever a blessing is probably a huge stretch. However, it can serve as a tool for helping couples learn how to work together.
Have you ever heard of other people who tried to make a change via a letter of resignation?
Some LGBTQI rights activists have expressed concern over McCormack's elevation to the office of Deputy Prime Minister.
1917, Sam Mendes et Krysty Wilson-Cairns
Whether or not the Browns would adhere to any of the mainstream Mormon church's stances on LGBTQ issues in any way is unclear. In a 2013 HuffPost Live interview, however, the family said they supported marriage equality. We have established our family the way we've chosen to, we've organized it the way we wanted to, Kody Brown said in that interview, which can be viewed below. We believe that all people should be allowed to have that right.
This made me and my fiancé want to prove them ― and Indian society ― wrong even more.
Le ton fait la chanson, he was fond of saying, meaning that melody is what makes the song and not the loudness of the singer.

The feature, which seeks to amplify Black conversations about Black hair, tells the stories of 18 people and their relationship with their kinky, curly, straight, dreadlocked and even hairless heads.
Certifying the welfare of the animal will be difficult and might require expert testimony, Rogers said. How do you prove that? Did you feed the dog, did you take it to the vet? Who's going to be the tie-breaker? Are you going to bring in the vet? she said in a phone interview.
Someone needs to educate Trump - preferably someone like Betsy Ross and not @BetsyDeVosED — Fred Lin (@fredofca) February 8, 2019
I knew getting my finances under control wouldn't happen without effort. Still, my two kids were finally both full-time in school. I saw an opportunity to push further in my career than I'd ever been able to do as a mom at home with the kids. I was excited to sink my teeth into new and exciting work, and I did. I scrimped and saved and cut back on expenses. I put just enough gas in the car to get the kids to school and get back home. But no matter what I did, I'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. I'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.
She did know because I'd mentioned it the last time I dropped my son off at school. Maybe she'd forgotten.
When that turned out to be too expensive, she ended up arranging two Florida sky banners instead. They became part of a mini-flurry of anti-Trump messages that hit the news after air restrictions were dropped over the former president's Mar-a-Lago golf resort, where he's now living.
I thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more I researched that, the more I realized I was wrong. Essentially, prenups are something for anyone to consider, regardless of how much money you have to your name, who wants protection or a legal game plan of what will happen if the marriage ends. Why argue about all of the assets you came into the marriage with, when the marriage is crumbling and on its final leg? Why not get that out of the way beforehand. The idea of a prenup or a legal financial document started to sound more and more attractive.

Rutherford hears complaints about one-uppers all the time in her therapy practice, and she's dealt with plenty in her own life, too.
One-upping is just a never-ending cycle of madness, Deverich said. Encourage yourself when it comes to your goals, and appreciate the experiences of others. Definitely distance yourself from braggarts and aggressively dominant jerks, though.
5. You're uniquely prepared for a pandemic.
While neither has commented on the reason for the divorce, rumors about Lambert's infidelity have long swirled thanks to Shelton's 2016 song She's Got a Way with Words, which takes aim at a cheating ex.

We decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date.
Two years after that initial 2015 exchange, the couple were visiting O'Hare before embarking on a vacation, where Buttigieg had planned to propose. And as it turns out, air travel turned out to be a fitting metaphor for their relationship.

He was trying to be kind, but I was mortified. The idea of being corrected by a 19-year-old kid I was old enough to have mothered stung. I managed to convince myself that ring times didn't matter and then I cried the whole drive home.
I am not going to accept anything for sure, she said. I am not going to do that ... I have to keep focused on factual things ... or I wouldn't be able to cope very well.

We all know there's no fucking competition between us ... I'm inspired by you. I'm your fucking student. I can't believe the beautiful, mesmerizing and unique work you've all done this year, he said. I really do feel honored to be mentioned with you.
Human Rights Watch and other rights groups welcomed the move, which comes amid a rising tide of hostility against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.
One of my close friends, Tova, said to me a few weeks ago, It is not what you know, it is who you know. She was referring to medical situations. Who you know, not what you know, dear readers, may save your life and bring you luck, a long life. Use your brains.
3. Maintain a healthy sense of pride in your accomplishments ― even if the one-upper tries to steal your thunder.
For more than two decades, authorities have dissected and combed through the evidence. Theories and suspicions abound, but the teenager has yet to be found.
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, Wylie Stateman
A 2015 study found that braggarts overestimated the extent to which their audiences would feel proud and happy, and underestimated their annoyance.
This film is taking Liz Bennet's ability to adapt to a whole new level, making the most of her well-known tolerance for irritants -- whether they come in the form of zombies or men who don't know how to communicate their emotions properly.
Le film Joker de Todd Phillips, avec Joaquin Phoenix dans le rôle-titre, part en tête de la course pour avec onze nominations au total.

Rustin was a great American who was both gay and black at a time when the sheer fact of being either or both could land you in jail, she said in a statement praising Newsom. This pardon assures his place in history.
But there were surprising losses, too. (This excludes the works that were completely snubbed in nominations, like Ava DuVernay's stellar When They See Us, Lupita Nyong'o's performance in Us and Zendaya Coleman's role in Euphoria.) Eddie Murphy's comeback performance in Dolemite Is My Name failed to garner recognition; he lost to Taron Edgerton for Rocketman, and Dolemite was shut out altogether. Billy Porter of Pose (unsurprisingly) lost the Best Actor in a TV Series - Drama award to industry juggernaut Brian Cox of the wildly popular Succession. And, in one of the biggest snubs of the night, odds-on favorite Jennifer Lopez — dressed in gold — lost the Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture award to Laura Dern's wonderful albeit glorified cameo performance in Marriage Story.

Given her views, which are most obvious from her tenure at Southeastern Legal Foundation, we are very worried about her ability to enforce the Violence Against Women Act, and to understand all the complexities of the communities that it serves, Smeal said.
Twenty-five years ago, as Hurricane Andrew bore down on northeast Mississippi, a teenage girl vanished without a trace in the town of Tupelo. She wasn't a casualty of Mother Nature. She was, according to police, a victim of a cold and calculating individual who took advantage of the chaos caused by the storm.
It's not a selfish choice but a way to make people around you happy, she added. Everyone has their own burdens of life. Rather than trying to solve your family's problems for them, let them solve the problem for themselves. No matter how long it takes. Seriously.
LONDON (AP) — Lawyers for the Duchess of Sussex asked a British judge on Tuesday to settle her lawsuit against a newspaper before it goes to trial by ruling that its publication of a deeply personal letter to her estranged father was a plain and a serious breach of her rights of privacy.
She added, I saw blood right there splattered on the walls and then I screamed ... and dialed 911.
When issues remain unresolved, resentment can create a large and ugly divide between two people. This often manifests as lack of empathy, disinterest and at times, even disrespect. Go to therapy before arguments seem insurmountable because one or both of you have become apathetic. ― Talia Wagner, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California
Things I really wanted to do had been removed from my priority list when I was living as a daughter-in-law ― but during those months alone, I lived fully and enjoyed it. That's when I wrote the book.
If you're in New York, you can also join HuffPost editors for a conversation on Black hair, politics and identity on Feb. 26. Register here.
Meghan denies collaborating with the authors — though she acknowledges allowing someone close to her to speak to them — and the book is expected to feature prominently in the trial.
If confirmed, as the head of the Office on Violence Against Women, Goessling would have a large influence over which domestic violence and sexual assault programs get funding, Smeal said, and which issues take priority.
If she DID get married, Liz Bennet would have had a prenup.
We all have that friend: the one who one-ups you in conversation every chance they get. Sometimes it's a co-worker or family member, but what they all have in common is that anything you can do they can do categorically better.

A woman who works for an aircraft company on the West Coast happened to be looking outside her window recently when she thought: Wouldn't it be funny to skywrite a giant message attacking Donald Trump?
I didn't really sacrifice anything to have an amazing marriage. Everything I let go has been repaid back many times over the years in terms of peace, harmony and love. What did I give up? Strife, anger, pain and suffering. What did I gain? A marriage beyond anything I could have ever imagined.
5. You're uniquely prepared for a pandemic.
A healthy sense of self-esteem can make you near bulletproof to one-uppers, Deverich said. Resist competing with the bragger in your life; it's a waste of time, plus, there will always be someone who's done, seen and accomplished more than you have. Our goals are so highly personal and individualistic, what's the point of comparing?
A recent couples' session illustrates this dynamic:
Do we want to treat them like humans? she said. No, but we don't want the pet considered like the couch either.
McCormack replaces Barnaby Joyce, who made global headlines last year when he threatened to execute Johnny Depp's dogs and more recently when he was forced to quit the role of deputy prime minister following weeks of controversy surrounding his extra-marital affair with a former staffer who is now pregnant.
2. Sympathize with the one-upper. They probably don't even know they're doing it.
In each of these different communities, there [are] different complexities. The person who runs the office must not only understand that, but also be sympathetic to it, she said. We're worried that a vote for her would exclude LGBTQ and immigrant survivors from protections and resources.
I didn't know you worked here, she continued.
His funeral will be held Friday.
Did Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry get engaged on Valentine's Day?
Regardless of having slapped Christmas together, the whole vibe of the holidays was off, at least for me. I was so consumed by stress, I hadn't felt like myself. I had been catching myself too overwhelmed to offer a smile to a stranger, or do the things I would normally do, like drop change in a bucket or make a donation to an important charity or take a hat out of my glove compartment and give it to someone on the street ― things I like to do but this year felt I couldn't. Emotionally and financially, I was maxed out, and that meant I wasn't in the spirit of helping others, even though I wanted to.
Unlike his predecessor, Kurt Waldheim who was regarded as a workaholic and who spent long hours in his office, Pérez de Cuéllar liked to get away from it all. He is very jealous of his own privacy, a close aide said.
Girl, you got this. You're strong, brave and beautiful. You are a powerful woman who is fully capable of rocking out this adulthood thing. You're in your twenties - maybe single, maybe married, maybe soon to be - and you are simply amazing. Don't worry. Stay close to your Father, and your sisters, and rock some red lipstick when you feel down. I'm here for you. Go kick some a**!

Ireland just expanded the legal definition of domestic violence to include emotional and psychological abuse.
One small example of a benefit: When I'm home sometimes I wear a kerchief on my head that makes me feel like I look like a less than attractive peasant from the old country. So I was happily surprised when during the Appreciation part of one of our weekly marriage meetings, my husband complimented me for looking cute wearing the kerchief. This gave me a warm feeling inside and an outward smile. We've been holding these meetings for twenty-seven years. I practice what I preach!
If she DID get married, Liz Bennet would have had a prenup.
As the first female combat veteran ever to run for president and the first American Samoan member of Congress, she was neither a traditional Democrat nor a traditional candidate.
There's so many different ways of looking at it, he continued. You can either say here's somebody who, like everybody, needed to be heard and understood and to have a voice. Or you can say this is somebody that disproportionately needs a large quantity of people to be fixated on him. His satisfaction comes as he stands in amongst the madness.

If you don't start offending your wife, I don't think you're going to have a marriage. I heard these words come out of my mouth at a recent session with a couple in my office. I imagined that they were thinking, This family therapist is crazy. But I was pretty sure I was right.
My fiancé and I have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. But one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word -- prenup.
It all centered on preparation and cooking. It took two to three days to buy all the groceries. I had to go to traditional markets, big supermarkets and even small shops when I needed a specialty item.
The law allows people to petition for custody of a pet. It empowers judges to take into consideration the care of the pet when determining sole or joint ownership. Questions like who walked the dog? and who took the cat to vet appointments? are now permissible criteria for determining custody.

I'm the only unmarried person in my family. I asked Kim how women should take on their roles as daughter, sister and sister-in-law so that there will be no regrets later.
The duchess is seeking a summary judgment that would find in her favor and dismiss the newspaper's defense case. Her lawyer Justin Rushbrooke argued that the publisher had no real prospect of winning the case.
As with so many character traits that are annoying, what's helpful is to expect the response ahead of time, Rutherford said. If you're talking about your own accomplishments, assume the one-upper will do the same. They have to stick their two cents in, whether what they're saying is truth or fabrication. If you expect it, it has less impact on you. It can even make you smile.
What if we all wore little red heart pins on our lapels.
This was a mutt they got at the pound, and it wasn't worth money, said family attorney Erin Levine of Oakland, California, who represented the husband and said the judge gave her grief for not settling the dispute out of court in the 2015 case. There was no way we weren't going to litigate this; they were so attached to the dog.
A year ago, Meghan and Harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said was the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. They recently bought a house in Santa Barbara, California.

I couldn't sleep for weeks leading up to Dec. 25. I stayed awake refreshing my bank account on my phone to see if my paycheck had cleared. It finally did on the evening of the 23rd, and I frantically went out and did all of my shopping ― for my two kids and everyone else ― on Christmas Eve. Mostly, I crafted and made cookies and wrote heartfelt notes to teachers and people I wanted to do more for but couldn't, financially.
Guterres said on Thursday he would urge governments to achieve gender parity in senior leadership. He said he achieved gender parity among his senior leadership team - on Jan. 1, 90 women and 90 men were in the ranks of full-time senior leadership, two years ahead of the target date he set.

We have learned a lot about sexual assault and other violence against women in the intervening decades, she said. The person who is most likely to sexually assault a woman is a man she knows — and resistance takes a different form when it's someone you know.
Remember we had to get out of our current home soon and we had searched and searched until we found just the right place. My male need to be in control wanted to just brush her off for having unnecessary anxiety. But we are people of faith and I trusted her intuition in spiritual matters. So I called off the deal. She was right. Not long after I received an offer for a better paying job that required moving out of that area. Had I not listened to her we would have been locked into a 12 month lease.
Pérez de Cuéllar married the former Marcela Temple. He had a son, Francisco, and a daughter, Cristina, by a previous marriage.
Turning to an expert helped us power through a difficult set of conversations about basic finance and how things will work once our money is merged and the money we make becomes shared. Once we knew what we were both bringing into the relationship, and were close to agreeing on how to implement shared money habits, we decided it was time to think about whether or not we wanted a prenup. While I always thought prenups were for people who had millions of dollars in assets, it turns out I was wrong.
There was no sign of forced entry into the house, police said. Based on the evidence, authorities surmised Leigh had been killed inside.
The country singer seemingly took a shot at ex-wife Miranda Lambert, who's been accused of beginning a relationship with her current boyfriend, Turnpike Troubadours frontman Evan Felker, while he was still married.
I felt my financial struggles gaining on me, so I picked up extra jobs wherever I could, bargain-shopped and sold items that were sitting in my garage. I tried hard to get ahead of it. Still, I wondered if January 2020 would be the year that it all came crashing down. For a while, it was all I could think about. I wondered how anyone, especially single parents, was able to financially survive in modern times. Personally, I felt like I was constantly underwater.

I remember calling my husband's 6-year-old brother young master, but in informal settings, I would use his real name. When an elder relative got wind of this, however, he told me to call him young master instead. I thought it was irrational.
The common theme is that the interaction left one person feeling uncomfortable, she told us. Whether intended or not, most filing a claim or complaint describe the pursuing employee's approach as awkward or inappropriate.

Like all questions of progress when it comes to diversity and inclusion, actually quantifying forward advancement, or using award shows to gauge that movement, is tenuous at best. Progress usually comes in stops and starts. One year, Moonlight may win the coveted Best Picture Academy Award. Another year, the white savior buddy movie Green Book may inexplicably take the top prize.
While Guterres did not name and shame, President Donald Trump's administration has led a push at the U.N. against the promotion of sexual and reproductive health services for women because the administration sees that as code for abortion.

7. And ultimately, life is too short to be miserable in your marriage.
Truthfully, I was starting to panic. I whispered affirmations to myself. I brainstormed ways to make up the money. I sold my engagement ring for $250, picked up freelance assignments and I reached out on a Facebook community where fellow writers and editors often discuss work opportunities. In a moment of panic, I wrote a quick note about my situation and let members know I was available for some quick jobs if anyone had anything to toss my way.

While some couples may view debt as a deal breaker, Rollo said that for most, it's dishonesty. I've had several clients present to couples counseling because they feel deceived by their partner.

Transferring to the United Nations in 1975, he was appointed by Waldheim as the secretary-general's special representative in Cyprus. During his two years on the divided island he helped to promote intercommunal peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
Another solution was to have a puja, a ceremony initiated by a priest whose chants and prayers would ward off the inauspicious energy. I could also wear a suitable yantra (gemstone) per my zodiac sign in what I learned was considered gemstone therapy, and the gem would radiate positive energy and lure away ill omens.
I am sure there are many examples of others who did not heed the advice of their astrologer and still went on to experience successful marriages. We plan on joining those ranks.

Meilleur acteur dans un second rôle:
I thought that each of us should be free and independent for a healthy marital relationship, and a lot has changed. After I left, my children also became independent, and my husband was alone. When I came back after my surgery, I saw him cleaning the house and watering the flower pots. [Laughs.] Now we do everything together, from start to finish, when we cook.
Can I run to the ladies' room? I'd ask the supervisor on duty. I tried to flag down another shopper so they'd get into my line before the lawyer mother I knew who had just returned from a weekend of skiing did. I didn't want to ring up her organic dragon fruit or imported cheese.
I know that not everybody understands that O'Hare can be a romantic place, but it absolutely can, Buttigieg said Monday. The first time Chasten and I ever communicated was on this app called Hinge, and he was sitting at Gate B5 at the airport. ... I always remembered that, in a certain technical sense, even though it was remotely, that was where we first met.
Pérez de Cuéllar maintained that, as secretary-general of the Peruvian foreign ministry at the time, he was required by protocol to take part in the ceremony even though he had no pro-junta leanings.
No matter what I did, I'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. I'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.
These were the people that I worked with. They brought me bags of their leftover school supplies for my kids. They offered me advice on marriage and parenting. They shared my love of horror movies. And it killed me to realize that the whole time, while I tried to profess my merits to customers who judged me, I had judged my co-workers.
Thank you guys so much for sharing my broken heart with me, she said onstage.
The body image wrestle and win. While the age at which this occurs is different for all of us, there comes a time in every woman's life where she decides that she is going to love her body. I am lucky that this age for me came early on in my life. Of course I have wrestled with certain things I don't like about my appearance, and things I wish I could change, as we all have. But I have been blessed with people in my life who encourage me in this area, most especially my husband. I think the wrestle ended before we even got married. What really drove it home was coming to the place where I knew that God created me this way, just how He wanted me to be, no more and no less. He wanted every detail about my appearance to be there. Once I accepted this, I was awestruck by the truth of it. Thinking of Who wanted me to be this way, blew my mind. I can honestly say that I don't struggle with my body-image now. Of course some days are better than others, and there are days in every woman's life where she feels average, plain, not pretty. But there is something about this stage of life that just makes us throw our hands up and say I'm done. We throw out all of the lies. We get tired of hearing that we're not perfect. So we take You're too____. and You're not____enough.
It was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. I'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason.

I needed to find a job that I could do at night once my husband came home. That way we'd eliminate our child care costs entirely and I would still bring in some extra money to help ease our other financial burdens. That's what I was offered by a grocery store located in the affluent town we could barely afford to live in.

It's become an inevitable game, of sorts, every awards season for the last several years (particularly in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite in 2015), for us to tally up so-called diversity and inclusion wins.
Jokes aside, one-uppers ― people who listen to you tell a story and immediately try to do you one better (or try to do you one worse, if you shared something sad) ― are some of the least pleasant people to talk to.
You're excited about getting married soon.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, however, will be going in a different direction. In March, Kensington Palace announced that the couple decided on a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream frosting by chef Claire Ptak of London's Violet bakery.

People are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined.
How can I possibly explain the confusion that washed over me after a night of extreme emotional ups and downs? I could barely concentrate at work, and ended up asking my boss if I could leave early to go to the doctor. Was I pregnant or not? Needless to say, I really wish someone would have told me about false positives, and how they are apparently more common than we are all lead to believe. This entire experience caused a very unnecessary roller coaster of emotions that, when paired with an already hormonal time of the month, absolutely wore me out.

Only Alaska and Illinois have similar statutes, both of which took effect in 2017. But the California law is the most specific, and at least a handful of other states are looking to it as a model.
Although I'm not religious or an avid believer in astrology, I didn't argue with my parents' reliance on the astrologer's recommendations because it was just easier than trying to dispute the accuracy of his claims. They found solace in knowing that the Universe was somehow supportive of key milestones for me, and for most of my life, my personal pursuits seemed to be reinforced by the cosmic world they believed in, so I chose not to rebel.
Pets are very emotional, Quirk said. As the owner of a rescue dog … I thought it was very important that their welfare be taken into consideration.
We spent full day in silence after a conversation about how to split our money and wages went south after discussing the potential scenario of having kids. I would have to temporarily stop working for a few months, and we both freelance so there's no such thing as paid maternity or paternity leave for us. We didn't reach a resolution.

Considering that months would often pass before we could see each other again, communication was all we had.

I could see the color drain from my parents' faces. My mom immediately went into problem-solving mode, inquiring what remedies were available to undo the cosmic block.

I was capable of more than ringing and bagging his groceries, I wanted to shout, hopefully jarring him from a call too important to allow him to acknowledge a fellow human being ― me. Instead, I looked at my growing line and thought of my ring times. I'd just have to make the next customer understand: I was not just a cashier. This was not a real job for me. I pushed the button to move their items down the belt and allowed myself to get lost in the hum of the store.
My fiancé and I are hoping to get married in London this coming September, once the global pandemic is over (or at least much less severe) and we can have our big fat Indian wedding safely in the presence of our close family and friends. There are still a lot of unknowns ahead of us but there's one thing I do know for sure: Astrology won't be on our guest list.

The nomination failed to win Senate approval. There was no public debate, but congressional sources in Lima said opposition came from Javier Alva Orlandini, Peruvian vice president and leader of the ruling Popular Action Party. The sources said Orlandini resented Pérez de Cuéllar's participation in the swearing in of the military junta that overthrew Belaunde Terry in 1968.
Rustin was a great American who was both gay and black at a time when the sheer fact of being either or both could land you in jail, she said in a statement praising Newsom. This pardon assures his place in history.
The more I talked to friends about this and told them I might want to get one, the more I felt judged. Some friends even texted me asking if I was having second thoughts about marrying my fiancé. I'm not. I truly feel like marrying this person is the best decision but that doesn't mean I should feel shamed for wanting to figure out how I will walk out of the marriage, financially, if it ever comes to that. The wedding day will be a great day in our lives, but it's the marriage that's the most important ― and this includes discussing our finances.
Luckily, some work relationships work out great, Edmonds said. I met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. You just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. PDA or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.

In New York, where we plan to get married, the money you make becomes marital. Which means, it's shared. Money or assets from the past become marital, too, unless you protect them with a prenup or don't add any money to your savings account, investments or assets.
It also would be something that could calm my pre-marriage anxiety, which I find normal. You're about to legally bind a lot of yourself to another person, shouldn't that feel a little scary? We decided to educate ourselves on what a prenup would mean and in the process, figuring out the best moves for ourselves individually and as a couple.
At about 9:00 a.m., Yarborough made a frantic 911 call to the Tupelo Police Department. She requested immediate assistance at her home on a cul-de-sac on the city's west side, telling the dispatcher that her daughter was missing and that she'd found traces of blood inside the house.

Her declaration of resignation as eldest daughter-in-law changed almost everything. Her husband, whom she moved in with again after knee surgery in September 2017, finally began to listen to her, and the annual ancestral rites and holiday ceremonies, which had been a source of immense strain and stress, were simplified. She and her husband grew in respect for one another, and ended up not divorcing. The change that occurred in her daily life was significant enough that she has called it amiracle, even a small revolution.
The new law makes Ireland one of only a handful of countries that have set such a precedent.

LDRs are not an easy feat. They take work, no matter how serious or mutually casual the relationship. These kinds of relationships make you answer the very nerve-wracking question: What do I want from this and am I willing to do the work to make it happen? This is a terrifying aspect of romance that many millennials and Gen Z babes avoid in the never-ending quest to try and be 'chill.' LDRs don't really have room for 'chill' and force us to figure out our values and get clear about what we want. Ultimately, that can leave you with a relationship (or relationships) that sustain you and benefit you in the long-term. — Engle

I have been through all of it, and I'm currently just a little bit past it, but not too far ahead. The 20s are a very formative decade, and come with so many changes it's hard to keep your head on straight sometimes.
