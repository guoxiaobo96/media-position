but despite the city enjoying freedom of speech and assembly, it does not recognise same-sex marriage and campaigners say lgbt people still face widespread discrimination and often come under family pressure to marry and have children.
we continued couples therapy under the banner of our new plan. my husband began individual therapy in order to process the resentments and emotional regulation issues that had driven him to cheat in the first place. and as we started dipping our toes into dating, i embarked on a journey of self-discovery that made me feel more alive than i had in years ― in all of the joyous and terrible ways one might imagine.

the overwhelming majority of written records are from five native american nations: cherokee, choctaw, chickasaw, muskogee (creek), and seminole. the federal government called these the five civilized tribes for various reasons (one of which was the fact that they owned black slaves). andrew k. frank provides the following definition on the oklahoma historical society website:
marriage is a commitment to not just another person, but also to the idea of hanging in there through thick and thin, good and bad. my husband was a big goofy guy, an imperfect teddy bear with an occasional growl. i got scrawled notes for my birthday instead of little blue tiffany boxes and i cherish every one of them.
the breakup won't be a surprise to many, who noted there were serious lifestyle differences between the couple.
emma mcintyre via getty images fancy running into you, bradley.
my parents divorced when i was 6 years old. by the time i was a teenager, i had experienced a decade of my mom modeling what it means to be a strong, independent, self-sufficient woman, and wondered if i would ever want to get married simply because marriage didn't seem necessary. it was around that same time that she began dating the man that she would marry and spend the next 25 years with, until he passed away two years ago. their marriage was full of love and laughter, and demonstrated that it is possible for two individuals to share a life together without having to sacrifice their own interests or independence. they also showed me that even though marriage isn't necessary, with the right person, it sure can be a lot of fun ― and 15 years in, mine just keeps getting better. ― susanne kerns, blogger and contributor to but did you die? setting the parenting bar low

while i'm grateful to people like filmmaker dream hampton and others who believed us and cared for us, i didn't always feel supported by the network and the higher-ups. an article is one thing, but a tv series that broke the internet is something completely different, and we were just not prepared.
i'm currently married, and i was married once before this. when i married my first wife, it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship, to the point where the act of getting married seemed to make it clear we weren't right for each other. when i got married for the second time, it definitely felt more like the ideal progression of our relationship. we became stronger as a couple as a result. - chris, married five years

on abortion matters, kacsmaryk fought to give pharmacists the right to deny emergency contraceptives to women. in a 2016 amicus brief filed with the supreme court, he wrote that a washington state law requiring pharmacists either to fill a medical prescription or find an available pharmacist who will, which had been upheld by the 9th circuit, authorizes an unprecedented and dangerous intrusion on the most basic right of conscience. the supreme court let the 9th circuit decision stand.
bev nance, 68, and mary walsh, 72, of shrewsbury, missouri, filed the lawsuit against friendship village in july 2018. the women, who have been married since 2009, claimed in the suit that the nearby senior living community had rejected their application for a unit after they'd paid a $2,000 deposit because of a longstanding cohabitation policy defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, as marriage is understood in the bible.
wyrick filed an amicus brief in the landmark 2014 hobby lobby case, in which the supreme court ruled that closely held corporations are in some circumstances exempt from regulations their owners object to on religious grounds — specifically, the contraceptive coverage mandate of the affordable care act. in his brief, wyrick argued that the mandate was unconstitutional because religious faith is more than mere belief. it is practice.
we asked relationship experts to tell us what kinds of things, both big and small, happy couples do for each other without being asked. here's what they had to say:
we date and spend time together to figure out if a person is right for us, but time together is important also because the experiences that we have together build a bond, piece by piece, marriage and family therapist becky whetstone told huffpost. the bonds are what helps the relationship withstand good times and bad.

as the new millennium dawned, lopez's clout soared. her name alone was enough to get the experimental psycho-thriller the cell (2000) an instant green light, director tarsem singh said. when she joined the rom-com vogue by signing on to the wedding planner (2001), the movie's $10 million budget shot to $30 million, partly to accommodate her $7 million paycheck, which was equal to that of co-star matthew mcconaughey, according to producer jennifer gibgot. meanwhile, lopez and combs were central figures in the tabloid-magazine boom times. following their 2001 split, lopez was riding high: she was the first person to have a no. 1 movie (the wedding planner) and no. 1 album (j.lo, her second) simultaneously.

anything you do that is outside the agreed-upon boundaries of the relationship is cheating. with that said, it is helpful to define the relationship so you are aware of the boundaries. there are different stages in relationships, and at every stage, boundaries should be clarified because most people are not actually on the same page when they assume the boundaries. this can be complicated when people are in open relationships. however, people who are poly/open seem to be more direct about setting boundaries and being honest about what they are ok with. ― angela skurtu, sex therapist and marriage counselor in st. louis, missouri

how to manage debt in future relationships
having spent my childhood feeling there was no point in excelling at anything, i learned that there is every point. you are the captain of the ship that is your life and working hard will make you a better captain ― your voyage will be more rewarding for it. god will not fix it for me so that i can live in a log cabin with a tame lion in the backyard. if i want a cabin, and indeed a backyard, i will have to earn it with my own skills. believing in armageddon's imminence, childhood me felt nothing i wanted was possible. in contrast, now i feel as though everything is possible. but i'll have to get it for myself. the independence remains intoxicating.

1. follow your dreams. even when you're at the end of your self-confidence rope. even when everyone around you is a naysayer. even when you're eating leftover toast for dinner every night. don't quit. recent studies show that older folks need to push through the discomfort of learning something new to keep their brains strong and viable. and that's an accurate metaphor for a lot of things in life. so, if you really want it -- whatever it is -- you must find a way to propel yourself through the pain, the self-doubt, the criticism, and the nagging voices in your head telling you to just give it up. (because, really, who do you think you are to want that thing, that job, that promotion, that role?) sound familiar?

flatt receives hundreds of requests every week from teachers and schools around the country who want to implement quest to learn's teaching model. recently, a chicago school asked for quest's entire curriculum, and tried to integrate it into their existing one. it didn't work out. the teachers were not given sufficient training, and students were often confused. this is a concept that requires everyone to not just be onboard and willing, but to actually understand why things are done in this way, flatt said.

truthfully, i'm in a complicated place with my faith. i have found that i am no longer comfortable attending a church that i feel turned its back on my sister. a funny thing happens when you take a step back from a church that plays such a central part in its members' lives. you begin to question everything. you strip away all you thought you knew to be true and must dare to ask yourself, what do i really believe? it's a place of uncertainty and even fear.

during the case, nielson argued that sexual orientation is a choice and disputed the harmful effects of discrimination on lgbtq people. when a u.s. district court ruled in 2010 that prop 8 violated the constitution, nielson argued that then-chief judge vaughn walker should have recused himself from the case because he was gay and therefore, nielson claimed, unable to be fair on the issue. he filed a motion contending that walker had a duty to disclose not only the facts concerning his [same-sex] relationship, but also his marriage intentions. that motion was denied by another judge.

growing up, we had no clue our school had the policy statements or hiring forms it does. no student was, to my knowledge, ever expelled for being gay. that would never happen, because no student would ever dare come out in the stifling environment of ics. no openly gay or lesbian teacher was ever turned away, because it would have been clear from a mile away this wasn't the place for them. the policies were there, i'm sure, in a file cabinet somewhere. they stated what would, to anyone attending the institution, go without saying. and they enforced something much more consequential, namely the curriculum.

believing everything revolves around you, it's a heavy, weighted-down way to live. bothered by every breath of wind, you're always harried, under pressure and under attack, like you're the butt of every joke. there's no rolling with the punches or going with the flow or any other easygoing cliche you can think of. just think about how it feels when you're legitimately attacked. now imagine subjecting yourself to that feeling for every minuscule, mundane annoyance you inherently experience in everyday society.

1. exercise faith: what is faith? faith is when you take god at his word. it is when you believe that you will receive those things which you have been praying for. what are you hoping to accomplish in 2016? do you want to live a healthier lifestyle? does your financial situation seem hopeless? the good news is, god can do exceedingly and abundantly more than you could ever ask or think. whatever it is that you long for, big or small, it is going to take faith to receive it. you must be determined to walk by faith and not by sight. in matthew 14, peter, one of the twelve apostles, defied the laws of gravity and walked on water, for as long as his eyes were fixed on jesus. i wonder what monumental feats you will be able to accomplish and overcome through faith in 2016. remain steadfast. make 2016, the year that you believe god to do the impossible.

i walked into 2017 with one resolution. to stop pretending. to stop looking like i had everything together. to fall apart more publicly and create space in my life for imperfection. to genuinely stop chasing this high of having it all together. because this is me over here trying to show you how great i am. it's really about control - isn't everything? but before i acknowledge that; let me humbly share my home-made gluten free vegan muffin recipe that i make each night; or pictures of my home in which i'm organized and have konmari-ed the shit out of every drawer. there's nothing wrong with any of those things; it's the motive behind it. what's driving us? who sent us all this stupid memo with these expectations that slowing down is the devil's handiwork and that upping one another on how much we are doing is the new conversation piece at playgroup.
in this professionalised approach to wedding planning, elites have begun the trend of celebrating some of the most traditionally muted rituals with much glam and glitz, which would otherwise be celebrated with austerity especially in a middle class setting. for example, at the elite weddings i attended, for the small ceremonies of haldi (smearing the bride and groom's body with turmeric powder) and gharcholi (bathing the bride and groom with holy water), a troupe of singers was invited and silver coins were given to the attendees.
many of those throwing bloomberg their support are mayors whose cities have benefited from seven- and eight-figure donations from bloomberg's vast network of philanthropies. others have personally attended an elite, bloomberg-financed boot camp for mayors. stevens cited her past work as a fellow with bloomberg philanthropies as one of the reasons for her endorsement.

believe that your friends and family want to be there for you, olmedo said. it can help to get your thoughts out of your head so you're not stuck in a loop, and you can get feedback from someone you trust that what you're feeling is valid. if you're feeling stuck, give working with a counselor or therapist a try for an objective ear. do what you need to remind yourself you're a good person who deserves a good relationship.
the bottom line is, i think to find peace, acceptance and happiness in life after divorce--to really move on, a person needs the courage and strength to become self-aware. self-awareness is the first step to making changes in your life to be the person you really want to be.

lopez shot anaconda and selena back to back, with anaconda hitting theaters less than a month after the 1997 biopic about the late singer selena quintanilla-pérez. lopez secured selena — and her first $1 million salary — via what was said to be the largest casting search since scarlett o'hara. the filmmakers auditioned thousands of upstarts at a time when there were no age-appropriate latina actresses with name value, according to producer moctesuma esparza. when the movie debuted at no. 2 and drew rapturous reviews for lopez, it validated what our instincts were about her, zee said. anaconda suddenly had a lot more weight, especially among underserved audiences of color.

for months, biden and his campaign were not particularly exciting, but they were trucking along. sanders' candidacy was generating hype and enthusiasm, but how that would translate into primary votes remained fuzzy. biden and sanders were arguably in the best positions as the nominating contest ramped up: each man's name recognition among democratic voters was matched only by the other's, and both had very high favorability ratings among primary voters.

basically, if james dobson or rush limbaugh was saying it, we were hearing it. while many of the messages were probably typically the kind you'd hear in any christian school, i think they had a particular intensity there. we weren't in oklahoma; we were inside the beltway, in the lion's den, and the world around us was an evil, corrupt, and frightening place. one day, when we graduated, we would have to go out into this world. we would have to be prepared.

a life that never cared about status symbols impressing the neighbors or living for job titles. the stuff we had accumulated was my idea, never his. in all honesty, i was the one buying into societies view of success and happiness. turns out death teaches you the value and real meaning of life. death teaches you that how society tells you to live is a set of rules you don't have to conform to or accept. death teaches you that memories and experiences are real wealth for those of us who are left behind to make sense of life after loss. death teaches you to live fully, bravely and honestly without the consumption of stuff as a means of artificial happiness.

i didn't think i was going to get pregnant that easily. we (she and flynn) had been living together and planned to get married, and i had been taking care of and spending time with jenny, david's older daughter, so my biological clock was ticking quite loudly. i had katie (at age 31), and i wanted to have natural childbirth, breathe my way through it, possibly have the baby in a hot tub, have a doula, but my father was an ob/gyn in england, and he said, 'there is no reason to have pain, so get an epidural, and do not have a baby anywhere but in a hospital because even in the most normal of pregnancies, something can happen. and, while you may be willing to take that risk, do you really want to know that your child who might have needed emergency help didn't get it?!' so, i had the baby in the hospital, and it wasn't a perfect birth. i don't think i've ever told anyone what happened here... but she tried to exit from two places at some time. the doctor said he'd never seen anything like that. so, there was a lot of stitching going on. and, the interesting thing is that when katie was pregnant with willa, she announced she was gonna have a doula, etc., and i reminded her of the story of what happened with her. i've learned, though, with children that they never listen to you.

in my situation, my son was too young to comprehend my pregnancy and the loss of it, so with much consideration and upon seeking consultation about how best to relay the news, we decided it was best to say, 'we thought mommy was pregnant, but it turns out she isn't,' zucker explained. when my son was 10, however, we had a frank and nuanced conversation about my 16 week miscarriage and how it affected me, our family, my work life and the age gap between my two children.

you think you're so funny, she said.
our parents' divorces didn't make us lose faith in love. if anything, it taught us what not to do in a relationship. what divorce did do was show us that marriage doesn't mean much when divorce is such an accessible option. it also showed us that marriage doesn't make a relationship happy or better. in fact, we learned that marriage was pretty insignificant when it came to whether our parents were happy or unhappy in their relationships.

men are praised for their gray hair while women are seen as old, less beautiful, and, moreover, infertile! marine tells me. she notes that while women seem to be embracing their gray hair, society still appears to have a long way to go to erase the taboo of the time period in which menstruation ends and women's bodies change again.

they don't just say, 'i saw you on the show,' she said. they say, 'i was in an abusive marriage,' or 'i was gang-raped and i've been carrying that' or 'i never got any information and i'm 50 and i've never had an orgasm.' i never feel overwhelmed by the work, but i tear up sometimes and sometimes i feel overwhelmed by the need. these women are so isolated. what i always lead with is, as women, we've all been traumatized to some degree; you're not alone.

though i had always admired and supported her work, until recently, our professional lives had remained separate worlds. that changed the day joe biden called and asked her to join the ticket as his running mate. on that day it quickly became clear that this wasn't just about my love for my wife, but also about my love for this country. stepping back from my career as an entertainment lawyer was a decision that we made together — this was about something bigger than either of us. — emhoff
i want to try to incorporate rest daily. this can look like a 15-minute yoga video or sitting for 10 minutes between sessions and focusing on deep breathing. this can even look like resting on the couch with my eyes closed and not napping. we tend to always be going and not think about the importance of rest. we tend to think and talk about the importance of sleep, but forget about the benefits of rest. rest gives your mind a break. it gives your mind a chance to pause from thinking. rest can help with stress, anxiety and focus. ― rebecca leslie, a psychologist in atlanta

we eloped on july 16 in brooklyn bridge park, near jane's carousel, with the brooklyn bridge in the background. while i imagine eloping in big sur would still be amazing, i can't imagine having a better wedding day than the one we had. because of the pandemic, there were barely any people out in brooklyn when we got married. our photographer took incredible pictures of us in locations that would normally be crowded. the ceremony was so intimate. we don't feel shortchanged in the respect that it wasn't done in front of guests — just two people in love, stumbling their way through vows.
we're sorry for any degree that our existence, and the publicity of our supposedly successful marriage made you feel 'less than' as you made your own terribly difficult choices. and we're sorry if our story made it easier for people in your life to reject you and your difficult path as being wrong, the jan. 25 blog read. if this is you, we want you to know: you were right.

in some ways, the pandemic makes it more enticing to have a second child ― a friend for our daughter, ample time at home for both parents, a built-in excuse to not entertain friends and family ― but it also makes it difficult for people like us that don't have family nearby who can help with child care or preparing for a newborn, she said.
sex is undoubtedly going to be different post-baby, with each of you experiencing highs and lows in sexual desire. fatigue, stress, a lack of time or your baby's sleeping habits might get in the way of sex, or there may be physical impediments, such as vaginal bleeding or pain from breastfeeding.
6) you have a novel coming out in march from atria books (whoop, whoop!) called mrs. houdini - does your poetry inform your prose, or vice versa? updike famously had separate writing rooms for his fiction and nonfiction writing - do you find different spaces and environments more helpful depending on the form you're working in?
this one seems obvious, but it's the sign that's most telling: think back on your lives prior to moving in together. were you happier and more satisfied with your relationship? was consolidating your space your undoing? if so, un-moving in can be a smart move, said karla ivankovich, a counselor in chicago, illinois.
good or bad, after you've had someone to spend this day with for years, it may feel like that is the only option, and may leave you feeling out of sorts, like, perhaps, more a failure than you already did, and make you start to question if you made the right choice to split. these first holidays on your own can be tough, but keep in mind that you did not come to the decision to be on your own lightly, and that it is the day that is making you question yourself, not the ultimate decision. come tomorrow, things will feel clear again, and you can be reinforced as you listen to all the stories around you of valentine's gone wrong. so what should you do with yourself on your very own first valentine's day in quite some time?

in theory, a dynamic database that helpfully points out everyone who needs government assistance sounds like a great idea. but the only way to do so in practice is by continuously monitoring the economic and social lives of every citizen — something that experts with the best intentions did not realise at the time. over three years, every additional suggestion has only made the social registry more and more intrusive.

as a mission of the catholic church, catholic schools are places where students come to learn and know the church's teachings, one of which is the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, the statement read. for this reason, catholic school administrators, teachers, or staff members that persist in public acts that are contrary to catholic teachings disqualify themselves from the opportunity to continue in their leadership role within a catholic school.

in 2007, when i was 14, i appeared on kids by the dozen, a reality show that aired on the learning channel and featured my family and other large families like mine. our part of the series was shot over nine days that year, just long ― and short ― enough for us to keep up appearances as one big happy family. my father, chris jeub, controlled both my education and my occupation. a gen x middle-class man, he first carved a place in my small world by controlling the uterus of my mother, wendy, who gave birth to me and my 15 siblings.

happy couples tell each other what they need rather than expecting that their partner will or should just know. - kurt smith
so on our podcast, we talk about several reality dating shows, but focus primarily on the bachelor. and shows like the bachelor are kind of notoriously overwhelmingly white and obviously you guys are an interracial couple. you became kind of the central love story of this juggernaut reality tv show. i'm wondering if that's something that either of you thought about while filming and how you've been conscious of that as the show has aired and you've seen the response.

i was still working and auditioning when i got married again to my second husband, tom girardi, who is a very well-known and very successful attorney. almost instantly, i assumed his life and was suddenly living the life of a very prominent lawyer's wife. it was very comfortable and really great and i was experiencing the best of everything, but at the same time, i was in a kind of a coma because i wasn't creating anything. i was learning a lot from tom about the law at its highest level — he's an incredible teacher and a scholar — but it was a totally new kind of education and a totally new life for me.
the solution: it's really a matter of negotiating the energy, luiz says. often couples end up feeling triggered and like they have nothing to give each other and the first few months with the baby are a complete and total nightmare. but for couples who are enjoying the fulfillment of the baby, they won't feel that shift in sexual need and desire.

the insurance provided by deeper cover mortgage insurance could be executed cheaper than the gses' current fee structure for the same protections. of course, in order for this form of credit risk transfer to be effective in reducing costs to homeowners, a commensurate reduction of gse fees must reflect the greatly reduced risk of loss borne by the gses.

the effect of this environment went beyond the official coursework. teachers, especially in the later grades, where students started to converse about the topics of the day, would constantly editorialize and share their opinions about the world. they were encouraged to do so, i'm sure, and they presented their views as gospel fact.

under the current mortgage finance operating model, mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac (commonly referred to as the government sponsored enterprises, or gses) acquire mortgages from lenders and then package and sell them to investors. the homeowners to whom the mortgages are granted have an ongoing obligation to repay the principal and interest costs of these loans. in the event that a homeowner fails to pay their mortgage, the gses are obligated to pay at least some of the difference to the investors. the risk described here is called credit risk and the gses have a great deal of it. reasonable estimates on their $4.5 trillion book of mortgages is that they carry about $200 billion of real risk outlays at any given time - even more if the economy turns sour and mortgage defaults spike.
it's become fashionable to dismiss childhood trauma as a motivator, especially in fiction; it reads as overused, overdetermined and cheap. nadia herself is dismissive of the role of her mother's death, and preceding mental illness, in her own psychology. but the show refuses to either reject that explanation or to offer it in a pat, schmaltzy way. like many people who lost a parent young, i can attest that it can cause complications down the line ― especially because you're often too young to properly grieve, and you simply skip over the healing process. that doesn't mean that nadia's brashness can be completely written off as repressed pain. it just means that she has a knot in herself to untwist, rather belatedly. the scene where she rid herself of the visions ... well, it was graphic. but necessary!
one of the first signs that things aren't going to last? when the bride or groom is extremely into themselves. this person is usually very attention-seeking and not in a 'yay, it's my big day!' way. with some brides, they make faces like they're posing for pictures even during a regular conversation. they usually are overly touchy with their fiancé as well and those two things together usually indicate it's just putting on a show. most couples who are genuinely in it for the long haul are more into each other than themselves.  ― rachel abolafia, co-owner of great expectations weddings and events in las vegas

the choice of purple may have been a tribute to the late rep. shirley chisholm (d-n.y.), the first black woman to run for president. as a mix of red and blue, purple can also symbolize unity, which former first lady hillary clinton opted for with her purple outfit. i want to just send a bit of a symbolic message that we need to come together, the former secretary of state said.

many singles in their 30s can't date, as the pandemic has made it hard, so they are looking to real estate porn to fill the gap, new york-based psychiatrist lea lis told huffpost. they are wanting to escape from cities to a simpler, more green life. this has become more appealing for many, creating the mass exodus that cities like new york and boston have experienced. the sketch is actually so funny and real, and humor is the best way to escape from the harsh reality which is 2020-21, including the covid pandemic, loneliness and isolation.
ross added that having frank discussions about women's bodies and their pleasure is a powerful way to move the culture forward in regards to sexual wellness and shatter the shame associated with sex and genitals.
i thought of how much of a challenge pregnancy was, how i wasn't able to deliver naturally and how my body couldn't feed my child. it was becoming obvious to me that i wasn't meant to be a mom. people say that your maternal instincts kick in as soon as your baby is born and to follow your gut. my instincts were screaming that something was terribly wrong. i was sure the worst would happen at any moment. i knew my marriage would be devastated over it and that i would never recover. i felt i had ruined everyone's lives. i also thought about the end of maternity leave, and how i would go back to work without having enjoyed my baby; and if he lived that long, he would surely die without me at home watching over him.

i consider that my life now -- the one i have opted for in lieu of proximity to my children, my friends, the job i had - must fly in the face of what our bra-burning sisters of yesterday fought for: emancipation from male dictate. am i anathema to the liberation they battled for? i cook for him, i run a home for him because he's the kind of bloke who enjoys a home with kids and cats and fat labradors slumped on floors, i entertain his colleagues and sometimes i bite my tongue when they ask me how i find life here (sometimes, not always: i'm married, remember, not mute). i try to remember to consider my reflection in the mirror; i try to remember that it is not just me that sees the face that scowls back (and so i drag on some lippie). i try to smile when he comes home. i open a beer for him (and one for me too) and i relate my day.
for decades, this is what psychologists thought, too: that the key stages in identity formation for gay men all led up to coming out, that once we were finally comfortable with ourselves, we could begin building a life within a community of people who'd gone through the same thing. but over the last 10 years, what researchers have discovered is that the struggle to fit in only grows more intense. a study published in 2015 found that rates of anxiety and depression were higher in men who had recently come out than in men who were still closeted. it's like you emerge from the closet expecting to be this butterfly and the gay community just slaps the idealism out of you, adam says. when he first started coming out, he says, i went to west hollywood because i thought that's where my people were. but it was really horrifying. it's made by gay adults, and it's not welcoming for gay kids. you go from your mom's house to a gay club where a lot of people are on drugs and it's like, this is my community? it's like the fucking jungle. i came out when i was 17, and i didn't see a place for myself in the gay scene, says paul, a software developer. i wanted to fall in love like i saw straight people do in movies. but i just felt like a piece of meat.
victoria kelly's poetry collection when the men go off to war received widespread critical acclaim since being published in september 2015 by the naval institute press. the military times hailed it for her themes of departure, absence and homecoming [which] are universal in place, and esteemed poet dick allen called it meticulously crafted [and] highly readable ... one of the finest first collections i've read in the last decade.

the monster-in-law (2005) producers knew to anticipate such hysteria, but they didn't know how intense it would get. to combat paparazzi who stalked the production through los angeles, the crew had to erect makeshift walls and station assistants with umbrellas blocking the action, according to producer chris bender. nevertheless, photographers scaled roofs and camped out in the malibu cliffs to snap long-lens shots. bender, who had collaborated with the likes of ashton kutcher and rachel mcadams, had never experienced anything as manic as the lopez surveillance.
why has this omission persisted for so long? i can't imagine that it isn't a huge amount [due to] patriarchy, in the sense that for the same reason it gets disdained on the page, it gets disdained on the screen, said maclean. to this day, the people deciding which films and shows to finance are almost entirely men. shonda rhimes is that rare exception — a woman with creative control over a tv empire, and a fan of the quinn series.

reviews for el cantante were tepid, but the film at least succeeded in not positioning lopez as an underdog. it was the first movie she produced, and it shows: puchi has tenacity, agency, brass. the theatrical rollout, on the other hand, didn't. the distributors marketed cantante with an urban vibe accenting the characters' druggy proclivities, and ichaso felt the pr exploited latin clichés that didn't represent the film. plus, by the time it opened in august 2007, almost a full year after premiering at the toronto film festival, the world still hadn't forgiven lopez for gigli.

falling in love would be an interesting choice of words for a black woman to use because the hip-hop industry does not love women in the same way that women love hip-hop. women are deeply and emotionally connected to this genre, despite the fact that their role in the growth of the industry is easily dismissed. black women like sylvia robinson, queen latifah, missy elliot and others helped mold hip-hop into the musical juggernaut it is today.

i personally felt insulted and unheard, as none of those who had sent me the link had taken time to ask me what my experience had been like as a queer mormon, carlston said. admittedly, the experience at the time was a bit humiliating. i had never found myself to be a lightning rod for folks to unleash their evangelizing before. it showed me a bit of what would lie ahead for me in the church: people who were uninformed or unconcerned about the realities and direness of the queer mormon experience.

too often we skirt around issues, thinking we are being clear but actually trying not to hurt their feelings, carroll said. being more straightforward — like asking, can you do the dishes in the sink before i start dinner? instead of just complaining under your breath and hoping your partner takes a hint — helps everyone to be on the same page and avoid resentment and miscommunication, she added.

eventually, in middle school, discussions would touch on sexuality. obviously, homosexuality was evil. they didn't talk about this a whole lot; it was best not to dwell on it, but the unfortunate topic had to be broached. what was shocking, even to me then, was the vitriol. these were christians and generally very kind people. evangelicals have a way of talking about sexual minorities in public. they use the word love a lot and talk softly of hating the sin. when they're among themselves, they tend to be more candid. needless to say, it was made very clear to me, and to all of us, that there was nothing worse than being gay. they were disgusting perverts who hated christians and had a nefarious agenda to dismantle society.

hair diversity is a problem, too. big banner movies and commercials almost never feature curly haired leads. curls do not feature in hair product ads and do not get the kind of care they need at most salons, because stylists consider kinky hair difficult. curly brides seldom wear their natural hair and go pin-straight on their big day; mainstream bridal fashions simply don't factor in curls. all of this underscores a cultural obsession with straight, proper hair. shockingly, the country has only just begun to wake up to hair diversity.

can you talk about things in a mutually respectful way? can you communicate and collaborate without shutting down, attacking, blaming or getting defensive if you don't immediately get your way? or can you notice such reactions and then take a breath, step back, soothe yourself and continue the conversation? can you arrive at some solution that feels okay to both of you? facing and working through differences and conflicts creates an important foundation for your relationship going forward. if you can't deal with conflicts at some point during dating, then how can you expect to deal with inevitable conflicts that arise in even the best relationships after marriage? ― john amodeo, marriage and family therapist and author of dancing with fire: a mindful way to loving relationships
8. he cannot read my mind.
his full monologue is on youtube. but on social media, critics weren't exactly feeling the love for carlson's latest claims:
thomas erdbrink, a dutch citizen who is the new york times tehran bureau chief, is one of the individuals who dhs could decide to exempt from the new law since he traveled to iran as a journalist -- but for now, he needs a visa to visit to the u.s.
mendoza is one of mallmann's places in the world and siete fuegos at the vines resort & spa location is his latest venture. it involves lots of rustic, delicious food (and lots of meat, of course) cooked slowly over crackling, open fires right nearby. this is the maillard technique in its full glory.
covid-19 travel restrictions and changing public health guidelines make it tricky to plan much of anything for the future. the good news is that many airlines are offering flexible cancellation and rebooking policies at this time. planning your next trip together — and being able to count down until the next time you'll (hopefully!) be able to see each other — should make the distance easier to bear.
let's dig more into the plot. it certainly lacked the freshness of the original — and at 32, i may want to relive first love, but i certainly don't want to relive college acceptance season. (not the movie's fault, though it's true.) mostly, it just didn't feel strongly plotted to me. the movie starts with lara jean and her sisters exploring their mother's culture in a spring break trip to south korea, and weaves together threads about prom, her father's wedding to cool neighbor trina, and lara jean's rejection from stanford, where peter has been recruited to play lacrosse. ultimately, the great obstacle of the movie becomes her curiosity about going to school in new york rather than trying to stay close to peter. it felt a bit disjointed to me, and the urgency of the two characters getting together was gone. i've written before that i don't really believe in rom-com sequels, and i definitely felt that here. what did you think about how the narrative hung together?

millennials and gen z have been roundly criticized for not taking the threat of coronavirus seriously (and rightfully so; look at all the young people who've been busted for house parties). but as walley's and jordan's stories illustrate, baby boomer parents and relatives are just as likely to dismiss the need to social distant. that's especially worrisome because covid-19 is most dangerous for older adults or those with serious health conditions. (an older adult is broadly defined as anyone over the age of 60).

i've been following the reporting, the commentary, the vice president's public diatribe in response to the backlash against his wife and the school and, given my own experience, i can't say i'm sympathetic to his claims of persecution. let's be clear, nobody is arguing that private, religious schools can't exist or can't legally discriminate. it's a clear first amendment right. and what i was hearing was merely criticism, or in most cases matter-of-fact reporting, of the school's policies.

records for these five nations constitute 35-50 percent of all native american records and 80 percent of all native american records filmed by the national archives. this is because in the late 19th century, the u.s. government established the dawes commission to oversee land redistribution within the five civilized tribes. to do this, the commission attempted to create an official list of members of each nation, and required families and individuals to fill out applications for acceptance, in essence making them prove that they belonged to that particular tribe.

amanda stemen, a licensed therapist and owner of fundamental growth, a therapy, coaching, and consulting business in los angeles, stressed that it's ok to feel the poor moods that come with the conditions. in fact, not allowing yourself to process negative emotions can often do more harm than good, she said.
for the overwhelming majority of women, it's a very specialized thing, streicher said. it doesn't exist.

similarly, 61-year-old debbie brilliant, a program instructor at an atria senior living home, said she feels amazing and hopeful after her first dose of the pfizer vaccine. as a caretaker who has visited atria's residents throughout the pandemic, brilliant was able to participate in her company's vaccine dispersal, which was like a celebration. brilliant and the seniors for whom she works were greeted with balloons, lively music and snacks that she said felt right for the occasion.
a september 2015 article in the atlantic magazine titled the nfl's continuing concussion nightmare reported that boston university studied the brains of 91 former national football league players. the result? 87 of them, or 96%, had signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (cte) - a degenerative disease believed to stem from repetitive brain injury. even considering that those who chose to donate their brains for such research would logically have a greater likelihood of cte, the numbers are still staggering.
1. you think their behavior is risky, but they may not see it that way.
i think sleeping apart allows us to decide when we want to cuddle ― we just get into the other's bed, she said. sleeping in separate beds has increased and improved our sex lives.
gary's hollywood debut didn't end there. still on stage, kimmel asked him if he's ever touched an oscar and led them over to actor mahershala ali, who had just won for best supporting actor.
when death knocked on the door of the man who slept by my side every night for fifteen years, it didn't come as a quiet and long knock. instead, it came as a loud and abrupt jolt that beat down our door and left me standing on the other side of the threshold exposed to the elements and the vast, cold abyss.
however, there is a lot of pushback from insurance companies about actually paying clinicians for the '60-minute' code. many companies require preauthorizations and have very strict criteria of when and for whom the 60-minute therapy hour is appropriate. if the insurance provider decides that the criteria were not met, they will not pay the clinician.
all of the girls topped their looks with perfectly paired face masks.
at first, i thought it was something in me that needed shifting. so i committed to my health. i ate well and exercised. i cut back on drinking. i got yoga-certified and attacked my sleep issues from all angles. i was working my dream job of being a freelance writer, and with one child in school and the other in part-time childcare, i finally had the time to commit to it. i was finding success in most areas of my life. but i still wasn't happy. i felt pent-up, irritable and borderline depressed. at times, i thought, maybe this is just what married life with two kids is. maybe this is how everyone feels.
in the remaining common-law states, debt taken on by one person during a marriage (i.e., their name is on the account) remains their sole responsibility once divorced. however, even in other states, certain debts can be considered marital debt, and that would have to be reconciled during a divorce, tayne said. for instance, debt related to a rent or mortgage, utilities or child care may be considered marital debt.
financial withholding is on the same plane as emotional withholding. i would imagine that even further back than your ex, you experienced emotional withholding from a parent, which made this dynamic with two consecutive financially withholding men seem familiar on a deep level. i believe that you are so desperate for this relationship to work out, especially since your kids are involved, that you are ignoring the signs that your boyfriend may not be fully able or willing to merge your lives. first there's the pre-nup, then there's his baggage from his ex, then there's the lack of a joint account, even for big line items like rent. it is possible that your boyfriend is keeping his guard up, and may not trust women because of his marriage. he may subconsciously believe that all women are out to get his money, which some guys believe. on your end, you are enabling his self-centered behavior by continuing to spend money on him and on your home even though he's not reimbursing you. you likely need to explore your tendencies toward codependency.
jill biden's day and night looks
eva was and is a traditionalist so i bought a diamond ring. since she's a light sleeper i slipped it on her finger in the middle of the night. when we woke up, i asked her to marry me, she saw the ring and, well, we got right down to celebrating! —lynn
during her first solo television interview, jill biden also discussed her interest in education, military families, cancer research and healing the country. she also answered questions from members of the show's virtual audience.
you have to listen to the people, what is going on with them. you are now far from the action. they are on the fighting floor, so you have to listen to what is happening down there. that is where the roots of the tree are. watch the roots, not just the leaves. financial statements are important but remember they are the leaves not the roots of your success.

remember that diagon alley set i purchased? it originally cost me $98, and today it's selling on ebay for more than $300. and that's nothing compared to some other sets. in 2000, a statue of liberty lego set went for $199. sixteen years later, its value had skyrocketed to $1,998.87. in 2007, you could have purchased the lego first collector's edition of the star wars millennium falcon for $499.99. that may seem like a steep price for a toy until learning that, as of 2016, it was worth a whopping $3,987.40.
in honor of her birthday, here are 12 quotes about motherhood from lane.
it was extremely hard to know what was going on behind closed doors and then sit in a pew and listen to this man preach about purity, marriage, integrity. ... it made me question a lot, jackson told huffpost.
according to newly filed court documents huffpost obtained, authorities allege a highly intoxicated harp spent the majority of the football game making crude, vulgar comments toward the women.
for the nation's bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the 'preeminent priority,' gomez wrote, quoting a voting guide the bishops' conference put together for american catholics.
the fear, anger, despair and grief from the wounded self can be a bottomless pit. because the inner abandonment is ongoing when there is no loving inner adult, the sense of loss is ongoing. to the wounded self, it feels as if you can never recover from this loss. until you decide to learn to be a loving adult and learn to take care of yourself, the feeling of loss and emptiness may continue.
keep an eye out for signs such as a sense of numbness, continued isolation, negative thinking, and/or an unexplainable change in sleeping and eating habits, harrington said. other less-thought-of signs are irritability, guilt, talking or moving slower, and/or restlessness.
i mean, the best thing i can say is, you know, just make 'em as jew-wise as you can. best safety advice you can give 'em boils down to 'when around blacks, never relax,' jeffreys once said of his conversations with his son. my dad has said, you know, he doesn't believe blacks are a separate race, he believes they're a separate species — and the older i get, the more i realize that, you know, he was closer to the truth than any college professor, he continued.

upon returning to the u.s. to begin grade school, i was relieved of the daily questioning i received in japan, but quickly learned that life in america was all work and no play. for christmas one year, my parents gifted me a hooked on phonics program to ensure that no one would mistakenly enroll their daughter in an english as a second language class. a few months later, my mother asked my father for a piano for her birthday so that i could begin music lessons. when we were able to afford a computer, they brought one home -– a clunky, grey nec -– so that i could learn to type well before my peers.
so if you racked up a credit card balance with the expectation that your partner would help pay half, the reality is that in the eyes of the card issuer, you are legally responsible for 100% of the bill.
spencer absolutely denies the physical abuse. he scoffs at the idea of financial abuse. and he doesn't deny telling his wife to kill herself or threatening to fucking break her nose. ok, what he said was nasty. but kouprianova? well, she is isolated from the community. she's an anti-american analyst. she's a kremlin mouthpiece.
i wasn't surprised. i'd grown up attending such a school. i figured they were a dime-a-dozen.
i have a great family, i have a beautiful mother. i have a stepfather who stepped in and played a huge, huge part in sharing what it is to have a dependable father figure in our life, she said. but it doesn't take away from the fact that we didn't know our dad. and people sometimes just need to hear that they're not alone in that.

we've got piles of rubble that we are searching just to make sure, said opelika fire chief byron prather jr. we don't think we'll find nobody there, but we don't want to leave any stone unturned.
my spouse, on the other hand, is a very light sleeper and struggles with insomnia. it's a lethal combination! she joked.
some have joked that this forced confinement will result in a baby boom in nine months. most of the media focus has been on those affected medically or financially by this crisis. but the pandemic's upheaval is also exacerbating the pain of those living in homes where they have been mentally, emotionally and/or physically abused. and this often overlooked group needs help, too.
breaking the waves, the breathtaking new opera by composer, missy mazzoli, and librettist, royce vavrek, had its new york premier on january 6, 2017 at nyu's skirball center. it had premiered in philadelphia in september 2016 at opera philadelphia, which had co-commissioned the work with beth morrison projects. based on the lars von trier movie of the same name, the story is set in an insular (literally) community on the isle of skye off the west coast of scotland. a young woman, bess, a member of the tight-knit religious community, marries an outsider, jan, to the great consternation of her congregation. he works on an offshore oil rig (for us literalists, there are no oil rigs off of skye - they are all in the north sea on the other side of scotland). bess prays for his early return. he is injured and paralyzed and, from his hospital bed, asks bess to have sex with other men and to recount her liaisons to him. the reasons for this request are murky (to keep their marriage and his hopes alive?) but her assent seemingly isn't: she feels guilty for praying for his early return, feels she may have caused his accident, wants to do the right thing by her husband and believes she will thereby cure him. that said, bess does like sex, as we saw when she asked jan to consummate their marriage in a loo at their wedding reception - envisioning it to be a romantic setting when it was anything but.
i began to understand the emotional isolation she endured — even while we were together — because she constantly felt as though she didn't fit into the world. she talked about gender dysphoria, her emotional dysfunction and how not being able to live the life she was so desperate ― and meant ― to live led to deep mental health struggles and emergencies. we talked about her suicide attempts and how surviving them merely set her on autopilot throughout not only the remainder of our relationship, but for a great part of her other subsequent relationships and eventual marriage.
and when i make a mistake, she's just plain ugly: nice one. it's a miracle the club lets you keep your membership. even when i play well she's cruelly sarcastic: oh, wow. look at you playing tennis.
laura lynne jackson is wife, mom and former high school english teacher from long island, new york, who has a supernatural skill set: she is both a psychic and a medium.
it's not like our daughters aren't trying to make their own way, it's just that most jobs for young people leaving post-secondary school, are unpaid internships. i'm not kidding you when i tell you, it is a bit bleak as a parent to visualize the day when our girls will be wholly, financially independent of us.
fighting a war on drugs by focusing exclusively on supply is an inherently flawed concept. today, in the debate over a wall along our southern border, we hear nothing about a real threat to our national security ― the humanitarian crisis that exists on our street corners, in our classrooms, boardrooms and, for many of us, right in our homes. where are the billions of dollars for this crisis, a true national emergency that is claiming over 72,000 lives via drug overdose per year, destroying families, and leaving too many children without their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters?
practical obstacles to adapting romance also pop up. a novel stuffed with sex scenes and building toward a tidy happy ending may be tricky to adapt for network tv, which needs to keep things a bit cleaner — and keep the narrative drama going indefinitely.
cue the pitt-aniston reunion campaign on social media:
raised by a mother who largely stayed at home and a husband who liked it that way, my husband knew little about home labor when we were first married, and even less about cooking. i still tease him about the mess he made out of an attempt to prepare lipton noodles before we were married, on a night when my maid of honor and i sat, camped in our living room, piecing together centerpieces for our wedding.

for lynn, information about the vaccine had been spotty, but after setting up multiple google alerts and all but living online, she learned that publix grocery stores were going to be offering the vaccine in three florida counties — all of which were more than a three-hour drive from her naples home.
have you ever played an important role in someone else's wedding? if you have, you may have found it to be a lot of work. maybe you like that kind of thing. that's totally fine. but, from my experience, other peoples' weddings cost a lot of money and time.
i had to call my parents last night and tell them i think they should stay home for a while, he said. while still young for parents of a guy my age, they are at greater risk. it went as predicted: my mom, who tends to be anxious about some things and the one who taught me the importance of following rules, said, 'well, ok, if you say so.'
when you are showing up for yourself as a loving adult in the face of loss, you will not feel abandoned, and therefore you will not feel the fear and anger that comes from inner abandonment. anger at the departed person is actually a projection of one's own inner abandonment, and the fear is also a result of this inner abandonment. when you are taking care of yourself as a loving adult, there is no inner abandonment. when you operated in the relationship as a loving adult, openly sharing your love, you have no regrets and no despair that comes from not having loved.

the longer you go without sex, the more you feel you aren't interested in sex. it works the other way around as well. sex is the best aphrodisiac. the more sex you have, the more sex you want. having sex can jump-start your engine, allowing your body to begin reproducing more sexual hormones that can remind you that you like sex, enjoy making love, and want to do it more often.
all marriages end, one way or another. instead of saying, 'i can't marry you until we have a prenup,' try framing it this way: 'at the end of our marriage, whether it ends in death, as we anticipate, or divorce, what would be important to you and how would you like to be treated?'
with the konmari method, it's not about dedicating a weekend every month to sorting through all the clutter and then slowly letting it accumulate again. it's about finding a home for each item and creating a system that you're actually able to maintain. the initial task may be daunting, especially if you have a lot of stuff, but the payoff can be big.

one of her several journal entries, kalapura recounted, was about how a person should embrace this life of abstinence only once older and fully aware of what that implied.
if i'm not careful, i can end up feeling not just alone, but resentful as hell. but one thing that helps lance my boil of single parent bitterness is seeing people in the public eye going through the same things i am.
once again, i was treated as a minor celebrity, as fans brought me candy and trashy magazines for reading their palms. as we waited two hours to board the plane, i became the de facto entertainment.
that frustration only heightened the next day when a series of miscommunications delayed the operation. standing outside, looking back and forth down our street as if that would make the truck appear, i was struck by my me! me! me! attitude. somehow, i was 2 years old again.

this is a funny joke, too: back in may of 2018, to save money the trump administration disbanded the u.s. pandemic response team, he said. although to be fair who could've ever seen something like that coming in handy?
not everyone who is transgender transitions medically. some trans people may not undergo any kind of physically transition and may not move from one end of the gender binary to the other. everyone is different, but for tracy, these are decisions and steps that have made her feel the best about who she is ― who she truly is ― and i support her. she is fully aware that i wrote this essay, saw it before it was published and is as hopeful as i am that sharing our stories might make a difference.
perhaps this means validating and offering a positive reframe, or listening to your partner with an open mind while taking deep breaths, gupta said.

baltimore county circuit judge robert e. cahill jr. sentenced giovanelli to 90 days at the county detention center and five years of probation for a fourth-degree sex offense and second-degree assault. as part of a plea deal reached in december, prosecutors dropped an original felony charge of sexual abuse of a minor and agreed giovanelli won't have to register as a sex offender, according to the baltimore sun.
the senator stands out as the highest-profile candidate from the industrial midwest in the expected 2020 democratic field. while president barack obama twice won the states of pennsylvania, michigan, ohio, wisconsin and iowa in his elections, trump swept the region in 2016. for democrats focused on appealing to the white working-class voters key to winning the upper midwest, brown had a track record of success.

i didn't have health care for 50 years, robertson said.
i happened to marry someone who is my opposite in many ways, so it makes for a lot of humorous situations, she told huffpost. sometimes when these events play out, they aren't funny in the moment — but i know that they might make a good cartoon later.

with out of sight, lopez made the covers of entertainment weekly and details. in the magazine movieline, she lambasted winona ryder, gwyneth paltrow, cameron diaz, madonna and claire danes for their acting skills. after a decade of surging fame, lopez was everywhere. she signed a record deal with sony and began a highly publicized relationship with hip-hop mogul sean puff daddy combs, two moves that made her one of the globe's most watched celebrities. but once an actor becomes a tabloid fixation, the calculus of her career shifts.

with gov. ralph northam's career in extreme peril over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook, herring issued a statement saying he wore brown makeup and a wig in 1980 to look like a rapper during a party as a 19-year-old at the university of virginia.
the next day, i pulled the camry that had been my home onto her private dirt road. on a hill sat a sprawling ranch house with an expansive deck holding rocking chairs and swings. as i drove further up the driveway, i noticed a massive crystal chandelier hanging from the oak tree in the front yard. where the dirt road wound left, there was a side house and garage. i pulled my car in front of a parking meter and a green-and-white road sign that said dildo. it was quirky to say the least and i loved it.
similarly, hannah ann sluss and madison prewett, the final two women vying for weber's hand, were strong contenders from the start: sluss received the coveted first impression rose, and prewett got the first one-on-one date with weber — victories that have historically boded well for contestants. weber's subsequent interactions with sluss and prewett made his attraction to both contestants clear.
we were supposed to get married at villa del balbianello in lake como, italy, in september 2020 with all our family members and close friends. we eloped at the same place on the same date, but because of the pandemic, we decided to invite our parents only. i felt sad and sorry about my family in japan, who were looking forward to coming to the event but couldn't because of travel restrictions.
but whenever i wanted to tell the truth about my family, i felt i was betraying the sacred rule passed down from our mom: accept but don't talk about it. although we scattered her ashes in 2009, speaking about this part of our past still felt disloyal. the last thing i wanted was to reopen old wounds. but wasn't this my story, too? didn't i have the right to speak about it?
she criticized google, apple and amazon for using their platforms as a tool to snuff out competition and compared the tech giants to too big to fail financial institutions at an event at the new america foundation, the google-funded think tank whose then-chairman was ex-google ceo eric schmidt. the speech launched a row where google complained to the think tank about the speech and eventually led to the expulsion of antitrust scholars there who would go on to found the open markets institute.

the search took its toll around beauregard, an unincorporated area of roughly 10,000 people near the georgia line. church chaplain ike mathews walked down a road lined with broken trees and debris as he went to check on members of his congregation and emergency workers.
while we are growing something sustainable and clever at our kitchen table, there are seeds of confidence being watered in her soul. because, if at any time she feels as if the life she's structured isn't as blazing and brilliant as she wants, she'll have seen her mum completely morph a situation with sheer determination. she will have watched me emancipate myself from an unbalanced career to unfolding into a creative businesswoman.
just before i climbed back into the car, after dropping bags of groceries at my parents' door and firmly declining an offer to come inside for a cup of tea, my mom stepped outside to wave goodbye to me. my dad stayed behind the door watching us through its window. i grabbed my phone and asked her to pose for a snapshot to send my sister an update about our successful social distancing in the face of covid-19.
given the unique personal and emotional natures of therapy, many people would find an hour or more to be overwhelming to their nervous system and moving on with their day after that, added denver-based licensed psychotherapist brittany bouffard. it allows the client to visit important processes, feel feelings, derive their insights and get the sense that there will be a reprieve from the intensity so that they can then go back to work or to their family.
the solution: make sure you both know what you're signing up for at the outset and how you're going to handle it. preplanning is an important part of doing things, silverman says. if you were building a house, you wouldn't want to just start building the house, you'd want to preplan it. you'd want to get all the dimensions and the drawings first before you start laying down the bricks and the concrete. otherwise, the house is not going to stand up straight. that's the same thing in raising a family. you have to kind of set your goals and your priorities before you get into the thick of it. it just makes it easier.

i wrote this book initially without a structure in mind, because for a long time i really considered each poem individually, without thinking of one as an extension of another. each poem draws on a single event, experience or emotion i have had as a pilot's spouse. it was only after the naval institute press wanted to publish the collection that i realized there was an obvious story arc there that i hadn't drawn out. a lot is said out there in movies and literature about the difficulty of returning to civilian life after war, and the stress it can put on a marriage. a story that is less often told (and one i know to be common among military families) is how sometimes the anticipation of war and separation can be just as traumatic. quite often, the greatest struggles happen before the deployment even begins.
a federal judge overturned the state's gay-marriage ban, and cited herring's opposition to the ban as a compelling factor in her decision. virginia court clerks began issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in october 2014, nearly a full year before the u.s. supreme court issued its ruling allowing gay marriage nationwide.

ultimately, even though being level-headed, understanding and patient isn't the sexiest thing on tv, it is exactly what helped us become the only perfect match to survive whatever the world has thrown at us. it's also provided a strong-as-hell foundation for us to build our amazing family on. ethan and i believe that if we can stay together under the scrutiny of a very public relationship, there's nothing we can't do together.

a particular talent mcdonagh has is lodging in his plots implications of what's to come so that spectators sense the untenable pickles in which his characters will find themselves immersed. he's diabolical at the kinds of things that have ticket buyers silently screaming don't go that, don't go there at the endangered figures. the skill is a good part of his torturing fun.

the funny thing about finding love on reality tv is that you're getting to know people for who they are without any of the distractions that can come from prejudging them based on their social media reputation or their friends or sizing them up based on what kind of car they drive or job they have. living in the are you the one? house meant you could escape some of the superficial things that can play a big factor in making or breaking attraction in the real world.

the most popular appropriation of a globalised culture is the hiring of professionals to oversee the wedding preparations. in indian weddings, the uncles, aunts, and cousins usually perform organisational tasks, often at the directions of the family priest (pandit for hindus). however, the elites have set the trend of hiring a wedding planner who has most conspicuously displaced the pandit, and taken on the roles of the extended kin who have little more duties than to look their very best.
and so, like so many other queer people that summer, we rushed to get married. we certainly weren't the only ones who lacked the excitement that the media romanticized. this wasn't about finally getting to declare my love for someone, i had already done that. this was about legally binding our already combined lives. annoyingly, the state didn't see it that way.

you know one partner is an enabler because that person answers questions for the other and defends behavior. when i ask something like, 'do you drink every night?' and a partner rushes to answer, 'she drinks as much as anyone else,' then it makes me feel that maybe this person makes excuses for their spouse's behavior in other realms as well. this often gives rise to a parent-child dynamic where one partner acts in a caretaker role for the other, to a less than functional degree. ― samantha rodman, a psychologist in takoma park, maryland

abigail is immediately described as an asset to dyer, which waterston found interesting considering the negative connotations of that word when compounded with marriage. but the chance to play around with the space in each scene and the mystery of the relational dynamics excited her. it's an ensemble piece that provides specificity for each character, allowing nuance to seep into every frame.
back in the day, getting married meant that once some mules, hay and gold changed hands, you left your family for the first time and were off to start a whole new life. today, most modern american couples live in sin long before they make it official. this left us wondering: how much does getting married these days really change a relationship? here, seven legally wed folks — from two months in to six years deep — share their experiences.

i love what you said about the gothic feel. i do think the aesthetic harnessed a very contemporary, brooklyn hipster vibe while also channeling a sort of timelessness. which fits, obviously. the show is gorgeous. nadia's hair is a perfect example of how small, stylistic details felt very otherworldly yet contextually appropriate, depending on your perspective. same with the vaginal geode on the bathroom door of greta lee's apartment, which nadia briefly believes to be an incredibly dense gravitational field that's gaining consciousness and deliberately fucking with us, but is, in fact, just some great design! as the show gets weirder and weirder, the style follows suit. i loved the detail of the rotting fruits, a clue that time is, in fact, moving forward within the loop land. and the eeriness of seeing the once bustling apartment party empty and illuminated in aquamarine light, as greta dances drunkenly by herself. the fear of an empty party, we can all relate to that!

the one with add has a fantastic brain — extraordinary ideas and concepts that nobody thinking in the normal way would probably see — and what i would say to people with kids like that is that yes, it's incredibly frustrating. you want your children to be best at this and that and to fit into the box, but not every child is supposed to go to college, be good at math, or whatever. i never went to college, but i got to testify at congress… so there ya go. you find your own place. good parenting is helping your child find their strengths versus focusing on what they're not doing as well as someone else.

the u.k. foreign office has been billing women for the cost of their rescue from forced marriages overseas, the times newspaper reported this week. the office's forced marriage unit, which assists with rescues of british nationals duped or coerced into marriages abroad, has been withholding the passports of survivors who can't pay for their own rescue, the report said. a survivor of forced marriage responded to the news in a blog post for huffpost u.k. that sheds light on the way some families manipulate their daughters into marrying strange men thousands of miles from home. it's a fascinating read that does credit the foreign office for investigating nearly 1,200 forced marriage cases last year. but it also makes clear how the policy uncovered by the times puts vulnerable women in an even more vulnerable position. these are not victims who had a choice, they didn't go to their local travel agent and book two weeks in the sun, overspending their resources on a jolly and expecting the good old british taxpayer to foot the bill, jasvinder sanghera writes. they are victims of crime at the hands of the very people who should have loved and protected them.

it's hard to believe it's been over 10 years since erika girardi unleashed her alter ego, the no-fucks-giving singer and performer erika jayne, to have her way with our collective pop consciousness. since then, she's made the most of her time living among us mere mortals by piling up nine no. 1 hits on the billboard dance chart, playing shows around the world and instructing her fans on the finer points of approaching life with unapologetic self-love ― not to mention how to properly pat the puss.

he was also the subject of a dramatic custody dispute between the two families as a child.
katherine eisold miller, a divorce attorney in new rochelle, new york:
i know one day i'll meet someone who can understand why we've created this living arrangement. marriage can be the pillar of a strong family, but it can also end without breaking the family apart. marriage can end amicably and respectfully, and i know that i will only live this life once and i want to be happy and in a relationship full of love. my first marriage was not that, but i am hopeful my next marriage will be. ending a marriage is not failure. it is a sign of maturity and responsibility, when people are ready for it of course.

old spice took note of this trend and made their promoted post a showdown between their spokesmen, terry crews and isaiah mustafa, each of who represent a different scent. as the two battled each other, call and response style, with wacky gifs in the aesthetic styling of imgur net-art, users voted on what attracted their attention most and a winner was crowned. and, unsurprisingly, the campaign was well received. digiday went through the top comment under the post and found gems like, the beautiful bastards in your marketing department understand me better than any man or i never thought i would find myself saying this, but this is the kind of shameless ad posting i can get behind. brands shine when they bring their audience into the dialogue. ads no longer feel like ads. they feel like an extension of the user experience on a platform.
while we argued often during my formative years, my teenage rebelliousness in action only went as far as choosing, against their wishes, to participate in a school play my junior year of high school and staying out until midnight the summer between high school and college. deep down, i knew that they loved me and only meant well –- after all, the price of success was having a little less fun than everybody else.

what ensued was both somewhat exhilarating — getting to see my regency escapism come to life — and unnerving. my private indulgence, one generally viewed with dismissiveness if not contempt by non-romance readers, had become the target of a full-blown cultural discourse. bridgerton was met with valid and vital critiques, especially over its treatment of consent, but also ones that made me wince: that it was formulaic, predictable, vapid, historically inaccurate, best suited for teens.

austen, who never married and died at 41 in 1817, apparently created not one, but two fake marriage announcements for herself, filling out forms meant to document the publication of banns (a public proclamation of an intended marriage, read out on three successive sundays from a church pulpit). the entries appear in the steventon parish marriage register for 1755–1812.
cheating to me is sharing or doing something intimate that you would only do with your partner. this both includes emotional and physical relationships. i trust my husband; he and i share similar values, discuss what we are each ok with, and genuinely know each other on a deep and personal level. i trust that his moral compass will guide him correctly; if his stomach gets a pit in it, he feels a guilty twinge, or if he thinks his actions and feelings would cause me pain, then that is cheating to me. i know my husband would never physically cheat on me because he would be honest enough to end it first, so this really pertains to the emotional relationships. that can be such a tantalizing experience, connecting with someone else distantly removed from your day to day. it provides a new thrill you haven't felt in a while, all from the comfort of your couch. in my eyes, that is truly cheating. ― todd gibbon-thorne, vlogger at tyler and todd

in another classroom down the hall, a sixth-grade class was playing games on government-issued macbooks. the teacher, a young woman with shiny black hair in a peach-colored power suit, said this semester's mission was to pick a real supreme court case and have the class argue both sides, with three of their peers serving as judges. students have the whole semester to prepare their case, while the judges are tasked with reading up on the issue to ensure a fair and balanced decision. last year's class had the same mission; the case they picked was obergefell v. hodges, the landmark 2015 case in support of marriage equality. we nearly had a riot with that one, the teacher confessed. the kids who were assigned to argue against it were incensed. they didn't understand how anyone could oppose a basic human right.

of course, the feelings attached to getting the vaccine are not just physical; many people report experiences of emotional release and relief.
i also developed an appetite for alone time. i understood that solitude is not sadness just as much as marriage isn't sure-fire satisfaction. being able to withstand just myself for company meant i wasn't desperate for anybody else's. when you're happy on your own, you'll wait for the right people and be selective about who you let infringe on your precious alone time. i'm not anti-men, i'm just pro-me. extended periods of solitude stop us from being commitment-hungry and mentally marrying any old person with a colgate smile.

his dating profile says that he is divorced, but then you find out that he's only separated? bad sign. overall, men like being in relationships. they try to bounce back from a divorce and re-partner quicker than women do. you need to find someone who is looking for the right woman, not the first woman who came along. ― caroline madden, a marriage therapist and the author of how to go from soulmates to roommates in 10 easy steps
five years in the making, the proposed national social registry has thus far been described by the indian press as a routine exercise to update the 2011 socio-economic caste census (secc) to prevent the misuse of pro-poor government schemes by ensuring that benefits and entitlements reach the right people. the fact that the ministry of rural development is responsible for the secc has helped further this impression that the secc update is an innocuous bureaucratic task.

to combat this type of thinking, gold suggested asking yourself what all the possible outcomes are ― including the positive ones. for example, in this situation you could take more control by telling yourself that you have the power to do better next time and use that thought process instead to motivate you to succeed, she said.
fitzgerald doesn't think there's any romance brewing, though. he's more inclined to see the moment as an instance of old friends and lovers simply showing some affection for each other and doing that thing that time tends to do for old lovers: forgive and forget the past.
i always know there is a quality of deadness in a couple who comes for therapy where one partner isn't at all worried about pleasing the other person. in a healthy relationship, we're supposed to be aware of what pleases our partner and, at least part of the time, try to accommodate their desires. it's of course always a question of balance: we don't live to please our partner, but we're not indifferent to our partner's needs, wishes, desires. it goes a long way in a relationship when we know our partner is paying attention to what we need, even if it doesn't always work out. ― begel

they know that to sustain a happy marriage over long term they must (1) act like (not just say) they are best friends with their spouse; (2) show physical affection and passion toward each other; and (3) demonstrate commitment to each other and their relationship. these spouses understand that it takes all three sides of the love triangle to sustain a happy marriage.
then the speaker, an older rocker dude, started to share. my mouth dropped in disbelief as he began telling my exact story. it seemed impossible that i could have so much in common with this man. he said that when he first walked into slaa, he thought everyone there were freaks and losers. he didn't think he belonged there. he even left early at his first meeting, which made me laugh out loud because at that moment i too was thinking of my exit strategy.

i struggle with a combination of procrastination and perfectionism (a common overlap), wherein i put things off until i have the time and space to devote to making them *just right.* while the desire for quality isn't in itself problematic, i begin to get overwhelmed when the to-do list starts getting longer and longer, which often leads to more procrastination. it's an anxiety-provoking cycle! this year i'm committed to reminding myself that no one has higher standards for myself than i do, and that the relief from finishing something in a timely matter is part of being kind to my future self. ― kathleen dahlen devos, a psychotherapist based in san francisco
it usually doesn't 'feel right' to be in an opposite mood of your partner, whom you care for genuinely, said clinical psychologist aarti gupta, founder and director of therapynest in palo alto, california. deeply empathetic people might be especially prone to feel their partner's emotions as if they are their own.

much of the coverage of gabbard's announcement has focused on the number of foreign policy actions she's taken that have confounded or enraged members of her own party. she secretly met with syrian dictator bashar assad, courted india's right-wing prime minister narendra modi, voted with the gop to make it harder for syrian and iraqi refugees to come to the u.s., and met with president-elect donald trump shortly after the 2016 election amid rumors she was being considered for a job in his administration, which she denied. the news of her presidential run also brought renewed scrutiny to gabbard's early-career opposition to lgbtq equality, a position she now says she regrets.
so this year on valentine's day go ahead and display a grand romantic gesture, as it will create a happy memory and en you some relationship points. go ahead and profess that your spouse is your best friend, your lover, and your soul mate all wrapped up in one. but, if you really want your spouse to feel the love, repeat the promises you made on your wedding day.
we are taking this situation extremely seriously. below is an open letter we have shared with all of our customers and partners today, which further outlines our immediate actions to address this incident as well as vistaprint's commitment to using this as an opportunity to shine a light on important lgbtq issues, she wrote in an email.
we've all been stuck inside for an entire year and the concept of moving — even just the possibility — is exciting, said kathryn smerling, a psychotherapist in new york. we all fantasize about what it would be like to spend more time in another location with a hot tub by the ocean. there's an element of good health in fantasy — obviously not every day, but having these healthy fantasies can keep you going sometimes.

many young men envision meeting their soulmate, sharing their life with the person of their dreams, having a family, and living the life that's expected of them - married to a beautiful woman and being a supportive husband and father. yet some men are torn apart inside by the secret they keep that leads to heart-wrenching guilt, shame, and fear of failing everyone they know.

this fantasy stems from men often feeling like they need to convince their partners to have sex. many men share that it is difficult to stay aroused when you know (or suspect) that your partner is not into it. in addition, many men share that when their partner is super turned on, it makes them even more excited, which enhances their sexual satisfaction. it also helps a guy's ego if he feels he is competent in bed. ―kimberly resnick anderson, sex therapist

once you're living together, it's a good idea to have an emergency fund with cash savings equal to three months worth of your joint fixed expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, transportation costs, etc.). calculate what that number is, multiply it by three, and slowly work toward saving that amount together. you can automate a monthly savings amount directly from your joint checking account.
for example, instead of being angry at the shopper who is not wearing a mask while inside the store, write to the corporation or to your local city council members demanding that mask mandates be more strictly enforced, delawalla said. anger is a very motivating emotion — use it to effect the change you want to see.
at first we thought it was simply a mistake, and we had accidentally received someone else's order. but once we saw the images and actually read a bit of the pamphlet, we quickly realized this wasn't a simple or innocent error, the husbands said in an email. both of our initial reactions were ones of shock … utter shock. the wording and imagery was aggressive, threatening, and deeply personally offensive.

granted, it's a common, and a completely acceptable, rationale human emotion to want to lash out, be angry, and desire the betrayer, pay, pay, pay for the lies they've laden into a 23-year marriage, that never really was the storybook version of the storybook marriage they thought they were living. however, by changing perspectives a little and dramatic shifts of thought, one begins to see the beauty of diversity, if one chooses to do so.

it occurs to me that perhaps stieglitz is not my life, but a detour from it.
i was shocked by her lack of understanding of the subtle nuances of male dominance that force wives into doing more of the accommodating. i could not understand why in her mind, she thought that asking for a more shared caregiving in my family i would end up being alone. and why after thirty years of fitting my work around my family and my husband's work, i did not have the right to claim my time and my turn. her reaction made me feel angry that this trusted professional was trying to guilt-trip me into ignoring what i need. i wondered how another female client, who feels less entitled to her needs and voice than i do, might feel? chances are she will walk away from therapy feeling guilty and ashamed for wanting more.
i don't know how it happened and i don't know why it happened. i could say that we married young and only after dating six months we moved in together and married a month later. i could also say that being two complete opposites was the root cause ― different taste in music, food, vacation spots. i could also say that he is a total introvert and i am a total extrovert. or that we are from two very different cultures. but i really don't know what happened. all i know is that one day i realized that i was not in love with this man anymore and didn't want to be in a loveless marriage.

she hasn't decided what to do with her husband's ashes. she looks forward to having a proper memorial when she can. she's found talks with friends and family therapeutic, as well as writing about her husband. in his obituary, she listed his many interests, including buying, repairing and selling vintage clocks; reading books in french and listening to a french-speaking windsor, ontario, radio station; sailing; and practicing his repertoire of more than 60 songs on his classical, finger-style guitar three to four hours a day.
watch out if your date sends you mixed messages about their financial stability. maybe he likes to treat you to dinners or gifts, but then his electricity gets shut off. or she's constantly waiting for that one financial break that will get her 'all caught up' on her bad financial decisions. how does this play out once you have a family? how will you feel shouldering the financial burden of a marriage, especially if you decide to have kids? one of my clients was constantly having to manipulate the family finances to cover for her ex-husband's overspending. the result was her trying to enforce limits on his spending, resentment building between them and a messy divorce over debt. ― richardson

a romance isn't meant to be restrained and biting like austen, or a gritty work of art like mad men, or even a constant churn of drama like gossip girl. it's a show about the slow build, and the explosion of passion. the sex is a payoff! they fall in love, and there's a payoff! they're happy at the end! maclean said, quoting a male friend of hers who discovered romance ― and the purpose of all those erotic scenes — through bridgerton.

originally, our wedding was supposed to be on sept. 26, 2020, in middletown, connecticut. we planned on having around 150 guests. we knew our large wedding was not happening in 2020, so the decision was whether to postpone getting married altogether until we could have our big wedding sometime in the future or to get married now and celebrate with our friends and families later whenever it becomes safe to do so. we weighed postponing our wedding to september 2021, but feared that we would postpone once, only to have to cancel or postpone again in 2021, given the unknowns about the virus and potential vaccines.

the definition of female sexual dysfunction is slippery because it depends on an individual woman's own perspective on her symptoms. for instance, female sexual dysfunction is an umbrella term that covers symptoms like pain during sex, low libido, and difficulty with arousal or orgasm. but if a woman experiences these things and is not distressed about them, or if she is satisfied with the quality of her sex life, then she doesn't have female sexual dysfunction. women can also experience seasons of female sexual dysfunction that come and go, depending on other factors in her life like postpartum recovery, serious illness or the beginning of menopause.

below, they share eight signs your date is more likely to be your future ex-husband than a lasting love connection.
you've learned to communicate honestly about key issues in your relationship. sweeping things under the rug usually doesn't reap good results. in your second marriage, you make sure to be forthcoming about your concerns and express thoughts, feelings, and wishes in a respectful way. challenging your beliefs and self-defeating thoughts help you to let go of hurt feelings. when we listen to our partner's side of the story and process it briefly with them, we no longer need to hold onto hurt feelings.
after i proposed to my fiancée, she did a second 'proposal' of sorts while we were on holiday. she said she wanted me to have a ring to show off too, and i see my ring as a sign of being equal with my fiancée shaaba. i haven't 'claimed' her with the ring. we both wear one to show our commitment to each other.

she's wonderful. completely different book. hers is very much a grief memoir, a travel log, a food thing and everything. she married a guy who was italian who died, and they went back to italy so her daughter could get to know his family and so she could reconnect where they met.
church members joey pierson and luke larsen held hands as they chanted and sang along friday at the rally. the young couple that identify as gay are still in high school, but came out to support fellow gay latter-day saints who attend byu.
the way you can address it is to capitalize on time when the baby is asleep to connect with each other ― and of course, to use babysitters. a lot of babysitters, anderson said. turn off the tv and actually do some connecting – the same goes when you get a babysitter: get out of the house and enjoy some baby-free time.
johansson, nominated for best actress and best supporting actress, appeared on the red carpet for the 92nd academy awards wearing a silver oscar de la renta gown alongside fiancé colin jost. while striking for its metallic shine, perhaps the most noticeable part of the marriage story star's look was the massive back tattoo she showed off in the backless gown.

it's particularly interesting that the show chose to give out chick-fil-a, as the fast-food chain has long been embroiled in controversy. for a refresher, in 2012, chick-fil-a executive dan cathy ― now the chain's president ― proudly announced his opposition to same-sex marriage, saying: we are inviting god's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, 'we know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,' and i pray god's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to define what marriage is about.

while my partner and i are now both out as transgender ― my partner is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns and i am a trans man ― at the time of our first wedding we weren't even the slightest bit out. we read to the world as a lesbian couple, and we both wore lace dresses to tie the knot. i even borrowed my mother's veil. it was a beautiful day, and we made our promises and then danced the night away with our loved ones. it was everything i could have hoped for, except, you know, the legal privileges afforded to married people.

charities are not supposed to be taking sides in partisan political activities, such as providing legal services to benefit a politician in an impeachment trial, borochoff said. regulators should investigate whether or not charitable resources, such as office, labor, equipment, etc., are being wrongly utilized to benefit sekulow's for-profit law firm.

when i opened door of the side house, my eyes were immediately drawn to a picture of a japanese woman with long wavy hair and a very wide face that was hung above a set of black-and-red drawer chests. to the left was a huge flat screen tv. you could say that the room had a bit of an asian motif, as the rest of the wall space was decorated with asian movie posters of the carrie in her blockbuster star wars role.
journal to measure your growth. scott, the writer from austin, said one of the things he's struggling with most is not having any way to gauge the progress he's made in moving on from his ex. usually, going out and being around old friends helps him measure his recovery, he said. at least then, you can ask yourself: are you feeling depressed around other people, or are you noticing yourself starting to smile again? am i wholly uninterested in the women in the room, or does the one over there look interesting? do i feel good about myself? he said. without being around other people, i can't tell. there are no measuring sticks for my recovery. gilbert understands that angst. but there's not a total absence of ways to measure your growth post-split, the therapist said. one way to do that during this pandemic is to keep a gratitude journal: each day, write down 5-10 things you're grateful for (a hot shower, food in the refrigerator) and reflect on those things, she said. after a while, if you do this practice consistently, you'll notice that you're able to more easily shift your focus from what you don't have to the positive things you do have. gilbert also stressed that healing from a breakup doesn't necessarily mean that you don't feel pain. healing, she said, means that you learn to stop reacting unskillfully to your problem narrative ― 'i'll be alone forever!' ― and start focusing on positive thoughts.

4- we can wake up feeling even worse, causing us to repeat it and drag it out through the day
gavin rossdale discussed his much-publicized divorce from gwen stefani in a recent interview, saying it was the opposite of what he wanted and that divorce is one of the hardest, most painful things to go through. he also lamented the loss of her unconditional love for him. these sentiments may come as a surprise to people given that gavin had a three-year affair with the family's nanny, which is what led to their divorce. it raises the question, why would someone have these regrets so long after the indiscretions that tore his marriage apart? perhaps it's the age-old saying that you don't know what you have until it's gone. the truth is, many times people may not value their partner until they are separated and can finally recognize all the love they had, which is now lost.

it's almost universally acknowledged that even in 2021, tired gender expectations about housework die hard. a gallup study from last year, before the pandemic hit, showed that even among egalitarian-minded millennial couples, it's gender ― rather than, say, the earning power of individuals ― that shapes the division of household labor.
fitzgerald said her group would consider legal challenges and ask the general assembly to intervene. republicans lack veto-proof majorities and have limited options to cancel local ordinances. the offices of house speaker tim moore and senate leader phil berger did not immediately respond tuesday to email requests for comment on the approved ordinance. the north carolina general assembly convenes its two-year session wednesday.

this past year has been a roller coaster, said rachel thomasian, a licensed marriage and family therapist and owner of playa vista counseling in los angeles. there have been times where i felt like i was handling it fine and other times that i was feeling burnout, hopelessness and anxiety at rates i've never experienced before. one of the hardest parts of being a therapist during this time has been trying to help all my clients cope with the same crisis i am living through myself.

dystopia is powerful not only for predicting the future, but also for putting the problems with the present in a fresh context, allowing readers to see stripped-down versions of societal wrongs. that's exactly what yoss does with his pithy critiques of cuba, so searing that he wrote them under a pen name. in a planet for rent, aliens take over a planet and revamp it as a tourist spot.

there's a difference between secrecy and privacy. i think if i am hiding any kind of relationship from my spouse, it would be a slippery slope toward cheating. why hide? if i am feeling nervous that he might find out something i'd rather not tell him, then it's probably cheating. or at least micro-cheating, which is most likely going to lead to an affair. texting, sexting, emailing, lunches, dinners, whatever. but personally, i find i can barely find time for my own spouse, and i struggle to think how i might find the time for a lover. if i did want to cheat, i'd probably end up telling my husband; it's so hard for me to keep a secret. i'm not that good at it. ― tammy nelson, a new haven, connecticut-based sex therapist, sexologist and the author of getting the sex you want

i wouldn't change anything about our situation. my mom was my best friend growing up and is to this day; my dad got remarried and he and i gained an amazing family who we can't picture our world without. the divorce didn't give me a terrible life. what it did give me was invaluable insight ― especially when it comes to relationships.

ultimately, therapists assess clients and determine meeting times on a case-by-case basis.
but this, as bady wrote in an essay on the queen's gambit, is not really the netflix way. netflix is tv that you binge or chill or fall asleep to, tv for relaxing, he wrote. [t]he immaculately rich interiors and production detail of 'the queen's gambit' make it less a period piece than a kind of fantasy of what the past was like, or could have been, the past re-imagined as product.

whether it's a 'hello' text or call to ask, 'how did it go?' the happiest couples reach out. they call to say, 'i'm running late,' or 'we just landed,' or 'do you need me to stop at the store on my way home?' the message: i'm thinking of you. the result: a feeling of being connected, being a key part of each other's lives. ― winifred m. reilly, marriage and family therapist and author of it takes one to tango
if you engage with an ex, that's what they're looking for. it's a marriage (or relationship) argument and you're not married anymore. focus on the relationship you have now. if you are co-parenting, keep the conversations about that and avoid the trap of a 'marriage' argument.
this can help you stay on the tracks of gratitude and appreciation so that you keep your marriage train from derailing. sadly, sometimes this doesn't happen until it's too late, which seems to be the case with gavin and gwen.

my life as a performer in the more traditional sense began at an early age. i started dance class when i was 5 years old, and then i started doing children's theater and musicals soon after that. it was really my dance teachers who deserve a lot of the credit for my taste in music because that's where i first heard the kind of music that was being played in the clubs. i remember being 10 years old and listening to sylvester's do you want to funk while doing stretches in class.

but i kept you home today so that i could hold you.
but the truth is, none of it really mattered. deep down, i knew i wasn't happy in my marriage and probably never would be, regardless of what my husband did. but admitting the truth to myself, let alone to family, was painful. i couldn't imagine being the person who tore our family in half, all for my own comfort. for months, for years, the guilt i knew i would feel if i decided i couldn't be married anymore kept me planted. i was an unhappy mother, but one whose kids had a home with two parents. my kids didn't have to shuffle back and forth or divide holidays between two homes. and even though my husband and i were fighting more than ever, each of us suffering as a result, going our own ways felt impossible.
i worked to be the kind of person who wasn't swayed by feelings. after all, when i was 19 i had fallen in love and swept myself into marriage, which ended in ruin. i wanted to be past falling in love as a concept. i needed to tamp down my feelings and think more. i told my therapist i was trying to be a robot. she didn't approve, but i still tried.
in other words, there's a 100 percent chance that your wife could use your sympathy and support ― even if it just means finishing off a bottle of wine and listening to her rant about her coworkers or the catty clique on the playground.
biden and sanders remained active in debates, but they faced predictable criticisms, and their responses were the same each time. while other candidates lobbed barbed attacks at each other, the senator and the former vice president filled their preset roles, largely without changing the arc of the race. the same was true for sluss and prewett, who sailed through the bulk of the season scot-free, rarely involved in any of the show's typical blowups.
many people are familiar with depression and anxiety on their own, but the challenges of dealing with them at the same time are less understood by those who don't directly live with them. that can lead to a lot of misconceptions.
even though there's humor in the scheme to fool keeley, which also involves 20-year-old val's estranged birth mother (christine baranski) returning to the fold, the movie never exactly roots for it. nor does it villainize anyone involved, instead trusting that the audience is intelligent enough to stay loyal to armand and albert.
through it all, though, the couple says their main concern was their then-18-year-old daughter, chelsea clinton. hillary reveals she commanded bill to tell chelsea about lewinsky before he apologized to the nation about lying under oath and obstructing justice when he denied the relationship months prior. in the series, bill holds back tears while recounting how awful it was to admit his behavior to his daughter. still, both bill and hillary credit chelsea with keeping them together in the days following bill's grand jury testimony, referring to images that show chelsea walking with the couple as they headed out for a post-confession trip to martha's vineyard.
behind the cameras, he wrote an episode of netflix's aj and the queen, starring and co-created by rupaul.
i know how tough it is to deal with an ex, especially when you share kids. but the only thing you can do is be a great parent. and that's it. never speak badly about your ex in front of your children.
let's be clear: oh's monologue on sunday was nothing short of refreshing, underscoring just how historic her stint as the first asian host of the golden globes really was. as she said, things are changing in hollywood; we can now demand more than the same people (historically, white men) tap dancing across the stages of celebrity soirees year after year.

an app i've recommended to clients who are in relatively new relationships and aren't ready to graduate to a joint account system is called honey-fi. it's simple to set up and easy to use. also, it's flexible in terms of giving you full autonomy over how much information you want to share; the rest you can keep private.
brown's decision not to run may clear space in multiple lanes of the 2020 democratic primary: progressives, including sanders and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, will face one fewer candidate pitching themselves as the solution to the county's rampant income inequality. but candidates who are arguing they are best positioned to defeat trump – including vice president joe biden, who is still weighing a run – may find themselves with less competition to win over moderate voters.
contact with loving friends has been absolutely central to me, said london-based psychotherapist noel mcdermott. this has been my bigger purpose during this time, the thing that has made sense of the challenges. i have been taught about what is important.
then, pivot and ask your partner if they'd be open to hearing what would matter most to you in either case.
this past year, my partner, whom i met through mutual friends in 2016, and i found a community in olympia, washington. here, we are among others who were cast out by extreme religion, most of us lgbtqia+ and facing poverty and chronic homelessness. we exist to fight the patriarchy and colonizer-capitalism ― and to embrace our lives and love without the guilt our families and the church foisted on us for so many years. thanks to the help of many friends and strangers from around the world, my blog archives have been restored, and i have some financial support from online patrons of my work.

while the media landscape, and along with it consumer expectation, has transformed, commercially supported media is nowhere near dead. consumers have a desire and a need to be informed about the products and services that are relevant to their lives.
accepting that a relationship is over isn't easy, especially when you're being bombarded with constant reminders of your ex, like text messages, insta stories, snapchats and facebook posts. if you don't want to block the person, consider other options such as muting him on instagram or unfollowing her posts on facebook. out of sight, out of mind.
getting married to the person you love is such an exciting experience. just the thought of having someone else to ride through the storms of life with you; someone to come home to; someone who is committed to you and only you; someone to laugh with or cry with; someone you can lay in bed with and eat cold pizza at 3:00 a.m.; someone who calls you out when you're wrong; someone who will support that crazy dream. all of that! it's like a sleepover with your best friend for the rest of your life.
sixty-four years ago a young girl from topeka brought a case that ended segregation in public schools in america, kansas gov. jeff colyer tweeted monday. linda brown's life reminds us that sometimes the most unlikely people can have an incredible impact and that by serving our community we can truly change the world.
having a single account where paychecks get deposited keeps everyone on the same page about what's going in and what's coming out. if this doesn't feel right, we recommend having a side stash — a little money on the side that's a judgement-free zone your partner can't comment on. your main paycheck should go into the joint checking account, but you pick a number or percentage together (no more than a few hundred dollars) that goes into your side stash. many couples find this to be a helpful tactic to cap fun money, while avoiding arguments.

a lawyer representing vallow and daybell did not immediately respond to a request for comment on thursday. the idaho storage company said in a statement on tuesday that it is cooperating with law enforcement, but didn't elaborate.

looking at excessive clutter can make you feel defeated, said konmari consultant caitlin roberts. you don't know where to begin so you don't begin at all. it feels like the work around the house is never done and never will be.
since #metoo went viral in 2017, it has transformed our culture for the better. the movement, created by activist tarana burke in 2006, has helped survivors and allies push back against rape culture and rally to hold abusers accountable, ousting media moguls, comedy icons, world-renowned chefs and politicians. invoking the legacies of harriet jacobs, rosa parks, recy taylor and anita hill, black women survivors have carved out spaces to raise awareness, disrupt sexual violence in the black community and, most importantly, heal. however, the movement hasn't quite had the same impact in the music industry, specifically in hip-hop and r&b.

these are statements that only winners would make. as devastated and knocked down as this guy is, he has strength and courage, which led him to the one thing i think paves the way to finding inner peace after divorce:
everybody needs to know they can walk into a place of public business and be served, pizer said. nobody needs to worry about having the door slammed in their face just because of who they are, and have to go from place to place wondering where they might be served and where they might be treated like a pariah.
however, in a 2016 interview with the publication ozy, gabbard suggested that her personal beliefs on homosexuality actually haven't changed:
it's really important to be able to have open conversations about sex with our partners and sharing our number could lead to a good discussion about what sex means to us and what we want from sexual intimacy at this point in our lives, she said.
i was in the hospital, again, this time to have my gallbladder removed, when the news broke. we could finally get married… even though we were already married. all of a sudden, people were congratulating us all over again.
on quiet nights, before i drift off to sleep, that familiar feeling hits me. it's one i have to work hard to distract myself from; in the moment, i can't. i'm not lonely or struggling with my daily tasks. i'm not more overwhelmed by my life than i was when i was still in my marriage. certain stresses have even been alleviated. but guilt still plagues me. i think about how i drove my family apart. i picture my husband alone in his home. i wonder if he's ok.
in a written statement included in court documents, one of the victims said:

and because i was a bit afraid that if i did not come, if i did not live with him, i might grow too used to living without him. as indeed he might grow too used to living without me. (i also feared he might meet somebody else and fall in love all over again in that stereotypical way men of a certain age are supposed to. and then i got here and realized -- given the dearth of female company i can pick from for a laugh over a shared bottle of chablis -- that that was probably an empty threat. too late, though, i was already ensconced: mrs r firmly in residence).

there is a healthy voyeurism to it, in the same way we watch reality tv and read people's money, food and sex diaries online, maenpaa said. we get to look at houses staged by others, judge their taste and imagine ourselves either in their lives or the life we would design if we lived in that house.
i said, make sure i don't cuss anybody out. then, i said something about someone that annoyed me, and she snapped at me. i said, no, no, no. i don't get to cuss at people, but i can still talk about them behind their back because they made me feel something. i didn't feel good, so i'm talking about that because it made me sad. that's what i'm doing, so you don't get to judge me on that.
life is a series of choices, and i think modern society has changed so much that we need to redefine and get rid of 'til death torture us apart.
many organization gurus might tell you that junk is junk, and it's not worth holding onto items for sentimental reasons. but kondo doesn't pass any judgment on what show participants decide to keep. in fact, she dedicates an entire step to tidying sentimental items, even breaking the rules in episode 4 by allowing margie to sort through her late husband's belongings ahead of schedule. kondo shows that it's perfectly fine to hold onto these things, but in a way that brings you joy, of course.
for bethany cook, a music therapist and clinical psychologist in chicago, music was an obvious outlet from the very beginning of the pandemic. she used it as a way to connect with others and spread joy as well.
you don't want to be so focused on talking that you fail to consider if it's the right time or not, spear said. you want your partner to feel considered and comfortable when you have big conversations.
now, when amy poehler and maya rudolph took the stage on sunday, i wondered if those women ― two more of michaels' protégés ― could carry a contemporary awards show with minimal criticism. their timing, chemistry and delivery soared in the few minutes they were on camera. that, in part, had to do with their lack of dependency on the prompter, as they used most of their limited screen time to gaze into each other's eyes after a staged proposal. (a proposal that maybe mocked director glenn weiss' emmys engagement?) but wouldn't watching poehler and rudolph perform standup for 60 minutes be 10 times better than watching them read off overly rehearsed lines to a room full of people who are high on moët and their own egos?
sure, some could argue that fox wasn't doing this as a political stunt and that it was simply an effort to make the audience happy. but twitter users found the whole episode comedic in its own right.
taking your time to decide the kind of marriage that would work for you can be a silver lining to divorce because you'll be more likely to go into your second marriage with realistic expectations. and the fact of the matter is that you can create a happy second marriage if you give yourself permission to be vulnerable and take risks.

an entire section in the byu code that was dedicated to homosexual behavior was removed last month. the clause that upset people said, all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings are prohibited. students complained that it was interpreted to be a ban on gay couples holding hands or kissing. those behaviors are allowed for heterosexual couples, though premarital sex is banned.
but men also have an obligation to speak up to their employers about their need for a better work-life balance ― just as working mothers have done since time immemorial.

hey, there's nothing wrong with treating yourself to a heaping portion of mac and cheese, binge-watching friends and throwing back a few glasses of sauvignon blanc post-split. we all crave comfort and a distraction during tough times. but eating, drinking, shopping or dating in excess ― and doing so to avoid dealing with unwanted emotions ― isn't going to solve your problems; it's just putting off getting a handle on them.
i love lucille, having looked now and delved into her, she added. she's an amazing woman. i'm very excited for people to see what aaron found out about her and the way he's interpreted desi and lucy and the way that it's so rich. i didn't know any of this.

in her blog post, golladay said that she began serving at st. marks in 2016 and at st. elmo's in 2017. golladay was appointed to these churches as a licensed local pastor, which means she was technically not ordained in the umc. instead, she was permitted to preach, conduct worship and perform other duties of a pastor at those specific congregations.

everything from how to handle your finances to whether you want children, and what kind of lifestyle you crave -- now is the time to talk it out and get on the same page with your significant other, says janet ong zimmerman, relationship coach and creator of love for successful women. these areas are fundamental, she says, and when both people are on the same page, this increases the probability for a long and happy marriage when couples assume things will work out without having these conversations, life and marriage become more challenging.

if popular fiction books are to be believed, the world as we know it is definitely ending, and soon -- the only question is when, and how.
i spoke of my family's harrowing experience with cancer, when my mother was diagnosed with hodgkin's disease, and how i came to comprehend real, unconditional love by watching my father care for her on a daily basis throughout those difficult years. but most importantly, i told my parents that they no longer needed to worry about me because i had married a man who treated me the way my father treated my mother.
getting kicked out gave me the freedom to question. maybe being gay wasn't a sin. maybe birth control and abortion weren't the same thing. maybe i didn't have to give birth over and over and over again in order to be worthy. maybe there wasn't an invisible being that knew my every thought that would burn my soul if i didn't do all the right things.

the heart goes last by margaret atwood
then one day in 2013, my parents kicked me and my little sister, lydia, out of their house. i was 22 and she was 19 ― plenty old enough to leave the nest, but we had no cars, no savings and nowhere to go. like our older sisters, we were never told exactly why we were kicked out. dad went on and on about how expensive we were, and how we'd have nothing without him. i had loved jesus with all of my heart, dedicated my life to serving him ― and my parents ― and did whatever i could to stay pure of heart for them and my future husband. i knew my protests would be futile as my dad logged into his bank, which was linked directly to our personal bank accounts, and transferred hundreds of dollars into his own account for imaginary debts he claimed we owed him. then he said he would start charging us for rent, effective immediately ― $500 each for the small bedroom we shared in a house full of 16 people.

consumption is a trap of instant gratification and temporary stimulus. the feeling of satisfaction quickly fades and must be replaced with more material objects, bigger, better and more elusive. suddenly your life mirrors that of a hamster on its wheel. you run as fast as you can in the same direction, never getting anywhere new or worth going.

a study out of the university of georgia center for family research found that the number one indicator of a happy marriage is feeling valued and appreciated by your spouse. when someone's efforts to please go unnoticed or are eclipsed by what has not been done, that person might feel taken advantage of and unimportant. one easy step toward happy-proofing your marriage is to take inventory of the good and pay attention to the things your partner does do for you, and to make sure to acknowledge them with a thank you. although they might let you down and disappoint you at times, balance it by keeping in mind all the times they are there for you. also reflect on how treasured you are feeling for the things that you do. if you are feeling shortchanged in being valued, let your partner know that a thank you would go a long way.

managing shared lives is much more difficult than managing life by yourself. through the experience of living together, you get to know your partner and yourself better. you are forced to develop boundaries, intimacy and relationship skills and hopefully you move toward personal growth. ― moshe ratson, marriage and family therapist
i think she saw my face and calmed down, and realized what was going to happen, he said.

i have somehow been blessed with an amazing platform where i can make my voice heard, he said. i wanted to make sure i used that platform to give a voice to people who don't have that same opportunity, and share a very real story of what many people are going through.
lauren: yeah. but i feel like this whole experience has to change you as a whole. you can't be the same person that you were going into this or especially not even a year and a half ago. you just learn so much about yourself because you're trying to partner up with someone and you can't properly do that unless you know what you want and who you are. so the whole process is just life changing and it's amazing.

according to dr. gottman, 85% of relationships [2. dr. gottman makes this claim on page 283 in the seven principles that make marriage work.] go wrong because partners find themselves unworthy. if you believe yourself not to be good enough, you will always anticipate for what is not there in yourself and your partner. and whether you want to see it or not, any person you fall in love with will be lacking desirable qualities. after all, they are human.
when it comes to sorting through your belongings, you might evaluate whether each item is practical, useful or valuable. however, one of the key tenants of kondo's konmari method of tidying is first asking yourself whether an item brings you joy.

more and more indian women are putting off marriage, but societal pressure to find a husband well before age 30 continues. those who don't settle down early on are often made to feel they have become too old to be desirable as a wife. at the same time, women may be encouraged to put educational and career ambitions on hold to first secure a husband — only to feel later that they have passed the optimal time for those pursuits. today, women are learning how to navigate the anxiety created by these expectations.
i never thought my 35th year would find me single. i can see that i'm a misfit in a world of speed dating and swiping right and perusing the dozens of possible matches waiting for you on your phone. but if this season of my life has taught me anything, it is to be true to yourself and value strength of character and steadiness and honesty above all else. i'm grateful for the chance to start all over and do it right. and i don't care how long it takes. the truest pieces of a life well-built always grow slowly.

sexual needs can change over time and it's important to ask every once and a while, 'hey, what have you been craving sexually?' once you find out, learn how to give that to them, she said. if they want something you're not familiar with, let them teach you.
is it weird? sure, if by weird you mean not mainstream. most people meet, get married and then move in, though not always in that order. and if we're being honest, there was a time when not following that exact succession was considered scandalous. we never set out to break any molds or rewrite societal norms, we just chose to create our own life's journey with each other instead of following any particular script.
so i think it's time we redefined what married truly is. we need to redefine marriage. we need to redefine exactly what marriage is. you need to redefine exactly what type of marriage you want or what works for you.

it's easy to love when things are going well. however, it's the thunderstorms and difficulties that arise that show us if the relationship is based on real love or infatuation. ultimately, in every relationship, frustrations happen, storms arise and our unhealed wounds come out of the shadows for healing. it is important to have a 'rough waters' game plan when the inevitable problems, fears, anger or regressions hit. nothing builds trust more than a good storm. that's when you learn what you are made of, how secure the relationship really is, and how committed you both are. when it gets tough, do you fall apart, run away or hold hands and talk it out? ― sheri meyers, marriage and family therapist
another route you can go is to make plans with your friends to go out or stay in together and do something that you would never do with partners. be fun, be decadent, and be spontaneous. enjoy each other's company like you may not have been able to in quite some time. some of the best memories of mine and many others valentines were the happy accidents you have with your friends. i can think of one such valentine's day when, unknowingly, my best friend at the time and myself, both, separately, decided to go for a drive and clear our heads. we passed each other in our cars, flagged each other down, and decided to go to a nearby italian restaurant for cappuccino and cake. completely random, completely spontaneous, and completely one of my favorite valentine's memories i have to this day. embrace your friends, embrace the moment, and focus on each other and the memories you are making.
that's an anxiety we all share, but the breakup forces me to prepare and plan and think about a future i wasn't expecting and didn't want, he said. to come to terms with that and the future the pandemic has foisted on us, it feels impossible. it feels emotionally paralyzing.

women are generally more collaborative and verbal than men, and texts don't do a good enough job of allowing a woman to vent and feel heard while she problem solves, he said. technology is good in a pinch, but it doesn't take the place (yet) of face to face conversation, especially with your spouse!

the jws had taught me that almost everything a person could want was wrong. especially anything sexual. gay sex? wrong. oral sex? wrong. masturbation? wrong. sex outside marriage? wrong. they hadn't seen fit to counsel us on whether modeling bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism was wrong too, but i could figure it out. it'd be wrong. but if it was what i wanted to do (and it was), i realized i could decide for myself how to approach it in a way that i could be proud of.
ethiopia is definitely authentic. but authentic can also mean mud, flies, intermittent water and electricity, long drives on rough roads and troublesome cultural practices such as forced marriage. however, for travelers interested in diverse indigenous peoples and a fascinating history that is also immediate, real, and personal, ethiopia is a must see destination. the comforts and conveniences we tend to take for granted may be in short supply, but the experience will be both exotic and reassuringly familiar, and as authentic as it gets.
as we celebrate love this week on valentine's day, let's remember how the little things can refresh hearts, refuel connections and secure comfort. because all anyone ever wants in life is a soft place to fall surrounded by those who make them feel like they matter.

there are nine community property states: arizona, california, idaho, louisiana, nevada, new mexico, texas, washington and wisconsin. if you are married, and then get divorced, and live in one of those states, all of your assets and debt accrued during your marriage are evenly split between partners, tayne said. that means you'd be equally responsible for your spouse's debts post-divorce.

the new year kicked off in india with a major development in the fight over women's access to a famous hindu temple. protesters have blocked women of menstruating age from entering sabarimala since september, when the supreme court ruled that all women had a right to enter the sacred space. this week, though, two women managed to slip into the temple in the middle of the night, setting off celebrations and protests.

regardless of whether weinstein was behind them or not, many of the awards campaigns for movies of the 1990s and 2000s relied on these transparently sentimental appeals and bombastic phrases to tug at oscar voters' heartstrings. looking back at the quotes from critics' reviews that were emblazoned on for your consideration ads, most of them conveyed wonderment and amazement. for example, in 2008 — another seismic election year — the ads for best picture winner slumdog millionaire boasted that the movie was a buoyant hymn to life and a soaring, crowd-pleasing fantasy.

i might have gone on like this for the rest of my youth, if not for a spectacular fight that ended my family's association with the jw organization. an elder from our congregation told my 16-year-old sister's boyfriend that he should break up with her since armageddon was just around the corner. he did so without hesitation, over the phone. my sister was devastated. my parents were concerned that she was suicidal. it was exactly the opportunity they needed to decide that raising their children in an authoritarian sect was perhaps not the best choice. i was 13 and suddenly we were free.

claudia luiz, the author of the making of a psychoanalyst, puts it bluntly: children really do ruin marriages. not that that's always the case, she notes, but the groundwork for real trouble is there from the moment a baby arrives. the relationship changes from being one where you're going in the same direction with the same goals to being competitive, she says. suddenly you're competing for time. because the baby needs so much, there's so much dependency and you get strung out. per luiz, there's nothing you can really do to prevent those feelings, because you've moved into this new developmental phase. there's grief over what you've lost when you become a parent. you've lost your freedom, your sleep, money. it's very depriving.
these things happen. rationally, i understood that, and i reminded myself of it repeatedly. but i couldn't shake my frustration, not with emily, but with the situation. i was frustrated to have to go to work early so i could then race back home, and i was frustrated to miss my standing lunch date with my mother and uncle. i didn't like having to do something i wasn't supposed to have to do.

i wanted to understand all of it. i wanted to be kind and supportive but i was also struggling with my own confusion, my own doubts, my own worries that i had hurt her or, perhaps selfishly, that she never loved me or that when we had been intimate, those moments were something else to her — an escape? a way to try and affirm the masculinity that had been assumed and demanded of her for her entire life? she listened to everything i had to say and then told me that her love for me had always been true and deep — the shaking in your bones kind of love.

utah's predominant faith, known widely as the mormon church, opposes same-sex marriage and teaches that intimate same-sex relationships are a sin. but it also urges members to be kind and compassionate to lgbtq people. the religion holds tremendous influence in utah, where the majority of state lawmakers and nearly two-thirds of the state's 3.1 million residents are members.
someone once told me that women are expected to work as if they don't have children and raise children as if they don't work. go back and read what you sent me, jim. your wife works outside of the home, cooks and cleans, takes your kids to their extracurricular activities and generally sounds like a great mom ― one who is probably already exhausted and overwhelmed on a good day. then, her best friend dies in one of the most tragic ways possible, and her mom gets sick. of course she's struggling!
going to bed and waking up at the same time can be tricky if the partners have different work hours or if one is a night owl and the other is an early bird. but do your best to make an effort.
since palms can contain so much, reading them can actually be quite tiring. the curve or depth of a line, as well as the placement on the palm, can completely alter the meaning. for instance, if your heart line curves toward your middle finger, it means that you give too much of yourself in relationships without getting enough back. however, if it curves towards the ring finger, it means you are hopeless romantic (but it doesn't connote that your relationships are rough). these are the minute differences you have to keep an eye out for, and after reading about 10 different palms, my vision will tend to blur and these differences can slip past me.

no single project illustrates the return to her jenny from the block ethos better than shades of blue. when creator adi hasak was first developing the tv series in 2013, lopez's longtime producing partner elaine goldsmith-thomas suggested her for the top role, an fbi informant with a troubled past. hasak was sure lopez would say no. but movie vets seeking nonfranchise material had begun drifting to television. a week later, lopez told him she wanted to produce and star in the series, likening it to nypd blue and homicide: life on the street. in a way, she anticipated the rise of the late-2010s female antihero. furthermore, she wanted to pitch it to a broadcast outfit, which would have been expected to enlist julianna margulies or another tv-centric actor, rather than a premium network.

while such issues are hard to plan for or even imagine if you are simply dating, it is would be prudent to get financial and legal advice before approaching major financial and life decisions such as buying a home, creating investments, or planning a future marriage with a dating partner. while it has historically been considered a measure of one's faith in the relationship as to whether or not to approach these discussions, it should be viewed more from the standpoint of planning and preparation. for example, a pre-nuptial agreement may not be right for everyone, but it is at least worth finding out if it could be right for your situation before making a major decision.
representatives from bju press and abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. however, a 2017 huffpost investigation found that about one-third of christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called accelerated christian education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. the number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)

at the beginning of april, we decided to postpone our big wedding celebration to october 2021. things had just begun to get bad in new york and we could see that it would most likely not be safe to have 180 people in the same room for a long time. ultimately, our deciding factor was that molly's entire family lives in the midwest. we were worried that they wouldn't be able to safely travel to new york, and we certainly didn't want to celebrate without them. while we knew that we were making the right decision, that didn't stop us from grieving the big wedding we had planned. it was heartbreaking and devastating and we cried a lot about it, but we don't regret the decision.

in a regular in-person relationship, you can look for signs of increased intimacy, trust, future planning ― even small things like plans for meeting family or going to a weekend cabin getaway, land said. if the relationship looks exactly the same a year later, that might mean there's a level of stagnation, which would be something to work on, particularly in a long-distance relationship.

claire: i have read it! i went through an l.m. montgomery obsession at around that age, and i read everything, even her more adult novels, like the blue castle. for those who aren't familiar, emily byrd starr is about 11 years old when her beloved father dies penniless. her mother has already passed away, so she is sent to live with three of her mother's siblings, who live on a farm called new moon. she's a very sensitive, odd child with a pale face and inky hair. like anne of green gables, she's given to fits of fancy and conversations with fairies, but she's more withdrawn, moody and morose. she's also a closer analog to montgomery, career-wise: while anne gives up writing to raise her family, emily becomes a successful author.

over the past few decades, the usccb's moral vision has narrowed to the point where the bishops treat abortion as though it matters more than any other moral issue, said natalia imperatori-lee, a scholar of catholicism at manhattan college. she pointed out that the usccb did not issue letters calling out former president donald trump for his racism, disregard for the environment or his alleged sexual misconduct and assaults.
well, at least that moment wasn't as awkward as this famous clip from newlyweds:
spencer lived in new york, where he worked for taki's magazine, the far-right magazine founded by greek multi-millionaire panagiotis taki theodoracopulos. spencer wore professor sweaters and they talked about eugene onegin, art and soviet films. his facebook page was filled with pictures of him with ron paul.

6. padma laskhmi: it's the only way of life i've known. i was raised by a single mom. i was told i couldn't have children, so every day i am kissing the sky with happiness about it.
and the truth is that i would be more gentle, more forgiving, with just about anyone else. if another mother came to me and told me of her longstanding unhappiness in her marriage ― the feeling that she already knows what to do but can't find the strength to do it ― i would tell her to get out, that her happiness matters as much a everyone else's. i would never tell someone to stay for their partner, or even for their kids. when one person is deeply unhappy, the whole family suffers. i know all of this, but reminding myself of it is easier said than done.

in that moment, all the years of love, parenting, and life-building are diminished to a rubble of memories. tortured wails of how could you do this to me? by an unsuspecting spouse are just the tip of the betrayal iceberg that sinks the life once known by all concerned.
in the heat of an argument or spirited conversation, you may end up talking over your partner from time to time. but if you're routinely cutting your partner off mid-sentence just to make your point, beware: a regular habit of this will leave your partner feeling unimportant, irrelevant and unloved, said kurt smith, a therapist in roseville, california, who specializes in counseling men.
9. forgive often: mark twain said it best: forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it. forgiving, by its very act, makes you the bigger person. sometimes you forgive even though you know your partner is wrong. you forgive the other not for their sake, but for your own. the inner peace you attain as a result makes it all worthwhile.

as a resident, i learned that it's all in a woman's head, millheiser said. she should go home and drink a glass of wine.
i knew i would shoot it because it's an opportunity, she said. i thought of how different my life would be if, in my teens or 20s, if i had seen this kind of information. but there was a part of me that felt like they were going to shelve it, and part of me wanted them to.

she wrote for the same publications he did — taki magazine and radix journal. she translated aleksandr dugin, the fascist russian philosopher who once called for the genocide of ukrainians. in 2017, she mulled the idea of peaceful parting as an alternative to ethnic cleansing to reach spencer's dream of an ethnostate for people of european descent. she helped spencer with technical work and graphic design. she answered interview questions for spencer through email.
by this point, we're probably all familiar with the idea that social media creates echo chambers. even though we essentially have everyone in the world at our fingertips, we inevitably fall back into our in-groups. huffpost can reveal that ― shock, horror ― the people we rely on to weigh evidence and make decisions on behalf of the american people are not immune to this.
what if, instead of approaching this story as a matter of political intrigue, we treated this story as it should be treated ― as a labor story, a story of a shitty boss and workers who deserve better? wrote journalist libby watson in splinter. in the american workplace, the boss has outsized power and workers have increasingly less. this is far more pressing in low-wage jobs, but it is also true in congress, where staffers are underpaid and overworked and the boss is a member of the ruling elite. it says something important about klobuchar's understanding of labor rights ― and her politics ― if she abuses the power she has over her staff to demand they complete her menial personal errands, or screams at staffers for tiny errors.

cameron: yeah. one thing i learned was that when i'm able to give her her space, she just feels happier. and it's not like it's something that she needs all the time, but i learned that just giving her that space is how she recharges her batteries, so to speak. and of course we, like any married couple, are continually building our relationship. but that was one thing that i had to learn pretty quickly and i'm thankful that i did.

it took leslie gray streeter, a columnist for the palm beach post, almost four decades to find true love. he wasn't what she was expecting ― she is black and baptist, and scott was white and jewish ― but they were made for each other. then, only a few years later, while they were in the process of adopting their son, brooks, scott unexpectedly died of a heart attack at the age of 44.
people die to come to america, she said. i was a passport to him. they all wanted him here, and that was the way to do it.
the key, though, is making this decision as a couple and to make it clear that the decision is for the benefit of your relationship, not a sign of abandonment, she said.
you are smarter about love. since you've learned from the past, you're less likely to repeat it. and you've learned to separate the past from the present and have begun to live in the present. therapy and/or keeping a journal can help you achieve these objectives.

a person can have a 4-hour session but they are not going to reflect and digest everything that was discussed during the session, mayo explained. the client may think it was a good session, but too much information would be covered for them to completely digest it and benefit from it. giving people increments of information and allowing them to process it in sections is good for the best possible outcome for treatment.

according to research from the journal of clinical psychology, approximately 8 percent (yep you read that right) of americans actually make good on their new year's resolutions, which, admittedly, doesn't look so promising. the biggest problem, however, is the goals themselves. instead of thinking big (i.e. we'll do spinning together five times a week), in reality it's best to start small (i.e. we'll do one spinning class a week) and work your way up from there.

most couples struggle with not wanting a certain type of sex, but are willing to engage erotically with a partner in other ways. sex is like food. if we had the same meal repeatedly, we would start to lose our motivation and craving for that food. we need to create variety in our sex lives so that sex can become exciting and rewarding. one of the main reasons couples are sexless is because sex has become routine, boring and predictable. we need excitement, playfulness and mystery to activate our desire.

my parents' divorce makes me work harder to create the type of family i wish i had. as a stepmom to three and a mom to one, every day i strive to provide the kids with a stable, loving environment. i'm not going to lie, being a stepmom and a second wife in a blended family isn't always easy but i think being a child of divorce has made me more dedicated to my marriage and to my family. i know firsthand how it feels to be a child of divorce, and i don't want that for my daughter, and i certainly don't want my stepchildren to have to go through that a second time. ― jamie scrimgeour, blogger and creator of the kick-ass stepmom project

for eight years, the outfield ran as a series on outsports and was consistently among our most popular pages. one of my all-time favorites — is barry zito gay? — was published in 2002 and i said at the time that i thought the cartoon perfectly captured the stereotypes gays and straights have about sexual orientation.
historically, women changed their names through marriage because women were viewed as property. so mary x is her father's property until john y comes along, and through the transfer of property, aka mary, she becomes mary y. this male-dominated history of such a valued and beloved tradition did not sit well with me. i was not comfortable with a tradition that viewed me as property, ensured i did not have my own identity separate from my husband, and solidified a woman's submissive position in the marriage.

we make excuses with everything from eating better to working out, and i hear it daily with sexual goals. when you experience low desire, your excuse may be you don't feel sexy, you're tired, or you are 'just not in the mood.' these are excuses that hold you back from experiencing anything at all. start small and go big. desire doesn't start at an accelerated pace. it may have in the past, but what we do know about desire is that it is more responsive than spontaneous. take a small step toward being more sexual each and every day. set a daily intention dedicated to your sexual health like, 'today i am going to feel positive in my body and find one way in which to give my body pleasure.'

she was drawn into the circles of anc politics when she shared digs with adelaide tsukudu, who was then courting the anc youth league leader oliver tambo, who was then a partner at law with nelson mandela. their introduction led to a marriage that lasted some four decades and a love that, arguably, did not end until he died. madikizela-mandela was at his bedside when mandela died and, along with his widow graça machel, mourned him as a husband in the long days of official memorials and funerals that followed.

the remedy is to prize your partner - and regularly. last thing at night, share with each other the 3 things you have most appreciated in yourself and your loved one during the day. once a week, share acknowledgments for what you partner has done, and appreciation for the positive qualities you notice in him or her. keep looking for the good, and overlooking the limitations.
it seems meghan was, at least initially, confused by how she could be disregarded and maligned by the royal institution. perhaps on a certain level she and her husband did not (and maybe still do not) understand that it is an institution whose only goal is to protect the white privilege of those who exist within its system. meghan herself admitted that she was very naive going into her relationship and subsequent marriage with prince harry, and that naivety wasn't just in regards to understanding the day-to-day life of a working royal, protocols and the proper way to curtsy. she and her husband were also incredibly naive about the reality of what it meant to introduce an american, divorced, half-black woman into the royal family. race was always going to be an issue in an institution that has largely excluded, exploited, ignored and even contributed to the plight of people of color all over the world.

she also admitted that the reason she ended our engagement was, in large part, because she didn't know what to do with her gender identity, which kept trying to rise to the surface. she hated that self then ― she didn't understand it, still didn't have a word for who she was, but she knew at some point it would destroy the self she currently presented to the world.

the supreme court ruled unanimously in favor of brown. in its decision, the court overturned the 1896 separate but equal ruling in plessy v. ferguson, marking the case as one of the biggest legal victories of the civil rights era. it was due to brown v. board of education that the federal government could force states to integrate schools, allowing children of color the opportunity for an equal education to white children.
you have forms of masculinity that depend on militarized expressions: the uniforms, the guns, the paraphernalia, the whole idea of the military structure and discipline, she said. when the institution of the military infiltrates social life and that sense of masculinity and what makes you a man depends on that ― depends on the gun on the side of your hip ― that becomes a problem for women.

don't feel guilty if you can't remember the last time you and your partner got it on; sexless marriages have become almost endemic in modern society. according to data scientist seth stephens-davidowitz, the top-searched marriage complaint on google is sexless marriage ― and it only takes a second to stumble upon advice forums, like the dead bedrooms board on reddit.
for married people who are exceptionally concerned with having their own money, it makes sense to discuss a prenup or post-nup, as the law would override individual assets, making the state of your savings — individual or joint — irrelevant.
and while gabbard, 37, has evolved since then ― she once backed a bill targeting discrimination based on sexual orientation and famously endorsed bernie sanders' presidential bid at the expense of her post as democratic national committee vice chair ― some people, including journalists from hawaii to d.c., wouldn't let her off easy for her homophobic remarks.

her confession and subsequent marriage shook my faith ― a faith that had already been wavering. at the time, i was attending church infrequently. my husband had left the church, and i found myself struggling with many doubts and questions. in truth, when i did attend church, it was more for my children than for me. i told myself that it was good for them to go because it was the way my husband and i were raised and because i have always believed the most important lessons i learned in church were taught to me in the children's primary program.
i love this man. other than this issue, he is wonderful and our families are blending very nicely and i am very happy. but this issue with money is reminding me of my ex (whom made a lot of money and i had to file for bankruptcy while living with him because he would not share or offer to cover expenses, while i was off on maternity leave with the kids). this makes me feel resentful and brings up trust issues, because if i can't trust him to pay me back $5, what does that say about things?
you might stay because you genuinely believe you love this person who regularly makes you feel like crap. you might even think you deserve this kind of treatment. i think we all know that you don't. no one does.

i don't read palms just at parties. i have found that it is a useful skill to have in supremely boring situations that need entertainment. after a flight was postponed for yet another three hours out of jfk airport in new york, the entirety of the plane decided to have me read their palms (after seeing me read my sister's).
although she's shacked up with her husband's close friend yvan, the narrator agrees to travel to mani, greece, where christopher is supposedly at work on a book about mourning rituals.

know that you can support your partner without taking on their negative emotions.
you get each other, protect each other, respect each other and love each other.
3. maintain your intimate connection. there are countless ways to develop and foster intimacy with your partner. holding hands, kissing hello, having deep conversations, incorporating humor, and making eye contact will show your significant other that he or she has your undivided attention as well as your interest. it is important to communicate openly, argue constructively, know when to compromise, and resolve conflict respectfully. never embarrass or put your significant other down in front of others. when addressing issues, watch your tone and use i statements to make your point. by being aware, informed, and tolerant of your partner's interests, dislikes, and vulnerability, you are steadfast in supporting, protecting, and honoring him or her.
while reading a new biography about the director, mike nichols, i was amazed to learn the whole thing was concocted on the fly during the shoot. equally telling is the fact that williams, then one of hollywood's biggest stars, had asked to play the more restrained of the two leads. his hyper-theatrical screen partner would spend the final 35 minutes of the film in drag, and williams didn't want to retread what he'd recently done in mrs. doubtfire. so nichols offered that role to nathan lane, a broadway luminary. it was for the best. unlike williams, lane is gay and could easily grasp the complexities of this particular code-switching.
it's easy to view your new life to be better than the one you already have, lis added. it is the extreme form of 'keeping up with the joneses.' instead of living in the moment, you imagine yourself living someone else's life in another place — and in a better place — than the one you already have. it's kind of like social media. there is always someone thinner, prettier and more successful. there's always that stunning colonial with better bushes than the one you already have.
king was often criticized for throwing out softball questions, though he denied this was intentional. he preferred his interviews to develop organically, adopting a more conversational style rather than sticking to a script or preparing a set of questions, he said.
kondo is unfazed by what would be anxiety-inducing piles of junk for most people. in fact, she's visibly elated by stacks of newspapers and rooms full of christmas decorations, and that energy is infectious. by the end of each episode, participants who started off apprehensive or overwhelmed are equally excited about home organization.
my friend tracy and i have started trading tips on the best way to paint nails in order to avoid bubbling. i advise her on quick-dry topcoats, toe separators ― things she's never heard of. tracy, like roughly 1.4 million other adults in the united states, is transgender. tracy is also my ex-fiancé. six months ago, over 20 years after our painful breakup in 1999 and two subsequent decades without any communication, she decided to contact me and come out.
this week's votes are part of a broader effort by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) to dramatically reshape the nation's federal courts while trump is in the white house. he has made confirmations of conservative judges his top priority.
i think his new wife was probably shocked when she first met me. in the beginning, i tried my best to make sure she knew that i was absolutely and completely not interested in ever getting back together with my ex-husband and that our relationship was just as co-parents. i am sure she needed time to process and adjust, but in my opinion she has done a great job. what i appreciate the most about her is the fact that she loves my daughter and it shows. even my mother sees and appreciates it, too. family dinners are now real family dinners where we all get together ― us and my very conservative family.
according to people magazine, the two are still on good terms with each other.
much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for lgbtq+ americans and if elected president, i will continue to fight for equal rights for all, she said.
in the meantime, keeping my heart open to myself is essential. i am always and forever, the love of my life.
others see pence's decision to teach at immanuel christian school, which includes students from kindergarten to eighth grade, as an endorsement of discrimination against the lgbtq community.

the two women also managed to stay above the fray of most of the season's petty drama, especially after sluss was implicated early on in a low-stakes spat in which she accidentally opened a bottle of champagne that did not belong to her. sanders faced a similar path on the campaign circuit: after his heart attack in early october, his support in the polls continued to grow, but it was not the story that dominated the primary, as various other candidates' profiles rose and fell.
this whole sleep separation pitch sounds promising, but let's turn to the question on everyone's mind: what about sex? does sleeping in separate rooms or beds put a damper on a couple's sex life?
3. the sooner you bring it up with your partner, the better.
as our time in maui neared to an end, my husband said he wanted to do something exciting. he suggested that we splurge on a helicopter tour of the island. so up we went, with mufflers on our ears to mute the sound. we viewed the huge haleakala volcano from above. the pilot bluffed us into thinking we'd crash into a cliff he headed straight for.
i may not be able to tell your entire future (or your past or your full present), but i can tell how open you are and how skeptical you are. i can tell what some of your darkest fears are and what some of your craziest secrets are. i can make you smile and remind you of moments you have long since forgotten. i can convince you to finally take that trip or to start playing the violin again.
off-camera, ethan was so much more himself ― confident, charming and so incredibly thoughtful. it was so refreshing getting to know each other better without cameras everywhere. i think things started getting really serious when he came out to visit me in texas and i got sick with pneumonia. i stayed in bed and slept all day and ethan just hung out in my living room by himself and took care of me until his flight home.
my heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions, chapman previously said of weinstein's deeds in a statement to people magazine.
our conservative, catholic relatives already thought my mom had sinned when she attended the touring production of hair with its infamous nude scene. but allowing her daughter to do that to her body and be okay with it was absolutely unforgivable. if i wanted to play with my cousins, i had to be dropped off and picked up in our driveway like a kid shuttled between divorced parents. many, like my grandmother, refused to speak to my new brother. i could feel something new emanating from every single person who knew or suspected what was happening in my family. it wasn't just judgment ― there was emotion behind it. it was disgust.
sekulow quickly remade himself as general counsel for the group jews for jesus. a self-described messianic jew, sekulow won a religious liberties case before the u.s. supreme court after members of the group were barred from passing out pamphlets at the los angeles international airport.
sekulow has been one of trump's most visible defenders, enduring as a trusted attorney for the president even as other of his lawyers have been sidelined or entangled in controversy.

joaquin phoenix paid homage to the late heath ledger during his acceptance speech at the 2020 screen actors guild awards.
while helicopter parenting and self-help mania seem to be as widespread in the u.s. as in sweden, its negative effects are enhanced by swedes' deep-seated wish to fit into a culture of agreeableness. we try to achieve this by pleasing others.
on july 3, 2015, the bharatiya janata party (bjp)-led government published the socio-economic data captured by the secc, but withheld the politically-sensitive caste data.
the older you get and the more responsibilities you have, the harder it is to commit to something as massive as starting a business. the risk can be too much for some people. i'm by no means saying you can't do this, i'm just stating it's harder.
the most famous moment from the birdcage is probably the one where robin williams gives a bored young hunk a 15-second tutorial in the history of american dance. it's one of the late actor's signature scenes. in an uproarious gush of energy, williams goes from coolheaded nightclub owner supervising a sondheim number to erudite showman. he demonstrates bob fosse, martha graham, twyla tharp, michael kidd and madonna, madonna, madonna with the zeal of a gay man who knows a thing or five about art.
for the mississippi-born williamson, eastsiders was a labor of love, too. he'd written the script for the show's first season out of his own frustrations with the lack of lgbtq representation onscreen as well as a scarcity of acting offers since his relocation from new york to los angeles. with the help of an online fundraising campaign, he launched the series on youtube in 2012.
her first buzz cut was inspired by a male model she saw on pinterest. people think you're aggressive if you have short hair ― butch, unfeminine. which works for me, because they leave me alone, she told huffpost. she acknowledges that things would be harder if she lived in a smaller town. surprisingly, she's faced little resistance to her choices in her parents' villages. (known simultaneously for its gritty, incredible sportswomen and its chauvinistic khaps, an extrajudicial, community-based system of moral policing that punishes women cruelly for their transgressions, redhu's home state of haryana is a living dichotomy.) mostly, people have just been curious, she said. i don't think they've judged me. i think when i was in college it was a little more on the nose because they'd harass you and say things like, 'oh, are you trying to be a boy?'
music brings me joy and seeing others enjoying it fills my bucket as well as theirs, cook added. one of my favorite moments was when i played 'do you hear the people sing,' and the neighbors on either side of me ran inside, grabbed their french flags and started walking up and down the sidewalk singing. even the postman driving by honked and we all felt a deep connection to each other.
growing up in a small, predominately white town in the 1980s, my sister and i were targeted and taunted by peers, and i often felt embarrassed by our parent's interracial marriage. i had to be walked to kindergarten every day by our neighbor's son because a group of older kids had been throwing rocks at me while pretending to speak chinese. i suffered the terror alone for days before finally telling my parents, because i didn't want them to feel at fault for what was happening to me.
it is easy to forget, but the first country to legalize same-sex marriage — the netherlands — did so only 17 years ago. today, only 26 countries in the world allow same-sex marriages. even in socially progressive countries like switzerland, marriages are reserved for heterosexual couples, while same-sex couples only have the right to a civil union (polls show that a swiss majority supports marriage equality, so most likely the law will follow suit in the not-too-distant future). and in the united states, it wasn't until 2011 that the share of adults who favored marriage equality outweighed those who opposed it, and merely by a margin of 1 percent — 46 percent in favor to 45 percent against. only after this shift did marriage equality become a reality in more than a few states, before the supreme court made it legal nationwide in 2015.

i used to love to have multiple partners at once. especially if they were living in different cities and would never be able to run into each other. i usually had one male companion in los angeles as well, but at this particular time, we were taking a break. multiple partners kept me on my toes. spinning lies is a huge part of the high a sex and love addict gets.

8. they cant agree on wedding decisions ― or anything, for that matter
if you do find your ancestor listed on the dawes final rolls, your next step is to obtain certified birth, marriage, and death certificates proving your lineage to that person. after you have obtained the necessary documents, contact the cherokee registration officer in tahlequah, oklahoma, to obtain an application to become a member of the nation.
15. exude peace: to be at peace with one's immediate relations, is the greatest of all happiness next to divine happiness. unless you are at peace with yourself, you cannot bring peace into your relationship. meditation, prayer, spiritual practice- each contributes to help us achieve peace in our lives. pray together and enjoy meals together. the more time you share together, the deeper your love for one another will grow.
and i love that i don't have to watch the actual wedding next week anymore. nothing could possibly top this.
president donald trump has issued a wave of pardons and clemency just hours before he was set to leave office.
living in physical bodies, this isn't surprising. despite what mysticism and science tell us to the contrary, despite all that talk in church about the holy spirit and the soul, most of us fully believe we're physical beings dwelling in a physical world. so a belief that contentment and a certain degree of happiness can be achieved through the balance of our physical activities isn't illogical. it's just that it doesn't work.

jeffreys went on to read mein kampf and started hanging out in daily stormer chat rooms, where anglin's readers plan real-world gatherings and in-person activism through his daily stormer book club network — from attending far-right rallies to posting neo-nazi flyers in cities around the country. on the daily stormer, jeffreys befriended sven longshanks aka steve stone. stone is a british hitler fanatic and host at radio aryan, a white nationalist online radio network that is based in the united kingdom and broadcasts from a secret location. british government regulators have been unable to police the neo-nazi network because it transmits over the internet. jeffreys pressed stone to let him record his own show on the network; eventually, stone agreed.

buescher plainly said during his unsuccessful run for nebraska attorney general, i do not believe homosexuality should be considered the same way race or ethnicity is considered with regard to anti-discrimination laws which currently apply to race or ethnicity. the leadership conference on civil and hum­­­­an rights has come out strongly against buescher, saying that his track record of partisan activism and deep-seated hostility to lgbtq equality and reproductive freedom makes him unqualified for the bench and calling him an ideological warrior.
wilson, who often shares photos and videos of future and his two other children on instagram, told gq that he sends his three beautiful brown-skinned kids inspirational video messages when he's not at home to reaffirm their sense of self-worth. these efforts have felt especially important this past year, he said, as uprisings took place across the nation over the summer in response to police violence against black people.

that part was not surprising, because as we always say, that is what privilege is always about, lemon said, adding, if you don't have to deal with it, then it doesn't exist for you. lemon brought up his own marriage to tim malone, a white man from the east end of long island, pointing out that only through marrying a black man from the south had he truly come to a reckoning regarding racism. of course, i'm not surprised that harry was introduced to racism through his wife and he felt it in a personal way, lemon said. that's how it happens.... harry has a black child and a black wife now, so it is personal. see lemon's comments below.

despite the many obstacles in achieving marriage equality, with time and advocacy, it will become more common. lgbtiq people, their allies and organizations everywhere around the world will continue investing in and fighting for change. lgbtiq people have overcome even the most shocking circumstances to change hearts and minds, and enact legislation that is more aligned with human rights principles. the trajectory of such change may not be linear, and while opponents to lgbtiq rights argue the alternative, it will ultimately bend toward justice.

4. strengthen your social network. it is of the utmost importance to have a life outside of your relationship. building your life together as a couple is exciting, but it is also crucial to have your own unique hobbies, friends, and interests. you cannot rely on one person to support all of your emotional needs. understand where and to whom you can go for each of your needs.

weddings among the super rich reinforce conservative values among the indian elites. yogita/wikipedia, cc by-nc
i've been married to a divorce attorney for 18 years. from the beginning i needed clear boundaries between work and relationship ― and no prenup. prenups look to me like a self-fulfilling prophecy, like you're planning the way out when you have not even begun while to my attorney bride, it just made sense to get clear on financial boundaries. keeping communications from becoming 'litigious' is an ongoing practice for both of us. i often joke that 'i'm married to a divorce lawyer, i don't mess with her,' but i actually find my spouse appreciates what an amazing marriage we have because she has seen so many marriages that were less than that. she works long hours and i miss her terribly, but our time together is always sweet.
i'm not. possibly because i'm not very brave. possibly because i'm a mite old fashioned (until death do us part? i do, i do). possibly because like a swan -- or an albatross (aren't they extinct?) -- my mate's for life.
mormon blogger josh weed was formerly a poster child for mixed-orientation marriages in the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, which views queer relationships as sinful. but in a blog post published last week, he said he came to realize that he could no longer be married to his partner, laurel weed, who is a straight woman.

the country's justice minister marco feoli said in a statement that the notary council's stance went against both the executive branch and the inter-american court.
in my marriage, love and abuse lay side by side. it was primarily emotional, with two incidents that were physical. both times he expressed remorse, but i wondered when it might happen again. i was embarrassed to be in such a situation, since as a therapist i would have advised clients to leave.
should have creates more toxicity than almost any other phrase, she said.
perhaps the hardest thing for me to stop doing is that i make my life much harder than it has to be, because i expect extraordinary things of myself every single day. i was devastated to realize that tiger parenting had taught me how to achieve, but never how to truly live.
the 'jekyll and hyde' description of somebody who is nice, who will behave in ways that seem thoughtful, that seem caring, that seem authentic is part of a pattern, houser said. it creates confusion. it creates a sense of distrust of your own experience. the ongoing contact is part of keeping victims confused and questioning the nature of the relationship.
i would see posts from new moms about how overjoyed they were. i didn't understand. i couldn't comprehend why i didn't feel the same thing they did and why they didn't seem as worried as i was. i remember my husband fawning over the baby and saying over and over again how in love he was. he'd ask me if i was happy. i didn't know how to reply. all i felt was this constant painful and crushing feeling in my heart and in my chest. i was also frustrated that he didn't understand that any breath could be our baby's last.

whatever its merits and motivations, that effort not only failed but may well have been counterproductive. the argument went that if we eliminated or severely curtailed the supply of drugs flowing into our country, addiction would cease to exist. the citizenry bought into it in a classic example of false assumptions resulting in wrong outcomes.

timbs still has to win one more round in court before he gets his vehicle back, but that seems to be a formality. a judge ruled that taking the car was disproportionate to the severity of the crime, which carries a maximum fine of $10,000. but indiana's top court said the justices had never ruled that the eighth amendment's ban on excessive fines — like much of the rest of the bill of rights — applies to states as well as the federal government.
we are having a political argument about whether people should be legally protected from lynching. lynching. extrajudicial and generally identity-based killings. i am incensed that, in an unsurprising expression of self-righteousness and moral control, self-proclaimed christians are leading the fight against the measure.
so how can we help our kids find financial stability while we cut the cord? show them how to budget. show them how to save for items on their must have lists, and how to save long-term for a rainy day. what i will say is this; if you do the work now, if you teach them to have respect for your money, and their money as they earn it, you're much less likely to end up with a 30-something year old kid living in your basement, while you continue to foot the bill for them.
when your partner is starting to feel like a 'best friend' that you want to gossip on the couch with after a long day at work instead of connecting in a sensual and intimate way, it's time to create some space for being lovers and bring erotic energy into your connection together. flirt, make eye contact, use body language to feel sexy and sensual. move your body and be intentional about turning your partner on. instead of turning to your partner and saying, 'do you want to have sex?' at the end of the night, work on creating anticipation, hints outside of the bedroom, texting and communication that show you are interested in being connected and intimate together. ― chavez

as things stand, the modi government remains deeply invested in the social registry. manoranjan kumar, the man who first penned the foundational note that kicked off the process, has retired but his successors in bureaucracy continue to support the social registry in the slogans of the modi regime.
what if the lack of respect that made infidelity so agonizing was less about sex and more about dishonesty? if honesty could be achieved and mutually maintained, then, could my husband and i develop a level of empathy that would allow for more sexual freedom without damaging our partnership? could we think and feel past the societal taboo of sex outside of marriage and discover a truer definition of love? was there a third viable path hidden alongside divorce and forced monogamy?

tony parker: the final shot (netflix documentary)
relationship professionals like me often talk and write about the value of commitment in a lasting relationship. but, i think constantine was on to something when he said that the important, but complex concept of commitment pales beside the adrenaline of real stubbornness when it comes to sustaining a vital relationship.
by the time i was in junior high school, i already knew. you could see it in the school yearbook, king wrote in his 2009 bestselling autobiography, my remarkable journey. they asked me what i wanted to be, and i told them: a radio announcer.

what people report in a therapy session has to make sense. if it doesn't, i know one or both are leaving out important information. part of the challenge is some people cover things up, some are worried about what i'll think of them and others lie or have a distorted sense of reality. ― becky whetstone, a marriage family therapist in little rock, arkansas

but on the day before the table's arrival, emily realized she had a can't-miss work meeting in the middle of the delivery window. she couldn't be there, so i would have to be.
it's the once actually established part that puts most people off, i think. with our focus fixed on the world circus, absorbed by the trials of our own tumultuous lives, seeking outside solutions, we believe we don't have time for such pastimes as meditation. but if we genuinely knew it was a scientifically reliable answer to all the unhappiness and flailing around we do ... ?
meghan, an american actress and star of tv legal drama suits, married harry at windsor castle in may 2018. their son, archie, was born the following year.
part of the reason everyone reacted so strongly is because brad and jen are both so iconic now and nearly an entire generation has grown up without seeing contemporary pictures of them together, he said. but another reason is because those shots ― especially the wrist one ― were so ridiculously romantic in tone.
keep in touch often but don't overdo it, said simone ferriero, an illustrator and comic book artist who is in an ldr. everyone needs personal alone space to recharge or do the things that they love. being constantly in contact with your partner can be a mistake and it could drain the relationship in the long run.
in some relationships, both partners agree they want to get organized, but they just can't seem to find the time or energy to make it happen. other couples have a different predicament: one partner is a neat freak overwhelmed by a messy living space, while other is unfazed by — or even enjoys — the clutter.

lauren: but as time went on, we would have longer dates, even up to four hours. and we're talking about multiple dates a day, so there would be times when we would be on 16-hour dates.

this being a digital age, our lives are suffused with fonts. just about every word we read is set in a font crafted by an artist, a team of them, or even multiple generations of designers. but for the non-graphic designers among us, who mostly interact with font without a second thought, the medium's possibilities may not seem particularly exciting.

1. one of the partners is completely uninterested in photographs.
last week, the second lady of the united states, karen pence, went to work as an art teacher at immanuel christian school in northern virginia. immanuel christian is one of the many american religious institutions, as rebecca klein reported for huffpost, that discriminates both in its hiring and its admissions. the school requires moral purity from its staff, meaning they can't be queer, have sex outside marriage or watch porn, and must respect the unique roles of men and women. the school also reserves the right to expel students for being queer.

the movie takes certain liberties with the timeline and the actual events in order to squeeze it into a rom-com template, but mostly it's just a checklist of aww-able moments: the engagement chicken! the public statement from harry defending his new girlfriend! meghan bonding with elizabeth's corgis! botswana!
you have an excess of free time right now. as gilbert mentioned, don't use it to stay current on what your ex is up to on social media.

although there are many real people on dating apps looking for what you are, that doesn't mean they are going to see you as a real person until you meet them face to face, she said. you have to remind yourself of that: if you're not even totally real, why feel rejected?
being in an ldr requires a lot of trust. there also has to be an understanding that you each have to lead your own separate lives, which includes going out after work for drinks with co-workers and having lunch with a friend, said los angeles marriage and family therapist caroline madden, author of fool me once: should i take back my cheating husband? any sort of pressure that you should be instantly available any time they call or text you should be a warning sign.
recently we watched a movie together and john's eyes teared up. he didn't say a word, but clearly he felt moved by the storyline. i wanted to talk about what he was feeling, to ask what provoked his emotion. instead, i smiled tenderly and held his hand while the movie continued.
i think marriage initially involves a lot of people who have nothing to do with your relationship, because it's a legally binding contract, and that has a weight to it, she answered. being married is different than not being married, and anybody who tells you that it's the same is lying.
washington ― the senate voted thursday to confirm eric murphy to the u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit, meaning a 39-year-old lawyer who repeatedly led efforts to make it harder for people to vote will now be a lifetime federal judge.
often times, the survivor in this scenario is in an ongoing relationship with an abusive partner, wilson said. people tend to believe rape is perpetrated by a stranger ― not someone known to the victim like a partner, classmate or colleague. so when sexual violence is perpetrated by someone the survivor knows (which is 80% of the time, according to the rape, abuse & incest national network), they often don't have the correct language to describe the encounter.
it was a violent, sexist world. one time, she went backstage to meet the members of a band she loved. they made disgusting comments about her body and tried to grab her ass. she was 16. she saw bloody fights break out between antifa and skinheads. she dated someone in the metal scene who was abusive. it was a world that was supposed to be violent and extreme. she was desensitized to it.

this is a step in the right direction, hillsborough board member matt hughes, who is openly gay, said during monday's board meeting. in so many places across the country, just not in the southeast but really everywhere, people can marry the love of their life on a saturday and get fired monday when they show up at work.
who does the lion share of childcare in your house? who picks the kids up from soccer practice? who makes sure a wrinkle in time is read and reported on by the deadline? if the answer is my wife, it's high time you stepped up, said laurel steinberg, a new york-based relationship therapist and adjunct professor of psychology at columbia university
back in the 1920s, u.s. department store l. bamburger & co., which later became macy's, launched an advertising campaign for male engagement rings, but the idea never really stuck. in other countries like chile and sweden, however, it's commonplace for both men and women to wear engagement rings.
liam daniel/netflix empire line dresses are in high demand since the premiere of netflix's bridgerton.
for heterosexual men, bar none, the most consistent fantasy i hear, year after year, is about having an enthusiastic partner who is having a genuinely good time and is freely expressive and responsive to his touch. it may be memories from a previous (particularly hot) sexual experience, or it may be images from porn, or it may be fantasy about a secret crush. but in every case, the woman is enjoying herself immensely and having multiple orgasms.
to have support in the highest office in the commonwealth of kentucky is so meaningful for so many lgbtq people who have never felt seen by lawmakers who can make a difference, he said.
these are spaces where there are multiple perspectives at play and you want everyone to be able to have space, ward said, noting that these sessions involve more information and relationship dynamics to address.
this is because south africa's movement toward greater equality, more muscular land transfers and harmonious race relations has often been a tortured journey. and so with her death, madikizela-mandela's legacy is quickly being reassessed. her path, many believe, may have delivered the fruits of freedom more quickly than mandela's path, which favored peace and reconciliation over the more militant road that madikizela-mandela often said the african national congress should not have forsaken.
i'm 100 percent with you on this one, ashley. i'll never understand men who make comments like this. they're inadvertently telling their daughters (or granddaughters), i don't trust your ability to choose the right person, so i'm going to intimidate all of them by putting a killing machine in their faces. that will teach 'em to treat you right. it's straight up stupid. and the fact it's assumed boys will soon come knocking based on your teen daughters' mature looks is really gross and not exactly empowering to them as young women.
in a 1983 new york times interview, he recalled his early career in small clubs where the show consisted of me — master of ceremonies, comedian and magician — maybe a dog act, and a stripper. it was a piano player in one such club, he said, who suggested replacing dallas burrows with some funny name like roger duck — or orson bean.
when the nameless narrator of katie kitamura's smart, spare book a separation finds out that her husband is missing, she's relatively nonplussed. christopher's prone to fits of whimsy, and besides, they haven't spoken in a month. because of his philandering and a mismatch in temperament, the couple has separated, but kept the split a secret.
one study investigating why living in the gay community increases depression found that the effect only showed up in masculine gay guys. the second reason the gay community acts as a unique stressor on its members is not about why we reject each other, but how. in the last 10 years, traditional gay spaces—bars, nightclubs, bathhouses—have begun to disappear, and have been replaced by social media. at least 70 percent of gay men now use hookup apps like grindr and scruff to meet each other. in 2000, around 20 percent of gay couples met online. by 2010, that was up to 70 percent. meanwhile, the share of gay couples who met through friends dropped from 30 percent to 12 percent. usually when you hear about the shocking primacy of hookup apps in gay life—grindr, the most popular, says its average user spends 90 minutes per day on it—it's in some panicked media story about murderers or homophobes trawling them for victims, or about the troubling chemsex scenes that have sprung up in london and new york. and yes, those are problems. but the real effect of the apps is quieter, less remarked-upon and, in a way, more profound: for many of us, they have become the primary way we interact with other gay people. it's so much easier to meet someone for a hookup on grindr than it is to go to a bar by yourself, adam says.
seeing how different we are from other married couples can be intimidating, and i admit sometimes i wonder if our partnership is good enough. i worry about this most often after some dumb fight we've had that usually leads to questioning all my life's decisions but i've learned that comparing our marriage to others and trying to live up to other people's standards does not work.

texas couple aaron lucero and jeffrey cannon had just begun their wedding venue search when they got an unpleasant surprise: the owners of their first choice, the venue at waterstone, emailed to say they shouldn't bother visiting because a gay wedding would be against god's plan and design for marriage.
in another clip from the interview released earlier this week, winfrey asked the duchess: how do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today?
lopez can blame halle berry, who was originally cast but dropped out to do x-men 2. in theory, the appeal of gigli is evident. it was a major-movie-star vehicle at a time when major movie stars were hollywood's meal tickets. ben affleck was still surfing his post-good will hunting crest, and director martin brest had a track record for fruitful comedies (beverly hills cop, midnight run). the film netted lopez an a-list-worthy $12 million. by early-2000s standards, it became an event before the cameras even rolled, so much so that lopez's renown further eclipsed her esteem. coupling up with affleck during production created a media spectacle, and bennifer became the nickname that inspired a thousand starry portmanteaus.
grandpa lampshade's thoughts of the day podcast debuted in february 2016. jeffreys launched his semitic truth center blog shortly afterward. within months, he had become an influential neo-nazi propagandist.

loving thoughts and behaviors towards your partner will promote loving thoughts and behaviors from your partner.
the democrats, however, have also curated their follows along partisan lines, with msnbc's rachel maddow in the no. 1 spot. the democratic top-10 list also features chuck todd of msnbc, jake tapper of cnn and mike allen of politico. what is really striking is the disparity in numbers for some other journalists, like ezra klein and nate silver, whom some detractors might characterize as liberal. for example, as you can see in the table below, 119 democrats ― but only 37 (out of 199) republicans ― follow silver of fivethirtyeight. it's also interesting to note that despite fox being… well, fox, chad pergram is still clearly someone whom democrats in the house are interested in hearing from.
give yourself permission to be happy, even if your partner isn't.
then, talk about what you expect ― not demand ― of your partner and figure out a compromise.
in an interview with huffpost, sáenz acknowledged that aristotle and dante discover the secrets of the universe was published at a perfect time when the public discourse around marriage equality was ramping up. by contrast, the sequel will be released as the world continues to reel from the devastation of the covid-19 crisis. in fact, the pandemic motivated the author ― whose works also include 2004's sammy and juliana in hollywood and 2017's the inexplicable logic of my life ― to commit to the long-gestating project.
the senate is voting on two more circuit court nominees this week, both of whom, like rushing, are young, ideological and federalist society members.
in the event of a breakup, you and your ex will need to work together to decide how you want to split up the debt that you accumulated while together. of course, that's not always easy to do when your relationship is ending.
i kept underlining what you called the grief cake period. you were clearly feeling unhinged in the days and months after your husband died, but you're also objective that you're unhinged. to be able to sit back and write about a period, it's so hard to do it without writing, i felt crazy. i was eating too much. just speak to that a little bit.
some sex and love addicts date unavailable partners, some are addicted to masturbation and porn, some depend on one night stands. for my life as an addict, the addiction told me that without men, without their attention, their love, and the power that came with that, i was nothing.
lopez clearly sensed that the back-up plan wouldn't be enough to restore her early-2000s glory. wanting double the buzz, she timed her next album, love?, to coincide with the movie's release. but lopez parted with her record label in what may or may not have been an amicable split after the intended lead single, louboutins, bombed. with a new wave of pop stars taking over (rihanna, lady gaga, taylor swift, beyoncé) and a drastically changing hollywood business model, lopez had to rehabilitate her brand.
the show, he added, has led to a wealth of new screenwriting projects. though he would like to maintain his acting chops, williamson ultimately sees himself following in the footsteps of phoebe waller-bridge of fleabag as a writer, showrunner and performer.
connie and i have spent the last few months traveling around the country to make dignity of work a centerpiece of democrats' 2020 campaign, and we are so grateful to everyone who has welcomed us into their communities and into their lives, brown said in a statement, referring to his wife, journalist connie schultz. we've seen candidates begin taking up the dignity of work fight, and we have seen voters across the country demanding it – because dignity of work is a value that unites all of us. it is how we beat trump, and it is how we should govern.
6. suggest that you co-create the agreement.
your situation is a pretty simple one, ashley. tell your husband to knock it off. tell him your daughters don't find the jokes funny at all ― in fact, they were offended by them. anyone who continues to spout off the same comments after being told your girls were upset by them is one of those aforementioned out-of-touch assholes. your husband will fall in line if he doesn't want his daughters to think of him that way.
because some like it haute. if i'm going to go that route when visiting paris (and where else better to?) i might as well go all out or go home. and i've pinpointed epicure, with its three michelin stars and chef eric fréchon at the helm, as the place to do it. fréchon is able to give a slight spin on the most ordinary of dishes: stuffed macaroni with artichokes, black truffle, duck foie gras and parmesan cheese. it just can't be bad.
vice president mike pence's incoming chief of staff has apologized for writing a column for his college newspaper that blamed gay people's perverted homosexual lifestyles for the aids crisis of the early 1990s.
giving them the tools they need to not only understand money, but also develop a healthy relationship with it, is your best bet to getting that financial umbilical cord cut -- sooner than later. do your part in getting them on their way to financial independence; they will thank you, and your marriage will thank you too! less money spent on your adult children is more money to spend on romantic holidays, and couple time or you time -- and how can that be bad?
to try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of hawaii, she said then. as democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.
the actor describes herself as a mother of six ― daughter katherine, son sean, twins john and kristopher, and stepkids jenni (the daughter of her husband david flynn) and kalen (the son of her husband james keach). over the years, she's spoken in interviews about parenting topics ranging from in vitro fertilization and childbirth to work/life balance and challenges dealing with attention deficit disorder.

the time has come for christians to turn off the television, and for christianity to file for divorce from the unholy marriage of our compassionate faith with the worldly and violent game of football.
almost three years ago, only a year after our divorce, my ex-husband started dating someone and fell in love. i wasn't jealous or worried. the reality is, i had been out of love with my husband for a while, and now we were both able to find the love we deserved elsewhere. i was happy that he was doing that. last year, they got married. and yes, we all live together and get along just fine. a happy man is a good father, and i can see that his new wife brings out the best in him. it's nice to see, but i am also very aware of the fact that we will all have separate lives at some point. our commitment is to stay together ― in the same house or close to each other ― not till death do us apart but only till our daughter goes off to college.
unlike the indian population census — governed by the indian census act of 1948 that legally mandates the confidentiality of those enumerated — the secc has no such safeguards.
i could tell you all of the things i made for 'mad men' that you never individually saw, but they were there in the background as a character, as a set piece, taking you to the '60s, mcsorley said. and the dishware was [period-appropriate]. just everything.

long-distance relationships call for two partners who possess major stick-to-itiveness: not everyone can endure the long stretches of times without seeing each other, the time differences, and the financial and logistical obstacles that come with visiting. (in 2021, there are covid-19 travel restrictions to contend with, too.)
whether you make new year's resolutions or not, now is a good time to improve your life – and your marriage/relationship.
iyer believes that workplaces aren't hair-inclusive. a lot of companies have a policy about the types of colors allowed on women's hair. advertising agencies and the entertainment industry are a bit more relaxed, but there are still clear assumptions made based on the length of your hair. medium or long hair that is straight, not frizzy and not colored, is considered the most professional. most indian corporations definitely consider buzz cuts unprofessional. it is assumed that you will not take your work seriously if your hair is fun!
still, it's worth taking a closer look at gabbard's positions on lgbtq rights, an issue she claims she has evolved on in quite an extraordinary way. in the 2020 election, every candidate's record on lgbtq rights will be critical — and that includes both statements in their past and how they're presenting themselves in the media right now.
the program is very systematic, with a program and manuals.... the results are exceptional. as i told you, companies grew from $12 million to $4 billion. but the program is not easy to apply. changing the culture of a company is a very, very time-consuming and difficult job.

the actor made a surprise appearance sunday night at the golden globe awards, where he introduced the movie moonlight, which was up for and won best motion picture, drama.
your date shouldn't be monopolizing the conversation. you may be forgetting to talk about yourself, but a true gentleman will realize you're doing most of the listening and will want to know more about you. i would not recommend pushing yourself into the conversation more than you feel necessary. simply try sharing a few thoughts, ideas or divulge a little about yourself. if you have to force him to listen to you, you can be pretty sure this is how the relationship will go in the long run. cut your losses now. ― amanda deverich, a marriage and family therapist in williamsburg, virginia

more men helped around the house early on in lockdown. what happened?
since my mind was focused on only seeing what was wrong with me, what is missing, and not appreciate what is there, it became impossible for me to rejoice in the delight of love my partner gave me.
while my everyday demeanor lands somewhere between mild mannered and half-comatose, it becomes something else behind the wheel. i'm fidgety and anxious, high-strung and hard-edged.
one of the biggest things i've learnt recently is the importance of patience. gary vaynerchuk, ceo of vaynermedia states the single biggest reason businesses fail is because they lack patience. being a young entrepreneur, you have the luxury of being able to be patient because you have such a long time to build a successful business.
growing up, i never questioned the impact of my upbringing and carried it with me in stride. it gave me immense pride knowing that the tireless work ethic and focus my parents had instilled in me could inspire my best moments. i thanked them in my high school graduation speech as valedictorian. i gifted my first year-end bonus to my parents entirely in cash, knowing my father would never deposit a check.
katya said her ex-husband often demeaned her for being russian. she said he also often disparaged gay people and people with mental illnesses and disabilities, especially people with down syndrome. larry calls it a disease, katya said of larry's attitude toward gay people. larry says, verbatim, 'we need to have a societal cleanse and put all of these defective people on the train.' you know, like hitler did with all of the jews? that was his favorite phrase.
my husband and i never had any dog in this hunt, but even we were surprised by our own reactions to the pictures, fitzgerald told huffpost. there were literal gay gasps when we saw that shot of him grasping her wrist as she turned away.
my story--about being fired by the billionaire, about my husband denying me access to our joint account, about sleeping in my car--tumbled out of my mouth. i was hoping to elicit some empathy, which would make her like me and i was desperate for her--or anyone else's--approval (a character defect i still struggle with).

while this can be an uncomfortable step for many people, especially men, it's a necessary ingredient for relationship happiness, smith said. a lot of partners withhold sharing negative feelings out of fear of hurting the other. yet they can hurt them even more by not being honest.
widowhood is not for the weak. one minute, you're fine and the next you're a raving lunatic. you curse your dead spouse when you have a flat tire, when you just don't have the energy to drive your kid to the school bus stop and no one else is around to help. it can feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders and you just want one thing ― just one ― to be easy. like, you know, canceling a cell phone plan.
the conversation illuminates the way many americans understood sexual violence at the time — especially as it pertains to black girls, who are often perceived as older, less innocent and more knowledgeable about sex than their white peers. like the women in philly, many of kelly's fans were shocked and dismayed by kelly's relationship with aaliyah. but they aimed their disgust at the younger woman, who was presumed to be either sexually unsatisfactory or suspiciously seductive ― never a victim or a survivor of abuse.
she was self-aware enough to say, 'no, i can tone down the j.lo look,' ladd recalled. 'i can be the girl who grew up in wyoming.' and then she even did a makeup test, probably of her own volition: 'look, see, i can do it.' she took it seriously.

however, scholars who study religion in america say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. christian nationalists argue that the united states was founded as a christian nation and has a special covenant with god, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with god. the textbooks parrot these ideas, said andrew whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the association of religion data archives at indiana university-purdue university indianapolis.
over the past year, lawmakers have repeatedly dismissed troubling allegations that gay men are being detained, tortured and even killed in the russian republic of chechnya.
at the time that i was researching my book, before the time these books came out, there were not really any by black people. i was like, i'm just going to write my story and hope that people connect to it and that people appreciate a story told from a perspective that is maybe close to theirs or that will say, 'it's not like my experience, and i respect it because it's not like mine. i'd like to know more about someone else's experience.'
it's a good story, my brother said when i called him recently to let him know i was writing about our lives.
this selfishness is as irritating as it is inconvenient, considering i've now entered the selfless arrangement of marriage. since saying, i do, though, my mindset's been recalibrating one yes, dear at a time. actually, i've never said that phrase, partly because i'm not on a sitcom, and partly because my wife, emily, and i keep things as balanced as possible. she has her areas of responsibility, i have mine.
when i needed to get up to feed or change the baby's diaper in the middle of the night, every step i took caused excruciating pain. i was also weak from excessive blood loss. on most nights, i would cry for hours, feeling frustrated, alone, helpless and hopeless, waiting for the sun to come up and for my baby to make it through one more night. although i had a lot of support at home from both my husband and my mother-in-law, i did not ask for help. no one can care for my baby like i can, i reasoned. plus, i needed everyone else to be wide awake in the mornings to watch him for me, in case i dozed off then.

the grief of the wounded self is primarily for what you are no longer getting. the wounded self might be saying to the departed person, how could you leave me? how could you do this to me? even if the loved one died rather than left the relationship, the remaining person might be angry at being left.

i see them all (of the children) all the time, and they are friends with one another, and they joke about the time they spent with me. we've been able to accept what happened, while not forgetting or disregarding the good we had together. once you love someone, you always love them. you may not be... married or to be in a relationship for a long time, but the relationship you had was valuable, and then it becomes something else, if you're fortunate. you can figure out how to have a different type of relationship.
one of his co-workers kept pressing him to confess that we have an open relationship ― when, in fact, we do not. on facebook, he once received a direct message from an anonymous account created with the intent of dissuading him from dating a sex worker. poor guy, he has to put up with dating a gorgeous and confident woman whom everyone pines over. how does he survive?
the comfort or solution hack puts the onus on the non-distressed partner to do a little heavy lifting, but it's worth it, she said. why waste time crafting a fail-proof solution to a work squabble or power dispute when all your partner wants is to lay out all the specific ways their boss is the absolute worst and hear you say, damn, totally.
then think about what lights you up and how you can use that as a catalyst in your post-divorce world. what are you passionate about? those passions or long forgot hobbies could be a new business idea or a way to make amazing friends. you could turn it into a blog or better yet, your battle cry.

i've been married for 34 years and for 30 of them, i've been a divorce lawyer. you might think i'd be deeply cynical about the institution of marriage. but you would be totally wrong. i, along with many of my colleagues in the family law bar, are deep appreciators of marriage. i think that is because we, more than most people, truly understand the value of family. we know it's what gives meaning to people's lives because we experience firsthand the depth of the pain when it doesn't work out. and i know that has made me a better spouse and parent. i'm tolerant of small problems and differences because i am so acutely aware of the big picture, of how unimportant those differences may be when compared to the potential cataclysm of divorce. i have to admit, though, that i've heard this from my husband more than once during an argument: 'stop cross examining me!' but really, if that's all he has to complain about, he has no idea how good he has it.

i thought harry and meghan: a royal romance would be terrible as well as intoxicating, but instead it was perfect as well as intoxicating. i loved the weird spirit lions. i loved the no-holds-barred approach to race and meghan's feminist activism. i loved our new accountant uncle, william. i loved kate's rebirth as the british regina george. i loved when fake harry told his family that he wouldn't make meghan shut down her blog, the tig, because that blog is part of her identity. (anyway, she totally did shut down the blog, but i appreciate the sentiment.)

you should subscribe. sign up the researchers i spoke to explained that gay guys inflict this kind of damage on each other for two main reasons. the first, and the one i heard most frequently, is that gay men are shitty to each other because, basically, we're men. the challenges of masculinity get magnified in a community of men, pachankis says. masculinity is precarious. it has to be constantly enacted or defended or collected. we see this in studies: you can threaten masculinity among men and then look at the dumb things they do. they show more aggressive posturing, they start taking financial risks, they want to punch things. this helps explain the pervasive stigma against feminine guys in the gay community. according to dane whicker, a clinical psychologist and researcher at duke, most gay men report that they want to date someone masculine, and that they wished they acted more masculine themselves. maybe that's because, historically, masculine men have been more able to blend into straight society. or maybe it's internalized homophobia: feminine gay men are still stereotyped as bottoms, the receptive partner in anal sex. a two-year longitudinal study found that the longer gay men were out of the closet, the more likely they were to become versatile or tops.
depression and anxiety can both be serious medical issues. there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting help for your mental health.

yep, i've been married to a divorce lawyer for 52 years. she wasn't a lawyer for the first 14. i'd been an attorney for five years when she was sworn in and we opened our own shop. we later joined a larger firm together; i retired, she's still there. for us, practicing law together was fun. my end was stodgy bank and real estate work. her practice seemed to bring new and amazing bits of insanity every day. what i remember most is her ability to keep her composure where very few people could, like laughing along with our staff at the death threat left on our answering machine or the court battle over custody of a stuffed parrot. those were happy days.

he and his supporters are fighting the culture at large in an attempt to keep the political system from acknowledging the humanity of lgbtq people. those christians essentially use their bigotry as a rock to live under, not recognizing that no matter how many times they refuse to acknowledge the existence, dignity and rights of lgbtq people, they do exist. they don't need christians' affirmation to suddenly make them real.
last, and certainly not least, tell her how much you love and appreciate her. every day. i've been told by my mom friends that hearing thank you has the same (if not more) impact than hearing i love you. no matter what happens, keep emphasizing how important she is to you and your family — because at the end of the day, happiness is the goal.
the couple told winfrey that this, along with the bigoted u.k. press, had contributed to their decision to move to america, adding that harry's family had thus far been unwilling to apologize for any role they had played in driving the pair overseas.

what i thought indecent was the fact that they wore outfits that mocked the christian religion and mocked traditional values, wheeler said. that's what i've got a problem with, is the mockery and the fact that the governor would pose and support that.
larry king was a baseball fanatic from a young age and spent his childhood idolizing the brooklyn dodgers and fantasizing about broadcasting their games one day. he later became a die-hard new york yankees fan after the dodgers moved to los angeles.
still, nearly a year into the pandemic and various degrees of lockdown, most of us are itching for change of some kind. why is that? for many people, the pandemic has accentuated problems that already existed, therapists say.

we saved money to afford the larger-than-life indian wedding that has become the norm for krina's side of the family. these weddings typically have more than 300 guests, but we wanted a smaller guest list in the 100 to 200 person range. we tentatively set a date for may 8, 2021, but being in health care, we waited to book a venue or a city due to concerns about the pandemic.
according to reporting by the nbclx news outlet, several states and a few hospital systems that keep track of births saw significant drops in birth rates in december, compared with the same month in 2019. this past december's birth rates were down 8% in florida, 5% in arizona and 7% in ohio compared with the previous year. (most states and hospitals contacted either couldn't provide information or hadn't shared their december numbers yet.)

my grandmother was actually named eleanor. but we chose it because it had to sound good in french and english. it's a little tricky. some of the american names don't really click. ... [my husband] wanted to name her bebe for a while. it seemed like a pinup name.

worldwide malta, ecuador, brazil and taiwan have banned conversion therapy, according to lgbt+ advocacy group outrightaction international. britain and parts of canada are mulling bans and about 18 u.s. states outlaw such therapy for minors.
to deactivate the blocking software, a person would have to prove they are at least 18 years old and pay a one-time fee of $20 to the arizona commerce authority. manufacturers or retailers could also charge a fee for disabling it, according to the bill. anyone who deactivates the blocker themselves would face a misdemeanor charge.

chances are, your turn-ons have changed over time. the same is probably true for your partner. take the guesswork out of the equation by talking openly about your sexual interests, said keeley rankin, a sex therapist in san francisco, california.
if your relationship has remained strangely stagnant since you first met irl or online, that's a problem, said marie land, a therapist in washington, d.c.
i'd recommend singles looking for others who share similar views join an app for celibate and asexual people called celibate passions, brito said. you're all on the same page. (if you are asexual, there's another called asexual cupid.)
it got so bad that i used to go to the grocery store that was 40 minutes away instead of the one that was 10 minutes away just because i was so afraid to walk down the gay street. the word i hear from paul, from everyone, is re-traumatized. you grow up with this loneliness, accumulating all this baggage, and then you arrive in the castro or chelsea or boystown thinking you'll finally be accepted for who you are. and then you realize that everyone else here has baggage, too. all of a sudden it's not your gayness that gets you rejected. it's your weight, or your income, or your race. the bullied kids of our youth, paul says, grew up and became bullies themselves. gay men in particular are just not very nice to each other, says john, the adventure tour guide. in pop culture, drag queens are known for their takedowns and it's all ha ha ha. but that meanness is almost pathological. all of us were deeply confused or lying to ourselves for a good chunk of our adolescence. but it's not comfortable for us to show that to other people. so we show other people what the world shows us, which is nastiness. every gay man i know carries around a mental portfolio of all the shitty things other gay men have said and done to him. i arrived to a date once and the guy immediately stood up, said i was shorter than i looked in my pictures and left.
a high-school-level textbook from bju press also blames the black lives matter movement for racial discord. it says:
as a divorce attorney, my problem is not making my clients' issues mine. while i am sympathetic, i have to remain detached to keep my objectivity and maintain my sanity. i certainly don't want to bring their problems home with me. that said, i can use my client's issues as life lessons. i can identify the mistakes they made in their relationships, in raising their children, in their decision making, and consciously modify my behavior so as not to follow them. i do not want to be someone's divorce client.
this is hardly a disavowal of the violence that is foundational to white nationalism. it is, rather, a horrific suggestion from jeffreys that targeted killings might be a more effective way to spark the white ethnostate nazis dream of. a far safer way to feed the white nationalist movement, as jeffreys knows, is to maintain a footprint on the platforms that give him and other neo-nazis such far-flung reach. platforms like gab or radio aryan or the daily stormer. or twitter. platforms that can turn a racist nobody hawking auto parts into a somebody selling hate around the world.

after speaking with huffpost, jeffreys took old episodes of his show offline. but he is still responsible for promoting an ideology in which violence against jewish and non-white people is not only justified but ultimately required.

we talked about her arrests. the toll it had taken when, just after their wedding, she had been picked up again and disappeared for a few days. they felt somewhat protected by their fame, but still... the kingdom wasn't safe. — kirk rudell (@krudell) january 2, 2019
4. for straight people, having sex with someone of the same sex
this was the heavy confession i told our couple's counselor last august, as my husband and i returned from our honeymoon in hawaii. it was a deep sigh, a release from the weight of so many years of tiger parenting deeply ingrained in me as the child of immigrants.
so what the heck?!?!? then ask!!
girlfriends can talk for hours about every nuance, possibility, and angle of any subject. john prefers the shorter and more succinct version, without endless processing and discussion. shifting my expectations and viewing him as my best guy friend helped lessen pressure and tension.
6. you tell that person things only your spouse knows, or worse ― things your spouse doesn't know.
my parents came to the u.s. from taiwan in 1982, lured by the opportunity to build a new life. they adopted western names, william and mimi, to better assimilate into american society. while my father had dabbled as a small-time soap opera actor and my mother briefly studied fashion design, they hung up these dreams for more sensible endeavors: working as a waiter and waitress in a family friend's restaurant. as the children of chinese nationalists who lost everything when they retreated to taiwan after the chinese civil war in 1950, they simply understood when it was time to grow up.
specifically, the signatories of the letter said that the new provisions discriminated against people based on their ancestry and could affect people who had legitimate reasons to travel to iran, iraq, sudan or syria as journalists or on business.
if dr. dre's career trajectory after that admission is any indication of how we view the physical violence suffered by black women, then i imagine millions of people consider it no big thing. even after he publicly admitted it, dr. dre was still able to become a world-renowned hip-hop artist with a net worth of $740 million.
i literally had to get it off my chest. the day that he died, i was in my kitchen with my friend scott eyman, who used to be the books editor at the palm beach post, where i work, and he is a hollywood historian. he has written many, many books. i used to always say, oh, i'm going to write this idea. i've got a great idea for fiction, and i would give him the first two chapters.

the study is based on data from nationwide surveys of high school students and young adults taken in 2017 and 2018. because federal surveys don't collect data on gender identity for people over 18, the trevor project study does not include information on transgender or non-binary students. research has consistently found that transgender youth have higher rates of suicide than their straight or lgb peers.
bishop michael olson, who leads the catholic diocese of fort worth, suggested last week that security isn't an issue with these new refugees.
so during the holiday i asked myself, what makes a partner chronically critical?
my two daughters aren't even close to dating age yet, but when they are, i plan to tell them they can bring anyone to our house (boy or girl), and i'll do my part to make them feel comfortable and welcomed. of course, if these guests engage in behavior that make my daughters unhappy or uncomfortable, i'll address it accordingly, just like any well-adjusted grownup should. and it won't entail waving a gun around like yosemite sam.
fans were sending ethan uninvited nudes on every social media platform and people were tweeting hateful things about us as an interracial couple. one of the most hurtful tweets was somewhere along the lines of golden boy ethan deserves better ― go back to china to pick rice, amber. but that was only one of hundreds of awful comments that people posted in hopes of driving a wedge between us ― or just to be cruel. we had to be the bigger people and understand that being in a public relationship means our communication is that much more important.
my boyfriend and i met through mutual friends, officially at a party but unofficially via cyber-stalking. his opening line was, i added you on facebook so now we're friends. he informed me, much later, that he had already seen my instagram account, which functioned as my stripping advertisement page. it flaunted everything from my playboy photos to twerking videos to a vice documentary about exotic dancing that i was featured in.
after i got engaged to staci, we had a conversation about how it wasn't fair that only she gets to wear an engagement ring. we were on a hiking trip in utah when i proposed, and before our flight back home, we were killing time in las vegas and stumbled into a jewelry store. next thing you know, i had a ring too!
on facebook, nelson's girlfriend, maria roberts, was critical of how the school treated her partner, saying that this is not how god would treat someone.
carrying in the groceries, making the bed, navigating technology disasters, juggling too many things on your to-do list ― even if there's no help to be had, it feels good to know someone is there if you need them, marriage and family therapist winifred m. reilly said.
basu has been witness to the friction hair can cause in families. i've seen friends who wanted to get a particular cut or color their hair. but they couldn't, because they were afraid of what their mother-in-law would think. they'd have to discuss it with their husbands, take their permission. i remember asking a friend if her husband would ever think twice before getting a haircut, coloring his hair or joining the gym. recently one of my closest friends got a really short haircut. she was excited about it, but her brother got pretty upset even though he has absolutely nothing to do with her lifestyle.
even if you're not able to change this person's mind, you might feel better if you voice your frustrations.
at one point i pulled a producer aside and said i wanted to go home. i didn't think i was cut out for reality tv and i felt completely over my head.
all those feelings i'd had growing up feeling neglected and insignificant came back to me in spades. i was in the midst of doing step work i noticed glaring example after glaring example of me hiding behind powerful bosses, celebrities and men. i had been eclipsing myself by bright lights for a long time. i came to the realization that the only illumination i needed or wanted was god's and with his help, i could shine brilliantly on my own.
with social media and all of our hyper-connectivity, it's inevitable that people will feel like they're not good enough, that they don't have enough, that they're not doing enough, she said. how can we not feel this way when we're constantly being exposed to what everyone else is doing or, more accurately, carefully choosing to showcase? this type of constant comparison can actually fuel feelings of loneliness and isolation, which is why it can be important to step away and take a break from time to time to recalibrate.
kelly's move instantly drew praise from national lgbt-rights groups. it came after new democratic governors in michigan and wisconsin issued such orders, as well as ohio's new gop governor.
tipping the scale to have more positive thoughts in your day can work wonders for your mind and overall health. here are 14 toxic thoughts that experts say you need to banish if you want to be happier:
priscilla: the other character introduced later in the show is nadia's abusive, mentally unstable mother, played to unhinged perfection by a redheaded chloe sevigny. after nadia begins hallucinating her younger self, we see flashbacks of young nadia experiencing trauma at the hands of her mother. in one particularly disturbing scene, sevigny smashes all the mirrors hanging in their apartment, which is teeming with watermelons. what were your thoughts on young nadia's appearance in the show? and what's your take on the scene where nadia finally rids herself of these visions?
heading into gigli, lopez had more than enough commercial fortune. but she needed to get critics back on her side. that's where an unfinished life comes in. on paper, the midbudget drama had ample oscar-bait hallmarks, including the backing of now-disgraced miramax honcho harvey weinstein and a stripped-down role that seemed ideal for an actress asking to be taken seriously.
i didn't know what that song was really about then — or what it meant to be sexy — but from the time i was little, i've always had a big personality. i was really friendly and i would walk up to just about anyone and engage them. flirty isn't the right word to describe it — i was just a completely open kid who loved to smile and put on a show.

but the researchers say the theory doesn't tend to hold up to statistical examination ― and the covid-19 crisis is obviously far more disruptive and longer-lasting than those two examples.
a visit to a police station in mani results in commentary on fear and how we express it facially; a found issue of a literary magazine leads to an aside about the merits of economical writing. kitamura's narrator is a translator, and the book's style reflects her interest in deliberateness. of a poorly written advertisement, she writes, the copywriter had no ear to speak of ― why, for example, somewhat stale rather than simply stale?
on tuesday, the senate confirmed allison jones rushing, 36, to the u.s. court of appeals for the 4th circuit. she worked for the anti-lgbtq group alliance defending freedom and has argued that there were moral and practical reasons for banning same-sex marriage. on wednesday, the senate confirmed chad readler, 46, to the same court as murphy. readler played a leading role in the trump administration's efforts to dismantle obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.
the bill, if passed, would be the first outright ban on conversion therapy in australia. other states have come under pressure to adopt the same ban and the state of victoria began public consultation on a proposed law in october.
i used to hula hoop as a child but had forgotten what a relaxing and fun physical activity it was, she said. i also introduced my husband to hula hooping, so we would go outside together during the working day and had some hilarious, shared moments together.

my co-host stacie and i actually hold fast to the controversial hot take that people split up for a reason, and should probably stay that way, she said. in our episode on this whole sorry jen-brad-angelina spectacle, i had a very personal message for jen as she and brad revived their friendship post-angelina: don't do it!

the entrepreneurial lifestyle is suited to younger people. most entrepreneurs in their 20s have not taken on any major life responsibilities such as mortgages, children or marriage. the time it takes to create and establish a successful business means people with children and other responsibilities can struggle to manage it all. having no real commitments means you're able to focus solely on your business.

despite all the talk of our chosen families, gay men have fewer close friends than straight people or gay women. in a survey of care-providers at hiv clinics, one respondent told researchers: it's not a question of them not knowing how to save their lives. it's a question of them knowing if their lives are worth saving. i'm not going to pretend to be objective about any of this. i'm a perpetually single gay guy who was raised in a bright blue city by pflag parents. i've never known anyone who died of aids, i've never experienced direct discrimination and i came out of the closet into a world where marriage, a picket fence and a golden retriever were not just feasible, but expected. i've also been in and out of therapy more times than i've downloaded and deleted grindr. marriage equality and the changes in legal status were an improvement for some gay men, says christopher stults, a researcher at new york university who studies the differences in mental health between gay and straight men. but for a lot of other people, it was a letdown. like, we have this legal status, and yet there's still something unfulfilled. this feeling of emptiness, it turns out, is not just an american phenomenon. in the netherlands, where gay marriage has been legal since 2001, gay men remain three times more likely to suffer from a mood disorder than straight men, and 10 times more likely to engage in suicidal self-harm.
my sister said, you are so good together.
chad readler, 46, is up for a seat on the u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit. he filed a brief on behalf of the trump administration in favor of striking down the affordable care act's pre-existing coverage requirement. he has also defended efforts to weaken voting rights and defended trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military.

in the heights of romance, your loved one can do no wrong. they are without fault. as time goes on, the habits that you found charming when you first met become irritating. his spontaneity, or her need to be well organized, start to drive you crazy.
by 2015, mary was 29 and living in maryland with her husband. she had seen three different doctors and even a reiki healer for the pain she experienced during sex. her menstrual cramps were also getting worse, to the point that she was falling over from the pain or vomiting during her period.
at first things didn't feel any different, as we had already lived together and had been dating for nine years before we got married. but a few months in is when i noticed a bit of a change. it seems obvious, but we simply hold more responsibility toward one another now. we're both fairly independent people, so making all these major decisions together, like merging bank accounts and logistically talking about where we want to live in the next three to five years, has opened the doors to what true communication and compromise means (not like the old days of talking in hypotheticals or deciding what ben & jerry's flavor to eat that night). compromise has been the biggest, hardest and most rewarding difference. - angela, married six months

it's been nice because now we know how to do everything and we're not coming down on each other, rachel told kveller.com. now, when there's something to put away, instead of, 'i'm going to wait for him to do it,' or 'i'm going to wait for her,' it's like, 'i'm just going to put this away because it makes me feel better.'
this can also be true if the connections you are making feel very surface-level and not fulfilling, quazi added. this disconnection may feel as though it is never-ending. she said you may feel misunderstood as well.
this tacit admission of guilt by the nfl should make christians who still enjoy watching grown men smash into each other with a ferocity that leaves bodies and minds damaged for life squirm, and question their continuing loyalty to the sport.
chris pratt revealed in a 2009 interview that he knew soon after meeting his now-ex-wife anna faris that he 'wanted to marry her pretty soon' after he met her. 'it took a while for me to admit it, because it would be crazy to be like, i want to marry you' the first day i met her. but i could have!' turns out, that kind of certainty doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship is built to last. it may be an indicator, instead, that this person feels familiar, like old patterns, old obsessions and old problems. if you want someone who brings out the best in you, that might not be the person who fits like an old glove. it might be healthier in the beginning of a relationship to feel uncertain and tenuous about the new person in your life. ― liat sadler, a specialist in family law in san francisco
prime minister micheal martin's apology came a day after the final report of an inquiry said 9,000 children died in 18 mother-and-baby homes — which housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage — during the 20th century. the inquiry was part of a process of reckoning in overwhelmingly roman catholic ireland, where church-run institutions were often tied to a history of abuse.
almost was the first poem i had written in over ten years. i used to write a lot of poetry, but in college, after churning out some pretty bland ones, i took a break; i think i realized i had too little to write about at the time. when my husband deployed in 2011, i was a new bride with my whole life ahead of me, but i was lonely and bored. i was teaching at a university but was off for the summer; i was working on a novel that seemed to have dead-ended. i took a poetry class at a local writing center because i wanted to find another creative outlet. i still remember sitting on my balcony on a very hot day, looking at the speck of ocean in the distance, and thinking about what it would have been like to have chosen a different, safer life, one that took me back to the small town in new jersey where i grew up. the life i had almost lived. by the end of writing it, i realized that the life i really wanted was the one i already had.
the approvals are legal: the immigration and nationality act does not set minimum age requirements. and in weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, u.s. citizenship and immigration services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives.

for those who don't know, the beauty queen of leenane is the first of mcdonagh's leenane trilogy. (the others are the lonesome west and a skull in connemara.) these plays along with the aran island trilogy (the lieutenant of inishmore, the cripple of inishmaan and the still-unproduced the banshees of inisheer) were all written in the early 1990s, mostly in mcdonagh's extremely fertile 1994.

the oscar-winner admitted she felt bitter after the breakup, but explained, i was trying to remember how it was i felt at the beginning of the relationship that inspired that record because as bad as a breakup can be, as bitter and horrible and messy as it can be, that feeling when you first fall for someone is the best feeling on earth, and i am addicted to that feeling.
yet, some members of the committee said they would never have endorsed a database as intrusive as the social registry appears today.
people whose parents split up might fret more about their serious relationship dissolving ― perhaps seemingly out of nowhere. that's because our view of commitment may be altered by the divorce, according to jane greer, a new york-based marriage and sex therapist.
i didn't understand his depression or his wanting to die. i wondered if i was in any way to blame, but we continued our relationship. we struggled, broke up, got back together, had terrible fights and broke up again. one of us would always return with some grand gesture — quoting love songs, makeup sex, tears, and then finally, laughter ― and things would be ok again for a while. it was volatile, but we were 19, 20, 21 years old. we were essentially babies when it came to relationships. we didn't know what we didn't know about ourselves, each other, the world around us, or love.
her business collapsed and so did her confidence. she died penniless. this didn't have to be her fate.
when there's hope that love is possible for a once-shattered marriage like brad and jennifer's, there's this fairytale-like feeling that happily ever after is possible for all of us, she said. we all think that what's happening to hollywood couples is happening to us. we think to ourselves, 'if they can get through it, maybe i can, too!'

disagreements don't mean your relationship is suddenly on the line, said gary john bishop, a personal development expert and author of unfu*k yourself: get out of your head and into your life.
grief from the authentic self does not include anger and fear. it is a deep sadness about no longer being able to give love and share love with the departed loved one. you miss this person, not just because of what he or she gave to you, but because you can no longer share your love in person. while you can certainly continue to send love to the departed loved one, it is not the same as sharing love in person, and so there is deep sadness and heartbreak.

the protocol has the potential to unshackle the church from our decades of infighting and allow us to seek justice for queer people, people of color, and to correct our neocolonial us-centric governance structure, warren wrote in an email.
asmaureen, tall, fit, wired o'sullivan is an upright battering ram. alternately giving mother mag as good (as bad?) as she gets at times and tied in metaphorical knots at other times, she has a toolbox full of hard looks to aim at her tormenter. it's a gallant show, maybe no more gallant than in her final undone moments.
she was forcibly married at 13 in pakistan and applied for papers for her 26-year-old husband to come to the country.
our over-identification with the celebrity ends up causing personal discomfort, and because we have elevated them to having achieved such enviable success, it can sometimes be more troubling to us when they fail than when people in our lives that we actually know and have relationships with fail, henderson said.
it's incredibly difficult for me to enjoy my own accomplishments. before i started therapy, a setback in my business didn't mean i made a human mistake that i could learn from, it meant i was worthless. deep down, that's how i felt. and when my business was succeeding, i hid my success because i felt no one could give two shits.

getting regular reminders that your partner is still super attracted to you ― yep, even after all this time ― feels pretty great. you don't need to shower each other in mushy-gushy compliments all day long (unless you're into that!), but getting a little comment about how awesome you look in those pants can put some extra pep in your step.
the first lady — a divorcee herself — also reveals what she looks forward to when covid-19 clears up and explains why women should take time for themselves every day, as she does. she spoke during an interview with clarkson that is set to air nationally on thursday.
khloe kardashian can't catch a break.
divorce lawyers hear some pretty crazy stories and we know what destroys relationships. knowing what destroys them gives us a window into how to nurture and preserve our partnerships. on the other hand, we also know how to protect ourselves and our assets and that could be pretty scary if things weren't going so well.
we originally planned to get married on oct. 12, 2020, at st. paul's united methodist church in northport, new york, and our reception was going to be held at flowerfield celebrations in st. james, new york. we anticipated having approximately 180 guests join us.
if it is a parent who died, the remaining child might have secretly hoped to finally get the love he or she never got from the parent as a child. the person might feel furious at the parent for dying without finally coming through with the desired love. this often occurs when people have not been a loving adult and learned to give themselves the love that they always hoped someone else would give to them.

the more i fought, the angrier he got, she told the jury. the disgraced film mogul is facing five felony sexual assault charges, which stem from multiple allegations from mann and weinstein's former assistant miriam haley.
i decided to reach out to the hearnes — photographers i have been following on instagram for years — on a whim. i figured at that point i had nothing to lose and expected them to be completely booked. i felt tied to getting married on sept. 26 specifically. after having that date in my mind for so long, i was hesitant to move to a new date. our photographer, abbi, reached out to me and told me sept. 26 was the only date in september 2020 that they actually still had available so it felt like it was meant to be. shortly thereafter, we booked the hearnes, called our parents, and told them we were eloping in moab, utah, a place neither of us had ever been before. we went back and forth about whether we would elope alone or whether our parents and siblings would come. i felt strongly that i did not want them traveling and placing their health at risk but they insisted on coming. so our seven immediate family members flew to moab to watch our socially distanced ceremony.

corrin's castmate olivia coleman and fellow nominees laura linney and sarah paulson were clearly very happy for the young actor when she won. both paulson and coleman even broke out into little dances:
forgiveness is not just for those who have trespassed against us. we must also be willing to extend an olive branch to ourselves for our own trespasses. let 2016 be the year that you walk in total freedom from guilt, shame and blame. stop reliving your mistakes. stop replaying those memories. you cannot change the past. but you can live with it and learn from it. forgive yourself. let it go. move on and make it part of your life story. god has forgiven you. he loves you. end of story. psalm 103 tells us that god is merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. learn to love yourself enough to forgive and make it a daily occurrence in 2016.

i'm a collector of many things, but nothing is more fun to collect than lego sets. there are sets from dozens of nostalgic movies ranging from indiana jones to back to the future available. you can even find lego versions of shows and cultural experiences as specific as the big bang theory and the beatles' yellow submarine. to add to the collectability, the lego company produces each set for only a limited time, and they never reproduce the same set number twice. as a result, they're highly valuable to collectors both monetarily and also in terms of the thrill we get in trying to hunt down the rarest limited edition sets.

communication with our daughter became a top priority, especially because soon both of her parents would start seeing other people. so my daughter and i started having weekly meetings. we would go to her favorite pastry shop, and she would have her notebook and i would have my notebook and we would both design an agenda. we talked about mundane things like school, what she wanted for lunch for the week, my work schedule, school pickup and nights at grandma's place.

the person whose calls you always take, that's the relationship you're in, says nate, andy's aggrieved boyfriend, after she takes miranda's call in the middle of a fight. with a boss who demands her personal time, it's no wonder that andy experiences burnout symptoms that are exacerbated by having friends and a lover who don't support her new career choice.

if your goal is to get an individual to change their ways, shaming them is unlikely to be effective. it often leads to defensiveness, which can make people double-down on their behavior to 'prove' that their actions are justified, delawalla added.
scholastic publishers evidently thought united states school children needed a new picture book to help them celebrate george washington's birthday. unfortunately the book also seems to celebrate slavery in the united states and has now been recalled. the book is narrated by an enslaved african young girl named delia. images show happy slaves baking george washington a birthday cake. one panel announces that hercules, a slave, takes great pride in baking the president's cake. but this year there is one problem -- they are out of sugar. but evidently that was not the only problem in the new nation.

do the bishops want to join in this work of seeking the common good, or do they want to be a stumbling block to it? she asked.
i'm learning about myself as well and have developed a sense of confidence and self-contentment that i never before thought possible. my obsessive need for self-care that i had been clinging to for years as a coping mechanism for anxiety and self-loathing is finally, bit by bit, transforming into self-love. in experiencing sex and intimacy outside my marriage, i'm becoming a freer, more actualized sexual being. i feel more comfortable physically exploring and being vulnerable, and am able to bring what i've learned back into the proverbial marriage bed to strengthen our primary bond. through the compassionate eyes of others, both new lovers and old friends, i see now that i have value and am on the cusp of no longer needing that external validation to know my worth.

research suggests that most couples wait six years after trouble emerges before they ask for help. we also know that most couples who divorce do so within the first seven years. so therapists know when you're coming in later than you should have. the average couple lives with unhappiness for far too long. ― zach brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forbetter

a year ago, we were planning vacations and comparing airbnbs with our friends and family to plan for our future fun. but for almost a year now, there has been no planning, no fun, no future that we feel safe counting on, maenpaa said. many of us haven't been able to even think about what travel or adventure looks like because we are stuck in our own four walls. it makes total sense then that we have turned that same planning eye to the one thing we can control right now, which is what those four walls could look like.

people assured me i was going to miss this newborn stage. meanwhile, all i kept praying was for my baby to grow. for him to not be a fragile newborn anymore! i was counting down the days before he could have his first set of vaccines that offered some sort of protection. yet when that day came, i broke down in tears wondering if i had made the right decision. all the warnings i had seen on social media came rushing in. had i not read the vaccine inserts enough? what if i was injecting my baby with poison? i began recording him on my phone while he slept to have a doctor evaluate his breathing for any possible adverse reaction.
i've been playing competitive tennis for six years and i've never been able to shut her up. she's just so quick. she starts insulting me before i even start playing. pre-match, without fail, when my opponent politely asks, would you like to back up to the baseline and warm up? debbie downer pipes up and says, no i'm not ready because i don't know how to play tennis.
i get it. it's a response i've grown accustomed to. a grown man that collects a child's toy is weird to some and just plain creepy to others. i've been so embarrassed by this hobby that one time i even lied to a lego store employee and told him that i was looking for their newest marvel set because my son can't get enough of iron man. except i have no son. i'm a father of three daughters ― and i'm pretty sure they have no idea who iron man is.
there is something magnetic about being unapologetically yourself. that's when my boyfriend appeared, taking me on real dates and shelving sex until we got to know each other first.

studies show that children tend to be better behaved if their parents combine warmth with clear and consistent rules and boundaries. for some, this means recognizing that empty threats may have worked when sara was nine, but no longer work at thirteen.
times are changing. there are cultural changes as well. since times have changed, it is time to think about marriage and priesthood as well, if there are priests and nuns who want to get married, they should.
recently, a customer service rep offered me this option: drive to a company store to authenticate my husband's account, bring his driver's license, social security number, death certificate and our marriage license. for real. oh, and then call him back because i clearly must have plenty of time on my hands. mind you, they are still billing my credit card while giving me the run-around.
the reason why conversations about money end in raging arguments or stony, resentment-hoarding silences is simple, according to bishop: survival. when it comes to money, or the lack thereof, we all too quickly descend into our most base, fight-or-flight selves.

for some of us, nothing piques the interest quite like knowing how many people the person we're boinking has boinked before. (try saying that 10 times fast.) it's not only a fun topic, but one that can bring you closer together and help you understand how you relate to each other as sexual partners, said megan negendank, a psychotherapist and sex therapist in sacramento, california.

yes, some mormons shun family members in an attempt to get them to reconsider a choice to leave. but there are more important, subtler problems with leaving. leaving mormonism can mean leaving the certainty of having instant friends wherever you move, as well as specific financial assistance in hard times, from direct funds from fast offerings in the local ward to food from the bishop's storehouse, not to mention the uncountable hours spent helping ward members clean houses, mow lawns, paint, shovel snow, babysit children, and even move out of the ward boundaries geographically.
the difference between the masters of relationships and the disasters is the master's focus on what they have, while the disasters focus on what is missing in their partner and overlook the good enough qualities that are there. the disasters take the qualities in their partner and themselves for granted.
the idea of separation seemed foregone, logical, natural even. but extensive therapy and time with thoughtful, open-minded friends (some of whom possess decidedly unorthodox relationship arrangements) slowly nudged me out of my misery. i began to tentatively question the ideologies i had been acculturated into, and to wonder about the very nature of sex and love and relationships.

in my opinion, breakups are more difficult for men during this time because they don't have access to an emotional support system, she told huffpost. men usually rely on their female partners for their emotional support, so when their partner or spouse breaks up with them, it is an incredible loss that isn't easily replaced.

two christmases and two birthdays may seem like a sweet deal, but they also require a lot of coordination. we worry about this the first time we bring our significant other home because it can get a little hectic and we don't want it to scare them away. but trust us, the reward of spending time with so many people (and the food and presents, of course) is worth it in the end.

sadaf is exceptional in many ways, said varma. things that people accept, a bad marriage or injustice at work — people say arre thoda sa adjust kar lo, arre udhar mat dekho bus apna kaam karo — she cannot do that. when it comes to her beliefs, she is uncompromising. she chooses to do the right thing over comfort and convenience.

as for warren, her clear corollary on weber's season was iowa native kelsey weier, who had a rocky start, unabashedly clashed with other contestants, scored a series of conversations with weber that demonstrated their mutual affection, said she was falling in love with weber (which she admitted, seemingly sincerely, she had not expected to happen), made it to the final four (aka hometown dates), and was then, fairly unexpectedly, dumped during a rose ceremony at an airplane hangar.
cheating is any break in the emotional and/or physical integrity of a committed intimacy. unless a couple has established rules for allowing emotional and/or physical intimacy outside the primary relationship, any kind of breach of it is breaking the promise of monogamous fidelity. that said, there are alternatives to monogamy that work well for many people. the central component of every relationship is boundaries and the clear definition of them. this is no different for alternative relationships (polyamory, etc.). negotiating rules and defining boundaries are essential to every type of intimacy. ― eileen de freest, writer

perhaps most beautifully, though, i'm remembering the gratitude and love that drove me to marry my husband in the first place. more and more, we're returning from our individual sexual experiences with a newfound appreciation for, and desire to be with, one another. in its finest moments, this experience has been a reminder, to both of us, to not take each other for granted, a notion that i would have thought counterintuitive before living it.
even though this phrase begins with the words, 'i'm sorry,' it is not a real apology. it does not take ownership of any wrongdoing. it does not communicate remorse for your actions, and it does not express any empathy towards the other person's feelings. instead, it may imply that you think the other person is being irrational or overly sensitive. try to understand and take responsibility for how your actions or words hurt the other person, saying something like, 'i'm sorry that i canceled our plans at the last minute. it was inconsiderate of your time and i understand why you are angry at me.' ― gina delucca, clinical psychologist at wellspace sf

after the wedding ceremony, most couples are excited about the reception. the stress of the wedding day is behind them and it's time to have fun and relax. couples normally spend the evening greeting guests, dancing the night away, and celebrating their new marital status. when a couple separates to talk to guests or leaves the other alone on the dance floor for hours at a time, it always raises concerns. i have photographed an entire reception and only captured a handful of images of the the couple together ― that's a very bad sign. ― gretchen wakeman

the first night that i was there, i went up to the carrie's room in the main house and we got into bed together, watched old movies, ate ice cream and chain-smoked cigarettes. we did that most of the nights. i felt a real soul connection with carrie, we both commented on it. we would literally finish each other's sentences. we talked about our gay ex-husbands, our mothers (who were scarily similar), our fears, sex and writing. we had a true kinship and bond, which helped me tremendously with my sobriety. i didn't feel so painfully alone anymore--in fact, i felt like i was truly a part of life, the close friend of carrie fisher, a far cry from the anesthetized mess i'd been before.

we need to let go of the scarlet letter burned into sex workers that cuts us off from society and the embrace of our partners' friends and families, let alone those potential partners. it's killing us, between the stigma and the resulting violence against sex workers. and even if you're not a sex worker, you're hurt too by the patriarchal control that insists a relationship amounts to ownership of a woman. let's overthrow it.

the elite indian wedding, therefore, is not simply an ostentatious celebration involving an unabashed display of money and taste. it is about competition, conservatism, and assertion of power. it is nothing less than the coronation ceremony of an elite status.

the news that karen pence, wife of vice president mike pence, is teaching at d.c.-area school that openly bans lgbt+ faculty and students ― and any manner of pro-lgbt+ belief or affiliation ― seemed to generate a lot of surprise among my peers. not a surprise that the nation's second lady would work there, but that such a school would exist — right in liberal northern virginia!

on its surface, the justice for victims of lynching act isn't about queer rights. the bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. according to the naacp, lynching was used after the civil war to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. at least 4,742 people, predominantly african-americans, were reportedly lynched in america from 1882 to 1968.

fox news host tucker carlson on wednesday lamented about what his show's chyron described as men in decline. during one segment, he claimed there was more drug and alcohol abuse and higher incarceration rates in areas where women earn more money than their male counterparts.
curiously, that narrative can also be applied to the contemporary democratic party. during the finale of delta pilot peter weber's season of the bachelor on tuesday night, primary results for six states began to roll in — and it struck me how much weber's season has, improbably, mirrored the 2020 democratic primary.

in 2015, i moved from colorado to seattle in search of a new life. within a year, i was homeless. with no college degree and limited schooling, i only qualified for jobs doing physical labor. i worked at a grocery store deli while sleeping in a car. i showered at a gym and changed into my uniform in the bathrooms of other grocery stores. while i was living in a car, i lost my entire blog and the hundreds of posts i had published, because i couldn't afford to pay the web hosting renewal fee.

and so, last august, my husband and i got married in beautiful mammoth lakes –- a destination wedding in the sierra nevada mountains of california that reflected our love of the great outdoors. to properly honor our chinese heritage and to make the travel worthwhile for our guests, i insisted that we do the traditional chinese tea ceremony and a 10-course dinner banquet the day before our actual wedding. we rented a rustic, raw space, hired the best chinese restaurant we could find in the area to cater and planned for an evening of dance and musical performances.
while marriage equality advocates have made significant gains in less than two decades, global surveys indicate that in much of the world, homophobia and transphobia are pervasive. in some places, like indonesia, egypt and chechnya, these attitudes and subsequent crackdowns on lgbtiq people are intensifying. in 2017 alone, hundreds of lgbtiq individuals worldwide were harassed, arrested, detained and tortured.

as unbelievable as it sounds, baume says, the show's portrayal of lgbtq life showed surprising sensitivity, especially for a time when queer characters were rarely seen in mainstream sitcoms. (mcmurray and castellenata also played a gay couple in recurring skits on the tracey ullman show, which ran from 1987 to 1990.)

watching a few episodes of schitt's creek together may be one of your favorite ways to unwind after a long day — and that's perfectly ok. but your netflix habit becomes an issue when all of that sacred time before bed is spent zoning out in front of the tv (or staring at your smartphone), instead of doing something that allows you to actually be present and connect with each other.

the piece opens with a scene at a philadelphia hair salon, where women getting ready for a kelly concert are discussing his rumored marriage.
author and activist kevin powell was a senior writer at quincy jones' vibe magazine when the publication printed kelly and aaliyah's marriage certificate in 1995. i interviewed aaliyah first for the publication, and i remember her sounding deeply connected to r. kelly in a way i thought was not right, given she was a minor and he an adult, about my age, powell wrote in an email to huffpost. i mentioned that fact to folks at vibe and to the best of my recollection we were the ones who published their marriage certificate first, and talked about the marriage being annulled.
until now, no first lady has kept her job once her husband reached the white house ― even when that meant leaving behind a hard-built career, like obama who left a leadership position at the university of chicago medical center to enter the white house. any future first gentleman keeping their job would mean juggling work with first spouse duties, and could also pose a challenge to ensure there are no conflicts of interest with their private sector work.

when people consider this question, i believe it depends on where they are and how they feel about their impending divorce. for many people, it's the end of a dream and a future with someone that they wholeheartedly believed they would grow old together with. and, for many people, the new beginning part doesn't come until a significant amount of time has passed.
gigli is a jennifer lopez movie as much as it's a movie about the idea of jennifer lopez. arriving 15 minutes in, she whips around to introduce her glammed face in close-up — the kind of entrance only a dazzling dignitary can make. lopez has the swagger to play a gangster type, but gigli channels it through scenes as overcooked as the sensual vagina monologue that she spouts while doing yoga. still, she runs circles around affleck, always sure how long to pause before nailing a punchy line or when to arch her back to elicit a laugh. together, they are so devoid of chemistry that one has to wonder what their actual relationship looked like behind closed doors.
this type of thinking can quickly impair your ability to succeed in the workplace and within your personal relationships. lynn whitbeck, the founder of online women's career mentoring site petite2queen.com, has developed the acronym yass to help her clients overcome a case of feeling not good enough:
the mandela united football club used its political protection to undertake a reign of terror in soweto, and the lid was blown wide open when 14-year-old stompie seipei died after falling out with the rest of the crew. it was believed that seipei had been kidnapped and tortured by the club, along with three other young people. at trial, madikizela-mandela herself was sentenced to five years imprisonment related to those events, a punishment that was later commuted to a lesser sentence.

discussing no man in particular, paltrow told the therapist: in the past, i've been in relationships with men who had intimacy issues, so i could be, like, 'i'm fine, i'm ready to do this,' and let myself think he's the one with the problem. in a way, some of the relationships were designed to keep me out of intimacy.

if you were sick of being single in before times, the pandemic might have exacerbated your forever alone-ness. if you've disliked living at home with your parents, even the smallest of studio apartments sounds ultra appealing right now. if you couldn't deal with your company's abysmal work-life boundaries, you might be tempted to take a pay cut at nearly any place else to escape.
another smart diversion tactic, according to smith, is to thank your parent for doing such a good job raising you. complimenting them may be the last thing that you want to do after they criticize you, but this compliment is a bit self-serving: by giving them credit for teaching you how to make your own decisions (and learn from any potential mistakes), you're telling them they can relax and let you take the wheel.
when do you find your inner debbie downer being the meanest? is it in a certain place: at work, in the carpool loop, at church? or at a certain time: during your morning commute, while you're getting ready for date night, when you're exhausted? or when you're with certain people: your exercise buddies, your boss, your sister-in-law? awareness is half the battle.
it only costs $80 to get legally married in philadelphia where we live. no big deal. a wedding, though? prices can get pretty outrageous. and neither of us have parents who could help pay for the event. sure, we could have our moms make the food, brew our own beer, and thrift all the decorations. but even a wedding on an extreme budget costs money and time.

it is likely to fuel renewed anxiety about the wisdom of benedict's decision to call himself emeritus pope, rather than merely a retired bishop, and the unprecedented situation he created by deciding to live in the vatican gardens and wear the white cassock of the papacy.
there is no reason to be joined at the hip. it is healthy to have your own interests and balance 'me' time with 'we' time. if you are always making your partner feel guilty for being an individual separate from you, then this is very selfish. ― feuerman
the couple, who married on june 17, 1977, also touched on joe biden's catholic faith ― which the president equated to meditation ― and the surreal experience of re-entering the white house after having spent so much time in it when he served as vice president in barack obama's administration.
says zimmerman, you must know yourself at the core of who you are. this means honoring your values, what's most important to you, and your boundaries. keeping a strong sense of what makes you you, says zimmerman, will make sure you stay true to who you are, maintaining your self-confidence and self-worth. and when you're confident and know your worth, the energy you radiate is extremely appealing and irresistible to your partner.
insurance companies also feed into the 45- or 50-minute session standard, as they base reimbursement on the type and length of therapy. a common billing code is 90834, which denotes 45 minutes of individual psychotherapy but can be used for sessions ranging from 38 to 52 minutes.

little 'thank yous' every day can go even further than the most romantic poetry, marriage and family therapist spencer northey said. some of my clients have initially thought it might seem mundane or redundant to say 'thank you' to their partner for things that are daily expectations in the relationship, such as taking out the trash, taking care of the kids, tidying up, and basic things like that. the reality is that this habit of acknowledging the little things you do for each other and the household maintains a sense of appreciation for each other.
and in the midst of all that, my grandmother got sick, and i watched my grandfather do all of the hardest things. the taking care and the letting go. never once in those last days did he try to control her pace as she drifted. he just left a sacred space between them for her to do what she needed to do in order to walk on.
i remember a couple of times turning around and going back home because i — you know, it was a small town, she said. i got really, really cold and would get home and be crying. and mother would, you know, she would try to warm me up and tell me it would be all right and everything.

i didn't feel any different as a woman who was dating to becoming a woman who was engaged and then to a woman who is now married. my husband feels the same way. but, we did feel a much broader effect on our relationship. there's an awareness that, moving forward as we go through life, we're in this together as a team, no matter the circumstance. it's not a change we felt overnight or in our daily interactions, but an overall feeling. - rachel (a different one), married two and a half years

i am hoping to find my way, and it all keeps coming back to one thing: love. i witnessed love the day of my sister's wedding and every time i have been with them since. my sister is happier and healthier than she has ever been, and that has fundamentally changed me ― and the way i view religion. she is someone who i know i can always go to with any problems i face in my life and will be met with endless love and compassion. and that is what i want to offer to her and all lgbt people. i want them to know they are always welcome in my heart and my home. my upbringing may have taught me that a homosexual lifestyle is wrong, but my life experience has changed my perception.
she created a game that serves as an ice-breaker to these conversations. money habitudes presents players with 54 different statements about money (for example: when i go shopping, i have to buy something or i will spend a lot of time and energy to get a better deal). the player decides whether he or she agrees or disagrees with each statement by sorting the cards into three piles: that's me; sometimes, it depends; and that's not me.

which brings us to barbara weber, the bachelor's mother, whose incredible reactions on the finale gave us something we so rarely get on the show: sass from people over 40. from the beginning of the season, previews of upcoming episodes included a dramatic clip of barbara weber begging her son, through tears, to bring her home. on monday, the first night of the two-part season finale, it became clear that she was talking about sluss. throughout the primary season, sanders received similarly passionate support from many voters under 40, who voted for him in disproportionately high numbers.

couples become gridlocked in issues because they feel the need to be right, said jess davis, an associate marriage and family therapist at wellspace sf. looking for a 'win' in an argument can feed a feeling of being stuck, and frustrations become hurdles. understanding that you're a team and can work as a unit can allow the couple to tackle the problem and not each other.
the important thing to keep in mind is that therapy is an ongoing conversation, and the real change happens when the clients practice what they learn in their lives outside the therapist's office. the focus should be on the skills and insights they gain during sessions and how they'll implement them ― not the length of the sessions.

they think, if my partner doesn't know what i need or show up in a particular way, it means xyz — e.g. they don't care about me or i'm not important, seely said. we fill in the gap with a negative assumption about our partner and how they feel about us. over time, this can drive a wedge between the couple.
we'd all feel a lot better if we let them happen, she said.
it was indefensible. and most important, i felt it was my fault for having such an ex. left with no other choice, i gave wayo an out by letting him know i did not blame him if he decided to run for the hills. crazy exes are justifiable deal killers. but that following year on valentine's day, wayo proposed to me in costa rica. the year after that, after i bungee jumped off victoria falls, we tied the knot in africa. but, unlike most married couples, we never moved in together. not yet, anyway.

i had a great role model in my father, he said. i saw him take on any overtime opportunity as a part of his commitment to his job. he even worked through vacations. covid to me was just an opportunity to serve more and take overtime like him. i'm seeing patients until midnight and it is because of that work ethic i was modeled.
how do you know if you're making a sound change or acting out of discomfort or uneasiness about pandemic? ask yourself: am i moving toward something or away from something? said dara bu elliott, a life and career coach at wellspace sf.
priscilla: oh, i learned so much. we should all be more experimental with our eyeliner, a la greta lee. and sometimes you need a buddy to pull you out of a bad spiral. growth can be about looking backward instead of forward. time is a flat circle. eating rotten fruit is ok if you're in a loop! and, most important, change is hard! that feeling of reflecting on yourself in a particular pattern or situation you hoped you would have outgrown by now. don't i know it!
jeffreys might have carried on in this vein forever, the down-home racist slinging crankshafts and crackpot ideas, a bigot indistinguishable from any other in the area. but one day while clicking through the comments on a yahoo news story, he spotted another reader's recommendation to check out a website called the daily stormer. so he did.

a profession that was once unique to advertising and magazine photography, the food stylist has become ubiquitous in hollywood over the past few decades. the job varies from project to project, but it's always multipronged. food stylists are historians, planners, cooks, designers, sometimes coaches and always problem solvers. because prop handlers used to be (and sometimes still are) responsible for anything edible on movie and television sets, many food stylists didn't set out to work in showbiz. but now that it's a fruitful, union-recognized position throughout the business, food budgets have boiled over. cuisine on-screen looks more detailed and delectable than ever.
i think many parents of adults suffer with feelings of irrelevancy and uselessness, and as a result make a practice of offering unsolicited advice and instruction in an effort to stay important to their children and family, smith told huffpost. they may also have a genuine belief that their own experiences mean they truly do know what's best.

viewers tell us that they prefer ads that are informative, relevant, and tailored to the environment in which they view them. the marriage of ad and program becomes most powerful when creative messages are customized for the platform, as hulu discovered when we tested sequential ad messaging: creative units that tell a story over the course of the program.
both betty and i saw in each other that we've always been criticized for being too aggressive, too male, ross said. whenever you know what you want, do what you want, like to have a fifth drink, like to have a good fuck, it's like, 'oh, you're a man.' i'm not a man. i'm a full woman.
it's an obvious red flag if they don't tell you they're married. yes, this happens. it's also bad if they don't tell you until late into the date or even the second or third date. then they explain that they're 'technically married but separated.' well, that means they're married. it's bad news. at a minimum, they are having trouble concluding their divorce, which means either they or their spouse (or both) is angry or fighting or incapable of reaching agreement. at a maximum, they are lying about being separated. ― kessler
as the event came together that saturday, i was enraptured watching my parents throughout the night. from the first few thumps on the drum, my mother's face lit up in delight as the lion dancers made their grand entrance for a daring bench routine. they clapped along enthusiastically to an upbeat tai chi dance choreographed by my friends from a college dance troupe. and as my husband's cousin performed a moving rendition of the butterfly lover's concerto, i could see my father's eyes welling up knowing too well why i had chosen this musical number.

vic certainly knows how to entertain, giving his audience tons to laugh at and enjoy. the show was everything expected from such a talent. dibitetto is wonderfully funny and fresh, never holding back but also does not attack anyone but his own outlook on his life and life around him. on stage dibitetto proudly states that he and lucy have known each other for 40 years before going off with his commentary about living as a husband and father. it is obvious how so relatable vic is to all as the audience burst with laughter and applause.
as a result of lucero and cannon's experience, the knot removed the venue's listing. last year, after the supreme court issued its limited ruling in favor of the masterpiece cakeshop, mike steib, ceo of the knot parent company the xo group, took to social media to reiterate the company's anti-discrimination policy, writing: our terms of service on the knot prohibit vendors in our marketplace from discriminating against couples based on their race, religion, or sexual orientation. when we learn that a vendor has violated these terms of service, we will remove the vendor's storefront and refund his or her money. we love our couples, and all of our couples deserve a marketplace free of unfair prejudice.

the refugee issue is not especially central for most voters, and american catholics are notorious for rejecting their leaders' guidance when it comes to morally-tinged political issues, whether that guidance tries to push them leftward or rightward, he said in an email. thus, you find large numbers of catholics (especially less devout ones) who support legal abortion, gay marriage, the death penalty, and restrictive immigration policies, despite church teachings to the contrary.

there are people who will watch the interview, listen to meghan's experience and her struggles, and still find ways to distort her reality into something that fits into a narrative of who they believe she is. this is what happens when people's lives become hypothetical and abstract, crunched down to tabloid headlines and two-hour tell-all specials that generate snappy tweets and think pieces but, ultimately, do little to heal the real-life struggles of the people baring all.
the death of someone you can't live without changes the course of your life from that point forward. you can't be the same, and your view of life beyond loss morphs you into a human being, that in many respects, you wish you could have been sooner. you become a human with superpowers of love, emotional depth and an awareness of life and it's cruel brevity of existence.

democrats retook control of the general assembly in november for the first time in a generation and have begun enacting sweeping policy changes. lawmakers noted that similar measures have been introduced in recent years but didn't survive in what was then a republican-controlled body.
and for those of us who are further along in our careers, it's equally important that we don't downplay our successes but instead be proud of working outside the home. not only are we role models for young professional women, we are the role models for our sons and daughters. in a 2015 study by kathleen l. mcginn, the cahners-rabb professor of business administration at harvard business school, mcginn found that women whose moms worked outside the home are more likely to have jobs themselves, are more likely to hold supervisory responsibility at those jobs, and earn higher wages than women whose mothers stayed home full time. men raised by working mothers are more likely to contribute to household chores and spend more time caring for family members. and, the findings hold true across 24 countries. there are very few things, that we know of, that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother, says mcginn.

in the early days of cinema, because film was black and white, the medium was much more forgiving, emily ferry explained. you could get away with a lot of stuff that you couldn't get away with once film became color. and then our food became — as a nation, as a world — much more multiethnic and much more complicated. in the '80s, when the food explosion in america happened, things got more specific.
i'd definitely do reality tv again, although it would have to be the right kind of show. the moment ethan and i became parents, we flipped a switch. nurturing our family and raising strong children is now our priority, and that means we'd stay far away from any show that entertains viewers with catty drama (which is, honestly, most of them). however, if a more family-oriented opportunity were to present itself (like dancing with the stars, the amazing race or something on hgtv), i think we'd be up for it.

lucknow, uttar pradesh — naheed varma was in college and her sister sadaf was in class 11 when communal riots erupted in ahmedabad in 1991. it was their first experience of communal violence, the sisters were shocked by the violence they witnessed in gujarat. the fear that naheed felt almost three decades ago has never left her.
marriage equality should be neither the only bar by which to measure the rights of lgbtiq people, nor for gauging how homophobic and transphobic a nation's policies and cultures are. bermuda is a clear example of that; in many ways, life for lgbtiq people is better there than in much of the world. the island has enacted laws prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and secures adoption and immigration rights for same-sex partners. clearly, these priorities outweighed marriage equality. while the reversal on marriage rights is cause for concern, we can also stand to learn from the country's many accomplishments.
honestly, i owe it all to my husband. after i was on reality tv, after that whole phase of my life was over, i really didn't want to do anything reality tv-related ever again. my husband is a producer and he works in development, and when i was in my first trimester i was really sick, really unhappy, and not that thrilled about my situation. and he said, whitney, i know this may not be something you want to do, but we have the camera. why don't we start filming what you're going through? because i feel like if you're going through this, you're not the first person. there has to be so many other people going through this.

contrary to the high hopes that obama's presidency would bring the country together, americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. the democratic party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the democrats. ... the republican party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star donald trump from new york, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave republicans the fighter they wanted. as a businessman, trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the united states and make it great again.' however, many conservatives were wary of trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by trump's choice for his running mate — indiana's conservative governor mike pence.
half a dozen local governments have enacted their own anti-lgbt bias policies, including two kansas city-area suburbs in december, but the williams institute, a think tank at ucla's law school focusing on sexual orientation and gender identity policy, said only 12 percent of kansas residents fall under them.

my former college roommate ― who came from dallas, texas ― used to make fun of the way i interacted with swedish friends, imitating with precision the way we frantically nod our heads in affirmation, interspersing a pendulum of singing sounds with bursts of ja ja ja (yes). the sole purpose of our conversations is unequivocal agreement, so they typically consist of vague and unfocused remarks so that they can always be given an accommodating turn if we sense an impending disagreement. otherwise, we refer to a reservoir of frivolous statements to fill any space that risks being taken for a pointed silence.
the pattern of answers can be a starting point for a constructive conversation about money, financial beliefs, and how those beliefs affect their lives and their relationships, solomon said.
deep down, you know that what it's saying isn't true. you're just having a hard time remembering it because the mean voice has been so vocal for so long. after hearing my own mean inner voice for 20 years and having heard thousands of mothers discuss their own debbie downers, there's one thing i know for sure: just because you can hear the voice, doesn't mean you have to listen.

i sat with the email for a while, shaking as i reading it over and over again. i appreciated his apology, but i was still angry so many years later and having a difficult time with our past suddenly being dredged up. my thoughts raced out of control as i tried to guess what caused him to reach out and apologize to me now, 20 years later. i wondered if he was in a recovery program and this was part of journey to heal or if he had recently been divorced and now wanted another chance at a relationship with me. i decided to reach out, gave him my number, and we began the long climb toward a much overdue reckoning.

when people used to tell me about how devastating infidelity could be, and what measures to take to prevent it, i took their advice with a grain of salt. such betrayal would certainly feel crushing, i knew, but surely it could be managed.
i agree that intellectual diversity is important to a true education. but if there are students who are being turned into snowflakes by their education, by mollycoddling parents and by teachers, then surely it's the millions of students who are attending schools that mandate limited viewpoints, adherence to ideology, and no exposure to true diversity.
but how is that going to help sara quit smoking weed on the weekends? i wondered.
most single moms complain about the challenges of finding time to date, and about the shitshow that is modern dating if they do manage to find the time. they talk about being lonely, or about how much falls on them. they talk about financial burdens, affordable childcare, not having anyone to call to grab groceries. these are all realities of single parenthood, and they are hard ― it's true for me, too. but by far, the biggest hurdle i've had to face is how it makes me feel to know i was the one who left my marriage, the one who gave up, who called it quits, who knew i was ready to move on.

while part of me would love to see the supposed liberal-fascist machine shut down schools like ics, that won't ever happen. religious schools are part of this country. so, instead, i would like to see them change from within. and that won't happen if we refuse to even talk about them. i'm glad we're talking about this school, and i'm glad people are being critical. now maybe the pences are the ones who will have to learn some resilience.

taylor swift has more bipartisan appeal, and is followed by eight house democrats and seven house republicans:
added nikki: for me it was a tough decision at first because my boyfriend john (cena, a professional wrestler and actor) and i had a talk about it. and we were kind of like, 'do we want put our private life out there?' john being so private, there was definitely discussion about that. at the end of the day, i know that people are gonna love me and they're gonna hate me but if women can relate to me and feel like they're not alone and learn from my mistakes then, to me, that's a reward, and i love what i do. but it wasn't like an immediate yes. it's definitely something i had to think about. and in the end, i feel i made the right decision and i have no regrets.
kardashian and odom's marriage was a main story line (and still is) on keeping up with the kardashians. khloe's struggle to conceive also factored into the family's reality show quote often. but looking back, kardashian says she realizes why she couldn't get pregnant. when you're high, you don't have strong swimmers, said the reality star of odom's drug use.

'cause that was scary to me! like, wait! i have to get rid of my place and move in ... like i said on the show, that's my sanctuary. i'm a loner. i love being in my space, having my music, just being weird, whatever. and so the thought of that was terrifying to me 'cause i was like, oh my god, this is a complete change. in a way, i felt like i was going to be uprooted even though that's not necessarily the truth. it's kind of like i was growing. i wasn't being uprooted. but i ended up getting rid of my place. of course, i kept it for three months after we got married because i still needed that. i needed that transition. i couldn't just go cold turkey. that's a lot for me. and cameron was super supportive with that too, so it was great.
when discussing protests against the iraq war and president george w. bush's low approval rating at the time, the abeka 11th-grade u.s. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in america was the media, supported by a large number of hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.

eventually, with no family barbecues or accidental chats in the grocery store lines, we decided we had to call our friends and let them know. it was awkward because what should have been a natural aside needed to be said so very intentionally. it felt like we were calling people to announce big news, which was in fact, just regular life. but one by one we reached out to people, blushing like teenagers. no one was surprised, and the predictability made me sting with embarrassment.

one of the things that many people think about is the kind of wife/husband they'd be. have you ever thought about that and it just scares you straight? it's like a forced, voluntary pressure to be the best at it, hands down. you want your spouse to think you're the best thing since slice bread and government cheese. you want them to desire you and never have eyes for another person. all of that translates into fear for some people. again, that voluntary pressure to be the best; to be perfect. thoughts flow through your mind such as what if i am not good enough... what if i get tired and want to give up... what if they just don't do it for me anymore and my eyes start drifting? these are real thoughts that some may think about when considering marriage. yet they still want it!

over the last four months i have experienced what it really feels like to be entirely cared-for by my husband. during our thirty-plus year marriage i have had to ask, and sometimes badger him to listen to what i need. but then last september when i suddenly became seriously ill, my relationship with my husband changed. he now listens more closely to what i need and sometimes he just knows without me having to ask. it is an amazing feeling to feel understood without having to explain myself. admittedly at first all this attention felt uncomfortable. but as i got used to it i realized that this is the normal i have been yearning for with my husband for a long time and i do not want to lose it. why shouldn't i be effortlessly understood? why shouldn't what i need be naturally present in my marriage, just like my husband's needs have been present from when we got married?

mark peterson via getty images rush limbaugh smoking a cigar while taping his radio show.
in the months before charles vallow's death, he had accused lori in divorce papers of needing psychiatric help. he said she was obsessed with near-death experiences and believed she had lived numerous lives on other planets before her current life.
decades before online extremists and pro-trump trolls used memes and ironic detachment to make their far-right beliefs seem less repugnant, limbaugh's employed the same strategy. he popularized cartoonish terms such as commie-libs and feminazi, while also claiming that abortion represented a modern day holocaust. he used mocking voices and affectations as he belittled women's rights, black activists and the gay community. his persona as an absurd blowhard gave audiences an excuse to brush off limbaugh's mainstreaming of far-right views as part of an act — just rush being rush, or el rushbo, as he was often called.

i think the plot lines are bananas. i think they're so extreme that they strain credulity, she said, laughing. you have to believe that a sane man, an adult, would say, 'oh, i'm just not going to have children so i can spite my father.' it only works if it's you with a glass of wine, kind of throwing yourself over to the world of romance. it's awkward to sit with someone else, knowing they're watching the same melodramatic story unfold, partaking in a pleasure that feels somewhat private, if not embarrassing. we all have these fan worlds that when they're exposed to other people that aren't a part of that world we might feel protective of, or feel bashful, she said.

we tend to think of sexual orientation as binary (heterosexual or homosexual), but these categories are socially constructed concepts that may speak to our general sexual desires but miss the nuance of our innate sexual fluidity and curiosity. when we fantasize about being sexual with someone of the same sex, we get to ponder what it would be like to be touched in ways that are both foreign and familiar (when we touch ourselves) and to break free from some of the gender assumptions that we normally enact. ―ian kerner, sex therapist and author of she comes first: the thinking man's guide to pleasuring a woman

whether it does damage to the relationship is found in the question of why they are sleeping apart: do both partners agree to it? is it temporary? becky whetstone, a marriage and family therapist, told huffpost.
the fix: sometimes what appears to be a need to be right is really just a desire to be heard and understood, davis noted. practice active listening: focus on what your partner is saying and then reflect back what you heard to show you see their position. if you're not sure, ask questions that demonstrate a desire to understand.

in the earliest days of the coronavirus, my mom underwent two-phase eye surgery at our local hospital. no extra precautions were taken when she went in for the first eye, but two weeks later when we returned for the second, screening signs were placed throughout the waiting area and news of the virus had overtaken the media. headlines played in a loop on the television mounted to the wall above the rows of chairs filled with patients and their family members. the tension was palpable.

for two years, we've lived under a president who has brutally assaulted lgbtq rights at every opportunity, after having seduced a complacent media into thinking that he'd evolved too and that he was actually more accepting on gay issues, as the new york times infamously put it. if we've learned anything, it's that we can't trust media narratives on the civil rights views of candidates — narratives often fed to reporters by the candidates themselves.
so it's official: the bidens' affection is totally real. it's in no way part of a slick pr campaign devised by cynical consultants determined to hide the president's senility by misdirection, he said, his voice rising a pitch and turning into a cackle. not at all! their love is as real as climate change.

he encourages me to fix up the house and make it a home for us and i am eager to do that. originally i would buy the items and we would split the costs... but when i asked for his half of the money he never had it, or would give it to me later. it would turn in to a scenario where i would have to start asking repeatedly, which i am very uncomfortable doing and is a major trigger for me from my past relationship (which he knows), and basically i would never get the money. so i stopped. i ask him for the money in advance. the problem is that he keeps saying he has no money and refuses to give me any. or he argues about the necessity of what i am doing (coat racks for all the winter gear for 6 people so it's not flung all over the living room!).

cameron: there was so much introspection going on throughout the whole process. and speaking on the guy's side, you might've thought that there would have been some competition. all of us were just talking about our emotions day in and day out when we weren't in the pod. you don't usually see that in your typical scenario, a bunch of men talking about how deeply they're falling for these different women. and so it was a beautiful thing and we all came out of it, like lauren said, changed.

the cause: let's be honest, when you're up at three every morning, covered in regurgitated formula and baby poop, looking sexy isn't top of your to-do list. but, for some couples, whether dad has chosen to not shave and forgo pants or mom opts not to wash the enfamil out of her hair, not taking care of your looks can trigger some unexpected issues. where the developmental need in courtship is to be attractive, as soon as you get into child rearing, the developmental need is to be available to the child, says luiz. so becoming attractive, there's no motivation for it. this can be experienced by the spouse as a rejection. 'well, why don't you want to be attractive? what is going on?'

they are likely sensing that their parents are sad even if parents think they are 'acting normal' while with their child. they may overhear conversations and wonder what is going on, but feel fearful of asking or not know how to ask in the case of young children, she added. neurologically our brains want to make sense of what is happening around us, so if parents don't explain pregnancy loss, children will begin to come up with their own explanation.
i'm sure the sweat was just pouring down. i'd be so nervous.

all three have the ideological bent that trump is looking for in his court picks. murphy, the solicitor general of ohio, has fought to make it easier to disenfranchise voters, argued against marriage equality in the landmark 2015 obergefell v. hodges case before the supreme court and argued against reproductive rights. readler, who is trump's acting assistant attorney general for the justice department's civil division, filed a brief in favor of striking down the affordable care act, defended efforts to weaken voting rights and defended trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military.

the story is told from andy's point of view, so we have a limited understanding of what choices miranda made in this unfair playing field that led her to become miranda. when i was a younger, i saw her as a villain. but as an adult, i harbor more understanding and sympathy for the self-assured leader who likes being in power and will operate to hold onto it.

amber and johnny: by all accounts, in many jurisdictions this could have been a simple split. the parties have no children together and they were married a relatively short period of time. this would eliminate any concerns regarding custody and child support. it also should have minimized exposure to spousal support and lessened the probability of accumulation of significant assets or debts during the marital period. however, the allegations of misconduct and spousal abuse turned this seemingly simple case into one of social media fodder. while both camps lodged allegations, the rest of the population picked sides on whether the domestic abuse actually happened or was used as leverage. unfortunately, as family law matters go, many things that happen behind closed doors boils down to a he said/she said version of events, with the court left deciding who was most credible. regardless of who is right or wrong, for those on either side of the fence a few pieces of basic advice: (1) make efforts to document events with photographs, audio, maintaining copies of written communications and the like; (2) seek advice of counsel when it is safe to do so; and (3) do not delay seeking intervention from authorities and the court if you need it.
unlike lighter versions of this concept, russian doll digs into both the why and the how of nadia's relived day: is it a bad ketamine trip? is she in purgatory? is there a bug in reality that's causing it to crash, and if so, what's the bug? once the show goes deep into these questions, it's inevitable that things will get spooky. it felt honest and completely necessary, and the gore was kept to a reasonable minimum.

in 2014, murphy defended the elimination of ohio's golden week, a five-day period in which voters could register and vote at the same time. the state created the period in response to the 2004 election, when many ohio voters were forced to wait in line for up to 12 hours to vote. the 6th circuit ruled in favor of getting rid of the period, but judge jane stranch wrote in her dissent that it would impose a disproportionate burden on african americans and was linked to social and historical conditions of discrimination that diminish the ability of african americans to participate in the political process.

when the disparity first came to light in the '50s and '60s, doctors thought it was a symptom of homosexuality itself, just one of many manifestations of what was, at the time, known as sexual inversion. as the gay rights movement gained steam, though, homosexuality disappeared from the dsm and the explanation shifted to trauma. gay men were being kicked out of their own families, their love lives were illegal. of course they had alarming rates of suicide and depression. that was the idea i had, too, salway says, that gay suicide was a product of a bygone era, or it was concentrated among adolescents who didn't see any other way out. and then he looked at the data. the problem wasn't just suicide, it wasn't just afflicting teenagers and it wasn't just happening in areas stained by homophobia. he found that gay men everywhere, at every age, have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, incontinence, erectile dysfunction,⁠ allergies and asthma—you name it, we got it. in canada, salway eventually discovered, more gay men were dying from suicide than from aids, and had been for years. (this might be the case in the u.s. too, he says, but no one has bothered to study it.) we see gay men who have never been sexually or physically assaulted with similar post-traumatic stress symptoms to people who have been in combat situations or who have been raped, says alex keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the fenway institute's center for population research in lgbt health.
it gets complicated with merged families. i remember i was upset with the girls about something once and my daughter said to me — in front of my stepdaughter — 'you take everything out on me!' my stepdaughter said, 'hey, i'm right here.' but it's true — the way i understand stepparenting is you're more the cheerleader than the disciplinarian with your stepchildren.

if he spends the entire evening talking about his long history of life challenges ― a string of broken relationships, for instance, or constant moves, or job losses ― it could be a red flag. this may be someone who's so caught up in emotion that he's not able to deal with the practical. you may have a wonderful, emotional romance, and perhaps this will sustain you into happily ever. more than likely, though, life will get in the way and someone will have to deal with the practicality of paying the bills, sticking with a job, cleaning the house, and minding the children. ― amanda deverich

if you're trying to get to know your date and they're having a very hard time opening up, it's a good sign they aren't emotionally mature enough or ready for something as important and deep as a long-term relationship or partnership. it's ok if they don't want to discuss everything at length on a first date, but anyone who is avoiding a topic altogether might have something to hide. maybe they just had a bad breakup or trauma, which might mean it's too soon to get involved and they are looking for more of a distraction than a love interest. the building blocks of relationships involve vulnerability, and anyone who shows signs of serious avoidance might not be someone you want to trust your emotional life with in the future. they might be ready later on, but don't chase anyone that's not emotionally available. ― jenny apple
my biggest fear going into dancing was that now no one would ever love me, never mind the fact that i had been single for nearly six years. but in the strip club, i met girls who were in long-term relationships and even married. one of my co-workers met her husband while she was stella-getting-her-groove-back at a nude joint following an abusive relationship. her future husband worked nearby and was friends with the girls at her club. my co-stripper tested his goodness by hustling customers right in front of him while he sipped a beer at the bar.
three months in, i hit rock bottom with my addictions and got sober while continuing to work in the strip club. since then, i've had more fun than ever. running around in my panties, stone sober, gives me a freedom i haven't felt since middle school.

it's not exactly comforting as a gay man to know that a politician decided you should be afforded civil rights as a matter of policy while she still personally thinks you're immoral. but even if we could separate these two things and believe that gabbard would passionately defend lgbtq rights the way that, say, now-deceased sen. robert byrd of west virginia — a democrat who was once a member of the ku klux klan — became a supporter of civil rights for african-americans, it's gabbard's actions right now that are still of great concern.

these are important questions, but they don't present themselves as questions, the writing is too good for that. in most first-person novels, the character talks to you. here, she recollects with you -- in her heart as well as her head. which is to say that dawn tripp writes in much the same way as o'keeffe painted: in vivid color and subtle shade. reading her, i thought of light years and something james salter said in describing it:

the truth of the matter, really, is she has not been considered for a bunch of years a major actress, one oscar-nominated producer said. she's been considered a major success and a major celebrity, and she has loads of goodwill because she's one of the nicest human beings on earth. it has probably made it a tad harder on the acting front because of her celebrity status. she might have gotten other roles had she not become such a pop celeb icon.

i have not spoken to my parents in three years. i've been told their door is open and that they are willing to welcome me back if i can set aside everything that makes me who i am today. i've never had a chance to come out to them as bisexual. as for my adult siblings, most people guess that our shared experience would bring us closer, but this has not been the case. deeper still than the religious element of our upbringing was an emphasis on work ethic, being a good asset ― and it was this that came between my sisters and me in recent years. when i was homeless, my two older sisters blamed me for my own poverty. my parents' snare has always been our siblings, and lydia couldn't bear to lose them. in our last exchange, she told me she was back to taking advice from our parents ― financial advice from my father and advice on essential oils from my mother for her own unvaccinated children.

the inclination to get wrapped up is totally natural. but our cardboard-cutout culture has de-humanized celebrities, to the point where they're perfect in our eyes. that's where it takes an unnatural turn, she said. we have forgotten that they're human and experience real emotion, real depression and certainly real mental health issues. and it's because we think they're perfect that we lack sympathy, and automatically resort to feeling giddy when the plot thickens in their lives.

if the child was unaware of the pregnancy, sharing the news of pregnancy loss is a matter of personal choice for parents, stuempfig said. if the child is exposed to parents' sadness and grief, it can be helpful for the parents to fill the child in so that they do not begin assigning other explanations such as blaming their own behavior for their parents' moods. typically trying to keep things covered up results in more anxiety and frustration for the whole family.

experts have linked extremism to violent misogyny in recent years, especially in the wake of mass shootings in which the perpetrators had a history of violence against women. these violent behaviors exist on a spectrum ― and, of course, not all abusive men turn into killers ― but violence against women often begets more violence, sometimes deadly. three people died as a direct result of the violence at the capitol, and more than 140 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot. two u.s. capitol police officers have died by suicide in the aftermath.

it might sound strange, but i think i believe in marriage even more because my parents got divorced. right now, i remember a decade of my parents living as loving partners. if they hadn't ended it when they did, those good years would be overshadowed by several more decades of animosity and misery for everyone. i imagine the model of a bad marriage would have soured my ideas about the topic far more than the experience of my parents' responsible separation. when bad marriages end and good marriages are left, the overall perception of the institution improves. ― tara eisenhard, author of the d-word, divorce through a child's eyes

kids by the dozen led to a staged reconciliation between my parents and alicia. in the eyes of our tight-knit christian community, a rebellious child is a great shame and failure on the part of the parent. to address and compensate for the show's strict depiction of their parenting, my parents self-published a book called love in the house: filling your home with the greatest commandment. in it, they highlighted matthew 22:36-40, in which jesus says that the greatest commandment is to love god and others. for us kids, this meant we had to give unconditional love to our parents without questioning their beliefs or authority. for our parents, it meant that god wanted them to have more children. i know, that's not what love is at all, but, sadly, i didn't know that for the first 23 years of my life.

in 2021, i'm focusing on staying connected with what my brain and body need. 2020 has been an exhausting year and so often i've found myself seeking quick ways to replenish and recharge, whether that's bingeing netflix or snacking on peanut butter m&m's. now there's nothing wrong with either of those activities, but i'm working on getting more deeply in touch with what i need when i'm feeling depleted, rather than just noticing the emptiness. do i need to give my brain a break and watch some tv? do i need an energy boost from eating something delicious? do i need to recharge by texting or calling my best friend for a chat? or is my body asking for some sun salutations, a dance party in my living room, a steamy hot shower, or do i just want to curl up with a good book. ― alexis bleich, the clinic director at kip therapy in new york city
anthony and lopez's new relationship fueled the production. both had entourages that, according to ichaso, constituted 24/7 frenzy. they thrived on chaos; ichaso compared their relationship, which ended in 2011, to elizabeth taylor and richard burton. marc is the love of her life, with his cigarettes and craziness and drinking and whatever, he said, acknowledging that lopez seems content with current fiancé alex rodriguez. she loves him. she would say to me, 'i couldn't sleep with him last night because of his cigarettes. i locked the bedroom.' they were like kids. they were just, at that time, so happy.
still, when they do take the leap and commit, they tend to do so with their eyes wide open and with a greater understanding of what it takes to make a marriage last. below, writers with divorced parents share the reasons they still believe in marriage.
tate, a photographer with a soulful love of poetry, recently sold an app that he founded with a friend for $40 million dollars. his wife also decided that their marriage was over. he has returned to new york after this abrupt turn of events and is, in many ways like smith, trying to determine what he truly wants to do now.
we couldn't be happier with our elopement. we hope that one day when it's safe to be together again, we can have the ceremony we dreamed of, a celebration with all of our dear ones. for now, we are deeply grateful to have had this moment together — a bright spot amid the heaviness of 2020. our hearts are full, going into a new year side by side. — adiel suarez-murias and richael faithful
in sweden, which has had civil unions since 1995 and full marriage since 2009, men married to men have triple the suicide rate of men married to women. all of these unbearable statistics lead to the same conclusion: it is still dangerously alienating to go through life as a man attracted to other men. the good news, though, is that epidemiologists and social scientists are closer than ever to understanding all the reasons why.

practices that try to change or suppress a person's sexual orientation or their gender identity have always been immoral and unethical, the state's health minister steven miles said last year, calling the practice highly destructive.

boy's mum: he thinks you both look like princesses
i reached the decision to seek a divorce unexpectedly last year. over the years, i had been conditioned to living with the constant fear of what he would be upset about next. even the good times were never really pleasant because i always knew that he could suddenly turn and become infuriated with me about something. he exerted control sometimes by implementing consequences but mainly by issuing endless threats. beyond my own fears, i could see that accepting this mistreatment was damaging my children's view of women as they watched their mom being denigrated by her husband.
why would i not want to show the world i am taken too? especially in our culture where rings symbolize you are with someone. for me, engagements are not a test run ― they are the moment we decide to be together forever. if chelsea was going to show people she was taken, i wanted the world to know too and feel very proud to tell people.

there was a room in the basement that i set up as an office, but it turned out that i didn't need a separate room to work, since i was living alone half the time. when my friend stace, who was also in the middle of ending a marriage, needed a place to stay, i cleared out the unused desk and borrowed a bed from my parents to turn my office into a guest room. i had stayed at my parents' house on an air mattress for the better part of a year, and understood stace might need a little time to save up for an apartment of her own while paying off her debts.
once, after arguing with a black man who called into his show, he told the caller to take that bone out of your nose and call me back. another time, limbaugh asked his audience, have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble jesse jackson? while discussing the black civil rights activist and politician. limbaugh once ludicrously asserted that if any race of people should not have guilt about slavery, it's caucasians. he invited a guest on air who sang barack, the magic negro to the tune of puff, the magic dragon. in 2016, he read an essay on air that had been penned by a well-known white supremacist.

if you look back at the reporting during the r kelly-aaliyah marriage, it was a massive failure, jemele hill, a writer for the atlantic, tweeted on jan. 3. zero understanding of sexual abuse. nobody treated this seriously. it was a collective shrug.
first, lopez agreed to judge american idol alongside randy jackson and fellow newcomer steven tyler. she negotiated a reported $12 million for her first season and $20 million for her second, fees that upped the ante for all superstars appearing on reality-competition shows. idol ratings were dwindling, and while her presence did little to restore its earlier cachet, it did place her in living rooms across middle america at a crucial time. she put her name on perfumes, hair-care products, home goods and a kohl's clothing line. with the much-needed success of the 2011 dance banger on the floor and her post-back-up plan movie choices, lopez leaned into her jenny from the block persona, opting for digestible, populist vehicles that wouldn't strain credulity.

hollywood still loves brad pitt, in case you were wondering.
alluding to aaliyah as a teenager fails to clearly demarcate that she was under the age of 18 when the marriage license was allegedly issued. claiming she married her much older producer negates the abusive dynamic at play and makes her seem like a willing participant in a union that by law is non-consensual.
as this essay went to press, a video of young white men from covington catholic high school harassing a group of indigenous people went viral. the students had traveled from kentucky to d.c. to attend the march for life, but paused to surround elder nathan phillips as he was playing a drum and chanting. one slid close, grinning, thrilled with his racist provocation, a hazel massery of his generation. maybe if karen and mike pence are worried about saving christian education in this country, they are going to have to break down the walls of bigotry that cocoon such institutions. alas, all they seem to care about is keeping queer people out.
having an end date gives you something to look forward to and work towards, leslie said. it also makes the challenges of long distance feel a bit more bearable because you know it is time-limited.
it's true, and we are very happy, the 57-year-old actor said in a statement to people magazine.
it was a much different time and a much different world then. as difficult and dangerous as it can still be for transgender people to come out, it was virtually unheard of ― and unthinkable ― at that time. so many trans people were not able to live the lives they wanted to live, and those who did often found themselves dealing with secrecy or shame or both.
no one saw this coming. not me, and therefore, i assume, no one else. in our defense, the teaser for harry and meghan: a royal romance provided no evidence — or even much justification for optimism — that the movie itself would be low-key amazing.

my dirty laundry was proudly aired and didn't scare him, which is a lot more than i can say for guys i've met much older than he is (my dude is five years my junior). as my social media had already outed me, i was free to be myself. he seemed to see stripping the way i do ― as a job.
a few months later, after rehearsing the conversation with myself over and over, i told my husband i didn't want to be married anymore. we moved forward, slowly and painfully. telling the kids was crushing. my daughter ran into her room and sobbed, then hid her head under a pillow while continuing to cry and asking questions about what would happen next ― her biggest concern was whether each of us would get married again and if she'd have to share us with someone new.

we do our workshops nude, and at the beginning, we go around the circle and say, 'how do you feel about your body and how do you feel about your orgasm?' ross said. no one says, 'i feel great about my body, i have multiple orgasms all the time.' you connect because you hear your story in everyone else's, you realized we have all been oppressed. that, in and of itself, is very liberating.
beshear's appearance was politically courageous, said chris hartman, executive director of the fairness campaign.
a 2005 investigation by the publication legal times reported about questionable spending at aclj, quoting former employees describing millions in charity funds being spent to support the sekulows' lavish lifestyle, which included multiple homes, golf junkets, chauffeur-driven cars and a private jet used to ferry then-supreme court justice antonin scalia. the guardian and the washington post reported additional details in 2017, shortly after sekulow was named as trump's lawyer.
the day before, the senate confirmed another trump appointee to a lifetime judgeship. allison jones rushing, 36, was approved with a 53-44 vote to the u.s. court of appeals for the 4th circuit and faced similar criticism. democrats pointed to her work for the christian group alliance defending freedom, classified as a hate group by the southern poverty law center, and her arguments that there were moral and practical reasons to ban same-sex marriage.

eventually, it started to not be fun anymore. i was spinning too many lies and i was not getting the high i once had from the attention. so i thought i needed new partners. when they did not fix me, i obsessively started flirting and intriguing — which is like fishing and reeling someone into your world and then, once they're hooked, throwing them away.

in their waking hours, both were left with guilt and some residual resentment ― which is actually a common experience among co-sleepers. a 2013 study from the university of california, berkeley found that one partner's restless night caused by disturbances from the other partner can lead to conflicts in the relationship the next day. another study showed that sleep issues and relationship problems tend to crop up simultaneously.

everyone is feeling the brunt of coronavirus. even those who are in denial or appear to have no emotions about it most likely do. one of the most important things you can do is to approach your relative with empathy: you're just as bummed out about self-isolating as they are. tell them that.

if you don't have a partner who holds you accountable to your dreams, sings your praises, shares your work, or understands your vision...what, exactly, are you doing? let me be clear: you can be the best dog-walker on the planet and be partnered with someone who hates dogs. and, really, that's fine. what isn't fine is being partnered with someone who doesn't love that you love what you do. what isn't at all fine is being married to someone who negates your goals or squashes your ambitions. because the person who isn't bursting with pride and enthusiasm for you -- who isn't carrying pompons with your name on them -- isn't someone who truly wants what's best for you.
it's a bad sign when someone doesn't seem excited about their wedding planning process at all. it's normal for the bride-to-be to be a little more into the details than the groom but when neither laugh or smile the entire time, you can just tell it's heading down the wrong road already. most couples have little jokes with each other or laugh about things the other wants at the wedding, and when there's none of that, it's like you can feel the tension in the room. usually not a sign of everlasting love. ― trené bambrough, co-owner of great expectations weddings and events in las vegas
james and i began a new friendship. i still struggle with this change, but i am proud of her, who she is becoming, the hard work she is doing to become her truest self. i realized i held on to the pain of the past for too long. because i had no way to explain why our relationship ended the way it ended, i never considered what she might be going through or the profound trauma she was experiencing at that time. i was too caught up in what i was going through ― i could only see the negative emotions that were coming at me and that i assumed were the result of my shortcomings and inadequacies. because i had been left without any answers for 20 years, i spent those years focused on me and what i could have done wrong instead of focusing on james and what she could have been going through.
there have been seven more seasons of are you the one? since my season, which was the first and aired in 2014, and they've all been a bit different, especially the latest season, which featured 20 pansexual individuals. but what made my season completely unique is that my fellow castmates and i had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. we had no idea what the budget for the show would be or whether it would even get a prime-time spot when it aired. the producers didn't even know the name of the show until after filming and we were introduced to the premise of the series in front of the cameras at our first challenge.

to risk overextending this comparison: neither democratic primary voters nor weber wanted to deal with this new information, and neither appeared to let it affect their decisions in any negative way.
if you are aware of a decline in frequency or satisfaction but you aren't sure if it is on your partner's radar — trust me, it is! if you are keeping track, chances are your partner is keeping track, too. although you may feel alone in it, your partner is likely experiencing a parallel process (even if they are on the other side of the equation). in fact, the lower-interest partner is often more aware of how long it has been than the higher-interest partner, because they are the one with the 'identified problem.'

daniel curet, who oversaw the hair department, said that he and fennell decided to use extensions for cassie's everyday appearance. her final disguise needed to be a striking contrast. we looked at several costume wigs, and the rainbow stripes was the one that we kept going back to and asking, 'do we dare?' curet said. in retrospect, it was a perfect choice given all the candy colors used in the set design at the coffee shop and in cassie's bedroom. funny enough, it was carey's idea to cut it at that particular length, and i went through at least 10 razor blades until i finally used utility scissors to cut all that synthetic hair into the choppy bob, which gave it a homespun vibe.

having a professional career, as a woman, in the 21st century is more important i.e. going to college and graduate school than dropping out and becoming a fashionista on instagram. you can establish yourself first, and hobbies and publishing books will eventually become a luxury in your thirties, forties, and even fifties. it will even come more naturally to you as you get older.
i thought he was sweet and in touch with his sensitive side in a way other guys i had dated weren't. we both had a total of two gay friends and had gone with one of them to a gay club, but we didn't know much about the lgbtq community then. transgender wasn't a word that was even in either of our vocabularies. a few times after being intimate, james told me, i feel like a lesbian trapped in a man's body. i laughed, having no reason at that time to think his comment was anything other than a joke.

those two statements may be the biggest white elephant in every room. death is unavoidable, uncertain and unwelcome. culturally we aren't taught how to grieve, how to process death or how to accept our mortality. nobody takes the time to teach us how to die so in many respects we never actually learn how to live.

people of any belief system claiming to value the well-being of our fellow men and women should take a hard look at these questions, but christians have a clear scriptural imperative to treat our bodies, and by extension the bodies of others, as temples of the holy spirit (1 corinthians 6:19-20). how can that message be reconciled with support for football, a game that has directly caused documented cases of life-long physical and mental damage, not just to a few, but to many who live with these consequences for the benefit of our armchair entertainment?
even though the wounds are still freshly cut, and like many heterosexual spouses luanne is getting the raw end of the deal (a justifiable feeling that most heterosexual spouses feel) by having her little-girl dreams of happily ever after shattered, the question remains, why me, why now, why to begin with? as understanding, compassionate, and loving as she can be, it doesn't take away the gut-wrenching blow to the heart, self-esteem, and trust that luanne built in her marriage to the man that she loved.

obviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said adam laats, professor of history and education at new york state's binghamton university. there's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.

it's always been 12-hour days for tv shows, goodman iland said. commercials are more like 10-hour days. and movies, they're all over the place. i would always have to be up an hour earlier, because i load my car with all the equipment, the ovens and the hot plates and everything that does not need to be refrigerated. and then i give myself 20 minutes to half an hour just to unload the food, if there's a lot of it. and i'm always there an hour afterwards, depending where we're at location-wise and whether we have access to sinks and a cleaning facility. so for me, it ends up being two hours longer. but you know what? i love my job so much that it doesn't really bother me.

still, some advocates were concerned about the language of the bill. jennifer pizer, law and policy director for lgbtq advocacy group lambda legal, said the bill suggests a licensed health professional who also is a clergy member can engage in pastoral counseling according to religious teachings, contrary to what they are permitted to do as licensed therapists. although she supports the bill as a step in the right direction, pizer said she is concerned that this language invites blurring between the roles of clergy and licensed mental health professionals.
no words can do justice to the magnitude and magnificence of his life, nelson said.
it's a very bad sign when there's relentless fighting and drama between the bridal party. here's an example: on the way to one wedding, less than 10 minutes from arrival, my team received a phone call. it was the bride telling us that the wedding was canceled. she was bitter and telling us that they were just not getting along and there was fighting among the bridal parties and between longtime friends. she mentioned that the best man had sex with a maid of honor who was really a matron of honor, since she was married. there was a brawl between the guys and it was a total chaos situation. we don't know if they are still together, but i imagine not. ― matt adcock, co-founder of del sol photography based in playa del carmen, mexico

indeed, the klobuchar coverage has set off a discussion on whether a male presidential candidate would be getting the same media attention. while there's no doubt that for years, working for a male politician with a temper was considered something of a badge of honor, that conception has been shifting. rep. tom garrett (r-va.), for example, was shamed in the press for misusing and mistreating his staff last year. there are plenty of other cases as well.

unfortunately, unless you can find your ancestor's name on an official tribal roll, you will probably not be eligible for membership. remember, too, that some native americans in the 1800s did not remain with their nation when they were moved to reservations or assimilated into the larger american society. either of these facts can make it much more difficult for you to establish a direct native american ancestral connection. of course, this doesn't mean you don't have native american ancestry. in fact, we encourage you to take a dna test which will show your percentage of native american ancestry (but not a specific tribal affiliation or connection), over the last few hundred years. establishing the dna basis of native american identity is fairly straightforward. but using archival records to prove specific native american ancestry--that is, a connection to one particular group or nation--takes some legwork, and sometimes a little luck, but reconnecting with that heritage can be a source of pride for generations to come, even if you aren't able to join a particular nation.

for some couples, that might be scheduling set times to talk twice a day, once before bed, or a few nights per week. others might prefer a looser structure for their check-ins. figure out a rhythm that makes you both feel secure in the relationship but also leaves time for the other important parts of your life, like family, friends, work, hobbies and downtime. then try to stick to whatever you decide.

we were very committed to keeping our original date, so we still got married on sept. 26. because it wasn't feasible for our families to safely join us, we decided to skip all the fanfare and marry in washington, d.c., at the supreme court. as a couple with one trans-identifying partner and one queer-identifying partner, it felt extremely fitting and urgent to stand under the pillars of the supreme court building and remember that our marriage is a right and, for so many reasons, a privilege. our day was punctuated by the fact that the late justice ruth bader ginsburg was lying in state steps away at the capitol building.

we can tell when spouses are already in love with other people. the tell-tale sign? when they adamantly defend 'friendships' that their partners say have been intrusive and or harmful to their relationships. when you love your spouse and want to keep your relationship from splintering, you acknowledge their desperate requests over the other person. ― laurel steinberg, a new york-based sexologist and adjunct professor of psychology at columbia university
the guilt of watching the kids having to go back and forth, from our home to their dad's. when my ex and i first told our daughter we were getting divorced, she cried and said, so we aren't going to be a family anymore? it was the single worst moment of my life. since then, i believe my ex and i (and our spouses) have done everything in our power to make sure they feel like we are all a big family and still love each other. but the guilt of watching them go from one house to the other never fades. i hate when they have an event coming up, they have to ask, will i be with you or daddy? now that the youngest is 4, he knows when the older kids won't be with us and is always asking when they'll be back home. it's heartbreaking at times. but i trust my ex implicitly and know my kids will be adored, scolded, challenged and supported the same way they are in our home. all things considered, i feel grateful.

as you can see, we're currently on the hook for a lot with our girls, and i know i'm not the only parent who feels this way. younger kids these days no longer just have part time jobs. the emphasis is on a competitive sport or two, music lessons, after-school tutoring -- all to assist them with their gpas so they can get into that ivy league school, or college of choice. while these are all important skills, and assets for them to have, what good is it for them to have academic intelligence, but not financial intelligence? the short answer: it's no good.
most people in my daily life, until this book was published, didn't know that i went to college at harvard. once, someone who knew my background asked me how it felt to have given up that life for the military. my time at harvard was a magical four years, but being a part of a military community feels much closer to the life i had before college, when i was going to public school in a small town. when i visit my college friends now, who are doctors and lawyers and businesswomen in big cities, i see how our daily lives have diverged. the military community, to me, feels very contained; bases have moved to largely rural areas, and the conflicts being fought abroad aren't really a part of most people's everyday lives. i felt like it was important to address the discrepancy between these two very different stages of my life. there isn't a linearity to the tension because it is more of an observation; i don't necessarily think it's something that has to be resolved in the story arc. i do feel like there should be greater public attention paid to what service members are doing, but at the same time, many of the people i know who are fighting do it so that those in civilian life don't have to be preoccupied with war; they don't have to live fearfully every day.
my whole body clenched as i felt the meaning of his words sink into my chest cavity. i tried to flex against it, to protect myself, but i could not. after witnessing decades of black men and women dying at the hands of the police and others, i was ready for some good news. i wanted something to ease the pain of the exhaustive barrage of hate, prejudice and harm that my people and i experience on a daily basis. i'm so tired of defending my blackness and the blackness of others.

also, remind yourself that no one owes anyone information about their sexual history. it's your right in a relationship to know if your partner has any stds or stis (if the two of you are sexually active), what their sexual boundaries are and whether they're faithful to you (if you are monogamous), but sex numbers are quite another matter. by sharing their number with you, your partner is getting vulnerable with you and trusting you with very private, intimate information, negendank said.

the decision to cancel our wedding was both easy and excruciating. we have family members who are high-risk, who are health care and front-line workers, and who would've traveled great distances to join us. we knew we absolutely did not want to ask anyone to put themselves at risk. for a long time, we oscillated between acceptance and sadness and everything in between. but ultimately we knew it was the safe, smart decision. we canceled our venue in may and began thinking through other options that would be safer. in august, we decided we would elope.

it becomes reflexive after years of mormonism to think of every step outside of the strict lines of mormonism as a sin that leads off this narrow path. even thought can be a sin. leaving the church entirely? for many, it is impossible. the only people who do that were lazy and don't want to obey the word of wisdom any longer. these people choose coffee and alcohol or smoking over their faith. others leave mormonism because they wanted to rail against the church, or to kick against the pricks.

what i needed from my now ex-therapist was a space in which to process the over-accommodating and self-neglect i have inherited from my mother and grandmother, and how these behavior patterns fitted beautifully with my husband's inherited male entitlement. both of us come from families where wives feel duty-bound to accommodate and husbands do not feel duty-bound to listen to and emotionally support their wives. thankfully my husband and i are changing this inherited pattern. i am the first woman in my family who is learning to be more self-accommodating, and my husband is the first male in his family who is learning to inquire after and honor what his wife needs.

wayo and i are fiercely independent and perfectly comfortable taking separate excursions with our friends. i have taken off to australia, fiji and new zealand without him and he'll periodically go out of town without me. most find this unacceptable, but for us it's perfect to be with someone who understands the need for friendship and space. we've been warned that this behavior will open us up to being cheated on, but the fact is cheaters are going to cheat no matter what the conditions. we are both of the mindset that we have no control over one another. for us, getting married meant being monogamous so if one should stray, we both understand that action will bring an end to our union. i don't want to be with someone who isn't willingly committed to me, and my husband feels the same way. knowing this allows us the freedom to enjoy each other fully as best friends should. marriage is hard enough without the added pressure of making it one size fits all.

and a lot of women are really appreciative because, like you said, you don't see a lot of black women in reality tv, even on dating shows, being the object of affection or in the forefront or being admired or, you know, so a lot of people are happy and they're happy that it's not as stereotypical catfight, loud. i'm a quirky, kind of nerdy black girl, kind of awkward too. so i think that it's great because a lot of people are seeing me and i feel like i'm representing a thing that wasn't there before. so i'm really appreciative of that.
i met my husband when i was still a teenager; our relationship has been full of great adventures, of growing up together. nostalgia influences a lot of my work; i think the act of looking back at the past often turns something mundane into something beautiful. everything is shinier in memory, and the luster of youth makes things magical. but i didn't want to write about things that had happened, especially pretty things; i thought it was important to write about the grittiness of the now. sometimes people forget that being in the military today can be very dangerous; many we have known have died too young. it is sobering. but connecting my current life to the past let me combine magic and realism. in prayers of an american wife, for example, i look back on a time when i first felt truly alone--twenty years old, in a tiny village in chile--and compare it with the loneliness of being at home during a deployment. suddenly that little village on the other side of the world became enchanting, almost unreal.

much like conversations centering around divorce or a parent separation, it's common for children to immediately blame themselves for a pregnancy or infant loss, zucker noted. this is primarily due to their cognitive development, which leaves them centering themselves or only seeing things through their perspectives. so it's vital that throughout the conversation, and perhaps even at the start, you remind your child that they are in no way responsible for any pregnancy outcome, especially one that ends in a loss. and that it's not the fault of the mom either.

it should come as no surprise that it takes a leap of faith to marry. the example below shows how one woman resolved her conflict about marrying. her major challenges were learning to believe in herself and gaining trust that she could succeed.
to know cole and ella is to know that their mother, kerstin, is an incredible mother. kerstin and i hit it off ourselves and are dear friends. she and i became a duo of cheerleaders in the bleachers at ella's swim meets and basketball games, often to ella's embarrassment. we sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional. — harris
again, we are hearing blame. 'look what you made me do.' this is not an apology for one's behavior but actually a maneuver to hold the other person responsible for one's behavior. in other words, 'you caused me to say this to you.' we are all responsible for our behavior, no matter what the other person says or does. a heartfelt apology is to recognize the pain we cause and own our behavior: 'i'm sorry that i reacted the way i did and upset you.' ― carol a. lambert, psychotherapist and author of women with controlling partners

the department of homeland security announced last week that it can waive the restrictions for journalists, humanitarian workers and people conducting business in any of the four countries -- but the exemptions are considered on a case-by-case basis and do not offer guaranteed protection to people who have these specific reasons to travel.
so we had to have these conversations about parenting in a mixed relationship, children who are mixed, how they're going to be treated by society, what are other kids going to say to them at school and how are we going to parent them when they being perceived as black and are going to have different experiences than me as a white man? so that was something that was critical for us to touch on, not because of the show, but because we were about to get married ...
this is the way it works. no one emerges from childhood totally unscathed. you do the best you can. and, if you are lucky, you find someone to do the best you can with.
for couples who aren't interested in a sleep divorce but want to improve their co-sleeping regimen, syncing up their sleep schedules can positively impact their intimacy. (granted, this advice isn't too helpful for people working different work schedules.)
yet the closure i got from our wedding weekend actually came from our american-style wedding day. my husband encouraged me to give a speech about my parents and i found myself at a loss for words. while i felt relieved, even somewhat triumphant by the way saturday had unfolded, my feelings toward my parents were still a complicated, tangled mess. i had spent my whole life trying to prove myself to my parents and meet the unrealistic expectations they had heaped on me from a young age. i grew up knowing that while i was loved, i was also an investment to my family. i had not experienced a normal childhood. but look at what we had to show for my troubles!
it is very humbling to get to see firsthand the healing that laura has brought into so many people's lives. i have had the privilege of meeting many of these people in person and hearing their stories directly from them. she has brought peace and healing to so many people whose lives were otherwise hopelessly frozen in grief. many of these people tried unsuccessfully for years to find any relief from their grief through counseling, support groups or other traditional means. it was amazing to meet these people and hear from them directly how laura's work gave them hope and perspective to begin living their lives again after years of living in darkness and despair.
it is disappointing in that legco doesn't have the forward vision or the courage to put something forward like this in fear of offending the traditional groups, chao said.
i know my own marriage improved greatly once i vowed to take god as my spiritual husband. i knew i could not keep a family and husband otherwise. most people don't go around talking about it, but prayer and giving might be the key to their marital success. people making advances might not be aware that we're all confronted with those same temptations, but they have devoted spouses and also hurt sometimes. they may believe they are the only ones who are dissatisfied, that they deserve more and then buy into it, opening themselves up for more temptations. sadly, that will lead them away from ever finding true love or happiness with the person in front of them.

even before news of the vaccine, we held off because we were worried about having to have a child without the additional help and backup of my mom, who lives in los angeles, de santos said. she had a c-section delivery the first time, and was concerned about the recovery process involved with another one without her mom by her side.

it's all in the family! she added. i love lenny; he's a great guy.
i was used to my family's skill at hiding the truth, but this took it to a new level. when my brother's new wife asked my mom to see pictures of him as a child, she told her they had all burned in a fire. over the next seven years, i often wondered what mix of naiveté and denial kept their marriage going, but i wasn't going to ask my brother. although we shared the bond of being outsiders, we never talked about him being transgender ― even with each other.
independent fundamental baptists are distinguishable from other streams of evangelicalism by their desire to separate themselves from mainstream u.s. society. while practices can vary from church to church, independent fundamentalist baptists often home school their kids, refrain from engaging in pop culture and share a fierce loyalty to the king james translation of the bible. ifb churches also don't have the hierarchical denominational structures that unite more mainstream evangelical groups, like the southern baptist convention.
i was put to work early and quickly learned to do everything from bathing five children at a time to waking up in the night to tend to fussy toddlers while i prayed for the strength to handle my sisyphean workload. my parents convinced me that my work was a duty to god, so it was impossible to view it for what it was: exploitation.
mary walsh and bev nance were discriminatorily denied admission to the friendship village retirement community for one reason only ― because they are two women in a committed relationship rather than a woman and a man, sage ceo michael adams told mcknight's senior living.

when the show debuted in january 2019, we kept begging them to provide us with on-site therapists to help us through it, but were told that they didn't have the resources for that. instead, they could get us counselors to talk to us over the phone. but i needed someone right there, in my face, to talk out my feelings. that night, i remember being numb, crying on the floor. i couldn't even watch the second episode the next day.

it's only been recently that i've started to find mormons who, like me, are finding their own way, clinging to doctrines they love, rejecting others they find abhorrent, studying mormon history with a critical eye, and finding a faith that is more resilient--as well as ex-mormons who know the faith's beauties and foibles and have found paths outside of faith. i wish i'd had more of those people around me when i was at my darkest spot, when suicide seemed the answer to my anguish over what seemed like god's death in my life.

transgender people are recognised if they have undergone sex reassignment surgery but activists have been lobbying to remove this requirement.
there are parts of who i am that still contain some darkness and my husband has served as a mirror to those areas. i've come to understand that i am the root of my struggles, as we all are. i have an amazing husband and a happy marriage, and yet old themes and negative patterns of mine still creep in. weren't those just supposed to disappear with the perfect partner?
the ohio senator said the judicial selection process has become painfully partisan under president donald trump. whether it was george w. bush or george h.w. bush, republican presidents used to nominate wise, prudent lawyers who believed in public service to be lifetime judges, he said.
i know it's a little unusual to rediscover your creative self at 35, and it's definitely even more unusual to still be doing it at 46, but that also makes the success i've had that much sweeter. erika jayne
after we got married, we were able to go back to our airbnb and have some cake and then take a nap! how smoothly everything went for us just reinforced that we had made the right decision in not having a bigger, traditional wedding. in a year filled with stress, anxiety and fear, we could not have imagined getting married with the stress of a big wedding! — missy and harley eames
the head of uscis, l. francis cissna, said in a letter to the committee that their request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages. the agency noticed some issues in how the data was collected and has resolved them. officials also created a flagging system that requires verification of the birthdate whenever a minor is detected.
i think even when i went through my big breakup, even my friends that know me so well, i might have said things like, 'i'm never going to love again. i'm never going to get married again,' she said at the time. but the people that know you best, they know my heart and that's just not me.
in hollywood, celebrity relationships come and go, often getting forgotten as new romances emerge. case in point: nicole kidman and lenny kravitz not only once dated but were engaged, too.

self-awareness is critical in these situations, feuerman said.
i am the third child born in our family ― my mother had my two older sisters as a teenager, and my dad adopted them when my parents married. my two older sisters had already endured the consequences of questioning my family's beliefs. alicia, who is nine years older than me, committed the unforgivable sin of wanting to date boys. alissa, who is six years my senior, converted to islam when she was in her 20s, making her dead to our family. she would later reconcile with my parents after capitulating to my parents' demands and undergoing christian counseling.
it is very common to have about 10-15 percent of your guests unable to attend a wedding, but when you get above 20-25 percent, you should start looking deeper. it's a telltale sign that your friends and family know that the couple is never going to work out! it's sad, but so unbelievably true. the outside perspective is the tell-all about your relationship. i was photographing a wedding where the couple invited 250 guests, paid the venue minimum of 200 plates and only 60 people showed up! that same couple came up to me and asked me if i wanted to invite my wife and kids to the reception because they paid for all these dinners and no one came! i just recently found out that the couple has since been separated. ― brian delia, owner of brian delia photography in clifton, new jersey

dyer recognizes the spark between them, but tallie's unhinged husband finney is far less amused, becoming a danger to their blossoming love.
black women have been told that the misogyny of rappers must go unchecked. that the largely black and male artists who dominate the genre must be allowed to tell their truths without restriction. we've long understood that the violent, racist nature of law enforcement means that we cannot seek police aid when we are harmed by one of our own men without risking the possibility that he will be harmed by a responding officer. we know that those same officers are unlikely to believe us or show us the sort of empathy befitting a victim. we've also been taught to believe that fast black teen girls are to blame when adult men engage them for sex that they cannot legally consent to have.
when i started getting a divorce, i had a lot to say. that sparked me being ready [for new music], maines said in an interview with the spiritualgasm podcast last year. songwriting is really hard for me, and i think for many years, i didn't want to analyze my life or my relationship. i was just in it and dedicated and devoted, and if i had started writing songs about it, that might not have been good. i don't want to say i was in a 'survival mode,' it wasn't like that, but i was just not ready to open up like that.
speaking with variety in an interview published on wednesday, kidman gave some insight into her seemingly relatively relaxed process of inhabiting the pop culture legend.
as if lured by a magnetic cult leader — or a hollywood megastar, same difference — partygoers drifted toward lopez's pulpit, dazed, wanting a glimpse. they could only get so close. her area had since been roped off. bodyguards stood at either end to stare down potential interlopers. other cast members orbited around the venue, but lopez was the center of gravity.
of course, partners' levels of desire may fluctuate over time for a number of reasons ― for example, the birth of a child, health problems or medication side effects. and there are relationships in which both partners are perfectly content with infrequent sex or not having sex at all. but for many couples, it is an integral part of sustaining a physical and emotional connection.
7. you're oblivious to your partner's needs.
larry brock exemplified it all. after he was arrested on jan. 10 for storming the capitol, katya brock filed for a protective order against him because she said she's fearful for her and her son's safety. if he was capable of doing something like this ― going to d.c. and rioting ― i don't know who that person is anymore, she said.

winfrey's special is especially timely as harry and meghan announced via a spokesperson on sunday that they are expecting their second child.
the sexual, sex-positive side of erika jayne is really who i am at my core. erika jayne is an act of rebellion — so when people tell me, no, i push back a little harder. i love a challenge, because it makes me want to take it even further. when people criticize me for being sexual and say, you're too old or you should act your age or you shouldn't be wearing that, then i look at those people and think, uh huh. sure. of course you would say something like that. [laughs.]

through it all, the series never lost its sense of indie cool ― in some respects out of necessity, as williamson continued to rely on fan crowdfunding for its budget.
christine arylo, motivational speaker and author of choosing me before we, warns that it can be difficult to choose the right mate before we've had the chance to clearly define what we want our own lives to look like. the truth is, she says, it's easy to fall in love but much harder to find a partner who supports you. when you know what you want from your own life, however, you are much more likely to choose someone you love and who is a good match to help you create that life.

dewan recently split from her husband, channing, after nearly nine years of marriage, and decided to drop the tatum from her last name.
when discussing president obama, the textbooks accuse him and his administration of stoking racial divisions. below is a passage from that abeka history book:
sharing space and time with another human being is agreeing to share head space, mood swings, dramas, quirks, families, pets, jobs, hygiene and so much more. wayo's pantries and refrigerator are pure chaos whereas anyone who's opened a kitchen cabinet in my house might consider my obsession with organization to be the work of a psychopath. on the seldom occasion that wayo and i do happen to argue, he'll purposely move things around in my fridge just to drive me crazy. i've warned him this tactic could put his well-being in danger. living separately means i know things will be exactly as i left them when i return home at the end of the day and i love that. wayo does try to adjust to my way of doing things by washing a dish immediately after he's finished with it, but i can see it's uncomfortable for him; and i, too, try to be less stringent by pretending to ignore the collection of glasses he leaves on his nightstand, but it's not easy (and if i'm being honest, i start tidying up the moment he falls asleep).
harpo productions/joe pugliese via getty images oprah winfrey interviews prince harry and meghan markle on a cbs special that aired sunday night.
in 2016, she wrote a letter to a montana paper, the flathead beacon, defending spencer. she compared the town's reaction to spencer to a witch hunt. she wrote about her grandfather, a russian orthodox priest, who, according to family lore, was jailed and shot by the communists.
the good news: georgia is a uniquely american chronicle -- told by o'keeffe -- that starts with the importance of a good story and a killer bod. does that sound uncannily like the techniques used to make careers for women a century later? yes, and to degree that may shock purists, this is a book about branding and marketing, the first two commandments of success in the art world and our world. a book about you, perhaps, if you're female and have a man in your life who wants the best for you and knows how you can get it. and, in the end, a book about a talent so fierce it crushed pretty much everything in its path -- a rare story of artistic triumph.
bill davila at the event, port offered a sweet explanation about what it means to be a parent.
laura: there is a saying in the industry: all mediums are psychic, but not all psychics are mediums. being psychic means that you perceive energy and can read someone's aura. it also means that you pick up on information about a person's past, present or future. when i read psychically, i am retrieving the information, or looking to see, feel and gather information.
you've learned the value of having realistic expectations about a spouse. your partner is not going to change. in other words, you can't change a cat into a dog. love just isn't enough to significantly alter a person's basic nature and upbringing. for instance, if you fall in love with someone who is reserved and you need outward signs of affection to feel secure, you'll feel chronically dissatisfied. most likely, these differences will probably erode loving feelings over time and diminish positive interactions in your relationship.
once i sent a new years card, with wishes for the new year to my clients: i wish you bigger problems next year than this year that you can solve. tell me how big the problems you are dealing with are and i will tell you how big you are.

because while the first round of damage happens before we come out of the closet, the second, and maybe more severe, comes afterward.
3. the parent honestly examines why they don't want to change their parenting style (or why the desired change runs secondary to what they are able to avoid by not enforcing rules). this is a highly unconscious process, by the way. a skilled therapist is the bet for gaining insight and support for being comfortable with conflict, and addressing other problem areas in the home. for example:
maybe that's why i now take extra satisfaction when stanley tucci's character, nigel kipling, who is miranda's right hand and art director at runway, gives andy a reality check about how she has spent more time complaining about her boss than taking advantage of the rare position she is in to learn how an executive does business.
social life in christian communities in kerala, jesme pointed out, is closely tied to the church. in fact, it is often difficult to separate the threads of social life from the community's religious life, making the act of opposing the church a life-altering decision. when a child is born you go to the church, marriages are held in the church, christening is done in the church, people bond over church fairs and sales, during holidays also you go to the church, literally everything is centred around the church. going against the church means going against family, friends and everyone you know and care about in our case, jesme said.

my mother was even approached at a restaurant in the neighborhood where i grew up by a woman who remarked that she remembered seeing us together when i was a child. then, the woman told my mother that she, too, had suffered at the singer's hands, when she was just 17. most significantly, the state of georgia has reportedly reopened its investigation into kelly's actions.
it's a sad day for bermuda, it's a sad day for human rights, the couple said.
this was absurd. i was absurd. nobody had done this on purpose, and nobody had done this to purposely put me out. and at the end of it all, what was i going to be left with? a beautiful wife, a beautiful home and a beautiful coffee table. none of which i deserved.
i honestly don't blame intelligent, rational people for being skeptical. i don't know that i would believe it either unless i had firsthand experience with it. - garrett jackson
rashima kwatra is communications officer at outright action international, an international lgbtiq human rights advocacy organization.
unlike most of his alt-right colleagues, jeffreys also brings an authentic working-class christian flavor to his racism. he has a recurring segment on his podcast that he calls the church of the lampshade, in which he preaches about the devil being the father of jews. he is the traditionalist so many white nationalists aspire and fail to be, a family man who likes to talk about how he lovingly imparts his racist views to his son — just like jeffreys' father once did with him.
it wasn't all sunshine and english tea roses for the real harry and meghan markle either. i feared that lifetime would gloss over the racist reaction markle faced when their relationship became known and superimpose a more palatable, standard-issue rom-com conflict. but instead of giving us a lame storyline about meghan — i don't know — seeing harry kiss an ex-girlfriend's cheek and fleeing to toronto in tears, lifetime gave us some real talk about race.

11. connie britton: i do want to say there are so many women out there who are single moms, really not by choice, and doing it and making it work every day. i think it's becoming much more a part of our culture and i hope that it will become more accepted and that those women are going to be more and more appreciated, respected and supported.

sure, the concept might seem a little strange (though not as strange as greeting each house), but the core of kondo's process is about being appreciative of all you have. gratitude is very important, she affirms. though owning too much stuff can become stressful, kondo reminds us that we shouldn't take our prosperity for granted.
do you remember back in the spring when all of this felt so scary and new? i realize that i felt like more of a team back then and the steps that you took around the house made a big difference. i'd like to try to get back to that place together. do you think that we could work on that? for example, if you could take over the meal planning, clean up after dinner each night and take care of the laundry, it would go a long way to helping me feel like we're in this together.
he said he was very sorry, lucas said.

we'd go round and round in circles, treading and re-treading over the same points, tossing the same phrases around with more and more anger and defensiveness ― mostly, i think, because we weren't sure what the other person wanted, he explained.

holidays are supposed to be a time for family, a time of joy and a time for reflection. sadly, they are often a time when people are disappointed, hurt and angry -- prompting january visits to a divorce lawyer.
i really didn't think i'd be cast because i'd never watched reality tv (except for the food network) and i've never been particularly dramatic. however, i am a strong believer that when an opportunity lands at your feet, you should be open-minded and give it your all. so, that's exactly what i did. two phone interviews and a couple of video chats later, i was being flown out to los angeles for a final round of casting in front of a panel of producers.
unlike advances in technology and the proliferation of sassy single professional women on television, real-life single professional women haven't quite made the leaps and bounds of forward progress.
we talked for five minutes, we caught up a little bit and that was it -- and it was nice, electra said. i've cared about him throughout all these years and it was great to hear that he sounded like he was in a decent place.

part of the fun of having a new sex partner is learning their sexual history and divulging yours, too: what are you into, sexually speaking? when did you lose your virginity (and was it as awkward as everyone else's?) are there any sexual fantasies you're dying to make a reality?
your ability to ask open-ended questions that allow you to see different parts of your partner

i was on a three-person date with a handsome argentine whom i had been tasting buenos aires with for one wonderful month. sure, i'd been forewarned that his friend valentina was coming along that night to finally make my acquaintance. i'd been told that her motivations lay in practicing her english with a tea-loving brit. in reality, it was a ruse to orchestrate a threesome. that very moment, i decided i was done with dating.

i feel like i've helped create a moment of connection there — like a couple is saying, 'this is so us,' and they are sharing a laugh about it, hedger told huffpost. being in a relationship can be hard. we have to remember to step back and laugh at ourselves. i hope my cartoons bring that perspective to people.
new year, new marriage. well, sort of. whether you just got hitched in 2016 or are coming up on your 10-year anniversary, it's never too early (or too late) to start working on your relationship and building toward a healthier, happier future together. but exactly what goals should you set, and more importantly, how in the world will you actually get yourselves to stick to them? that, couples, is the question.

none of what we are saying has anything to do with amy being 'likable' or 'emotional' or whatever other nonsense people throw out at women, said a former female staffer. it's that she is a terrible manager and abusive to her staff. i can't emphasize enough that there is a big difference between being demanding and being abusive.

when an emotional connection forms between two people, it usually leads to a relationship. cheating is often portrayed as somatic or physical, but anything you're hiding from your partner could be interpreted as cheating, as it could lead to a loss of trust.  ― jake hamilton
lauren: it's super unfortunate, especially because being on a show like this, you have to be vulnerable and even if you're trying to live your truth, like if whatever jessica did or said, hopefully that was her truth in the moment. and the fact that she bared that and unfortunately the public reacts negatively. i could imagine that could be hurtful. whatever growth she had to go through in that process or whatever she did in that time, that's kind of hurtful. like, man, i was just saying how i felt or doing this and now i'm being crucified for it. so it's unfortunate, but that's reality tv. you open up your life to opinion and you never know if it's going to be good or bad.
choose your words carefully. harshly criticizing the relationship or your friend's partner is going to put your friend on the defensive, chertoff said.

i learned at a very young age how our country was lost and had the blood of innocent babies on its hands. gay marriage was an affront to the natural order. nobody even brought that one up — our teacher came in one day, in 1996, fuming that a court in hawaii had suggested otherwise.
in many cases, i find that the client isn't accurately portraying themselves, she said. the most common example of this is a client who really wants to find love but gives off the message that they're treating dating casually. other times, insecurity will show through a profile picture wearing sunglasses or a sarcastic tag line that's trying too hard.
basically, your job is to plan a menu for every week of production, said richard papier, a chef who lucked into employment on 21 jump street, 12 years a slave and lee daniels' the butler when he returned to new orleans a few years after hurricane katrina. papier and his counterparts comb through a script to see which scenes require victuals. then they figure out how to accommodate actors' individual food restrictions, research and shop for the necessary items (or send assistants to do the shopping, if budgets permit), prepare them so they photograph well on camera, and help finesse those scenes during the shoot, including refreshing food for retakes.
but apparently, harry's love for meghan is not enough, not for the british press, not for certain palace residents, and not for the firm. harry spoke of not understanding what it meant to be black before he met meghan, not knowing how difficult it would be for her because of the bubble in which he was raised, the protections he has always received.

caloway williams, a byu senior who is gay, called the letter a slap in the face that he interpreted to meant his faith doesn't love or accept lgbtq people. he called it infuriating to hear top leaders speak of their love for everyone and then see policies that don't match that principle.

these textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said kathleen wellman, a southern methodist university history professor who is working on a book about the two christian publishers. i'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture.
of course, these desires for meghan and harry to more explicitly call out the monarchy for what it is are entirely unrealistic, based more obviously on my own politics and opinions than theirs. and that's what this interview was, a canvas on to which we can all project our own biases. i left the interview having learned nothing that i did not already know or at least suspect.

this could all have gone wildly awry; a script is only as good as the actors who bring it to life. often lifetime movies are fronted by former teen soap stars who check only one acting skill box, like sexy squinting or natural-seeming laugh or looks like she's really drinking coffee even though it's an empty cup.
nicolas cage has found himself moonstruck again, revealing that he married his girlfriend, riko shibata, last month.
social distancing is hard, owens said. we like to be around others, even though we spend a lot of time on social media. and those — like me —with kids are going to find it increasingly difficult not to have playdates and to keep them away from their older relatives. it impacts us all.
there are 139 colleges that exempt themselves from following title ix rules against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy or receipt of abortion. yet these schools continue to receive federal funding. many require explicit professions of faith from faculty. not only must teachers avoid acting in a way that is immoral in their personal lives, but every aspect of the educational experience is policed to make sure students only receive limited viewpoints and are never challenged on their core beliefs.

rebecca henderson and greta lee are party animals in russian doll.
now that we have more hours together in the same house, there are more opportunities for my husband to hurl criticisms at me. as the arguing intensified over the past month, several friends have urged me to move out as soon as possible. there were times i didn't feel safe as he hounded me with his lists of demands, threatened me about the divorce terms, screamed, name-called and incessantly ordered me to explain why something was put in the wrong place.
and back on the late show, colbert's team created a mock coronavirus psa... as might be envisioned by vice president mike pence, who is in charge of trump's task force on the situation:

a similarly marvelous biopic, the imitation game, released in 2014, helped advance the unfamiliar legacy of alan turing, the english computer scientist and cryptanalyst who helped end world war ii in cracking german intelligence codes. turing also was instrumental in developing theoretical computer science and the turing machine, an early computer. turing also happened to be gay. several years after the war, authorities charged and convicted him with gross indecency, and he was chemically castrated. a caption towards the end of the imitation game stated that turing committed suicide at 41. some criticized the film for inaccurately portraying certain historical events and turing's own relationships, in particular, his association with a female character portrayed by keira knightley. most significantly, historians debate the actual nature of turing's death, and whether he indeed committed suicide.

that is what i have noticed most in her over the last year ― that she is at peace, a peace that i am striving for as well. she has let go of the pain and shame, as she described it, of trying to live as a church member. she said the church made her feel as though god's love were conditional upon her doing or being something. it seems to be a consistent issue i've noticed with religion. the spiritual can get lost in the specific aspects of worship, with the faithful feeling they need to complete a checklist for worthiness rather than focus on basic principles and what really matters.

for instance, where kate cradling her baby bump received positive coverage, meghan making the same mundane gesture was described as one of pride and vanity. this kind of coverage started almost immediately after it was revealed that meghan and prince harry were an item, and most of it played into racist stereotypes specifically about black women. reports that meghan made kate cry, or that she was too demanding and aggressive of palace staff, all contributed to the idea of a difficult, angry black woman.

not a hoarder, exactly, but vic was definitely a pack-rat. and thank god for that. as a result of his inability to throw anything away, i am now basking in the warmth of memories spurred by what i have found in his clothing pockets. yesterday i came upon a hotel card from a london trip we took at least 10 years ago. i also found our ticket stubs from visiting the space needle in seattle, mixed in with a few old grocery store receipts and long-expired coupons for subway. in a box in our foyer closet, i found a car key that went missing last april and the program for our daughter's 8th grade graduation. she is now a college freshman.
the two programs are designed to delight first-time concertgoers as well as aficionados. bach and vivaldi (january 29-30, 2017) showcases soprano anna dennis in bach's weichet nur, betrübte schatten, bwv 202, aka the wedding cantata, and the less well-known vivaldi motet o qui coeli terraeque serenitas. principal flutist liz mann provides the virtuoso fireworks in bach's orchestral suite no. 2, and vivaldi's la folia variations round out the program. regarding the juxtaposition of the latter with the wedding cantata, roe says, we wanted to open up that dialogue of connection between marriage and folly, but we'll leave it up to the audience to decide privately if there's a direct progression.
1. understand this, in any relationship, you will most likely mess up at some point. big time too! and guess what, your relationship won't be unique to those storms. everyone goes through that life: * you will act out of emotions verses logic. * you will say some really bad things and you will question the walk down the aisle. * that cutie from the coffee shop will give the look that pretty much says say the word and its on. * you will possibly have those thoughts about leaving your spouse while staring into their eyes. * you will slam the door and walk out when your spouse is the most vulnerable. * you will question your worth, to them and to yourself. * you will throw your hands up for the very last time. these things happen and its real! we're talking about spending a lifetime with another person....trust and believe it will happen. anybody that says that they don't experience at least one or two of those things is lying; to themselves and to their spouse. so, knowing the cons going into the whole marriage thing doesn't feel like pressure anymore (and of course, the pros far outweighs the cons). it's like you are going in and you already know you will (not if) miss it in some areas.
once you've been together awhile, you should start having conversations about how and when you will shorten the distance — whether that's eventually living together or moving to the same city. if your ldr is a longer-term thing, hopefully you've at least had some discussion about how you'll visit each other more in the meantime.
simply put: no partner or relationship is perfect. no matter how much you loved your ex, try to be honest about his or her flaws instead of romanticizing them.

at the core of the therapeutic relationship is confidentiality, she explained. the client enters the relationship being guaranteed that their revelations will not leave that space, unless of course there are safety risks. this creates a unique dynamic that is not meant to go on for long periods of time. it would not be sustainable to have this type of conversation for many hours at a time.

the very nature of this virus isolates people. if we show symptoms of the disease, we must quarantine ourselves from our families and from society itself for at least 14 days. to end up at a hospital can mean lingering and ultimately dying separated from loved ones because no one will be allowed into our rooms as we struggle for our last breath. for weeks we've learned concepts like social distancing, where now we must not intrude within 6 feet of one another's personal space. steadily all of our in-person social groups and institutions have closed. some connections have moved online, but this new norm of personal interaction and socialization by computer has left many people anxious, lonely and disconnected.

how you view your divorce is instrumental for your future. with a positive and realistic outlook knowing that it will be a roller coaster ride for some time, it provides an opportunity to start over. you might think it's about your ex and the dreams that you lost -- but, in truth, working through your divorce is really about you and all that you have to offer. yes, divorce can and often is a long process and requires effort and energy -- but, in doing that, you'll make it to the other side of divorce.

keditsu's hair journey straddles the personal and the political. i started shaving parts of my hair as a teenager, she said. and then completely when i was 27. and then in parts from 2017 onwards. my parents disliked my latest experiments so much that they even prayed for me! for them, my mohawk was unbecoming of a mother and a responsible working woman. for some others, it clashed with their idea of naga beauty and femininity. my husband loved it, as did most of my friends. the most recent experiments with my hair were simply a personal quest to explore what being beautiful meant to me. i'd reached a point of self-acceptance ― realizing that hair and other accoutrements of beauty were at once superfluous and vital to one's personhood. with my mohawk, i wanted to challenge ideas of what a mother should look like, and what made a woman my age beautiful. in a very deliberate way, i chose to sport these hairstyles because they expand the idea of what it means to be feminine.

to reference an old adage, a happy marriage is a long conversation which always seems too short. the word conversation is key here. many of us have experienced a relationship, romantic or otherwise, that felt entirely one-sided, akin to a conversation where the other person endlessly rambles without asking how your day was. good conversation is never one-sided, and similarly, in the hyper-connected world of today, neither should our marketing efforts.

although my parents were extremely hesitant about how quickly and seriously i was falling for my tv show boyfriend, the moment they met him they understood why he was my perfect match. i first introduced ethan to my parents at a super authentic chinese restaurant (one of my faves) and not only did he eat absolutely everything that was served, he loved it and proceeded to learn some chinese phrases. my parents were definitely impressed. on top of that, ethan and i were constantly finishing each other's sentences during dinner. i had never been in a relationship that fit so perfectly and my parents could tell.

we eloped in san juan national forest in southwest colorado on sept. 22. we said our vows as the sun rose at this beautiful alpine lake. it was the best decision we have ever made. our wedding day was the one bright spot in this strange year. we spent the week with our immediate families (nine people, all tested for covid) for the first time all year. we hiked amongst beautiful mountain lakes, went rock climbing and spent valuable time with the people we loved the most. most people are pulled in a thousand directions on their wedding day. we had the nine people we care about most in the world with us on our wedding day. — kenny chang and krina amin
the text today was a poem—the hangman, by maurice ogden. a tall, blonde-haired boy in the middle of the room was trying to make the case that the eponymous hangman was clearly supposed to symbolize death. before he was done making his point, the girl next to him interrupted. you're reading the text wrong, she said. some of the students snickered. a student pointed out that he'd have to deduct two points because she'd interrupted. she shook her head. i don't care. i can't sit here and listen to him talk about symbolism when he is so obviously wrong. the class cheered.
although the national rate of homeownership has dropped to a 48-year low of 63 percent, the fact still remains that the taxpayer on one side of the debate, is also the homeowner on the other side almost two-thirds of the time. as a result, the oft-repeated argument, the taxpayers are on the hook for the homeowners' mortgages, is at best misstated.
i snuggle my kids, who are happy and content. i make my coffee, pack lunches and get everyone out the door. then, i settle into my favorite coffee shop and a new feeling arises. i'm met with relief that i had the awareness, the strength, the commitment to change my life because it wasn't easy, but it was right. i know the guilt isn't over. i know it will bubble up again and i'll have to talk sense into myself, the same as i would my closest friend. i know i'll have to give myself compassion.
according to the mount vernon website, washington became a slaveholder at the age of eleven when his father died. by the time george washington died in 1799, the enslaved population on his mount vernon planation included 318 people, 123 who were owned by washington himself and the rest who were part of the estate of his wife's children from a previous marriage. instead of freeing the people he claimed to own in his will, washington transferred ownership to his wife. some of these people were freed in 1801.

amid the chaos of our daily lives, i would reach the clutter breaking point and stealthily toss things out when i thought he wasn't looking. now, each item i find feels like a cherished gem. i do wonder though why those loose almonds i found in pants he hasn't worn in years never got moldy.
larry always viewed his interview subjects as the true stars of his programs, and himself as merely an unbiased conduit between the guest and audience, it continued. whether he was interviewing a u.s. president, foreign leader, celebrity, scandal-ridden personage, or an everyman, larry liked to ask short, direct, and uncomplicated questions. he believed concise questions usually provided the best answers, and he was not wrong in that belief.
hannah ann, you set an example for women everywhere a couple nights ago. you are such a strong, confident woman and you deserve all the love in the world. i accept full responsibility for my mistakes in our relationship and wish you only the best.
although i have always struggled with the church's hard-line stance against homosexuality and same-sex marriage and believed myself to be one who doesn't discriminate, i was naive. naive because it was easy to say, i can love someone and not agree with their lifestyle, which was something i had heard spoken often in church. the reality is i had never experienced same-sex attraction or even witnessed anyone close to me experience it, so it was easy for me to say that i didn't agree with it.

(incidentally, by the mid-'90s, mcdonagh announced he would no longer write for the stage and turned to movies, like the brilliant in bruges. he has since resumed with the not-top-drawer a behanding in spokane and the scintillating-for-myriad-reasons hangman, which has yet to be produced stateside. apparently, there is even a newer play ready to go.)

i feel like you're a wizard with some of the writing that you do because you approach sensitive subjects in a way that i don't see coming. case in point, you write about saving yourself for marriage. that's a subject that's personal, and i wondered if you questioned whether or not to include it or other subjects like that within the memoir?

there's an overwhelming desire to root for meghan and harry because they've clearly been through a lot, and yet, there's an equally overwhelming desire for them to dig deeper. prince harry talked about having done the work of understanding race (only after dating meghan, apparently) and yet one can't help but wish that instead of just talking about unconscious bias he would say more, do more. call out the fact that the monarchy is an obsolete and racist institution that he and his family have been complicit in.
phillips-palo quickly slotted lopez opposite robin williams in francis ford coppola's fish-out-of-water dramedy jack (1996). the film did lukewarm business, but along with the immigrant drama my family (1995), for which lopez received an independent spirit award nomination, it established her screen presence as that of a compassionate everywoman.

indian weddings are most famously imagined as enormous spectacles. this image is surely real, though representative of a small segment of the indian population, and realised only in the world of the super-rich. some reports have estimated the super-rich to constitute 1% of the total population, which contributes to 22% of indian gdp.
this could have been the moment i realized that what i'd done to these two men was pretty messed up, but no. instead, i detached. i felt myself float outside of my body and watch the whole thing play out like i was watching myself in a soap opera. (strange, since i am an actor.)
now, if you have the same interest, if we have common interest, that will make risk lower because those who you need will cooperate. when there is common interest there is cooperation. when there is cooperation there is less risk. a complementary team that shares knowledge and is based on common interests, reduces uncertainty and reduces risk.

it's really about how you handle it when you wake up, she told people. i look in the mirror and i have my affirmations. and mine are simple.

alex, a fitness instructor in seattle, was told by a guy on his swim team, i'll ignore your face if you fuck me without a condom. martin, a brit living in portland, has gained maybe 10 pounds since he moved there and got a grindr message—on christmas day—that said: you used to be so sexy. it's a shame you messed it up. for other minority groups, living in a community with people like them is linked to lower rates of anxiety and depression. it helps to be close to people who instinctively understand you. but for us, the effect is the opposite. several studies have found that living in gay neighborhoods predicts higher rates of risky sex and meth use and less time spent on other community activities like volunteering or playing sports. a 2009 study suggested that gay men who were more linked to the gay community were less satisfied with their own romantic relationships. gay and bisexual men talk about the gay community as a significant source of stress in their lives, pachankis says. the fundamental reason for this, he says, is that in-group discrimination does more harm to your psyche than getting rejected by members of the majority. it's easy to ignore, roll your eyes and put a middle finger up to straight people who don't like you because, whatever, you don't need their approval anyway. rejection from other gay people, though, feels like losing your only way of making friends and finding love.
reffitt admitted to police that he put his wife into a chokehold and pulled her to the ground. when the cop asked how long he had choked his wife, reffitt responded that he had trouble remembering but he said not long because he loves her, according to the police report.

the edges are rough, production-wise. who can blame them? a top-quality movie doesn't get made and released in the six months between a royal couple's public engagement and their nuptials. at one memorable moment, the two's first blind date is interrupted by sunrise, which arrives with the abruptness of a powerful lamp being switched on offstage. at another, the film noticeably cuts to news footage of a car going into the real buckingham palace. hey, they tried their best.
a turning point for my sister and my faith came after the horrific shooting that took place at the pulse nightclub in orlando, florida, on june 12, 2016, where 49 people lost their lives. the senseless violence had a profound impact on my sister, who saw herself in those targeted for being different. she sent our entire family a heartfelt message the following day. she told us that she was gay and ready to live her truth. the news shifted something deep inside me. up until that point, my life had mirrored my sister's in many ways. we both married men in our early 20s, and we both had three sons. my sister was now divorced, and i had watched her suffer through many challenges. i had also witnessed her close connection to another woman, whom she had described as her best friend, developing for many years. i often wondered if their relationship could be more than friendship, but as an even more devout church member than i ever was, she had never revealed her true feelings for her girlfriend to our family, and she steered us away from conjecture.

for women like mary who experience chronic, debilitating pain during sex, there can be few places to turn for help. if doctors learn about female sexual symptoms at all during medical school or residency, they are advised to prescribe ways to relax patients, like drinking alcohol. but sexual dysfunction symptoms are more common among people with chronic ailments like diabetes, psoriasis, depression or cardiovascular disease, and they can also be one of the first signs that something may be seriously wrong with a woman's reproductive organs. when a doctor dismisses a woman's concerns about sexual dysfunction, he or she could miss an opportunity to diagnose diseases where sexual dysfunction may be their first or only symptom.

as the female lead on m.a.s.h., major margaret hot lips houlihan was in a class of her own. the character was the head nurse in the mobile army surgical hospital unit (set during the korean war) and her physical beauty was written into both storylines and one-off gags. though hot lips often leaned into her sex appeal and clashed with other characters in earlier seasons of m.a.s.h., by its end, she had changed ― and the actress who played hot lips is part of the reason why.

instantly, mcdonagh demonstrated that he possessed a unique vision. born in london of irish parents who, like many before them, moved to england in search of work, he visited ireland in summers. so though he had experience of his parents' homeland, he was also brought up with the english attitudes towards the myth of ireland. undoubtedly, that accounts for the hint of spoofery that permeates the playwright's vision of ireland.

sometimes, the conversation will be fun, like the maker's mark fake kentucky derby contest on reddit. maker's mark asked redditors to decide and vote on the names of horses that were entered into a fake, digital derby that was featured as part of an ad-page takeover of the frontpage. the winning names, like beast of bourbon or much horse very fast, were irreverent and nailed the tone of a typical reddit thread, which is why the campaign worked on a platform that is notorious for being hesitant towards corporate intrusion. maker's mark came into the conversation speaking the language of their audience they wanted to reach and redditors felt like equal players in the conversation.
like watkins' novel, lepucki's turns away from the broad scope of post-apocalyptic societies and instead looks at how a new living situation might effect the parties in one of the most personal relationships there is: a marriage. cal and frida have fled los angeles and are living in a ramshackle old house, blissfully happy and trading for supplies with an occasional visitor. but frida's eventual boredom leads them to seek out a nearby settlement, and that's when the trouble begins.

moving out might solve the thing that showed the relationship difficulties, but it doesn't fix the underlying issues, rollo said. this is also a time a couple needs to have a talk to determine what their goals for the relationship are. maybe they want to marry one day, or maybe it's time to talk about making things more casual.
an already difficult situation becomes nearly impossible once a venue has been booked, invitations mailed and a dress bought and altered, she said. even better? if your friend is getting serious with someone you feel isn't a good match and you think a proposal is imminent, have this conversation before the engagement.

there is an old saying that if you never have a quarrel in a marriage then the first time can end in divorce. so the good news is it's ok to have little spats every now and then. we have been married for over 30 years, and inevitably there are times when one or even both of us loses it. we are, after all, very human. we've been there, done that, and collected a whole range of tee shirts! but, in all that time, what we have never done is go to bed angry with each other.
in one such incident, a leading exporter forgot to invite a real estate baron to the marriage of his son, straining not only their social and business ties but also of their networks. it took more than a decade and multiple attempts by common friends to restore their relationship. the politics of invitation most certainly resonates with the politics of businesses and survival.

far more understandable than the name alone might lead one to believe, credit risk transfer allows the taxpayer to share the burden of large-scale mortgage repayment risk with the private sector that is incentivized to bear this risk. it also allows the homeowner continued access to 30-year mortgages at competitive, yet affordable fixed rates. and the fact that the homeowner and taxpayer are often one in the same makes this more than just a housing finance term or policy initiative. it's common sense, plain and simple.

i was too young when my parents divorced to get the concept of marriage before it was gone. my ideas about marriage, therefore, came from watching my grandparents. their lives together seemed effortless and comfortable like a locomotive on a schedule that always made it on time. my parents' lives seemed laborious in comparison with a never-ending track change.
if we truly love music, hip-hop culture and the women who are suffering in silence, then we should collectively use our power to create something better. will we keep loving problematic things, acknowledging that some bad feminism is unavoidable, or do we finally put our feet down? what if we showed how much we value black women by refusing to support artists who create music that normalizes abuse? what if we stopped supporting artists who are so casual with their abuse that they tell us about it in their lyrics?
taking care of yourself is an investment that you benefit from, but your loved ones, colleagues, neighbors and community do as well, ali said. so it's ok to say 'no' to baking homemade treats for the neighborhood bake sale if you feel that you'd benefit by soaking in a bubble bath instead.

it's a kind of fear that's baked into our society, and that's reinforced on each of us with the overrepresentation of monogamous romance we see in life and in fictional narratives. even the idea of a couple, as synonymous to a relationship, signifies that the only ethical partnership exists in pairs of two. and yet in modern society, there are so many examples of successful throuples and open arrangements, and so many more examples of failed monogamies, many of which fell apart solely due to cheating, lacking other toxic dynamics.
i have been fortunate enough to have found great success in my career and in all areas of my life at a young age. so many people now praise me, follow me on instagram @busygirlboston, and become my consulting clients on busy girl daily. they all say: kristina, you are such an inspiration! how do you do it all? how did you get published? how did you get arianna huffington to be the keynote speaker at your women's innovation conference? how did you get your product, moroccan magic lip balm into whole foods? although, my ego gets excited when i hear things like this, i come back to reality when i break down my secret to success. it is very simple and practical knowledge and the key to getting what you want out of life. so again, i remind you that you only get in life what you ask for. how did i get published? i looked up the publishers email address, sent them my story and asked them to publish me! how did i get arianna huffington to be the keynote speaker for my conference? i started digging on that fabulous thing we call (the world wide web) and found her information. so what did i do with it? i emailed her and asked her to come speak at my boston business women's conference! hopefully you start to see the pattern here.

afterward, rachel and kevin comment on how much calmer things feel for them now that they've de-cluttered. they've established a designated place for their belongings and a system for keeping it that way. they are kinder and more patient with one another and the kids.
as i drove i found myself pushing away the soft feelings in my belly with a litany of rational thoughts: dating someone who lives with you is too convenient and easy; dating a friend is cliche; it would get too serious too quickly; my kids didn't need me involved in something serious; it would destroy our friendship.
it's kind of like how you'd be thrilled if your friends who dated for years are finally fine with being in the same room again; no more weirdness at parties!
particularly frustrating for some of these staffers have been the charges of sexism. many of the aides who spoke with huffpost are women, who consider themselves feminists and have worked for other strong female politicians.

people usually assume there's a religious reason behind choosing celibacy. but is that the reason for you? are you accidentally celibate (i.e., you just haven't had sex for a while and don't mind keeping it that way)? you waiting to find the right person? are you getting over an ex? your potential partner is probably curious (and maybe making a lot of assumptions), so you might as well be honest.

bermuda's government is justifying this breach of equality as a win-win, a way to appease social and religious conservatives and lgbtiq people. and it was a compromise, of sorts: the majority of the public rejected any recognition of same-sex partnerships. in a nonbinding referendum in 2016, a year before the bermuda supreme court legalized same-sex marriage, 69 percent of bermudians voted against marriage equality. in that same referendum, 63 percent of voters rejected civil partnerships. the domestic partnership act preserves civil partnerships, but this win-win has left lgbtiq bermudians feeling like second-class citizens.

if your partner is sleeping like a baby and not helping out at night, there's bound to be some resentment, said laurel steinberg, a psychotherapist in new york city. if a mom is breastfeeding, the feeding may be left entirely up to her at first, but her partner should pick up the slack in other ways (rocking the baby to sleep, for instance, or diaper duty). and if she decides to incorporate pumping into her routine, her partner should step up and do some bottle feeding.

but no one outside our house understood the new rules. the neighbors had tolerated mom mowing our front lawn in her lime green bikini, but the girl-next-door turning into the boy-next-door was harder to ignore. i tried to convince myself that everyone thought my sister was just trying out a new summer cut with sideburns. i soon realized i was fooling myself when my best friend cindy began making snide remarks about my weird sister who thought she was a man. i was embarrassed and ashamed but had no way to defend myself. if i told cindy the truth, she would tell her mom and her mom would tell everybody. it was safer to just stop being cindy's friend.

the launch of the food network in 1993 was a key development. the channel popularized the celebrity chef at the same time that martha stewart living, saveur and other publications were prioritizing sophisticated food imagery. (spungen, a former martha stewart editor, went on to style julie & julia, it's complicated and eat pray love after friend and food writer amanda hesser recommended her to director nora ephron.) in the 2000s, the reality-tv boom gave us top chef, hell's kitchen, man v. food and anthony bourdain's globe-trotting docuseries no reservations. through websites like epicurious and food52, the internet made cooking more egalitarian. meanwhile, a dietary fad or savory trend seemed to permeate the hoi polloi every other week. by the time the 2010s brought about glossy confections like the great british bake-off and chef's table, food was more than a source of sustenance — it was a multibillion-dollar lifestyle commodity.

i didn't sleep the night after my mom told me the news. she sat me down and looked very grave as she asked if i knew what a transexual was. i was only 12 years old and i didn't. in 1972 i doubt anyone in my midwestern suburban neighborhood would have. i worried it might have something to do with me preferring barbies and easy bake ovens over hot wheels racing cars or baseball gloves. was i going to have an operation? i didn't like having my tonsils out and this seemed a lot worse. but i soon realized she was referring to my sister, who was 18 and what people referred to as a tomboy.
i have a new friend. a friend that is different from the one i grew up with, dated and almost married, but this friend wears pink cat ear headphones and watches youtube videos on how to do at-home manicures. my own world has been widened with this new understanding, and there is tremendous healing that comes with forgiveness — both of another and the self. i'm glad our paths crossed again in this way. coming out as transgender, i realize, isn't a death, but a new birth, a journey that isn't the same for everyone, but one filled with hope, with beauty and promise. and for me and tracy, recovery.
apparently, while i might have sobbed my eyes out when in 2004 an amendment was added to our state constitution declaring marriage to be between one man and one woman, the enormity of that hadn't really registered for a lot of straight folks. i answered their questions by pointing out that most straight people viewed their wedding, and their marriage, as something much larger than a legal agreement. it was important for us to have a wedding, legality be damned, because we wanted to commit to sharing a life together. and so we did.

therefore, this behavior might represent an unmet emotional need that's looking to be met through misguided digital habits, durlofsky continued. that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's important to take the time to examine and acknowledge what's driving this behavior so you can find real solutions to your issues.
the times' report cited an unnamed law enforcement official with knowledge of the probe, saying the bureau has taken the first steps to open a criminal investigation following the newspaper's reporting. investigators will likely move to speak with ava and obtain any text messages she sent with adams.
red flags that your loneliness could lead to a bigger issue.
when it comes to debt you accumulated together, such as a credit card balance or mortgage, it will be handled according to state law.
but rouda has another reason to feel an affinity for the 77-year-old billionaire. in the 2018 midterms, when rouda was locked in one of the most contested elections in the country, bloomberg spent $4.5 million of his vast personal fortune on ads thrumming rouda's republican opponent.
some financial professionals say to wait on these conversations, but i think the earlier the better. financial habits are a good indicator of priorities; if you and your partner don't share priorities, that may be a sign other issues will arise down the road.
why do some parents feel at liberty to weigh in on nearly every facet of their adult children's lives?
working nights while my boo is busy during the daytime can also be a hassle, but i would've been busy at night with comedy, anyway. being able to spend only four nights of the week together actually keeps the fire lit between us.
the truth is that i would be more gentle, more forgiving, with just about anyone else.
they were later released without charge, but activists say many have since gone into hiding for fear of further raids.
today, she knows, things are much different. in spite of being out of the game for a decade, chappell marsh is familiar with the struggles inherent in dating app use, thanks to her single clients. if you're in therapy and on a dating app, your therapist goes along for the ride, too.
i took a breath and listened. james, who had not yet changed her name at that point, told me of her struggle — her lifelong feeling of being different, of not being comfortable in her own skin, of feeling broken even when she was a child, and how that sense of brokenness never left her until she came out.
still, the study showed persistent problems across the board. for example, the ages of characters for female performers still trend younger than those for men, as female characters experience a precipitous drop from their 30s to their 40s, and few women age into their 60s, the study said.
in 2014, researchers compared straight and gay teenagers on cardiovascular risk. they found that the gay kids didn't have a greater number of stressful life events (i.e. straight people have problems, too), but the ones they did experience inflicted more harm on their nervous systems. annesa flentje, a stress researcher at the university of california, san francisco, specializes in the effect of minority stress on gene expression. all those little punches combine with our adaptations to them, she says, and become automatic ways of thinking that never get challenged or turned off, even 30 years later. whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. we don't have the tools to process stress as kids, and we don't recognize it as trauma as adults, says john, a former consultant who quit his job two years ago to make pottery and lead adventure tours in the adirondacks. our gut reaction is to deal with things now the way we did as children. even salway, who has devoted his career to understanding minority stress, says that there are days when he feels uncomfortable walking around vancouver with his partner. no one's ever attacked them, but they've had a few assholes yell slurs at them in public. that doesn't have to happen very many times before you start expecting it, before your heart starts beating a little faster when you see a car approaching. but minority stress doesn't fully explain why gay men have such a wide array of health problems.
in terms of western palm reading, there are three major lines that cross your hand: the heart, the head and the life line. the heart is the first line that horizontally curves across your hand, followed by your head line and your life line. your heart line focuses on how you love, your head line on how you think and your life line on what your life will be like (but not the length of it).
i joked to a friend that there are two things i need to help me recover from this break-up: a hug and a bartender, he said. unfortunately i don't have access to either.
this essay is part of a three-part interview series with sexual abuse survivors drew dixon and asante mcgee, and co-founder of the #muterkelly movement oronike odeleye.
since there was no episode of the brady bunch where jan feels like she was assigned the wrong gender at birth, i realized i pretty much had to figure out this hybrid brother/sister thing all by myself. my mom's guidelines were clear: we will accept this, but we will not talk about it — not even with each other. that first conversation i had with her was also our last.
neither rudell nor a representative for the saudi government immediately responded to huffpost's requests for comment. huffpost's email to albutairi was not returned.
being in the same bed at the same time as your partner increases the likelihood of having sexual contact. if you find yourself avoiding going to bed until after your partner is asleep, you may be consciously (or subconsciously) decreasing the odds of having sex. you need to ask yourself some tough questions: why don't i want to be awake in the same bed at the same time as my partner? are there aspects of my sex life that are disappointing or anxiety-provoking? avoiding may feel easier than hurting your partner's feelings, but an honest conversation (first with yourself and then with your partner) may keep you from ending up in a sexless marriage. ― resnick anderson

holidays are supposed to be a time for family, a time of joy and a time for reflection. sadly, they are often a time when people are disappointed. the currier & ives perfect thanksgiving, chanukah or christmas is not a reality for most people. family gatherings are often difficult. you do not pick your relatives and many people can't stand their in-laws. holidays are also a time when people make mistakes. what about one drink too many at that holiday office party? an indiscretion with another man or woman can be problematic. a word that should not be said, a careless email or text message -- the list is endless. with social media, it is so much easier to cross that line than it was a few years ago.
she's a fucking real person, hasak said. that bullshit of premier cable versus basic cable? she doesn't function in that universe. … she has the wherewithal of not doing the usual hollywood bullshit and saying, 'i have to climb the highest mountain.'
the movie, in general, leans heavily on their target audience's knowing the general arc and milestones of harry and markle's relationship, which relieves its creators of the obligation to transition smoothly from scene to scene. why not just jam in a scene in which harry confronts a crusty old british lady wearing a racist blackamoor brooch at pippa middleton's wedding? princess michael of kent did once wear a blackamoor brooch at a lunch with markle, and royal fans will be excited to see that tidbit pop up in the fictionalization.
every now and then. i can do it, but it is harder when you know someone so intimately to stay neutral with regard to the information coming through. also, i try to stay in normal mode most of the time, because mediumship is extremely draining to me and i can get physically sick if i stay open all the time. i found this out the hard way. so now i set pretty clear boundaries with the other side.
they learn that the world doesn't revolve around each of them, which is scary ― but also that they're not alone, which is comforting. it also complicates the question of what selfishness and goodness look like. nadia doesn't seem to feel anything; she's single, hard-partying, independent. alan feels too much, especially his obsession with his girlfriend, whom he's suffocating with his overbearing emotional needs. neither of them is a bad person, but both need to learn to actually show up for other people and to allow other people to show up for them. the idea that their intersecting moments of selfishness constitutes a bug in reality that crashes the whole system, a neat nod to nadia's day job, also hints, in a good place-esque way, to the idea that humans owe certain things to each other.
i can also tell you that abuse rewires the brain, creating neural pathways that make victims either hyper- or hypo-aware. this means they are either incredibly sensitive and jumpy, or desensitized. kouprianova was desensitized. spencer would threaten her, intimidate her, call her disgusting and ugly. she would respond in a monotone.
we went into the hospital at 5 a.m. for a scheduled cesarean section. late that same night, i was still wide awake. the nurse told me several times i needed rest. i smiled and nodded but wouldn't dare let myself close my eyes. she finally came in and asked why i wouldn't sleep. i broke down. in between sobs, i explained to her that my baby was going to die if i went to sleep, and i wasn't going to let that happen.
there absolutely have been happy marriages without children but i see myself happily growing old, alone, or with a partner i'm not tied to by marriage. now i understand that sure, maybe i'll meet someone who i'll want to spend my life with, but we won't need a certificate justifying our love for each other. there may be some nice marriage benefits out there, but i'm okay living my life without.
they told me i only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the senate gave john bolton this week, pitt said.
those who are engaging in risky behavior are sending the message that covid isn't really their problem, that they don't see a reason to modify their behavior to mitigate risk, said atlanta clinical psychologist zainab delawalla. this is infuriating to people who have been making sacrifices for almost a year, and doing so not just to protect themselves, but also to protect others around them.

i've wondered for years when lopez would land another out of sight. she can convincingly portray working-class strivers — many pop idols can't — but i suspect that lopez has hardly demonstrated her full range on-screen. broader career machinations — her celebrity, in other words — acted as an impediment; having collected $12 million for one of the biggest bombs in cinema history (2003's gigli) has its consequences. after seven nominations from the tacky razzie awards, the industry seemed to deem her unworthy of highbrow fare.
however there are advantages to having and using a credit card in your twenties. for example, you'll have a longer positive credit history, which can set you up for better mortgage rates when you buy your first home. the best way to use a credit card is to charge your regular monthly expenses, and pay the balance each month. paying it off each and every month is crucial to avoid interest charges. another compelling reason to use credit cards is to earn rewards that can help cut the cost of things like travel or even everyday expenses. for example, i have enjoyed free flights, discounted flights, and free first class upgrades with bonus points earned by opening an airline-branded credit card. visit honeyfund's blog for more info on how to use credit card rewards points for travel.

you are not responsible for their happiness, said philadelphia marriage and family therapist george james. if you've tried to support your partner, the next thing you can do is things that keep you happy. reading, exercising, hobbies and friends can sometimes be an example for your partner as well.
during this whole process, nobody asked how i felt about it. in our society, women change their names, and where i'm from, if you do not change your name, you wear a big, fat, ugly scarlet f on your chest for feminist. when did feminist become a negative word though? why is a woman supporting women linked to such dirty connotations? i swear the people in my life were one step away from dousing me with holy water to knock some divine sense into me.

liberty counsel in and of itself isn't the problem. (it certainly is a problem, just not the problem.) a christianity that uses the pulpit to teach discriminatory ideologies and christian superiority is. the group is a case study of what happens when politics and christianity are so tied that christians cannot or even refuse to see the people that policies are supposed to represent. many religious people have consistently used the intersection of their understanding of scripture and the law to dehumanize.

so far, two courts have upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and rejected the arguments made by the artists, who believe a marriage should be between a man and woman.
the biggest change for us was that, for better or worse, once we got married we decided to divide and conquer and make sure each family task was handled by the more adept person. like, i'm really good with bills and budgeting and he's not, so that's my domain, and he doesn't have to worry about it. and he's a terrific cook... meaning i haven't really looked at an oven in five years. i handle our social calendar. he handles anything to do with the car. the plus side is that most things get done quickly and efficiently, with minimal fighting. the down side is that i have no idea how to pump gas anymore. - jillian, married 5 years

the political world has largely received these stories as sexist criticism, dismaying and infuriating former aides who experienced klobuchar's fury firsthand. from tweets by prominent democratic strategists hilary rosen and patti solis doyle:
our primary issue seems to be money. originally when i moved into his house, i agreed to pay $700 all inclusive plus we would alternate weeks for groceries. because he had been burned in the past by his children's mother who defrauded him out of thousands of dollars, his family, whom i love dearly and are very level headed people, encouraged us to sign a cohabitation agreement which protects his interests in his home in the event that we ever separate. being a good sport, i signed this agreement even though i personally though it unnecessary. i told him because of this i would not pay any money toward his mortgage or renovations to the house, considering i would reap none of the financial reward. we do not have a joint bank account.
taking a few steps back or walking away from the maskless person is an option if you want to avoid confrontation. but if you feel compelled to speak up, you could say something like: i have a son at home with a compromised immune system — would you mind putting your mask on?
the novel redefines the traditional american love story ― it's really a love triangle ― and places it inside a world that a lot of people don't know about, but impacts all of us in really big ways, oprah says.
i'd never do anything with it, and he would say to me, you're going to finish the book that you have to finish.
on may 18, 2018, the moment my baby boy was born, i was overwhelmed with emotions. i cried, the nurse cried; it was beautiful. this is it, i thought. this is the feeling everyone told me about. i had a rough pregnancy, having been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum ― severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy ― early on, so giving birth felt like a relief. later, i was wheeled into the recovery room and a hospital staffer came in with a checklist: was i feeling sad? did i feel worthless? did i feel like hurting myself or others? my answers were a big no! i wasn't sad at all.

by design, the technology architecture of uidai precludes even the possibility of profiling individuals for tracking their activities, the authority stated in the affidavit. dismissing the concerns of privacy advocates, the uidai falsely claimed that contention of the petitioners that on the basis of a single identifier, aadhaar will enable the government agencies to track and profile and do surveillance is completely unfounded and denied.
i personally experienced an extreme lack of sexual education which made the abuses i experienced all the more difficult, easter told huffpost. this lack of knowledge about sex and sexuality creates a greater vulnerability for children, teens, and young adults victimized by abuse because they have not been given language to understand what is happening to them, let alone the language to describe and report it to a safe adult.
the actor has a daughter, eleanor, with ex-husband christopher lambert. she later took on the role of stepmother during her nine-year marriage to josh brolin. since becoming a mom in 1993, lane has shared snippets of her experience, from matters of breastfeeding to work-life balance to parenting books.
environment plays a huge part in our mood, said saniyyah mayo, a licensed marriage and family therapist in los angeles. ensuring that i didn't stay in the house every day all day has helped me keep my sanity. even going from the bedroom to the living room can also help with maintaining a positive mood.

andrew scott, who plays the priest in fleabag, won best supporting actor in a comedy series.
you can take a page from me and do something for yourself that is positive and working toward a goal you had set for yourself during, or even before your marriage. i always knew i was going to finish school and be a psychologist, so i spent my first valentine's day in 9 hours of class, and did not feel the least bit sad about it. i focused on the fact that i was working hard towards a goal i had made for myself before i even knew who my ex was, and that i was one step closer to achieving it. this particular option also served as a welcome distraction, as it gave me something interesting and demanding to focus on for the whole day. now, you do not have to go to those extremes, but finding an activity that is rewarding and distracting is not a bad way to pass the time on this holiday.
in those early days of parenting, i turned passive-aggressive, angrily ignoring towers of dishes in the sink or laundry piles on the bathroom floor, treating him to increasing amounts of silence as days passed without him making a move to clear either and life with a baby created mountains more of each. he'd ask me what was wrong, and i'd grunt out nothing or i don't want to talk about it.

a key disputed section of hb2 required transgender people to use restrooms in many public buildings that corresponded to their sex at birth. it drew national condemnation and prompted several large corporations and sports teams to relocate events to other states or reconsider expanding in north carolina.
my mediumship door stays locked like a bank vault unless i am actively shifting my energy to do a reading. the psychic information i get is another story, though. i can't shut off or tune it out, but reading psychically is much less draining than reading mediumistically, and using it can be a helpful tool to navigate the world! i can also look to see if my kids have homework they are not telling me about, for example.
oh, and you're pretty. did anyone tell you that lately?
getting closure after a relationship ends can be healing and help you move forward. though you may be tempted to have this post-mortem conversation right away, don't rush into it. both you and your ex could benefit from some time to breathe and reflect.
ann brenoff a note left for the author by her recently deceased husband.
being under a stay-at-home order when i don't feel safe at home is frightening. i recently called my lawyer to tell him that the threats and constant bullying were getting to be more than i could handle and i needed to make a plan to leave earlier than september. my lawyer told me to make up with my husband, do my best to get along, wait until i could work for a few months at my new job, and hope that the courts reopen by july. i understood his reasoning and resolved to do whatever i could once again to be agreeable and endure this time amicably. it appears this will be yet another life stage during which i have to tolerate my husband, my freedom be damned.
i began asking for permission in 2016 and some financial help to publish the book. but i was refused both, she said. these were simple poems on nature and god, but i was told that this goes against the rules of our lives as nuns.
like most alt-right podcasters, grandpa lampshade spoke with a swaggering confidence about racially transforming the country. social media had made him important. made him a leader. anonymity made him unaccountable. there was no telling how many angry white men he'd helped push further down the path to extremism. grandpa lampshade mattered. he had influence.
as i entered, i held my breath, afraid of offending, afraid of being offended. scott's father was lying under a thin blanket, several tubes stringing from his arms to a machine. his eyes locked on mine immediately, and i found myself walking over to his good side to greet him.

it would understandably be a rough couple weeks to be lady gaga's ex, since watching your former girlfriend win an oscar, grammy, bafta and more is a special type of pain we wouldn't wish upon even our worst enemies.
after an unnamed source confirmed to people earlier this week that the pair were indeed an item, photos of them on a romantic beachside stroll have the rest of the internet convinced that their romance is officially a go.
we all know there's no perfect relationship out there, but if a marriage doesn't serve you anymore, what's the point of being in it? because you took some vows that were created years and years ago when people were dying at young ages?
admitting that love is blind, kardashian told stern that she was unaware of her estranged husband's infidelity for some time.
i've counseled men who've been willing to open up over coffee at starbucks on friday mornings before work or while walking the dog together, he told the huffington post. many couples with kids will say that they never have any alone time, but you can usually find it during the day-to-day activities of life if you think creatively.

he ended up going overboard with six, which caused a lot of smoke to spew out of the house, sending ridgik into a justified panic.
i walked my depressed self into a church rec room in los angeles with a bunch of sex and love addicts, after my therapist told me i had a major problem with relationships (shocker).
i asked him if he wanted to know my number, and he said he wasn't interested, she said. we've had a lot of other conversations about my past sexual experiences and serious relationships, so i know it's not from lack of interest or caring. i think he just thinks knowing the number isn't that important and that's fine with me.
the u.s. taxpayer bears the ultimate burden and threat of having to (repeatedly) bail out the gses. the fhfa - the gses' assigned federal regulator agency - has been working to find private sector companies willing to assume this roughly $200 billion of credit risk. as one could probably guess, this is no simple or easy task.
but there are other considerations aside from political ones. capitol hill has long been known as a grueling place to work, with low wages, no unionization and little accountability for members.
allie is hardly the only person choosing to be celibate ― after all, we're in a so-called millennial sex recession. and even couples who've gotten physical are starting to practice a kind of reverse celibacy, said tammy nelson, a sex therapist and the author of getting the sex you want.
over that period, there were 5,556 approvals for those seeking to bring minor spouses or fiancees, and 2,926 approvals by minors seeking to bring in older spouses, according to the data. additionally, there were 204 for minors by minors. petitions can be filed by u.s. citizens or permanent residents.
i went through a faith crisis following the death of my sixth child, mercy. though i considered myself an atheist for several years, i continued to attend services, in part because losing my friends and family members as well as my faith system was too much of an obstacle while i was in the midst of suicidal depression. but it is also true that even if i didn't believe in god anymore, i was still unable to disentangle all the parts of myself that had been raised mormon, including a kind of judgmentalism about those who left the mormon faith.
i just wanted to curl up in a fetal position with my baby, just smile at her and absorb her. she is pure sunshine.

my friends also fell in love with ethan the moment they met him. however, one thing that did concern my texan friends was that he couldn't two-step to save his life! we went to a country bar with one of my best girlfriends and when she took him on the floor for a spin, he not only stepped on her ― he fell on her. but other than the dancing, ethan was perfect in my friend's eyes.
it would seem that mat staver, the founder and chairman of liberty counsel, and his supporters are trying to prevent lgbtq people from being protected from lynching as a means to keep them from being protected from discrimination. an anti-lynching law is, according to staver in an interview he gave to the christian news siteonenewsnow, only a baby step to one day passing employment, housing and health care legislation that would offer protections to lgbtq people. thus lgbtq people's lives become a small sacrifice for the ideological comfort and control of the religious right. he and liberty counsel seem to care more about what people do in their sex lives than the violence and inequity that they experience because of their identities.

it's not uncommon to come into a marriage carrying debt. but, says zimmerman, the more debt you can eliminate and the more money you can save before your marriage, the better off you will be. why? not only will it reduce the potential for financial fights, but also, if something were to happen to your spouse or if your marriage doesn't last, it's always in your best interest to be able to take care of yourself, says zimmerman.
this is why therapists often suggest meeting more frequently, rather than extending sessions, when clients express a desire for more time.
the campaign has received some pushback from those who believe conversion therapy bans violate free speech and the right to religious freedom.

asked what gives her the most pleasure away from the ring, the quick-witted brie said, well, my husband ... just kidding. but, you know, honestly, my husband and i, we love gardening. we're really big into local food spots and farm-to-table spots and just kind of showcasing and using our platform to put local vendors on that.
if there is ever a question about whether any people should be protected from lynching, we have a problem. if there is a question about whether lgbtq people are made in the image of the god we claim, we have a problem. christians must recognize, particularly in the political realm, when we're failing to hold truly christlike belief and behavior.
for periods of time after the assault, a victim could continue to be in a friendship, a consensual sexual relationship and even a marriage with their rapist.
it's past time we protected lgbtq virginians from discrimination under the law. this bill will make us stronger and more inclusive of all ― i'm proud to support it, gov. ralph northam, a democrat, said in a statement.
lb: a bit of both? i also watched all nine of the released episodes, and i must say, like netflix did with the circle, those cliffhanger endings kept me wanting more. duh! i had to see these couples meet in person! i also had to know how diamond and carlton's volatile fight about his bisexuality would end. that said, i definitely found myself tuning out the segments on couples i didn't really care about ― giannina and damian, amber and barnett ― and absorbing scenes with the pairings who spoke more to the conceit of the show ― lauren and cameron, jessica and mark. and i also root for kelly and kenny because their relationship is very sweet.
the police officers declared openly that they could not protect [the pair] from attacks from homophobically minded citizens and organizations. this was a hidden threat, kochetkov said. therefore the decision was made that for now, they must leave russia.
until these these basic safety issues are resolved and greater protections are put in place to secure the security of lgbtiq people, equal marriage will continue to be a distant dream for much of the world.
the solution: they should definitely talk about shared responsibility, says silverman. sometimes it's going to be a lot more responsibility for one partner than the other because one might be working and the other one might not be. but they should talk about shared responsibility so that they don't get resentful.

although it seems so easy to travel the world, post a picture on instagram of the #ootd and create a blog and get vendors and advertisers on your page and etc., and yes, point in fact, people do make careers out of it but becoming a doctor, lawyer, engineer, pharmacist, business woman, consultant, therapist, entrepreneur, etc., should not be looked down upon nor overlooked.

as cheryl mills, who was deputy white house counsel in the clinton administration, explains, she chose to compartmentalize, to say, 'i might want to kill my husband, but i don't want the country to have to lose their president because i want to kill my husband.' most people can't do that. i wouldn't.

then she not-so-subtly sent some serious love (and again seemingly confirmed her marriage) to her longtime partner simon konecki saying, obviously, i can't go through those feelings because i'm married now. i've found my next person.
i think you know what i'm going to say, he said, looking down at me on the bed. i said i didn't.
that shows concern but it's not actually listening, deverich said. usually, quiet partners have learned in life not to bother expressing their feelings because they've been overrode by others who engage at a louder level.
unfortunately for the brazzels, their experience at carter tax service went downhill immediately after they told owner nancy fivecoate they were married. at that point, they said, fivecoate told them she couldn't file their taxes because doing so for a same-sex couple would violate her religious beliefs.

at first i tried to kid myself about the amount i was spending, but one day i started adding up all of our lego receipts and my mouth just dropped. i'd spent over $45,000 on lego bricks! as crazy as it sounds, i had justified a lot of it along the way because i knew how collectable lego sets are and saw them as part of our investment portfolio (more on that in a minute). but coming to grips with that number is part of what helped me start thinking about the many reasons why i love the wonderful world of lego so much. now, i'm finally at the point where i no longer feel any shame about this – and i've permanently come out of the toy closet, so to speak.
lauren: oh girl, i was too. i cannot watch that scene with me and my father without crying every time. if you played it now, i would start crying just because me and my father, we've always been so close. i'm a daddy's girl, for sure. and so it really meant a lot to me for him to just embrace this. like, this is my husband and i know we met in an odd way, but him grilling cam, i feel like that's anything that any protective father would do for his kid.

there is one moment in which we see miranda with her guard down after her marriage falls apart while her enemies are circling to oust her. is there anything i can do? andy asks, awkwardly acknowledging her boss' vulnerability. your job, miranda replies firmly. it's one area miranda is always on top of, and it's a job andy never fully commits herself to do. instead, she's always complaining about miranda to colleagues and failing to own her own professional ambitions.

you don't see a lot of black women in reality tv being the object of affection or in the forefront or being admired, she said. i'm a quirky, kind of nerdy black girl. kind of awkward, too. so it's great because a lot of people are seeing me and i feel like i'm representing a thing that wasn't there before.
the reality is, you're probably going to need more than one amazing, whirlwind week together on vacation to determine whether you're compatible, said stephanie buehler, a psychologist and sex therapist in southern california.
she was politicized while very young. one tale is that she begged her father to attend a welcome home ceremony for soldiers after the second world war, but at the city hall, they were not allowed in because it was for whites only.
if there's anything i've learned in my decades of political work, it's that without lived experience at the decision-making table, even well-meaning policymakers often don't do what is required. today we're seeing billions of dollars going not only toward opioid-specific treatment protocols and increased public safety measures but toward a revival of the same old scare tactics from nancy reagan's failed just say no campaign.
saniyyah mayo, a licensed marriage and family therapist in los angeles, compared therapy sessions to high school classes. each class presents a set amount of time that students spend learning about a specific section of the curriculum. afterward, they can process the information and even explore it in a different setting through homework.

the church made its position on queer sexuality even clearer in 2016, when it updated a web page meant to serve as a resource for gay and lesbian mormons and their allies. the website emphasized that the church believes it's ok to be mormon and gay ― as long as members don't act out on what the church calls same-sex attraction. the page shares the stories of mormons who identify as gay but have pledged to pursue a life of celibacy or who have committed themselves to mixed-orientation relationships.

chances are, their relationships have frequently ended after intimacy developed, she said. they're looking for perfection but usually find some flaw, and end the relationship so they can continue their search.
my wife had a really rough 2018. her best friend died in a drunk driving accident, and her mom was diagnosed with cancer. she and i have always lived a fit and healthy lifestyle, but her depression has gotten really bad. she's distant with our kids, has stopped exercising and has (and i really don't mean to sound like a jerk) gained a worrying amount of weight. my wife is normally a superwoman kind of mom ― she goes to work every day, cooks and cleans, reads stories to our daughters every night, and is at every ballet and soccer practice. i'm helping out as much as i can, but it's been challenging. i love my wife and want to help her start off the new year on the right foot and get her mental and physical health back. i'm not even sure she realizes how bad it's gotten. what can i do?
knowing that i have given back to my community helps me to keep perspective on everything happening around us, she said.

many people rightly see jan. 6 as a tipping point when trump's anti-democratic tendencies and conspiracy-mongering finally provoked a genuine disaster. but it was also the crescendo of his yearslong embrace of misogyny and toxic behavior toward women. trump has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to rape, by more than 20 women. he filled his cabinet and senior staff with accused domestic abusers. a month before the 2016 presidential election, he was caught on leaked audio bragging about grabbing women by the pussy.

i truly believe that we all get to decide what feels right for us in our own sex life, marin said. celibacy may not be super common, but that doesn't mean it's not a valid choice.

1) he intentionally made turning on a tv in our house harder than it needs to be.
i've tried validating and allowing for my own emotions to be, patel said. leaning into whatever i am feeling and talking about it with my husband.
when i shared this experience with my therapist i could see from the look on her face that she was struggling to understand where i was coming from. her body language communicated that she was uncomfortable with my desire to stop being my family's main caregiver, even though my children are adults. and when we discussed my desire for my career goals to now take precedence over my husband's, she started arguing with me.
the fix: to break this pattern, bring more conscious awareness to your communication habits, smith said. practice letting your partner finish their thought before you jump in with your two cents.
as odd as it felt to see a straightforward romance adaptation dissected as if it were a failed attempt at matching jane austen, it makes sense. because the genre is generally regarded with such disdain in mainstream culture, it occupies a rather marginalized niche. a non-romance reader is unlikely to have a firm grasp of many things about the genre, outside of well-worn jokes about throbbing members and fabio's flowing hair, and though romance is among the bestselling genres in the book industry, it's rarely adapted for tv or film.
as such, i was always somewhere in the dating life cycle: in the heat of passion, recovery or hunting once more for those dizzy, eclectic times. each relationship was effectively a rebound, as i never gave myself time to heal or self-reflect. without carving out crucial breathing space, i'd keep wearing the habits of yesteryear's loves and tarring every man with the same brush.
i would often riff on the homoerotic subtext that's already present in sports, or otherwise look for a queer point of view by injecting drag, bear culture, leather culture, etc. various team rivalries also came up a lot, often in a relationship context (mixed red sox/yankees marriages, for example). there are a few current (for the time) events comics around gay marriage and various sports stars either coming out or saying something homophobic and i'd comment on it.
it's also fun to look at other individual accounts to see the breakdown of congressional followers. for example, here are the results for katy perry, who was one of hillary clinton's most high-profile supporters in 2016 ― she's followed by 22 house democrats and one republican:
for decades, limbaugh was associated with the far-right fringes of the republican party. in 1995, only days after timothy mcveigh bombed a federal building in oklahoma city, president bill clinton issued a blistering attack at a speech in minneapolis in which he said the nation's airwaves ... spread hate, they leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable. … it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech and behavior.
king lost interest in school following his father's death, barely finished high school and never enrolled in college. he became a self-proclaimed radio freak, spending countless hours listening to broadcasts of baseball games to help fill a void left by his father's death.
i was destroyed and couldn't fathom recovering.
15. taraji p. henson: hell, even the president of the united states — four of them, in fact — were raised by single mothers. nevertheless, mention that you're a single mom, and all-too-many of us still have to cut through a thick, gristly layer of stigma before we're given our proper due.
the letter posted this week and an accompanying q&a posted online don't provide details about what same-sex romantic behaviors are and aren't allowed. but it seems to shut the door on the idea that gay and lesbian couples will be allowed to kiss and hold hands on campus like their heterosexual classmates.
sadly, 2016 seems to have been the year of the celebrity split. there were a number of celebrity match-ups that melted down throughout the year, one more shocking than the next. while some of these may have been expected, others left us reeling from the abrupt endings of our beloved a-list pairings. if we are all being honest, these events are like the proverbial train wreck we just cannot avoid reading about if given the opportunity to peek inside what happened. while satisfying our voyeuristic curiosities about all things celebrity, we can also use these events as a reminder to take stock of our own lives looking to the future for better relationship trends in 2017. taking stock of the biggest 2016 break-ups ....

this story has been corrected to show that the coroner now says the oldest victim was 89, not 93.
but when that buzzfeed article came out, i wasn't prepared for what came after it. people were dm'ing me with threats, calling me a liar. blogs were laughing at me, saying i was too old to let r. kelly abuse me or how i should have known better. yes, i'd heard all of the stories about him in the past, but i didn't believe them because, like most fans, i didn't want to. i thought that since he was acquitted, the rumors couldn't have been true. i never imagined this is what would happen to me.
1. communicate consistently, but at a cadence that works for both of you.
i know it's all been for the best, but i still think about the what-ifs: what if i didn't try hard enough? what if we could've made it work? what if my own happiness wasn't worth the emotional strain i put on my husband and my two kids?
it's time to add a few things to your pre-wedding to-do list. because, according to our experts, the months before you get married should be more about discovering your true desires and setting yourself up for success rather than picking out a color palette. here are eight things you must do before the big day.
not to mention, i'd grown bored of the monotony of the dating process and bogged down by the mental clutter that came with it. there had to be a better use for my time than feigning interest in suitor x and his life story. simply put, dating was no longer fun.
i might always feel some guilt at changing the shape of my family, but i also know that i'll be a happier, healthier person ― and thus, a better mother ― because i did just that. that's what i come back to each time the guilt takes hold. and i know that the more firmly i ground myself in this new life, the more that waves of confidence in that will come.
although 45- or 50-minute sessions are the industry standard, it's not a hard rule across every case. for couples or families, therapists offer longer sessions, usually 90 minutes.
i've been with my husband for 10 years and married for eight. i don't take anything for granted. i've seen a lot of relationships that went south just because someone stopped paying attention to them. i see a lot of small mistakes that build into big problems. i've learned from the pain i witness every day. i consciously work on avoiding those mistakes myself. i try not to let my professional stress bleed into my personal life and i try not to cross-examine my husband. but i'm human!
after a decade of marriage, negendank still vividly remembers posing the question to her husband when she was 20. she wanted to know everything: what it was like, who they were, how her s.o. felt about the encounters now.
you won't believe this when i tell you, but i felt relief when we finally heard that she was in jail. just to know where she was was, that she wasn't dead, was all that mattered in that moment, she said. then, it hits you. our lives have changed forever.
tidying up involves getting rid of a lot of stuff you don't need, and kondo has a process for that too: thank each item before putting it in the no pile.
after cobbling together their own training on female sexual health, they take a multidisciplinary medical approach to female sexuality instead of simply shunting patients off to talk therapy.
lauren: cameron is close with damian.
perhaps your mean inner voice shows up more frequently when you're at work: how can you not figure out this project? most people could do it in their sleep. maybe it lingers when you're with your children: you were late to the field trip? again? or maybe debbie downer has become a third wheel in your marriage: every other wife makes her husband dinner and lets him play golf on the weekend. you'll be lucky if you're still married to this man six months from now.
why not teach at a school that welcomes everyone, instead of choosing one that won't serve lgbtq kids, kids of lgbtq parents? said jodee winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs at the human rights campaign, in a statement to huffpost. the pences never seem to miss an opportunity to show their public service only extends to some.

it was important to both of us that we were equally present parents and stayed in a positive relationship that would only benefit our daughter, but it was obvious that our relationship had reached an end. while he felt it was depressing, i felt it was liberating. he didn't want to get a divorce, so i told him about conscious uncoupling. we were a family and always will be. he will always be the father of my daughter. i will always be the mother of his daughter. we still respected each other as adults and parents but didn't want to be married anymore.

in a perfect, world you're going to meet somebody and have a family, and live happily ever after.
conflict is inevitable in any partnership — and long-distance couples aren't immune to the occasional disagreement. but when you try to address these issues with your partner, pay attention to how they respond. are they committed to talking through them? or do they routinely brush off your concerns? an unwillingness to address these problems now could indicate they're not in it for the long haul.

and so, bleary-eyed and sleep-deprived from new parenthood, we got married. we passed the baby back and forth between us, at one point setting them down to sleep on a meditation mat. we stood in front of a room of people, about half of whom didn't realize they were about to be at a wedding at all, and re-read the vows we had written two years, and a lifetime, before.

that optimism was pierced this week when administrators at the university owned by the church of jesus christ of latter day saints clarified in a letter posted online wednesday that same-sex romantic behavior was still not allowed on campus. the letter said the recent revision to what is known as the honor code didn't change the moral standards of the church or the faith's opposition to same-sex marriage.

i typically don't bring it up to acquaintances unless someone asks me directly what she does, or unless they express an interest in the paranormal. the topic of psychic mediums can be somewhat polarizing ― some people are fascinated by it and other people believe it is impossible. i honestly don't blame intelligent, rational people for being skeptical. i don't know that i would believe it either unless i had firsthand experience with it.
receiving gifts: send your partner a thoughtful gift in the mail — whether it's for a birthday, holiday, anniversary or just because. and remember that the care and effort that goes into picking the item for them is more important than its price tag. it doesn't need to be fancy or expensive to count, mascardo said. it could be a book or a candle that you think they will enjoy. show that you pay attention to their interests and preferences.
you need to track your family generation by generation until you get back to the reservation or other location where you believe your native american ancestor lived. using u.s. federal census records is the easiest way to do this research. (ancestry has a great article on census search secrets if you want some tips.) the 1910 census included an indian census at the end of each county's enumeration that lists blood quantum and tribal affiliation. these records can be gold if your ancestor appears.

still, i was too nervous to tell other people. the love felt ethereal, airy, uncontainable. in that misty bliss, there was both unlimited possibility and dreamy surreality. for months i insisted that we let our relationship be just ours; i didn't want anyone else to take away the everythingness of the feelings i was finally willing to have.
most recently, pitt requested that the couple's custody documents be sealed and accused jolie of having no self-regulating mechanism to preclude sensitive information from being placed in the public record, or she has other motives. in turn, jolie's lawyers filed documents agreeing to keep the case private but responded stating pitt was terrified that the public will learn the truth.

throughout these last few years of hate-mongering screeds, jeffreys has made a deliberate effort to stop just shy of instructing his fans to commit violence against enemies of the white race. it's not that he's a peace-loving hipp[y], he said — he just doesn't want to get kicked offline and end up in prison for endorsing bloodshed too explicitly.

using money to control your spouse can seriously damage your relationship. it can help to set a specific dollar amount for each partner's discretionary spending, or to agree that you'll discuss any purchase over a pre-agreed limit, solomon said. the goal is to diminish the idea that one partner controls the other.
recognizing your own feelings and sharing them with your partner can help you process whatever you're going through and bring the two of you closer together. it may be easier to express positive emotions like joy, but it's important to open up about negatives ones, like frustration, sadness and shame, too.

as you can imagine, most couples come into a relationship with different financial situations. one person might be earning more, have credit card debt or student loans, better healthcare benefits at work, or a higher 401(k) match, etc. if you start thinking as a team, deciding which levers to pull and how to approach saving and debt decisions becomes more straightforward because you're looking at things from a big-picture perspective.
absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. there are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it's time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.

especially if you've just moved to a new city, it's so easy to let the dating apps become your social life. it's harder to look for social situations where you might have to make more of an effort. i have moments when i want to feel desired and so i get on grindr, paul says. i upload a shirtless picture and i start getting these messages telling me i'm hot. it feels good in the moment, but nothing ever comes of it, and those messages stop coming after a few days. it feels like i'm scratching an itch, but it's scabies. it's just going to spread. the worst thing about the apps, though, and why they're relevant to the health disparity between gay and straight men, is not just that we use them a lot. it is that they are almost perfectly designed to underline our negative beliefs about ourselves. in interviews that elder, the post-traumatic stress researcher, conducted with gay men in 2015, he found that 90 percent said they wanted a partner who was tall, young, white, muscular and masculine. for the vast majority of us who barely meet one of those criteria, much less all five, the hookup apps merely provide an efficient way to feel ugly. paul says he's electrified waiting for rejection as soon as he opens them. john, the former consultant, is 27, 6-foot-1 and has a six-pack you can see through his wool sweater.

gay people have really had to fight hard to be accepted, and there's a sense of understanding in that community and they have no interest in judging me for being anything other than myself. i'm thankful for that and thankful for the courage they've given me. as easy as it may seem to be me when you're looking in at my life from the outside, the courage to be totally and unapologetically myself doesn't come easy. here i am, a 46-year-old woman who will not apologize for who she is or what she does, and that can make people uncomfortable. but i refuse to alter erika jayne in any way to make anyone else feel comfortable. that's just never going to happen. so having these men in my life who have inspired me by taking the same stand and saying the same things about themselves — this is who i am and that's not going to change for you or anyone else — makes me feel incredibly grateful.

researchers say this kind of training, deliberately trying to appear more masculine and taking on a different sex role, is just one of the ways gay men pressure each other to attain sexual capital, the equivalent of going to the gym or plucking our eyebrows. the only reason i started working out was so i would seem like a feasible top, martin says. when he first came out, he was convinced that he was too skinny, too effeminate, that bottoms would think he was one of them. so i started faking all this hyper-masculine behavior. my boyfriend noticed recently that i still lower my voice an octave whenever i order drinks. that's a remnant of my first few years out of the closet, when i thought i had to speak in this christian bale batman voice to get dates. grant, a 21-year-old who grew up on long island and now lives in hell's kitchen, says he used to be self-conscious about the way he stood—hands on hips, one leg slightly cocked like a rockette. so, his sophomore year, he started watching his male teachers for their default positions, deliberately standing with his feet wide, his arms at his sides. these masculinity norms exert a toll on everyone, even their perpetrators. feminine gay men are at higher risk of suicide, loneliness and mental illness. masculine gay men, for their part, are more anxious, have more risky sex and use drugs and tobacco with greater frequency.

if you're a bisexual in a heterosexual relationship, other people will just assume you're straight, which makes you feel invisible, salway said. and then if you try to join the queer community, you find that there's very little recognition or representation of your experiences. one of the greatest risks for suicide is feeling like you don't matter or you don't belong. that erasure is a huge challenge for bisexual people.

i couldn't be perfect and i couldn't earn a place in paradise. my own expectations were less grand but still meaningful to me. i tried to be honest, to do no harm, to leave people in a better state for having known me. with this in my mind, i was relatively unmoved by occasional poor reactions from family members to my career. i was a pornographer of sorts, but being an ethical pornographer is something i will never feel ashamed of. and 9-year-old me would be flabbergasted to discover that we can work hard when we know we're shaping our own future. i can't imagine she'd be ashamed of me. i want to call back through the years and tell her she will be a model after all ― and that it would probably be useful if she paid some attention to her multiplication tables.
as humans, we tend to take on the emotions of the people around us. researchers refer to this phenomenon of catching someone else's feelings as emotional contagion. it happens because we unconsciously imitate the other person's body language or facial expressions. then, through a variety of physiological and neurological processes, we actually feel the emotions we mimicked — and then act on them, wharton school management professor sigal barsade wrote for the harvard business review.

while brutal honesty and truth often slice deep into the jugular of life, transparency for being known for who you are is a blessing that eradicates guilt, shame, and self-loathing, opening one's self, and hopefully others to the light of living truth for truth's sake. in the light of matt's truth, his real truth, he and luanne are building a new foundation that embraces the reality that who you are is who you are, even though at times it hurts and brings up anger and confusion. however, both matt and luanne have found that any attempt to fight your truth only compounds the darkness, hurt, and pain -- which in turn, eventually, manifests as a person living a pretend life and having pretend relationships.

hours later, i read a tweet from donald trump in which he called covid-19 the chinese virus (the first of several times in recent days he's done that and a term he defended at his press briefing on wednesday). my concern was no longer just about my mom's vulnerability to the coronavirus. simmering worries i've had about our ethnicity became icy fear as i scrolled through the comments. trump's language and the expected ripple effects feel very dangerous, even here in canada, where statements from leaders south of the border have incited and inspired people to behave badly.
4. they're rude to the waitstaff.
meyers ripped into trump for saying that in theory the virus will miraculously go away in spring as the weather warms up.
on tuesday night, former vice president joe biden was building a delegate lead over sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) after a surprisingly successful super tuesday a week earlier, which had followed a month of decent poll results but lackluster debate performances and a series of biden's typical gaffes.
5. point out that a good prenup benefits the lower-earning spouse, too.
as a boy on the cusp of puberty, only just beginning to realize i was different, this wasn't a nurturing message, especially coming from a trusted teacher and echoed enthusiastically by everyone i had ever called a friend. i remember wanting to turn invisible, imagining they could tell that maybe, just maybe, i was one of those perverts.
i read the ramblers in one delicious gulp last fall and i haven't been able to stop thinking about (or texting aidan about) the characters since. the three protagonists, clio an ornithologist who carries deep scars from growing up with a mentally ill mother, her best friend from yale, smith, who comes from one of new york's perfect and hugely wealthy families and is recovering from the sudden end of the engagement that she thought would begin her own happily ever after, and tate, a college classmates of theirs who has returned to new york in the wake of his marriage ending and his company's highly lucrative sale.
that wasn't the end of her story. because she had been enduring pelvic pain for so long, she had developed vaginismus, an involuntary clamping down of the pelvic floor muscles that made penetration difficult or painful. after the surgery, it took another eight months of pelvic floor therapy to help her ease back into sex with her husband. by then, she was 30 years old.
marina fang: i gotta say, it was pretty underwhelming. i, too, adored the first movie — it was charming as hell and thawed my cold, cynical heart. its release came a time when the rom-com genre was having a renaissance, and it was a part of a wave of movies and tv that achieved the platonic ideal of becoming more inclusive and culturally specific without being strictly about that. but both follow-ups have lacked the inventiveness of the first movie, which was such a brilliant fusion of leaning into rom-com tropes while also playing around with them in bold, new ways. this one felt especially formulaic and saccharine. and even as a form of escapism, it didn't really deliver for me. i felt constantly at a remove and only minimally invested in it. it left me wondering if there's a limit to pandemic escapism, and whether it was the movie itself, hitting that pandemic wall where i can't tell up from down anymore, or a combination of both. claire, where did you land on this one?
correction: a previous version of this story incorrectly gave rushing's age as 37 and murphy's as 40.
the beautiful bureaucrat by helen phillips
since launching her presidential campaign, sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) has faced questions about her mistreatment of her staff, as reported by huffpost and other outlets. former aides said she berated them, physically threw objects at them, made them do her personal chores, undermined their advancement to other jobs and created an anxiety-ridden workplace that led to high staff turnover and trouble hiring new talent.
gomez praised biden for what he called the new president's moving witness on how his faith brought him solace in times of tragedy and his commitment to the poor but said bishops had to proclaim all the truth of the gospel.

he kept looking back and forth from scott to me, his gaze landing on our hands, which were tightly clasped together. after a few moments, his right hand, which still had some mobility, reached for my free one. once he had it, he held it up to scott and mouthed the word, beautiful.
the beginning of a new year is a time many people make an effort to organize or de-clutter ― but how can you keep it going, instead of falling back into your old, messy ways?

in 2009, police responded to an incident of family violence in which bennett assaulted his sister and almost poured bleach on his 2-year-old nephew. he was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, malicious destruction of property and reckless endangerment. in response to huffpost's request for bennett's records, one record was withheld because it pertained to a child abuse case.
the secc heralded a quantum shift in the way the indian state understood the question of poverty and entitlements. for decades, indian policymakers had defined the poor as families whose annual incomes placed them below a threshold defined as the poverty line.
a better (and less expensive) solution, she said, would be to split the debt in a fair manner, such as 50-50 or proportionately according to your incomes. if you have a loan or credit card in your name that your ex agrees to handle, it's a good idea to refinance the debt into their name. if they don't qualify to refinance due to poor credit or unsteady income, one option is to sell off the backing asset (such as a car) and pay off the loan. that way, when you split, you each take the debt that's in your name and you're done, cochran said.
this proposal is fit for a couple of dinosaurs lovers.
on the other hand, many couples in a mixed orientation marriage bravely join forces, standing tall in love, vowing to get support for overcoming the wicked temptation of same-sex attraction. prayer, therapy, retreats, hard work, and tear-stained conversations litter the landscape of a marriage in defense mode, all in the name of make it work, just make it work! however, even the most resolute attempts to stay afloat in the life ring of until death do us part, find many couples surrendering to the truth that fixing the same-sex attraction, or fixing it enough, as matt, the husband you're about to meet, said in his tedx talk, isn't going to happen. to quell the truth of a spouse embittered in their own internal tug of war with who they are vs. who the rest of the world expects them to be is practically a death sentence in and of itself.
words of affirmation : shoot them an encouraging email reminding them how smart and capable they are before a big presentation at work. or comment on how good their hair looks or how cute their smile is when they send you a selfie. be as specific as possible, mascardo said. try to say in detail what you love and appreciate about them. for example, instead of saying, 'you're so kind,' say, 'i love the way you always smile and say hello to people when they pass you on the street.'
3) when the men go off to war is structured into three different sections: departure, absence and homecoming. the titles feed into both the macro themes of the sections, and on a micro level, the connective tissue from poem to poem. was this structure planned, or something that you decided on as you were compiling your various works into the collection?
so many people marry somebody at the wrong time of their life. they were tired of being single, they met somebody when they were super young.
i have been able to read palms since i was 17. my grandma taught me. she used to read palms at parties, until at one gathering she sensed that someone was a murderer. this didn't stop her from teaching me, although she never read my palm, nor anyone in our family out of fear of what she might see.

at one point i said, 'i'm really sorry that you have to just listen to me talk,' she said. it's a running joke in our marriage that i talk a lot.
i have been there and i didn't think i would say i don't one day either.
actually it means that you are a very down-to-earth person and a good friend. they're lovely.
every single time my kids showed her the christmas gifts i got them, she would make some kind of snarky comment.
i don't have the confidence that my government's going to take care of me, said arns.
i felt the elation of attachment and the dejection of it not being reciprocated. i was let down, and had to let others down, and had to learn to be content with both. i learned ― and am learning ― about new people, with interests and life stories vastly different from my own. in meeting with others in an atmosphere of such complete emotional openness, interpersonal barriers i once thought immutable seemed to fall away. i've forged deep connections, some of which, with luck, could endure for a long time.
no one is perfect, but i think we would all agree that each of us strives to continue to grow and evolve into a person we like more and more with each day.
it's a little bit of jane austen meets 'gossip girl' with maybe '49 shades [of grey'], he told the wrap in a december interview. critics and viewers, at their wits' ends trying to make sense of this sexy, gossipy, frothy regency costume drama, also tried to characterize it in terms of beloved on-screen classics: pride and prejudice, downton abbey, and, yes, gossip girl. these comparisons convey some bafflement, an uncertainty about how to categorize a show that isn't really a realist historical drama, nor an edgy satire, nor a campy soap.
part your lips slightly and exhale with a whooshing sound through your mouth. close your lips and inhale silently through your nose. count to four in your head. hold your breath for seven seconds. exhale (with a whoosh sound) for eight seconds, she said. practice this mindlessly to let your brain relax. complete this cycle for four full breaths.
besides, who am i to get upset at anybody else? that dude who cut me off, and that person taking forever to check out, and that delivery driver who hasn't shown up, they're not carrying out some personal vendetta. they're just trying to get somewhere, and do their job, and grab some laundry detergent on their way home. just like i am.
at the time, many people assured us that eventually the tides would turn and we would get that coveted legal status. i wasn't so certain. as the gay marriage issue made its way through the courts, we were treated to the same tired old arguments again and again; namely that people like us weren't suitable to be parents, and therefore shouldn't get to file our taxes together either.
when the orange city woman checked her jewelry box, she found her rings were missing, as were several other pieces of jewelry, including a diamond ring that belonged to her grandmother. the total value of the stolen property was about $6,270, according to the sheriff's office.

christian denmon, a divorce attorney in tampa, florida:
i was trying to be honest about what was happening. i think anyone who's ever had grief or loss, that shock and the panic and the understanding that you don't know what's going on was really important. i think, as a writer and as a columnist, i write about myself a lot. i find myself gauging where i am in situations. during the grief cake period in my life, i certainly was aware. i would say something and go, oh. i just said that. wow. i said that thing. i told that person i didn't want to talk to them, and i walked away. i went somewhere else, and i thought i wouldn't normally do that. i thought, who cares. i'm a widow. i don't care. no one gets to judge me for anything i'm doing. i didn't slap anybody.

17. amanda stanton: i decided instead of being embarrassed of my failed marriage and ashamed of being a single mother, i was going to own it. being the best mother you can be and giving your kids the best life possible has nothing to do with your relationship status and you don't have to be happily married to have a 'picture-perfect family.'
her father was one of five brothers, all of whom chose to stay in india following the partition. one sister moved to pakistan with her husband's family. they learnt how she had suffered from depression and died in a mental health facility in karachi, almost a decade after her passing.
even socially conscious mcs like the beloved nas, who created the 90's hit if i ruled the world with the soulful lauryn hill, are guilty. in the song, he imagines what he would do if he had complete control over the world: for the men, he would open every door in attica and send them to africa, freeing prisoners and returning them home. for women, every girl i would meet would go down town. in nas' perfect world, the men would be free and the women would be virtual sex slaves. and like lauryn hill, the whole world sings along with tracks that reduce black women to sex objects in a culture that black women birthed.
the oscar-winning director has recently boasted about his spanish skills, joking about how his eldest daughter, violet, is studying the language and keeping him on his toes.
realize it's who she is. she's not happy and is looking for you to engage. she cuts you down because she sees things that reflect poorly on her. it's not about you. classic signs of a narcissist.

a messy home can make us feel overwhelmed, helpless and anxious, she said. often times i find couples have different ideas of where an item 'belongs' within the home. frustration arises when an item cannot be located and tensions build within the partnership. the results are cluttered counter tops, stuffed drawers and repeated purchasing of the same 'lost' items.
given the absence of big studio promotion, the final six episodes of eastsiders debuted in december to minimal fanfare. as in previous seasons, however, word-of-mouth has proven to be the show's selling point. in january, the series was a new york times critics pick, while cosmopolitan featured it alongside schitt's creek and rupaul's drag race on its list of the 15 best lgbtq+ shows.
there's certain things ― and i think anyone in a marriage would agree with this ― you just don't. you just leave that. we're here now and it's all good. we don't need to hash up all that stuff.

my number one piece of advice is definitely to stop virtually stalking your ex, madden said.
will things between my husband and i progress into the mutually empathetic utopia i imagine? only time will tell. one or both of us could prove emotionally unfit to sustain an open arrangement and our experiment could fail. and there are sure to be bumps, some jarring, even if we succeed. i still have moments when i think i ought to consider separation as an act of self-preservation, when i wonder whether the mental load of our new arrangement destroys more than it builds. inevitably, though, those darker moments are followed by the conviction that the true act of self-preservation is to maintain courage in the pursuit of happiness ― to follow whatever paths, no matter how unorthodox, lead to that place of self-actualization. and for now, at least, the most promising path involves walking with my husband, side by side.
the ministry of rural development, the uidai and the registrar of general of india under the union home ministry did not respond to huffpost india's queries despite repeated reminders.
i noticed the beginning of the book is written almost in real time. i felt like i was really present with you, and i wondered how soon after your husband had died did you start writing your thoughts and your feelings?
we adjourn to a group date on a boat headed to the beach. at the beach, the women play volleyball and show off their hot pre-baby bodies. nick, it's a feast for the senses. corinne gets upset that she didn't get enough attention so she goes off to take a nap. nick goes after her to get her back, which annoys the neonatal nurse. then, jasmine gets uber-competitive during the game, out of apparent frustration that she hasn't gotten a one-on-one yet. and something must be in the air, because vanessa also appears to be having somewhat of a nervous breakdown about not having enough time with nick. this group date is going awry, with all the women resenting nick. even the calm neonatal nurse starts to cry! nick's voiceover indicates that he's aware that the date is devolving into a disaster. what an insightful guy.
he previously posted a photo with the @dudewithsign instagram account about his refusal to shave, while promoting his latest work, changes. the new album was released earlier this month along with a revealing 10-part docuseries, justin bieber: seasons,″ that takes fans behind the curtain of the singer's sometimes-troubled public persona.
i want to know in my heart our kids will only be little for so long, so we'll cherish and nurture this gentle space in their lifetimes, where we get to be parents, and partners, and a family. i do believe this, but i know also life can be unfair.
to help promote his album, timberlake perpetuated the idea that spears was the reason the two broke up. he also poked fun at her 2002 movie crossroads and made coy suggestions that the two had had a sexual relationship — despite spears' saying earlier in her career that she wanted to remain a virgin until marriage.
being in an interracial relationship, i wanted to really just live my life authentically, speed told hosts leigh blickley and emma gray. i wanted to talk about, 'what about our children?' ... it's sad. i mean, we are in 2020, so it really shouldn't be an issue, but it's real life.
let's talk about humor. your story is so sad, and yet it's the funniest memoir i've ever read. could you speak to that?
i have always felt better about myself, past, present, and future, when i've been single. between relationships or even now, i've always found life easier to work out and connect with on my own. i'm not saying there aren't successful individuals who have been married before, but i just don't see myself connecting as well to who i am and what i want for myself when i'm connected to someone else.
also me: planning jennifer aniston & brad pitt's second wedding — ally reid (@ashallann) february 16, 2018
i wasn't the girl who dreamed of a great big wedding. marriage to me was never a must and i believed in commitment without the certificate; yet i knew without a doubt that i wanted to marry this man. so i said yes.
then, in recent weeks, stories emerged about biden and prewett that seemed to predict the beginning of the end. biden began telling a bizarre story about how he had been arrested trying to visit nelson mandela in prison — despite the fact that it hadn't happened. (maybe the anecdote was meant to be a hail mary after biden's earlier missteps on racial issues, which included an outdated defense of his anti-busing position in the 1970s.) prewett revealed that she was saving herself for marriage, obliquely suggesting to weber that she would not be able to go forward with their relationship if he slept with the other remaining women, despite producer-sanctioned intimacy being one of the show's main gambits.

the times call for self-care more than ever. - patrick tully, marriage and family therapist

melissa mcsorley found herself researching which apple varieties existed in the 1960s, one of many specifics that made mad men so precise. susan spungen became a hand double for meryl streep, trussing a duck in julie & julia as if she were the one portraying the legendary julia child. christine tobin set off a hotel fire alarm at 4 a.m. while searing pork chops so frances mcdormand could gnaw on the bones in the hbo miniseries olive kitteridge.
she was smart, she was sexy, she was funny, she was physical, soderbergh recalled. working with her as a director, if i were to give her a note, she had a dancer's pride in being able to do your note exactly the way you described it immediately. … i certainly felt like we were catching her at the perfect time. she was clearly on a trajectory, and i felt, 'we're gonna get a lot of props for delivering her at a moment where she's blowing up. let's be smart, let's be early adopters.'
naturally, they're dressed to the nines. the series' costume designer, ellen mirojnick, brings the fashion of 19th century england back to life with vibrant colors; airy, era-specific silhouettes; tons of embroidery and lots of outlandish prints.
jeffreys' message is virtually indistinguishable from the conspiratorial ravings of his colleagues: white people, he claims, are the victims of a world order controlled by the jews, who are actively replacing white americans with black and brown invaders. this is the central and most hackneyed of white supremacist conspiracy theories, one that gives aggrieved race warriors an eternal enemy to rail against and blame for their own shortcomings. jeffreys faults jewish people for everything from communism to the sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
just look at the amount of effort our enemies go through to try and choke out the daily stormer through limiting fundraising ability, he said in january 2017. what do you think would happen if we gave them the opportunity to declare us all as being a part of some sort of terrorist organization or something? at the very least, we would not have our platforms anymore ― and at the worst, we would all be bunking up in a federal prison somewhere.
early this morning, i stood with our toddler in the kitchen.

i offered to coordinate one wedding for free. the bride asked me to place some ready-made, simple centerpieces on the tables as she was a diy kind of bride. during our meetings she assured me that all i had to do is place ready-made bouquets into the vases. when the day finally came, i couldn't find the mentioned bouquets, only the tightly packed shipping boxes. inside, i found roses with thorns and leaves on, uncut and unprepared. i had only one hour to create 15 centerpieces and i did it because i knew my reputation was at stake. i left pretty traumatized that day. the bride didn't even say 'thank you.' i don't suppose their relationship is built on a strong foundation because of that. if they treat others badly, you can expect they will treat each other the same way. ― dybala
rev. ashley easter, an abuse victim advocate who was raised in an ifb church in virginia, said that it's common for children in these communities to not receive adequate education about sex and sexuality. (in her victim impact statement, jackson said that she was raised in an extremely sheltered and religious atmosphere, with no sex education other than to keep herself pure until marriage.)
for clients, this timing may make it easier to see a therapist during a lunch hour or just before work. for therapists with back-to-back sessions, the 10 or 15-minute break offers the opportunity to write progress notes about the client they just saw, return calls and emails, handle billing, take a bathroom break, get a glass of water or even just breathe.

earlier this week, the chicago fire star shocked fans of the former couple when he liked a comment shading gaga that read stoked you got away from gaga. #hollyweird.
there are no nationwide statistics on child marriage, but data from a few states suggests it is far from rare. state laws generally set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, yet every state allows exceptions. most states let 16- and 17-year-olds marry if they have parental consent, and several states — including new york, virginia and maryland — allow children under 16 to marry with court permission.
along with jay-z, the animated short in a heartbeat will be honored this year. last year, honorees included her story, a short form dramedy series about two trans women in la, we've been around, a series of short films highlighting trans figures throughout history, and sin ir más lejos, a song by gema corredera about queer love.
i know according to the church and the bible and everything else, we're supposed to make that marriage work. but a lot of the times the marriage doesn't work because the people no longer work well together.
when our younger cousin came to visit us, a neighbor kid threw her to the ground, shoved snow into her face, and called her a chink. overcome with rage and protectiveness, my sister and i pulled him off and chased him to the door of his house, where we were met by his unimpressed parents. we went inside and confessed what we did to our father, worried that he'd find out about it eventually. he didn't waste a moment before announcing, you have to stand up to people like that your whole life.
like many of her friends and family, lynn was eager for the rollout of the covid-19 vaccine, and to be eligible for the shot in her arm. after about nine months and more than 300,000 deaths in the u.s., the first batches were finally released in january — light at the end of a monthslong tunnel. all of the country's 50 states have designed their own distribution plans, some of which have gone more smoothly than others.
as soon as the stories started coming out last spring about a potential baby boom, phil and i discussed how those predictions were surely wrong, and how what we should expect to see instead was a sizable baby bust, kearney told huffpost.

below, marriage therapists who have been working with couples for years share nine things they can glean about a couple after the first therapy session.
what's it like working with your husband on this parenting content?
people experience and process emotions differently, so there's no way to gauge how your ex is actually holding up post-split ― no matter how many seemingly carefree photos he or she posts on instagram. quit playing the comparison game and embrace however it is you're feeling, even if it's pretty crappy, said marriage and family therapist spencer northey.
integrate some meditation into your life, suggested rachel thomasian, a licensed marriage and family therapist and owner of playa vista counseling in los angeles. there's been so much going on and so much noise all around, it's important to let your mind be still for a few minutes a day.

but apparently the actor wasn't harboring any ill will for the singer, later explaining he liked the tweet by accident in the comments of a recent instagram photo.
the question was on the tip of my tongue as i watched the very talented stars awkwardly rattle off jokes side-by-side sunday evening. maybe it was their lack of chemistry. former emmys host samberg is a natural funnyman, kicked into gear by live tv king lorne michaels. oh's humor is a little drier, sharper; a bit of cristina yang bled through her carefully timed delivery. separately, their demeanors are fantastic. forced together, one host always seemed to be chasing the other's lead.

we also learned that gi and damian are dating still, which is very exciting. a good twist.
a lot of people start to consider suicide in high school, but as they age they develop coping mechanisms through their job or their social network and those suicidal thoughts go away, salway said. but then, as they lose friends and family members as part of aging, those feelings of loneliness and depression return. we've been attentive to the risk of suicide among queer adolescents but we also need to look at what's happening in adulthood, salway said.
wheaton college, an elite school sometimes styled the harvard of christian schools, began termination procedures against professor larycia hawkins (the first tenured african-american professor in the school's history) because she posted on facebook that she stands in religious solidarity with muslims because they, like me, a christian, are people of the book. and as pope francis stated last week, we worship the same god. according to wheaton's provost, the idea that two of the three abrahamic religions might venerate the same deity violates the school's doctrinal convictions. hawkins and wheaton eventually parted ways. no one questioned whether hawkins was a christian, but whether her theological understanding of the nature of divinity narrowly clung to wheaton's ideological mandate.
the secc sought a more granular picture of entitlements to capture the increasing financial complexity of the lives of indian citizens, and the increasingly focused nature of government support schemes. state and central governments were now rolling out schemes that looked at indicators other than annual family income — like school scholarships earmarked for girl students, loans to start small businesses, etc.
this is a delicate, uncomfortable conversation, but if it's something that genuinely matters to you, you owe it to your partner to bring it up as soon as possible, said lisa helfend meyer, a family law attorney in los angeles.
a 2013 study from the university of california, berkeley, confirmed what anyone in a relationship knows to be true: that couples tend to have more frequent and more severe fights after getting poor sleep. and if your partner is the reason you didn't sleep a wink, then it's really going to cause some friction.
my son has told me that i will never find a man with the qualities i am looking for and that i need to be with a woman. i tell him that i haven't even met a woman i could see myself with, although i would welcome her if she does arrive.
we have begun a complete investigation to determine how and why the couple received these materials. if we determine that any vistaprint employee or partner had any role in this situation, we will take strong action.
words were shouted, tears were shed, hugs were given, and prayers were said, ihfe wrote in a march 5 facebook post. i am so sorry for the pain that is being felt by many of our families who feel as though they have come under attack.

i've grown into these traits as an individual. i've come to terms with not being the perfect partner. i make mistakes, mess up, and yet i try and try again. i've learned that the ideals i held myself to have no room in a successful marriage. learning to also forgive myself has become much easier with all the practice.
tears came to her eyes and they started to holler.
divorce is a bad word in my household. divorce in our society is often attributed to failure. failure in marriage. failure in relationships. even failure in parenting. but this is not my case. in my marriage, there was no failure — just a stark realization that people grow and love comes and goes and that is ok.

despite the mundanity and complacency that can develop within a long-term partnership, a sure way to keep the fire alive and burning brightly is to watch your partner beam when you regularly notice and point out their contributions to your life. people want to be reminded they are of value to you, and secure couples understand that this should be frequent. although you may assume your love to be understood, in reality, acknowledging your partner's efforts and contributions consistently builds an even deeper connection. ― kari carroll

benedict's intervention is extraordinary, given he had promised to remain hidden from the world when he retired in 2013, and pledged his obedience to the new pope. he has largely held to that pledge, though he penned an odd essay last year on the sexual abuse scandal that blamed the crisis on the sexual revolution of the 1960s.

the only way to excuse the klobuchar allegations is to conflate cruelty with feminism, wrote jezebel writer ashley reese. it's the reductive bad ass #girlboss model of empowerment that celebrates virtually anything women do — because a woman did it. it's about getting ahead, not other women.
to put this together, we attempted to compile as complete a list of congressional twitter accounts as possible ― which was harder than you might think, as there is no central list. when a member of congress had multiple accounts ― for example, sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) has @ewarren and @senwarren for her campaign and her congressional office, respectively ― we lumped together the follows rather than try to arbitrate which was the real account. so, in this example, if @ewarren follows a given account but @senwarren doesn't, that still counts as a follow. for the purposes of keeping count, we've decided to count independent sens. bernie sanders (vt.) and angus king (maine) as democrats because that's who they caucus with.
francis has expressed sympathy with the amazonian plight , though it is not clear how he would come down on the issue. while he has long reaffirmed the gift of a celibate priesthood in the latin rite church, he has stressed that celibacy is a tradition, not doctrine, and therefore can change, and that there could be pastoral reasons to allow for a exception in a particular place.

this is quest to learn, a public secondary school where the teaching curriculum is modeled on game design principles. students in each class undertake a series of missions through the semester, broken up into smaller quests. (think of it as one large problem broken up into a series of smaller problems.) missions and quests are designed by the school's teachers, and are in line with state-set standards. the overall mission of this english class was to write a dystopian story. it was called the writer games, after the hunger games. the teacher had been known to come to class dressed as effie trinket, the escort of the district 12 tributes in the books. today's quest called for analyzing current dystopian fiction, hence ogden's poem.
when my brother remarried, my husband and i danced at his backyard reception with him and his wife. it was a bright spring day and we were surrounded by supportive relatives. my grandmother died without ever speaking to my brother again. others in the family took a few decades, but finally came around and now adore the man they've come to know. their kids and grandkids weaved through us as we danced, playing a game of tag, unaware that the groom had once been thought of as perverse and disgusting by many of the people around them. i marveled at this wholesome family scene. this was all my brother had ever wanted.
the tension escalated as i continued asking questions, and began reminding my siblings of the times we were all taught to forgive and forget about ― how we always had impossible expectations and responsibilities. but i wasn't living there anymore, and my mother could always come along and tidy up the thought process of a doubting child. she'd done the same for me for the first 19 years of my life.

we have a very healthy marriage and we got there by doing therapy when we needed it, and constantly doing fierce moral inventories, bell told people at the premiere of chips monday. we both take responsibility when we are wrong, and i think it is easy to work with him because i married him, because i enjoy spending time with him and i trust him. that is exactly what i want in someone that i work with.
but on tv, the late-night hosts were fighting fear with comedy.
the dynamics of this year's oscar race are still unfolding, with the contenders jockeying for attention using various narratives. on one level, the current best picture front-runner, chloé zhao's nomadland, could be considered a movie for the moment, a movie about something timely and urgent. it documents the grim effects of the great recession, the monotony of being cogs in a capitalist machine and the precariousness of life on the margins (and has faced some scrutiny for not being critical enough about these topics). yet, as my colleague matt jacobs wrote, it's not explicit about these big important themes — and it doesn't need to be.
when we're stressed out, it doesn't take much to set us off. making time for activities that relax you — like taking a walk, cuddling with your dog or doing a puzzle — will help you build up tolerance for the aggravating behavior of others.
depression can also present as a wide range of symptoms.
the truth is that we are looking at all the wrong places because, believe it or not, the answers are inside each of us. the myth that my happiness is dependent on my partner is just that: a myth. it means that you are giving away your power and living your life by someone else's standards for you.
5. they're obsessed with being right.
for couples who do want to combine their finances, here's a step-by-step guide to how to do so:
in the beginning of a relationship, the sex or physical connection doesn't have to be mind-blowing to indicate that the relationship has staying power. there's often awkward fumbling as you and the other person get to know one another. but if there is no sense of excitement at the beginning regarding getting to know one another intimately, there won't be any excitement later. that might be fine if neither person requires sexual intimacy as part of a successful relationship. some people stay in these relationships because they enjoyed the other person's companionship and their friendship. a relationship with uninspiring intimacy may bring beautiful children into the world, and it may end on amicable terms because the friendship was always the strongest part of the relationship. but for many couples, the lack of sexual intimacy may lead one person to eventually seek it elsewhere, and that can spell the end of the marriage. ― sadler
6. accept that your friendship may take a hit.
before you go to have sex, take a moment or two in bed naked together to just do nothing together. pay attention to your physical and emotional state, your breathing, the points of contact between your body and the bed. see if you can just exist in the moment without having to do anything in particular. that state of being in the moment without judgment is what's commonly called 'mindfulness.' a little mindfulness before getting sexual together can make it seem a lot more natural and less stressful.

michael tullberg via getty images king speaks at the heart & soul: an evening of high comedy and low cholesterol benefit for the larry king cardiac foundation on nov. 7, 2009, in west hollywood, california.
we've grown up with the internet, so the ability to compare offers, find discount codes and publicly shame a company on social media to get the best deal has primed us to be careful, wary shoppers, maenpaa said. add that to our crippling student loan debt, and we are more likely to spend months or years searching for the perfect return on our investment instead of buying a starter home with the assumption we can upgrade in a few years.

when you haven't seen your family, hung out with friends or gone on vacation in the name of pandemic safety, watching other people do the things you so desperately miss can be maddening. you might say it makes you pangry, a made-up word for pandemic angry that describes what many of us are feeling right now.

as soon as we'd gotten engaged before our first wedding, the questions started rolling in from well-meaning straight people in our lives. so how does that work, legally, in michigan? was the most common one, a question that was either a polite way to ask what is the point of this wedding if you won't really be married afterward? or, more often than not, portrayed just how little people knew about the legal realities of being gay.
finances are the no. 1 reason partners who share a household fight. before commitment, you need to know if you can rely on your partner to stay true to a budget and effectively manage your shared pool of money. it might be a good idea to start small, like agreeing how much money you want to spend as a couple one weekend, then trying to have fun within that set limit. ― spencer scott

without seeing it modeled by your own parents, achieving gender parity in housework and emotional labor is pretty much a pipe dream. (even with that model, though, it's easy to slide into old gender roles; culturally, we put a premium on men's work while undervaluing women's. plus, paid leave and child care options in the u.s. are abysmal.)

as the post-wedding bliss begins to dissipate these last few months, i still feel as if a weight has been lifted. in some ways, marriage was the most significant milestone to usher me into adulthood. my parents have long let go of trying to dictate my life, but these days i've also let go of the resentment i've harbored all these years. i've vowed to take the lessons from this experience to help me be a better mother to my own children ― to let them live normal lives, express their emotions and, most importantly, learn how to be happy.

when she was little, her mother had her hair cut in a short bob for convenience. baby ghazal would tie a black cloth to the back of her head and pretend it was a ponytail. today, to her mother's frustration, qadri has decided she wants it short all the time. as it is, her faith endorses modesty in attire ― women are expected to cover their hair and not keep it short. she's received unpleasantness from relatives on occasion. when i leave my hair half-open they consider it indecent, she said. but it doesn't matter much to me what others think of me or my hairstyle. i trust my parents' wisdom and guidance on what's proper.

sure, it sounds a tad silly, but to see pitt and aniston ― two nearly perfect avatars of the concept of a failed marriage ― so publicly embrace each other gives hope to the rest of us that it's possible to mend a broken relationship. (and in this case, it's extra nice to see pitt rehab his image and enjoy critical success after getting sober. aniston, too, is finally getting recognition she's long deserved for her dramatic work. why not tack a love story onto that feel-good narrative, too?)

and, truth be told, a lot of my mentors were gay. i grew up around a lot of gay people, and they were the ones who were responsible for introducing me to club music, which obviously changed my life forever. i feel less judged around gay men than many of the women i know and associate with. my gay friends accept me for who i am. they understand where i'm coming from and what i'm trying to do and they're able to separate the showgirl from the reality. they give me total acceptance, which, believe me, is not something you come by every day. i have these outrageous parts of my personality and they celebrate me for them. other people in my life have told me or — worse — told others about me, well, you know, i don't really approve… it's like, really? you don't approve? well, guess what? fuck you! but i don't have to worry about that with my gay friends.
i experienced a keen insight. i wanted to remember it, let it guide me. this is what i realized: i don't have to drive myself so hard to get what i want. i should trust that i will get what i need without knocking myself out. blessings are in store for me; i just need to allow myself to be present to receive them.

lauren: so we started off with 15 on each side ― girls and guys. and the pods are like these mystical meditation chambers, as we like to call them. so the more people that were there, you get less time dating. but as it whittled down, if you didn't make a connection with someone then, of course, that was that. but we would have these ranking lists, so you would just say your top five, like out of all of the people that you dated they would match up like, ok, these two made a connection. that's how it will go on. and cameron was always my top.

because the role of awards show host is the most thankless job in entertainment, and we should stop commanding that our favorites even try. rather than judge someone for all their inevitable mistakes, let's laugh at short bits between a few random a-listers. guiding the ship, as oh now knows, is a losing battle for the hosts and the audience at home, who are really just looking for a reason not to change the channel.

lauren: oh man! it's really super amazing, especially because for cameron and i, we took this super seriously. we were both very vulnerable and that's scary, especially if you're being vulnerable in front of the world. so we're so honored that the world not only can identify with our story and relate, but that they appreciate it.

you can spot your ex-husband on the first date when he shows up at lunch or dinner and claims he is 'broke,' asking you to pay for the meal. if he is broke and unprepared to pay for the first meal, he will avoid responsibility and accountability in a marriage. send that man packing! you need someone to be an asset, not a liability! ― joyce morley, a marriage and family therapist in decatur, georgia

despite president obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. groups such as black lives matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. mixed messages from the obama administration, the department of justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.
while brutal honesty and truth often slice deep into the jugular of life, transparency for being known for who you are is a blessing that eradicates guilt, shame, and self-loathing, opening one's self, and hopefully others to the light of living truth for truths sake. in the light of matt's truth, his real truth, he and luanne are building a new foundation that embraces the reality that who you are is who you are even though at times it hurts and brings up anger and confusion. however, both matt and luann have found that any attempt to fight your truth only compounds the darkness, hurt and pain which in turn, eventually manifests as a person living a pretend life having pretend relationships.

you start opening up to your friend about problems in your marriage, madden said. on the surface this seems okay. you are just trying to get the other gender's point of view, in an effort to help your marriage. but it signals 'i might be married, but i'm not happily married.' your marriage is vulnerable. you also then give your special friend a list of things that bug you about your spouse so that they can provide you sympathy, but also now know perfectly how to give you what you are missing.

so we grew apart. our careers took different directions, our values evolved and 13 years after getting married, we were two completely different people. our relationship became convenient, and day by day it felt more like we were college roommates. i know relationships have their ups and downs, but for me it just felt flat. we could share a meal and talk, but our talks were shallow and they just covered the day-to-day basics of living together and sharing a child. there was no romance involved, and there hadn't been for years. what summer camps will she go to this year? what will she do for her birthday? did i pay the car insurance, garbage, phone, bills, etc.?
taking anger to bed is one of the most damaging things we can do. during the day we have a chance to process anger and let it go, to see what it's really saying. but at night it can become intensified and build from a simple story to a major drama. so here are five reasons why not to go to bed feeling angry:

you can tell your child the reason you're not feeling well by sharing the news of the loss or you can simply name the emotion and talk about that aspect. richards advised saying something like, sometimes mommy feels sad, but i talk to daddy about it and i feel better. you have seen mommy sad a lot lately ― it is not your fault, and i am going to be ok.
i was 9 years old and i wasn't going to grow up. i didn't need to learn to spell because i'd never need a job. it was 1986, my family were jehovah's witnesses, and the jw governing body was confidently predicting that armageddon would arrive by the mid-1990s. everyone who survived that would live forever in paradise on earth. we were promised this at each of the thrice-weekly meetings we attended. in paradise, we'd build log cabins, make friends with wild animals and spend our time picking fruit with other jehovah's witnesses. this was all lovingly illustrated for us in the jehovah's witness literature.

jesme suspects that mulakkal may have emboldened other priests to pursue women in that manner. i am sure a lot of nuns have been victimised by the same men, but they are afraid to speak up. there's a pattern, said jesme. such things are happening everywhere. often, even when you complain to senior sisters, they're told that just like jesus suffered, they must also suffer.

or maybe for you, you struggle to appreciate your partner's wonderful qualities, including their kindness, dedication to the family, and the deep emotional support your partner offers you when you go through a tough time, and instead focus on their flaws. maybe that they are sensitive, kind of awkward at social events and not as clean around the house as you'd like.
my husband and i had talked about opening up our relationship nearly a decade ago, before we got married. it had been my idea at the time, and he had nixed it over concerns that i would have much more success at the endeavor than him. i now understand that his worry was rooted in the kind of abandonment fear that fuels jealousy and a tit-for-tat mindset. the kind of visceral half-conscious terror that, when left unexplored, upholds institutions like monogamous marriage and vilifies other ways of living.

he was never able to teach me to be the handyman he is, although he impatiently tried, rolling his eyes when i handed him pliers after he asked for a socket wrench. but our relationship taught me something more important — how to not get hung up on the external and to be able to recognize the humanity in others. when i see how much time the world wastes demonizing the other and causing unnecessary strife and pain, i know now is not the time to be timid. i need the same courage to take the kind of action that he and my mom showed me all those years ago.

we sat down together and wrote a list of guidelines unique to our situation, some of them hard rules ― like using protection and not meeting up with established friends or family ― and some softer, more malleable but requiring open conversation. we agreed at the outset that we would remain each other's primary partner, and though we would still be capable of developing deep, meaningful connections with other partners, the main purpose of opening things up would be for friendship and sex. we knew the only way we could successfully navigate the ocean of gray we were introducing into the black-and-white narrative of our traditional marriage was through radical honesty and compassion. we needed to be able to sit with and articulate our emotions without becoming blinded by jealousy, depression or anger.

in the last year of our relationship, we transferred to a new university in another part of the state and lived together in a cheap apartment. things were still volatile and became even worse as the months progressed. we decided to get engaged in hopes that it might stabilize and save our relationship. my parents put an announcement in the local paper and threw a party. no one knew that by that point we were sleeping in separate bedrooms. i had also begun to notice james was spending a lot of time in dissociative states. when he would disassociate, it was like he wasn't there — he would stare blankly into the distance and often seemed to be frozen in some thought i couldn't see or hear. i would curl into him, my head on his shoulder, trying to reach him, to bring him back, to save him ― and us ― again.
we spoke about the accountability and the expectations that we have, pompeo told reporters after visiting riyadh. the saudis are friends, and when friends have conversations, you tell them what your expectations are.

when prewett joined weber onstage — after telling the bachelor mc chris harrison that she is still in love with weber — she received a tepid welcome from the studio audience. weber seemed over the moon; his mother did not and proceeded to tell prewett why, exactly, she didn't like her. sanders supporters have recently published similar arguments about biden in various progressive publications.

i know i am the real deal, the whole package, good relationship material, despite my wounds and fears of attracting the same dynamics as the undesirable ones in my marriage. friends attempt to assure me that i won't, since i have grown dramatically in the two decades since michael died.
although there are many varieties of narcissism (outgoing and bombastic, shy and introverted, or proudly self-sacrificing), there are common traits, malkin said. what they all have in common is a powerful aversion to sharing authentic emotional vulnerability.
obviously, you don't want to say yes to the weightier things in life ― like deciding whether to have kids ― just to be agreeable. but there's no harm in indulging your s.o. when it comes to the smaller stuff: what band to see in concert, what movie to watch, which restaurant to dine at, where to vacation, etc.
there are other ways that i uphold and maintain trust, such as not giving lap dances to men that i know from outside the club. while my partner has never said not to, i felt it was inappropriate and established that boundary. i also don't give out my number or social media handles to customers (actually that's something i wouldn't do even if i were single). half of them are girlfriend shoppers who come to the club trying to take home a lady, which is asinine. it's like playing monopoly and thinking you'll cash out in real dollars at the end.

disagreements about that approach toward homosexuality have caused deep ruptures within the denomination. some factions of the american church are in favor of allowing same-sex marriages and accepting gay clergy members, but many umc leaders from africa and asia oppose those moves.
meanwhile, our lives moved on. we decided to have a baby, and after a miserable pregnancy and grueling labor (i carried the pregnancy, my dedicated spouse carried basically everything else while i was too sick to function), we had one. we were flat broke, exhausted and trying to adjust to life with a newborn while my recovery got more and more complicated.

the best resource for information about native americans other than members of these five nations is the u.s., indian census rolls, 1885-1940, collection on ancestry. these censuses include 565 federally-recognized tribes besides the five civilized tribes. the early censuses usually list indian andenglish names, gender, age, and relationship. some have additional birth, marriage, death and relationship notations. not every group took a census each year. keep in mind that blood quantum was usually not added until 1930s. blood quantum is a measurement of tribal affiliation based on ancestry. for example, a child with one native american parent and one non-native american parent would be considered to have one-half native american blood. if you have three non-native american grandparents and one native american grandparent, your blood quantum would be .25, or one-quarter. and so on.
in recent years the gses have started to spread significant portions of this risk through mind-numbingly complicated transactions involving complex securities, contracts and debt offerings. in late 2015, the gses committed to another year of this program.

sometimes the year-end and the beginning of a new year are also thought of as a time for change and new beginnings. that change may be to not spend another year with your husband or wife, and to begin again by ending a bad marriage or relationship. the reasons for divorce are endless, but the holiday season often brings matters to a head -- which makes january open season for divorce.

this week's votes are part of a broader effort by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) to dramatically reshape federal courts while trump is in the white house. he has made circuit court confirmations his top priority, as circuit courts are often the last word in federal court cases. the supreme court hears only about 100 to 150 appeals of the more than 7,000 cases that come before the nation's 13 circuit courts each year.

five years into their relationship, kimberly* and her husband started sleeping separately after she sprained her ankle. she moves around a lot in her sleep, so she thought it would be better not to risk bumping it against him in bed. during this time, kimberly said she and her husband discovered they actually got better sleep apart than they ever did together. so they kept it going.
maybe you've made mac 'n' cheese for dinner one too many times, biden said, addressing working mothers struggling with the stresses of pandemic life. maybe your temper is shorter than usual. maybe you're too tired to be the 'fun mom.' it's okay. you're not failing. you're strong. you're resilient. and you're doing your best to carry your family through one of the most difficult times in memory.

four of my adult siblings are still part of the quiverfull movement. my parents' primary message is that people should have more children, and my siblings are on their way to having large broods, too. sometimes i receive a phone call from one of my brothers, but the chasm between what i believe now and what they believe makes communication nearly impossible. i miss them, and i hope someday i can build a relationship with them that isn't based on adhering to my parents' beliefs. though deluded people with nefarious intentions still run the world outside of the one i eventually escaped, my pyrrhic victory is i don't have to delude myself anymore.

such a public feud in a well-known family would have been remarkable anywhere but was particularly unusual in asia when no country in the region at that time recognised same-sex marriage.
experienced marriage therapists can read code. that means we can look beyond what is being said and learn about the underlying issues by observing the body language of the couple sitting in front of us. when i notice one partner leaning in, reaching across to touch the other, nodding and gesturing in the direction of the other and the other partner leaning away and avoiding eye contact and physical touch, i know we've got a problem. no matter what is being said verbally, the body language is speaking volumes and it's important for me to listen. ― vikki stark, a psychotherapist and the director of the sedona counselling center of montreal
we've really been thinking about kids but when you have something happen like this, now i'm the one that's working and my husband's at home, brie said. it makes you kind of readjust and look at your life and say, 'are we really ready for kids right now? or do we really have to look at the next chapter of our lives, and does that mean different careers?' so you see us go through that journey this season.
de santos, like many other parents, has concerns about a vaccine's effect on a baby in utero and the chance of getting covid-19 while pregnant. (a new study out of washington state found that pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized for the disease than other females and that the mortality rate among them was more than 13 times higher than those of similar ages who were not pregnant.)
my husband's beat-up old suv was his man cave. he used it to take the dogs to a muddy park or sandy beach every day. it was also used to transport soccer players with stinky socks and as a storage bin for half-eaten school lunches with the occasional forgotten bag of oranges rolling around until they fully rotted. his trunk was where things went to die.

noel is a yoga teacher and body positivity activist. in her malayali culture (noel's family has origins in the southern state of kerala), long hair is considered beautiful. so when she first shortened her hair to shoulder length in high school, her father didn't speak to her for a week. she attributes his anger to patriarchal conditioning. i went bald eight months ago and that was pretty wild. didn't care about the consequences because on this journey of self-love and acceptance, i realized that i was using my hair as protection. i would untie it to take a picture because i believed i looked more 'beautiful' like that. and i didn't want a crutch, so i just did it, she told huffpost. some friends said they didn't want to look at me. i said great, thank you, next.

despite mountains of reporting — not nearly enough, mind you — and evidence, people found ways to disregard allegations as rumors, and cited his 2008 acquittal on child pornography charges as a reason to leave the matter be. the same community that knows how unfair and inadequate the criminal justice system can be will lean on it when someone they love has been legally exonerated.

so he started filming me, and you can see in the first episode i'm in bed with crusty yogurt around my mouth, totally disheveled. and we put it out there and the response was crazy.
5. they speak openly about their thoughts and feelings.
this makes a recurrence of the offense almost inevitable. always connect the apology to the future. for example, 'the next time i feel that way (whatever triggered the offense), i will remember that i love you and that our bond is so important to me,' or, 'i'll make sure i get centered in my values so i don't act on impulse.' the subtext should always be: 'i'm sorry that i hurt you and harmed the bond between us.' ― steven stosny, psychologist and author of love without hurt
all the while, stace fixed our windows, bikes, bathroom sink, created a fireplace where there was none, hung shelves, replaced a toilet, a showerhead, a faucet, painted the house, planted three bushes. she giggled every time she caught me taking a picture of her doing these things, which was every time, because i loved watching her work, the way she contorted her lips while she concentrated, the way she looked at me, pleased when she saw me crouched, three feet away, camera in hand.
1. the parent must be willing to change their behavior first. a common pitfall is confusing discipline with punishment.
i define cheating as having secret and deep intimacy, usually physical intimacy, outside of a committed relationship. to me, sexual intimacy is the most romantically intimate you can be with another person. emotional intimacy outside of the relationship is disloyal, but in most instances, is not an equivalent to sexual intimacy. ― lauren hamilton, creator of modwife.co, a marriage and lifestyle blog
on pursuing her after the first date
on a hot morning in the summer of 2015, my partner, our newborn and myself piled into a friend's car and headed for our local zen temple. we weren't going for the usual sunday morning service, though it was at the same time. we were headed to the temple to get married.
it's hard to say with certainty that one thing wouldn't exist without something else preceding it, but the birdcage marked a turning point in hollywood. armand and albert showed what's possible when queer narratives don't center trauma or disease, and the actors who portrayed them did so with a convincing interiority that pushed past stereotypes. they're still worth our jazz hands.
we know our turn is coming, but that doesn't mean we like waiting for it, gold explained. we see images posted on instagram of people getting the shot, and that only makes us want it more.

the planned schism would allow the remaining churches to reconvene at a later date and potentially remove controversial language from the church's rulebook that claims the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with christian teaching. lgbtq methodists and their allies have long argued that this language is harmful.
treder-wolff said this type of thinking is harmful because it eliminates that essential learning phase of a new role or skill when we must be free to flail and flounder as we figure it out. recognizing this thought as toxic is an important step, as is replacing it with new, healthy thoughts ― try: everything worth doing requires the freedom to flail and flounder, everything i put a good effort into will result in learning to do something better and better or everything i put a good effort into changes my brain.
i've been criticized for playing unlikable gay people, and i'll own that, droege told huffpost. we need to show lgbtq people as human beings who aren't perfect. you get all these different perspectives and points of view, but not all of my characters are redeemable. why do we have to be likable? likable's so boring.
i love movies that don't end the way we think (or hope) they should. because -- spoiler alert! -- not everything in life ends the way we'd like, either. la la land reminds us that clinging to the illusion of camera-ready endings robs us of the growing pains which guide us toward better or different choices next time. la la land's teachings are simple: be true to yourself, chase your dreams, marry the right person, and accept that things don't always go according to script.
instead of talking about it, we sat together while she applied for her dream job, we finished hanging up a rope swing in the backyard, she made me soup when i was sick, and then the next week i returned the favor, sitting by her feet, watching old episodes of friday night lights.
after hanging up over 1,000 photos and displaying videos of happy times through the house, evans named the museum lala and louise land.
i will never forget that moment, 30 years ago today, when at age 22, i was awakened from a drunken stupor by a bright light shining in my face. the glare came from the flashlight of a sacramento county sheriff's deputy. i had passed out behind the wheel of a running car in a bad part of town, a neighborhood notorious for drug activity. terrified, i pleaded with the arresting officer not to send me to jail.
i have to say, before we go to break, i'm so sorry, she said. i introduced you and it was just such a habit, and i have to say the way that you and channing are handling everything is beautiful for your daughter and the statements have been great. and i apologize. i just have known both of you for so long, and i'm so used to saying...
after happy birthday doug concludes its new york run next month, droege is hoping to take the show on the road, possibly internationally. given that both bright colors and bold patterns and happy birthday doug both focused on the lives of queer angelenos, he's considering mixing things up ― at least in terms of location ― with his next theatrical project.

my commutes are the most infuriating parts of my day. the traffic, the missed lights, the minivan in the right lane that has no intention of turning right -- it's as if houston's motorists have conspired to give me hypertension. and i'm far from being an aggressive driver.
before i do any interview, i have a conversation with whoever i'm interviewing and ask, 'tell me what your intention is, and i will tell you what my intention is, and let's see if we can align those two,' winfrey said. i don't want you to finish an interview and at the end of the interview, you say, 'i wish i had said ...

the isolation of the last year has hit us all, so much so that we may not even notice the toll it's taken on our mental health. here are a few indicators that loneliness is becoming a larger problem:
it means to notice when it's time to add excitement to your marriage. when an activity you used to enjoy on your own or as a couple no longer lights you up, it's time to try something new--on your own or together.
in any relationship, we all have moments in which we act in selfish ways. but when self-centered, immature or inconsiderate behavior becomes the norm for you, then there's an issue.
through open, honest, transparent communication, matt and luanne have chosen to accept the truth of matt's same-sex attraction - him a little more easily, her a little more painfully. leaning into their relationship built on love, respect, support and brutal honesty, they're now, in their own words, trying to do this well. that being, creating an environment for themselves and their children where the family thrives rather than survives as their marriage unravels - she as a single, pained and saddened heterosexual mother; he as a single, excited yet sorrowful, gay father.

vic dibitetto, known as the italian hurricane, is wonderfully outspoken in a humorous manner. he may be loud and hysterical on stage but in the green room the polite dibitetto offered me food and drink as if entertaining me as a guest in his home. his wife, the lovely lucy was there as well. one can tell that after many years of marriage the two still relish each other as he told me she's my rock. the comedian honored me with a gracious interview before his two sold out shows at governor's comedy club in long island.
if it was easy--everybody would do it! don't question if you picked the right career field, there was a reason you had so much passion to pursue it in the first place. although we all want to have fun, and the idea of work hard, play hard has somewhat changed, in that muas, djs, and bloggers seems like all fun and games, it's not, it's just a wave or a cycle, that will soon pass, and eventually come crashing down, but that m.d., j.d., m.b.a., degree will still be there. get that degree, first. then decide if you want to be a mua, blogger, or dj and publish a book on the side and become an author.

7. take responsibility for your part in why things ended
not a bragger by any means, the humble dibitetto, as if still amazed at his rise in fame, proudly announced to me i sold out both shows tonight and last night [at the brokerage also in long island] and came close to selling out westbury music fair memorial day weekend. after taking a couple of photos and allowing me to film him sending my daughter a little hello, in his own fashion, i left him to do his show.
above all else, the most crucial thing i have practiced is self-kindness, von lob said.over the years, i have practiced speaking to myself in more kind and affirming ways, which definitely helps lift my mood.
when they get married and have a couple of children, they'll know what life is, kalapura said. she also said that the church should understand that 'sexuality is a gift of god' and shouldn't deny its workers the right to love. in fact,she added, it was sexual repression that fed the culture of sexual exploitation.
it's very easy to stand on the sidelines and talk about people who are doing things and creating things. it's much harder to actually go out there and do something or make something and risk something — whether that's your livelihood or your reputation. so, i've decided i'll live my life this way and you can live your life whatever way you want. when people are coming for you, you just have focus on the positive things that are happening in your own life. let people be miserable without you — they can handle their misery all by themselves. you don't need to have any part of that poisonous nonsense.
when you haven't done the inner work to develop your loving adult self, it is the resulting inner abandonment that creates the fear and anger that may accompany the grief. your inner child is terrified at feeling so alone and is angry at the adult for not being there. you feel alone in the loneliness, which may lead to despair. while loneliness is a natural feeling to feel when we have lost someone we love, you will feel alone in the loneliness when you have no loving adult self to nurture you through the loneliness.

erdark via getty images there's nothing wrong with asking your partner about their 'body count,' but it's also worth examining why you want to know.
as stories of violence and sexual harassment against women continue to become more public, it's fair to say that this phenomenon isn't exclusive to hip-hop. pop star ke$ha, who's slated to perform grammy awards ceremony, recently went through a lawsuit with famous music producer dr. luke, wherein she accused him of sexual assault, sexual harassment and gender violence. taylor swift, a country music singer who's nominated for two grammys this year, has been vocal about her own alleged assault at the hands of david mueller, a radio personality. but their star power combined with the numerous tales of violence in hip-hop are still not enough to spark a movement for change in the industry.

remember, some things in life requires us to hang in there; there's no magic. you can't run every single time to the next best thing. i mean, is it really the next best thing or is it the temporary fix? that really speaks on your endurance or lack thereof. and i get it, sometimes it just can't work. i'm a product of a divorce, so i understand. but trust me when i say, it's a choice. some of us go into marriage with choices versus just a choice.

it's not that there's not merit to the argument that other men have been abusive and gotten away with it, she said. it doesn't make it ok for anybody. we don't say, we haven't held men accountable in the past for this on capitol hill, so why start now?
o'keeffe was the most famous female american artist of the last century --- and the most written about. i'd read karen karbo's charming how georgia became o'keeffe and roxana robinson's 675-page biography. i'd spent a day at o'keeffe's home in abiquiu, new mexico interviewing her last assistant, juan hamilton, for a magazine profile. and like anyone who'd taken an art history course, i'd seen dozens of the 500 photographs that alfred stieglitz had taken of her and could write at least two paragraphs about vaginal imagery in her flower paintings.

life is fun and exciting now, with social media paving the avenue of success. but in 10 years from now, there is no guarantee that your blog nor make up clients will still be at your doorstep, this is why establishing a career first, is more important. a career, will give you that foundation, not necessarily that you'll always have a job you love but that you will have a legitimate job, and can still pursue other things you love. a career will be the stepping stone to pursuing other creative non-traditional jobs you love--like blogging and make up and djs.

the time i clawed back from romancing helped me fall in love with the world again. i'm not usually one for unashamed country counting, but this year alone i've fraternized with manneken pis, christ the redeemer, the eiffel tower, chicago's bean and the panama canal. i took a scenic ride on one of the world's highest high-altitude trains through the depths of salta's lerma valley, went salsa dancing in cuba and signed up for flamenco lessons. i felt absolutely zero guilt about wanting my life to be about my wishes because i realized just how delicious that could be.

i feel like if my resident state truly cared about my freedom, then its divorce law wouldn't require one of us to move out in order to file for a divorce. as long as i can't afford to move to a place that will house my three children, i can't file for a divorce. i looked into my options last summer and discovered that without an income above $160,000 or a letter from someone qualified to guarantee my rent, no landlord would lease to me in my children's school district.

another actor's influence on his role:
we left. i don't think my father expected us to find somewhere to go, but some kind friends took us in. that day was a breakthrough because it triggered memories of what i'd been forced to minimize and see as isolated incidents over the years. i dropped out of college a few months later ― my poor home-schooling had made academic success virtually impossible, and i couldn't afford it. i sank into a horrible depression and began seeing a professional therapist, who was alarmed at my poor sense of boundaries and all of the traumatic memories that poured out of me.
look within and ask yourself what might be contributing to these feelings, she said. a lack of connection with others might mean that you need to expose yourself to other individuals who you have more in common with, who you find more interesting, or who align more with your morals, values and personality.

it's bizarre reading about little ics in the national media. a common description affixed to it, in this latest culture war dust-up, is an anti-lgbt school. it's an odd label, as if being anti-gay were its raison d'etre. but it is, i must say, more than fair.
your mid-twenties is the best time to start your retirement account. you have time on your side now more than any other time in your life, which means you will get the maximum benefit from compounding, or the ability to earn more money on the earnings in your account. it's also the time in adulthood when you are likely to have the fewest expenses -- before you have a home mortgage, multiple cars, children, etc. now is the time to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k), especially if your employer has a matching program. compounding and employer matching are two opportunities for free money you may not have any other time in your life!

let's go deeper into this and let's go to the origins of marriage. back in the 1400's when people were getting married, it was until death do you part. because people would get married as teenagers and somebody would die in their 20's or early 30's. the life span was not 80 years.

questions like 'are you sad?' don't leave a lot of room for communication and can feel invasive or forceful to a closed off partner, she said. try asking 'what's going on?' or 'tell me about your day' instead.

but you do need people who will support you and offer you advice and sometimes call you on your shit. i learned a lot from my mom. tom has been an incredible mentor in many ways, but he doesn't ask me my opinion on his legal cases, so i certainly don't ask him how he feels about erika jayne's creative choices. maybe that sounds a little harsh, but we're very supportive of each other and he trusts that i can handle my creative life — just like i trust that he can handle his legal life.

one client is staying home one day a week so his wife can go to her workplace, but he continues to make excuses that he's just not good with kids and often creates more headaches for her when she gets home, so she says the benefit is a wash, said kurt smith, a therapist in roseville, california, who primarily works with men.

and so i think the greatest thing that i've ever learned in life is probably in that relationship with future, because the reality of being a stepparent is that biologically they're not necessarily yours, but the reality is that you have to love them as if they are, wilson said. they're your own blood in a way. you get to love them that way. and i think every kid deserves that and needs that and yearns for that.
adams' ex-wife, the actress mandy moore, also claimed the musician was emotionally manipulative during their marriage, which ended in 2016.
at the beginning of the pandemic in march, i had friends planning on getting married in may and july who were still hopeful, so i thought august was not going to be a problem at all. by late may, i brought up wanting to get married in 2021 instead since my maid of honor was stuck in the u.s., my wedding dress was still in italy and my grandparents were still in china. our parents suggested that we still wait a bit to see how things developed.

as catholics, an essential aspect of our faith is to welcome the stranger and care for the alien, the bishops added.
of course, a transparent, no-holds-barred conversation with your partner isn't a solve-all here (though it will certainly help). for working parents to have a genuinely healthy work-life balance, employers need to be a little more conscious of what their employees are going through.

the original hipster move is to prefer emily starr to anne shirley, so it made enormous sense to me that artistic, wounded nadia would have gravitated to the new moon books. along with nadia's enviable frock coats and frilly blouses, the emily theme lent a gothic edwardian aura to the show, a sense that the age of video game design and the age of novels penned by hand exist almost simultaneously. maybe this is a tangent, but what did you think of the show's aesthetic?
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, widely known as the mormon church, teaches its members that being gay isn't a sin but engaging in same-sex intimacy is. the faith has tried to be more welcoming toward lgbtq people over the past decade, while adhering to its doctrinal belief that marriage is reserved only for heterosexual couples.

priscilla: wow, thank you so much. this chat is off to a great start. yes, i loved the show. as someone who has trouble making tangible changes in her life and loathes birthdays, i found it pretty easy to identify with nadia even without the experience of being trapped in an existential death loop. i mean, who among us hasn't stared desolately into the mirror at their birthday party like, oy, this again. another year, still myself. actually, i do not know if this is something other people do. do you feel that way?

as we became more food-obsessed, so did pop culture, leading to the rise of the food stylist. dedicated stylists mean heftier, more intricate food allocations, according to nancy goodman iland, whose credits include the good place and straight outta compton. mcsorley estimates that the cuisine on a food-heavy movie like 2014's chef, which she worked on, totals more than $35,000. christine tobin said one of her greatest achievements was a $20,000 banquet scene in american hustle, replete with cooked-lobster displays, that didn't even make the final cut. compare that to the several thousand dollars that valerie aikman-smith was allotted for the entirety of 1997's titanic, including the real caviar that james cameron requested for the dinner scene where leonardo dicaprio learns how to dine like the rich.
i'm a feature writer, so i've always written sad stories, but my real gift, i think if i have one, is being funny. when i was writing about what happened, it just flowed. it just filtered who i am and what was happening through humor, because it's how i dealt in real time. there were obviously things that were not funny at all, but when i started to write it just came out that way. i thought, do i try to be joan didion? but i am not joan didion. i wish i was, but i'm not.
the way a conversation starts determines how it will end the majority of the time, she said. let them know you love them and want to continue in the relationship. then start with an 'i' statement (a statement that starts with 'i feel ...

her speech gave me the permission i needed to put those hard months into wider perspective. yes, a layoff was a job loss, but it was not a failure in winfrey's eyes ― and shouldn't be in mine, either. winfrey said that when you understand that losses are there to wake you up, you don't allow yourself to be completely thrown by a grade or by a circumstance, because your life is bigger than any one experience.

'will your parents even go to your funeral?' he taunts in one recording. i can hear the high-pitched sound of cartoons playing in the background ― the children are right there.
when you name the emotion and the reason why, your child learns how to identify feelings and also hears the message that it's normal to feel sad and cry sometimes. it's also useful to let them know that even though you feel sad sometimes, you're going to be ok. parents should model vulnerability and healthy coping skills, like taking breaks, asking for help and sharing their feelings. ask your child for a hug if you need one.
this might be an obvious statement but it shouldn't be overlooked. starting a business in your twenties gives you so much time to learn. you can fail and still have years and years to develop and adapt.

as a secular jew, i felt at home at dominican. as an institution, it knew what it was and hoped i would share in the mission to make a more just and humane world. my muslim and queer colleagues reported similar feelings of inclusion, and i don't think dominican is atypical in this regard. from kindergarten to graduate school, it's possible to attend or work at a religious institution of learning that takes faith seriously without endorsing exclusion or bigotry.

looking back, i am so happy we decided to go for it. we had a more intimate ceremony than we had originally planned ― neither of us were keen on reading our own vows in front of 150 people. while we were sad that our grandparents, extended family and friends could not be with us, videotaping the ceremony helped and we plan to have a party to celebrate whenever it becomes safe to do so. with so much uncertainty about when covid will be controlled, it's nice to at least know we are already married. — sarah b. and david c.

as his fame rose, limbaugh liked to explain his success by claiming he had talent on loan from god, but it was a reagan-era federal communications commission policy shift that allowed limbaugh to reach national infamy and create the mold for modern right-wing media stardom. in 1987, the fcc abolished the decades-old fairness doctrine which mandated that tv and radio broadcasters present both sides of controversial issues. this meant that stations were no longer required to feature opposing views, and instead radio hosts like limbaugh could spend hours spouting off right-wing fallacies without challenge.

many christians, often concerned about compromising their sense of what they believe that jesus would want, have doubled down on their fragile self-image of being holy, pure and sanctified. in their fear of compromising their beliefs about sexuality and gender, they have almost fully compromised one of the core teachings of jesus: to love god and your neighbor as you love yourself.

truthfully, my ex-husband and i were able to reconcile the love from our relationship before things got toxic. by getting divorced and consciously uncoupling, my ex and i have been able to maintain our family unit and allow it to grow in ways that are best for each of us and our daughter. we're still partners in life, but we're just not romantically or legally married to each other anymore. it works for us, and i feel lucky.
further, families were constantly moving from rural to urban areas, and back again — implying that the distinction between urban and rural families (eligible for corresponding urban and rural welfare schemes) was becoming harder to maintain.
whether its the unexpected complications of blending families or the disappointment that a new marriage still falls short of one's hope for marital bliss, expectations about marriage and family will be challenged by a second marriage. complicating this, many second marriages aspire to avoid the irreconcilable problems they left in a previous marriage, only to find them in different forms in their new marriage. expectations are often unreasonably high, and bonds can crumble under this burdensome weight. ― alicia h. clark, a psychologist in washington, d.c.
maybe the chanting, incense, other-worldly surroundings, or the priest's welcoming embrace nudged me toward the spiritual end of my science/metaphysics belief scale. whatever it was, i choked up with emotion. it took me several minutes out in the air and sunshine before i completely regained my composure.
king's office did not respond to a huffpost request for comment on feenstra's candidacy.
if a more electric movie opens in the first half of 2020, it will be a miracle. the bracing, audacious promising young woman is the sort of thing hollywood should be making all the time, a scorched-earth treatise with massive entertainment value that twists and turns from one shock to the next. even more astounding, it's a directorial debut. emerald fennell served as the showrunner on season 2 of killing eve and has acted in call the midwife and the crown, but this film plays like the work of someone with half a dozen features under her belt. leaving the theater, i felt giddy.
gary's shorts is the only appropriate way to end black history month — rembert browne (@rembert) february 27, 2017
this one is pretty easy because usually the partner tries to bully me. the difference is, i haven't lived with the client for years and had my self-esteem torn to shreds so the bully doesn't scare me. the thing about bullies is that they really will back down if you call their bluff and let them know where the door to the office is if they don't really want to get help. ― stephanie buehler, a southern california-based psychologist
our lives are astonishingly normal. we live a totally typical suburban family existence. the fact that laura is a psychic medium rarely factors into our marriage or family life. we are a close family and love spending time with the kids doing normal family stuff. we explained to our kids from any early age what mommy does and it is totally normal to them.

it's all connected though, i think. if you can't do the hard work of putting aside your own selfishness in the earlier years, what do the later years look like? it took 62 years to build what they had, and i understand that. but if there's one thing i've learned, it's that maybe the little things are actually the big things. honesty and integrity start with lending a helping hand and showing respect and saying i'm sorry and meaning it. if i knew then what i know now. but isn't that always how it goes?
best guess at the cause he'd choose as first gentleman: as a decades-long professor, mann could become a champion for u.s. education and improving access to higher education.

the notion dawned on me that perhaps some of the pain i was feeling stemmed from a preventable social malady rather than abject personal failure. maybe, to a certain degree, our institutions had misunderstood love, and taught it to us all wrong.

the men in my practice talk a lot about work, but their focus is typically on the deals, the strategy and the financial benefits ― not how it affects their relationships, he told us. the women tend to focus on the relational dynamics of their job and home life.
ask your employer to divert that amount from your paycheck into your savings account each month until you reach your purchase date.
you'll also want to get much more specific with your resolutions, as opposed to keeping them very vague and general. for example, don't just vow to be more affectionate in 2017; find measurable ways you can achieve this goal, like touching each other every time you watch tv, and make that your new year's mission. see, easy right? and definitely not nearly as overwhelming as just trying to get in more physical touch.

as a prominent fixer, a middleman of sorts for the political and social honchos, whose job it is to introduce influential figures to one another to expand their networks, told me, the most effective meetings are outside the meeting rooms. at one wedding, on citing the presence of a senior politican, the fixer said to me, this indicates that he [the politican] is willing to negotiate the business deal or else he would not have attended the wedding.
while i might have expected life without the pursuit of romantic relationships to bring up feelings of sadness or loneliness, all of this actually culminated in a mind shift whereby i stopped viewing solitude as calamitous. i could give up my subscription to the must have a man association and life would still go on; it could even be great. accordingly, recent reports from the american time use survey show that, surprisingly, unmarried women are actually the happiest population subgroup.
also, through my own personal experiences, i can say with absolute certainty that the afterlife is real ― which is a concept that many people spend their lives grappling with, never 100 percent sure. there are paranormal phenomena that exist on the peripheries of our physical world that, although rare, are indeed real.

we talked about everything from our family values to our hobbies, which were remarkably similar. honestly, we didn't even have to say much ― the vibe and presence of ethan was so warm and comforting that i immediately felt at home with him. i was surprised by that, but our almost instantaneous and seemingly deep connection gave me the motivation and confidence to want to ride out the rest of the show.
a year later, everything began to change.

what started out as a temporary inconvenience has now turned into our way of life. wayo's job is far more flexible than mine, so he's the one who commutes the most, but even still, we never actually cemented any rules outlining when and where we spend our time. though we talk on the phone several times a day, we typically only spend about two weeks out of the month sleeping in the same bed.

i rationalized that my children were probably -- and certainly will be soon -- ready to untangle themselves from my long and knotty apron strings. i asked my mum, 'what shall i do?' mum, who lost my father when she was younger than i am now. go with him, she urged. nobody ever asked her; fate just snatched him away.

and so, my wedding meant so much more to me than just a chance to celebrate the love my husband and i had nurtured over the years. it was my ticket out of the mental prison of expectations that my family had laid the foundations for, and that i had continued to build around myself – a chance to show my parents that i understood them and a way for me to make peace with myself.

the practice of giving a dowry is also modified. at one elite wedding i studied, the groom was given an audemars piguet watch costing approximately £10,000, a bmw 7 series car, and £50,000 in cash. there is an insistence, especially by the father of the bride, to treat this not as dowry, but only as a gift, as the bride-to-be too, it is argued, is gifted expensive jewellery and clothes by her in-laws.
it was part of a pattern for limbaugh, who repeatedly tried to downplay white supremacists during trump's four years in the white house, a period of rising far-right terror across the globe. after an avowed white supremacist massacred 51 muslims inside two new zealand mosques in 2019, limbaugh speculated on air that the shooter may in fact be a leftist who shot muslims to smear those on the right.

what we soon realized is that any disagreement is less about the issue and more about the need to be right. so we try to focus on what is really going on. anger is a powerful and complex emotion--when it grabs hold it is difficult to control ourselves. but there are often layers of conflicting feelings hidden beneath the anger, such as insecurity, grief, or fear, trying to make themselves heard. the power of rage is such that it can act as a defense mechanism that overshadows these other emotions, causing us to lose touch with ourselves and struggle to articulate what we are really feeling.
alison patton, a divorce attorney and mediator in la jolla, california:
many catholic conservatives supported trump. francis had a rocky relationship with trump, disagreeing with him on a series of issues including immigration and climate change.
eg: yes! i affirm you! love is blind is gripping because it's so voyeuristic. it taps into the thing that all good dating shows tap into: a base desire for love and partnership, and the wish that those things could be somewhat simple and formulaic. love is blind posits that the problem is just that we're so disconnected from each other, so the solution must be putting people who really, really want love into a very heightened situation where they have only conversation and no outside, screen-based distractions. but, as anyone who has dated knows, love and attraction are messy and complicated, and even if you date seriously and blissfully for a month, and even if you make it to a legal commitment, there are no guarantees.

it could be the catalyst for you to start planning backward from this dream by saying to yourself, 'ok, i want to live in this city and in this kind of home, which seems to cost around this much for what i want. so to afford this life, i need to be making this salary, which in my field means this title. or maybe i'm going to change careers because mine just won't get me there in the amount of time i want, so let me think about boosting my resume or adding a certification or skill in the near future,' maenpaa said. and so on until you've gathered enough data about what it would take for you to achieve this next phase.

frequent and clear communication is very important so that the reprioritization of time and energy doesn't come across as a loss of interest in the relationship, saunders said. initially, it may feel uncomfortable to invest less, which may create an insecurity spike, but using communication can be validating along with making the most of the time that is allocated to the relationship.

in find me, the life as we know it isn't threatened by war or otherworldly forces, but by a strange, mystical disease that strikes suddenly and wipes out most of the population. some, however -- including protagonist joy -- find that they're immune. incubated in a hospital with other survivors, joy gets the idea to escape and find her mother, a relentless explorer who left her and many questions behind. it's as much a dystopian book as it is a road trip novel, and a poignant commentary on loneliness.
that baby is three years old now, and our lives have changed in a million ways. but that second wedding reminded me that change is actually the whole point of marriage ― you change together, you carry each other as you grow and shift. we have, like most people, become busier than we'd like, and most of the time our marriage is the background again. we often joke that we'll just keep getting married, every so often, just for the excuse to throw a party. somedays i think, maybe we really should.

we collectively closed our minds to the fact that this was not the first time the jehovah's witness organization had predicted the end of the world. they first believed it would happen in 1914. their subsequent predictions (1918, 1925 and 1975) were similarly anticlimactic, but many jws still delayed further education, put off getting married and decided not to have children. all these things, we were promised, would be better done later, in paradise. i was aware of the large number of unmarried elderly ladies in our congregation ― they'd been waiting, lonely and patient, for their entire adult lives. i was also aware, at least vaguely, that perhaps someday i'd be one of those old ladies. that is if the jehovah's witnesses were wrong about armageddon. again.
first, keep in mind that what you see on instagram doesn't always tell the whole story. maybe that vacation pic your college friend posted isn't recent, but a throwback from 2019. perhaps your co-worker's photos with her parents weren't from a holiday visit — they've actually been living together during the pandemic.
making sure i sleep enough and rest has allowed me to help balance my children's homeschooling, working from home, and everything else, she said.
if it is sometimes difficult for you to talk to family or friends about your experiences with anxiety and depression, consider talking to other people who are having similar experiences, she said, noting that you can find support groups for people with anxiety and depression at the adaa website.
i wouldn't call it close friends, but we got along, holland told the washington post. for the kids' sake, more than anything else.
he had them squeezed tight, and he said when it came through, it just took them, crisp said. it just demolished the house and took them.
not everyone is interested in photography. in fact, i sometimes meet clients whose fiancés are interested in everything except being photographed on their wedding day. luckily, most reluctant subjects know that photography is important to their partner and so they participate willingly. but that's not always the case. early in my career, a groom hired me by phone. when i arrived at the wedding and introduced myself to the bride, she gestured toward my camera and said, 'don't point that f**king thing at me today!' that made it a pretty rough day. they divorced three months later. i think that a willingness to happily consider the needs of your partner is key to a fulfilling, long-term relationship. and that includes embracing photography even if being photographed isn't your favorite thing. ― rob greer, a wedding photographer in los angeles, california
the book is the worn stones of conjugal life. all that is beautiful, all that is plain, everything that nourishes or causes to wither. it goes on for years, decades, and in the end seems to have passed like things glimpsed from the train -- a meadow here, a stand of trees, houses with lit windows in the dusk, darkened towns, stations flashing by -- everything that is not written down disappears except for certain imperishable moments, people, and scenes.
oaks was a bit more explicit in his response, suggesting that believers need to follow god's commandments in order to receive blessings.

i've been thinking about our sisters that we don't spend any time with and our brother — brothers. we've got four siblings we don't spend any time with, she said. i just had this moment of like, it would be nice to connect a little bit, especially with my sisters.
sometimes, one spouse would come home and complain about office drama and really need the other's perspective and lens to sort through an issue with a coworker or their boss. other times, we just wanted to shout and yell and have the other be entirely on our side, james told huffpost.
st. george told huffpost she can jump into problem-solving mode very quickly, but time has taught her that her friends and romantic partners oftentimes just need a sounding board.
fidelito, who had the highest public profile of all castro's children, was born in 1949 out of his brief marriage to mirta diaz-balart before he went on to topple a u.s.-backed dictator and build a communist-run state on the doorstep of the united states during the cold war.
when you're planning for an expensive and important event like a wedding, it's imperative that you already know how to budget and save. so learn now. (if you're new to the concept of maintaining a monthly budget, learn the basics, here). you can actually have a lot of fun practicing how to budget for an extraordinary expense! is there a trip you've been meaning to take? or another big-ticket item you're dreaming of, like a car? here's how to make that dream happen:
if you're an avid netflix user, you know there's only one way to watch: put on your stretchy pants and plop on the couch with enough snacks to sustain you through several hours of viewing. and if you haven't already binged your way through tidying up with marie kondo on netflix, add it to your watch list asap.
we all know people who drink too much. they're alcoholics, and they make their lives and the lives of those they love a living hell. as a sex and love addict, i used men as my drug of choice. multiple partners, inappropriate affairs and cheating were my acting out behaviors.
quality time : plan a thoughtful zoom date with your partner, she said. send them uber eats, and be intentional about making the time special and different from your everyday calls.
once you're married and you've successfully navigated budgeting, saving and paying for your own wedding, you should be in a great position to take on your financial future together and have fun with it!
accusations can damage a reputation and a marriage. sometimes irreversibly, tyson wrote in his facebook post. i see myself as [a] loving husband and as a public servant ― a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public.

the republican lawmaker who denounced the photo at the rally owes an apology to everyone appearing in the picture, the governor said. at the weekend rally for a republican legislative candidate, state sen. phillip wheeler accused beshear and the democratic party of corrupting the values of children, the lexington herald-leader reported.
it might be hard to understand why someone would stay in such a violent relationship. spencer — who, again, denies ever physically attacking his wife — has questions: if he was so violent, why didn't kouprianova call the police? why didn't she leave?

clearly, there's a shortage of socializing options for the brokenhearted. but there are things you can do to stay healthy and put the focus on your well-being while quarantined. below, therapists ― and our newly single sources ― offer breakup advice they're learning on the fly.
beshear told reporters wednesday that he's not worried about political backlash. attending the rally was the right thing to do, he said. the democratic governor took office in december after defeating socially conservative republican incumbent matt bevin.
observe what it's like in the moment to feel un-partnered during a pandemic. resisting those observations will actually make the breakup harder, she said. observing the experience and practicing non-judgment will help you detach from emotional chaos so you can make thoughtful choices.
the employment application also says the school believes in a definition of marriage that strictly includes one man and one woman and notes that a wife is commanded to submit to her husband as the church submits to christ.

jariwala owns a sustainable fashion line that champions a hardy hand-spun fabric with ties to india's freedom movement. growing up, she struggled with her curls. i wanted to straighten them all the time only to be accepted. i remember a morning from my fourth grade when my teacher asked me if i'd combed my hair enough. she suggested i do it multiple times to get rid of the 'shabby look.'
i would like to send these little words to the moon in a spaceship and remove them from every person's vocabulary, said jennifer hunt, chair of pathology at the university of arkansas for medical sciences and founder of a leadership development program for women called unlocking the authentic self.
covid-19 has now killed more than 400,000 americans and sickened millions more, while putting tremendous strain on our health care workers. yet many families continue to gather indoors for maskless get-togethers. celebrities and influencers are still taking group trips to far-away destinations.
mariah and james; lady gaga and taylor; j-lo and casper; and josh and diane: these folks have something in common - they dated, but did not marry. what could possibly be the problem if they did not actually tie the knot? some states recognize common law marriage, which means that while you may not have had an actual marriage you may still, in fact, be married. for example, josh and diane dated for 10 years before they split. if certain elements are met in states that recognize common-law marriage, parties may be unintentionally considered married, and this may follow you to other states that do not even recognize common law marriage. common law marriage aside, it's also possible to form financial entanglements with someone with whom you share such history. and following along the financial thread, even for shorter relationships like mariah and james, it is rumored that mariah demanded a $50 million dollar inconvenience fee over the split (read: what she wants to make up for wasting her time). the fortunate, and unfortunate, reality of the law is that if there is a deep pocket involved someone can probably find a legitimate legal claim to make that forces the parties into some sort of negotiation rather than deal with the risk of a lawsuit.
as the pandemic grew in strength, our future wedding date became increasingly uncertain. we wanted to be married by the time we finished our medical residencies in july 2021. we love to go hiking and lose ourselves in the outdoors, and krina has been a fan of elopements for years. we set up a meeting with photographer maddie mae and immediately decided we would elope. we were not sure how our families would react, but we knew they would ultimately understand. rather than cancel our dream wedding, the pandemic allowed us to be married uniquely without all the concerns of a traditional wedding.
spears looked shocked in response to those comments, but sawyer seemed to sympathize with ehrlich, telling spears:
after years of grappling with the possibility of a schism over the welcoming of queer christians, the umc's general conference voted last year to affirm existing church doctrine prohibiting same-sex marriage and the ordination of queer clergy and to impose harsher penalties on clergy who break the rules. queer methodists and their allies were deeply disappointed by the vote and immediately began seeking a new way forward.
alexis [bledel] and i walked onto the set together and -- i feel super emotional about a lot of it and i'm afraid i'm going to start crying at every turn -- but walking onto that set really felt like something, she said. it felt like a lot of time had passed and it felt like we were just there. it felt amazing.
the person i ended up with was not the person i originally met, she went on. and that wasn't my fault ― that was his. i knew how much i had to give and how much i wanted to receive.
how dare you say that we are not interested in families in the black community. that is outrageous. that should be stricken down.
there are a lot of threads to tie off in this bittersweet finale. but there's only one thing that matters: does always and forever cast the same spell as to all the boys i've loved before? or would rewatching the first installment be a better way to spend a valentine's day under lockdown? huffpost reporters marina fang and claire fallon got out their coziest blankets and a tray of freshly baked cookies to discuss.
i'm not one of those people who thinks that we're exactly the same as straight people, williamson, whose credits include recurring roles on mad men and the good wife, told huffpost. we have our own unique experiences, and those shape how we see the world and how we come into relationships. we don't have many long-term depictions of queer characters, and even fewer long-term depictions of queer relationships. so i thought to myself: what can i do that will add to the zeitgeist ― the queer zeitgeist?
my upbringing may have taught me that a homosexual 'lifestyle' is wrong, but my life experience has changed my perception.

especially because [on the podcast] we've been talking so much about sibling relationships and distraught relationships or good relationships, kate added as her brother laughed.

vallow and both children were present when charles vallow was shot, authorities said. investigators concluded the shooting was self-defense and no charges were filed, according to police documents.
it is for this reason that comparisons of gay people to simply single people who have not married yet are so woefully lacking in nuance. i once heard the difference between these groups stated this way and it's always stuck with me: single mormons go to bed every night pleading with the lord that they will fall in love with someone tomorrow; gay mormons go to bed every night pleading with the lord that they will never fall in love with someone.
there's nothing stopping the road to equality, but the truth is we don't know how long it will take to get there, said larissa arroyo, an attorney representing the couple in costa rica who planned to marry on saturday.
this, however, is just scratching the surface.
and even he says most of his messages don't get replies, that he spends probably 10 hours talking to people on the app for every one hour he spends meeting for coffee or a hookup. it's worse for gay men of color. vincent, who runs counseling sessions with black and latino men through the san francisco department of public health, says the apps give racial minorities two forms of feedback: rejected (sorry, i'm not into black guys) and fetishized (hi, i'm really into black guys.) paihan, a taiwanese immigrant in seattle, shows me his grindr inbox. it is, like mine, mostly hellos he has sent out to no reply. one of the few messages he received just says, asiiiaaaan. none of this is new, of course. walt odets, a psychologist who's been writing about social isolation since the 1980s, says that gay men used to be troubled by the bathhouses in the same way they are troubled by grindr now. the difference he sees in his younger patients is that if someone rejected you at a bathhouse, you could still have a conversation afterwards. maybe you end up with a friend out of it, or at least something that becomes a positive social experience. on the apps, you just get ignored if someone doesn't perceive you as a sexual or romantic conquest. the gay men i interviewed talked about the dating apps the same way straight people talk about comcast: it sucks, but what are you gonna do?
being constantly joined at the hip isn't healthy for any couple. if you're in an ldr that's working in this area, you're ahead of the game, brown said.

she is really considered one of the fast-rising stars in the legal profession, he said. she is clearly qualified to do this job.
priscilla, i must note that you have curls just as luscious and buoyant as natasha lyonne's character nadia vulvokov ― but did your affinity for the show go any deeper than hair-level?
just as you open up about your emotions, invite your children to do the same. ask them what they're thinking and feeling during the conversation and check in days later to see if that changes as they've processed the information.
when harry and meghan engage in first-date banter about his showing up 40 minutes late, it could easily have been a cringingly wooden exchange of quips. i mean, it would really hurt my street cred to be seen in public with a guy who can't tell time is barely even a joke. but fraser and fitz-henley deliver their lines like two people actually trying to impress each other on a date, not like two community theater actors doing a first table read, and i ate up every second of it. when they laughed, i laughed. when they caught their breath and leaned in for a kiss, i caught my breath and leaned toward the tv, which was unreceptive to my advances.
acknowledging your emotions and sharing them with others can also help lead to solutions to various challenges.
in addition, i was going to start a new job at the beginning of april to earn some income, but that was delayed another month because of this virus. when you haven't supported yourself financially as an adult, starting anew as a single mother of three is intimidating.
logistically speaking, therapists typically rely on the time between sessions to reset themselves for their next client, noted stuempfig, adding that this can involve taking deep breaths to prepare themselves mentally for their next client so they can feel present and alert.
singles and couples alike fantasize about having three people in the bedroom. part of the appeal is the sensual overload — so many different body parts all intertwined. a lot of couples like the idea of a threesome for bringing some spark and excitement back into the bedroom. ―vanessa marin, sex therapist
toward the end of the interview, meghan said, my regret was believing that i would be protected.
pay attention to the negative facts people divulge about relationships, lancer said. ignore their vulnerability, bragging, and compliments.
scary! humbling. poignant. challenging. frustrating. sometimes i think opposable thumbs were invented so teenage girls could use text messaging. and now boys are coming into the picture. i'll get questions on that that just knock my socks off. i'll pretend to be cool about it, but inside i'm ... [pretends to faint]. but, hey, bring it on! i can answer that question about sex and try not to sound insane! these are girls, you must remember, who are growing up watching 'gossip girl' and movies like 'sex and the city.' my daughter saw 'sex and the city' and said, 'mom, don't go. you can't handle the sex.'
speaking of the men who beat her sister, varma said, they must have thought video bana rahi hai, humko bata rahi hai…
another example: a young man who owned a fine restaurant once told me that the men working there would bet on what women they would be able to seduce. he had 10 waitresses working for him, and said it disturbed him that he could make conquests of every one of them, even the married ones! he also told me he was surprised that he could even lure them away from their homes and their own children! this sickened me and broke my heart, but what's even sadder is that he did break up several marriages, including his own, because all those women left everything for him.

how he and the senator first met: the gillibrands met on a blind date while jonathan was studying in new york city at columbia university. at the time, sen. gillibrand was a lawyer in the city. i thought he was one of the nicest and kindest people i'd ever met, the senator told vogue in 2010, describing her first date with her future husband. that's what charmed me. their second date involved going to mass together at st. ignatius, on the upper east side.
alas, for too many other institutions, faith provides the material to build a defensive wall rather than a strong foundation. karen pence's new employer, immanuel christian, is one of many examples at the secondary level. i've been tracking similar issues at the collegiate level.
i was so nervous, i almost cried, she said. it was hot in the costume and there were so many people there i forgot what to say.
you do feel like you're living in a fishbowl, turner told marie claire last year. it's frustrating [that] it's the most mundane things that make the news ― how boring! there are really no other headlines?'
it was horrifying for us. we had never seen anything like this. we realised how polarised ahmedabad was. we were the only muslims in a 10 kilometre radius, naheed said. that was our first experience with the gujarat model of polarisation.
in order to convert in israel, the reform movement requires people to pursue a year of intensive religious study, commit to a jewish lifestyle, and perform certain rituals, such as circumcision and immersion in a jewish ritual bath, according to the jerusalem-based israel religious action center (irac), which has spent decades pursuing equal status for the reform and conservative movements in israel.
if one parent demeans or bad mouths the other to or in front of the children, it's going to backfire. every time. a child will always hold this behavior against the parent that spoke badly about the other.
now that the election is over i've decided to disconnect from the news and social media. there's just too much negativity and alarmism that i don't find healthy for me. this is tough to do though, and requires really being on your toes. i was looking for a youtube video the other day and a news stream showed up in the search results giving me the latest goings-on that i just didn't need to see or think about. but cutting back on the noise is doable, and i already see a difference in my outlook and attitude because i'm doing it. ― kurt smith, a therapist in roseville, california
authorities said the four suspects were rounded up by vigilantes and police and, if convicted, could face up to 100 lashes in public.
dream up something unique to do together in the bedroom, make a plan at least a week out and let your partner know something special is coming. drop hints along the way (sexting works well!) until the big, unforgettable night. the elements of surprise and anticipation that this helps create are critical to a lasting, powerful sexual relationship.
but northey said the majority of the couples eventually ran into a big hurdle: in spite of valuing gender equality in all areas of their lives, most struggled to make it happen at home since so few people have received any sort of training or modeling on how to do so.

it starts early. children are sheltered from negative feelings as if unhappiness is an illness they won't be able to shake. instead of teaching kids how to deal with the full range of their emotions, we treat them like they're fragile and incapable of navigating their way through uncomfortable feelings.

i've been able to get a lot of meetings with some big names by just playing to my age. in the business and entrepreneurial world, there's a lot of giving back. entrepreneurs who have made it love helping young entrepreneurs and so why not take advantage of that? send some emails to business owners that you want to talk to. tell them you're a young entrepreneur and ask if they'd be willing to meet and give you some feedback on your business idea! i guarantee you'll get some replies.
land tells her clients to stay cautiously optimistic but not too invested in the people in their dms.
broader societal factors could also play a role. suicides among american adolescents have been rising steadily since 2007, a phenomenon researchers still cannot fully explain. plus, research has found that depression and drug use spiked among the lgb community during the nationwide debate over banning gay marriage in 2004 and 2005. recent political developments, such as the highly publicized ban on trans soldiers in the military, may be having a similar effect.
in addition to weathering the pain of a breakup, you truly feel alone because of quarantine, said virginia gilbert, a marriage and family therapist in los angeles. ordinarily you'd commiserate with friends, but everyone's at home.
the first thing we talked about was paris hilton, and then all of a sudden you get the tone, jacobs said of fennell. some [filmmakers] want independent cred, and they're hanging out with the bon ivers or whatever. it's always the same thing: 'i want something really edgy. where's tom waits?' and so to have a conversation with someone that's like, 'i want to talk about paris hilton. i want to talk about pop music' — that's interesting.
we disagree on who gets to visit our baby at home.

the republican national committee has paid more than $250,000 to sekulow's for-profit cla group since 2017, when he was first named to trump's legal team as special counsel robert mueller was leading the russia investigation, according to campaign disclosures.
but not even oh could save the long beleaguered awards show hosting gig overall. because it's a bad job. what we really want is to see her in more leading roles on television, maybe even film. let her energy be focused on those important goals rather than a job that rarely receives praise. we put these hosts through the wringer, only to demand more from the next year's choice ― be funnier, be quicker, be more aggressive, but also relax. why do they even bother?
for example, you will regularly be tasked with helping your partner find lost items — their car keys, the remote, the ketchup, etc. — that aren't lost at all. one or both of you will routinely fall asleep five minutes into any movie or tv show you try to watch past 9 p.m. and no matter how much you love each other, you will, at some point, find yourself inexplicably perturbed by the way your spouse breathes.

the world around eastsiders would change, too, with same-sex marriage becoming the law of the land in 2015 followed by the election of president donald trump, who ran on an anti-lgbtq platform, the next year. such cultural shifts were woven into the narrative of eastsiders, expanding both the show's scope and ambitions. politics, in particular, became the source of some pushback among viewers when it was revealed that gay adult film actor colby keller, who appeared in a season 3 episode, was a trump supporter. (williamson, a democrat, defended the casting choice in an advocate essay.)
james is tracy now, some six months after coming out, and fully identifies as female to family and friends. she's been taking hormone replacement therapy and i hope it helps her healing and that she finds the emotional stability she deserves. she's also been doing extremely painful laser hair removal treatments on her face, for which she has to take several strong painkillers per session. i listen to her discoveries and struggles — fears over public bathrooms, work concerns, worse. i both worry about her and celebrate her transition and want her to be safe, finally proud of who she is becoming.
a fight is about each person trying to dominate the other to win, said jay heinrichs, a rhetoric professor and best-selling author of thank you for arguing. the goal of an argument is to win over the other person and get them to agree with you happily. in a relationship, it's better to argue ― even if it isn't easy. the first goal should be keeping the relationship intact, heinrichs said. a divorce usually isn't good for finances. so it's best to start out by saying, 'i love you. even when i think you're wrong, remember that i love you.' try to keep the argument away from blame for what happened in the past, or proof that the other person is a spendthrift or an idiot. focus on solutions, not blame. a rule of thumb: switch to the future tense, such as, i get why you're angry about what i did, but let's talk about how we're going to deal with this credit card debt.
now that i am sexually active, there's an added layer of guilt, where [i think], 'wow, if he rejected me nearly as many times as i did then, i would be crushed,' she said.

it is also liberating to acknowledge your role in the relationship's demise, lamotte said. even if your ex is 90 percent to blame, owning your part in the process is a way to make sure you learn from the relationship and position yourself for a healthier romantic future.

as peter and i have decided to go our separate ways, i am confident that we will both move in the direction of our purpose and never forget that god has a plan in all things. i will always love and respect him. i am convinced our paths were meant to cross and we are both better because they did.
express your appreciation. people often take their partners for granted, greer says. still say 'thank you' — even for the small things like doing the dishes, a cup of coffee in the morning, etc. saying 'thank you' never grows old!
my whole body trembled and i wanted to shout for someone to help me, but i felt uneasy doing this because of the man's advanced age, guessing he might be senile, so i didn't scream for help. i freed myself, put the ice cream in my cart and swiftly walked away.
i'm tired of feeling so suppressed and not feeling the love that god wants us to feel, said pierson, 18. it's time to show what god's love looks like and that his god is unconditional and infinite and reaches everyone, not just straight people and not just celibate gay people.
scholten, the democrat who lost to king, told huffpost wednesday that it's clear iowa republicans are frustrated with king, but where's the line drawn?
klobuchar has responded to the reports by saying she is tough, not abusive. on rachel maddow's msnbc show, and in similar comments at a cnn town hall, she said, i'm going to take the high expectations and bring them out to the country because if we want to really get these things done, some of these things should happen.
i was so grateful that she thought we still had enough to stick it out. god knows the burden she paid for that, bill states in the lead-in to the final episode, which details the backlash hillary faced and how it played into her bids for president years later.

in early 2017, the newly elected democratic gov. roy cooper and gop legislative leaders approved a replacement law that prohibited local governments from enacting new nondiscrimination ordinances for workplaces, hotels and restaurants until december 2020.
melissa kearney, an economics professor at the university of maryland, and phillip levine, an economics professor at wellesley university in massachusetts, published a report over the summer predicting the pandemic could result in half a million fewer births in 2021.
all of this could spell trouble down the line. birth rates were sinking to a record low, even before the covid-19 crisis. as levine recently told insider, fewer workers in the labor force could have a dire impact on our social security system, since it's dependent and financed through tax contributions of new employees.
the iranian people's demands have been put off too long, a protestor identified only as yaser told the bbc from the city of talesh. none of the authorities have allowed a platform for these demands to be heard. the protesters are decent, not saboteurs. ... they want jobs, an income and marriage. no protester deserves a bullet.
even though the wounds are still freshly cut, and like many heterosexual spouses, luanne is getting the raw end of the deal (a justifiable feeling that most heterosexual spouses feel) by having her little girl dreams of happily ever after shattered, the question remains, why me, why now, why to begin with? as understanding, compassionate, and loving as she can be, it doesn't take away the gut wrenching blow to the heart, self-esteem, and trust that luann built in her marriage to the man that she loved.
laura: he was actually pretty open-minded about it and interested. in retrospect, it was a good litmus test as to whether i should date him or not.
your ability to turn towards your partner during conflict
the next step is to choose a destination away from home to perform the wedding ceremonies. elite families compete most conspicuously on this decision, as they jostle to hire the most expensive heritage hotel or palace in india, popularly in the cities of udaipur and jodhpur. some claim the highest bid by choosing an international exotic destination, such as vienna.
other challenges, however, have resulted in gradual progress for lgbt+ people, including the right to obtain visas for dependents and spousal benefits for same-sex partners.
mcconnell has made judicial confirmations a top priority and has already helped trump dramatically reshape the federal courts. to date, trump has gotten 31 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two supreme court justices confirmed. that's so many circuit judges ― more than any other president confirmed by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on the u.s. circuit courts is filled by a judge nominated by trump.
my beautiful and dear friend @elizabethmessina has photographed all of my babies in my belly. #5 didn't disappoint. i feel the most comfortable, confident, natural, and beautiful when i am pregnant. the pregnant body is such a gift! thanks elizabeth for always capturing my heart and soul... i ❤️you forever. xoxo #bellypics #bellybump #bellyshoot #babyfive #bumpproud #loveyourbody
beyond that conversation, there was a moment that didn't make it on air when ethan really took my breath away. while we were talking, we heard some of the other cast members getting ready to play spin the bottle. as fun as that sounded, i didn't want my time alone with ethan to be cut short. before i knew what was happening, ethan had a cheeky little smile on his face and he was leading me to the side of the house behind some bushes where he proceeded to give me the biggest kiss. it was what most people would refer to as a fairy tale kiss ― he spun me around, dipped me, and i swore the world was melting around me. he told me he took his chance right then and there because he didn't want our first kiss to be during a stupid game of spin the bottle. i was officially smitten.
it is urgent and necessary for everyone — bishops, priests and lay people — to take a fresh look with the eyes of faith at the church and at priestly celibacy which protects her mystery.
i have wistfully gazed at couples who are all mushy-gushy with each other and desire that. i have also heard stories about the vitriol and violence in relationships and sigh with relief that i am a party of one. it is so much less complicated when i am the only one who needs to make decisions that affect my life, the only one to get out the door on time, the only one whose cleanliness standards i meet, without expectations of someone else meeting mine.
i don't know her address, vanessa lachey finally said. but thank you whoever sent it from us!

getting in touch with anger, as well as addressing your greatest fears regarding what would happen if you did lay down the law are critical pieces of the parenting puzzle. practicing calm in the eye of the storm (a herculean task, if ever there was one) is also essential.
i know, i know. thank you, the 37-year-old said, before addressing the audience. honestly, thank you and everybody for all the love and support. it's truly, so moving. it's all love.
marc owens, who served for 10 years as the director of the exempt organizations division of the internal revenue service, said the structure of the charities and corporations controlled by the sekulow family appeared designed to obscure just who is getting paid and how much.
prior to meeting my partner, i played the dating app game and hid my profession from guys until it was time to come out, after which they'd friend-zone me or try to check off their bang-a-stripper bucket list. finally, burned out on playing to male smallness, i threw the idea of dating to the wayside and owned myself, stripping and all.

back in the day, romantic rejection from strangers was mostly restricted to the bar and other places where singles congregate. today's singles have to deal with a one-two punch of rejection: they get rejected in person and on the apps, said marie land, a therapist in washington, d.c.
also hold off if you're feeling any subtle peer pressure.
outside of being that person who shouts i object! mid-ceremony, it's hard to know how to handle the situation. is it ever ok to voice your reservations earlier on ― or is that bound to lead to a best friend breakup?
divorce sucks. i did a lot of the wrong things in my marriage and don't blame her for leaving. i own it. i do wish however she stayed to see my transformation and give us another chance. i hate that we can't be together as a family with the kids. i hate some other male figure will be in my kids lives. but i did it and own it. at least i am becoming a better person as a result #getcleanandsober

in response to huffpost's questions, john wittman, a spokesman for abbott, did not address the governor's apparent break with catholic teaching. he emphasized that abbott's decision won't prevent refugees from coming to the u.s. or stop refugees from moving to texas after initially settling in another state.
if your date describes every single one of their exes as 'crazy,' it's a sign that they cannot take responsibility for their role in relationships. it's a strong red flag that they won't own their share of a relationship with you. relationships take investment from both people. someone who refuses to own their mistakes is not likely to fully invest, and you may end up being the one trying to make the relationship work. ― morghan richardson, a divorce attorney in new york city
when kotb told affleck you can tell you still love her in reference to garner, he immediately responded, of course, she's wonderful. somebody's the mother of your kids, they're going to be the most important, central person in your life, and that's good.
there's obviously no right way to broach the subject, but if you're apprehensive about bringing it up, it helps to have a loose script in mind.
on saturday, november 6, 2016 matt and luanne bravely, both in their own unique way, took the stage at tedx sonoma county to share their story, their journey, and their truth - a truth that demonstrates with respect, support, honesty, and a deep dive into forgiveness and understanding that both of them are trying to navigate the waters of unraveling a marriage of deception and lies, with dignity and love.
after monster-in-law, an unfinished life and the 2007 album brave, which was her first album that didn't debut in the top 10, lopez hit a nadir with critics and audiences alike. she took a few years off, giving birth to twins in 2008. by the time she returned with the formulaic romantic comedies the back-up plan (2010) and what to expect when you're expecting (2012), the comic-book craze had engulfed hollywood. the types of adult movies she'd made in the prior two decades — particularly rom-coms — were passé. if no one took her seriously then, certainly no one would do so now.
north carolina attorney general josh stein, a democrat, is investigating the potential abuse of charitable funds raised by the organizations tied to sekulow. spokeswoman laura brewer said it was unclear when that probe, begun in 2017, would be complete.

i was just floating after i got it, the 65-year-old naples resident told huffpost.
but the social registry is premised on the notion that citizen information — particularly aadhaar-related information — shared with any government department can be seamlessly incorporated into a unified database accessible to a third government agency. these safeguards, the officials at the october 2019 meeting complained, would make it very difficult to build the social registry.
i'm the grandma who likes to steal the kids as they come through the door. i'm the one that likes to say, 'why don't you have a date night and leave the baby with me?' i've baby-proofed the whole house again; it's like starting all over. being a grandparent is fantastic because you get to borrow the children for an intense amount of time, and then you get to hand them right back. i loved watching all the kids deal with the pregnancies and now watching them as parents.
tense, even combative mother-daughter relationships aren't unusual when the daughter is an adolescent. most of these relationships improve, however, when the daughter has reached her twenties.
our friendship and trust grew each day, and it honestly has been great to have the co-parenting support in the house without the expectation of having to make an unhappy marriage work just for the sake of it.
ye had your turn! she thrusts her palm under my eyes. tell me my future!
lucas said the black lawmakers told herring they needed to discuss their next steps among themselves.
focus on your own sensations while you touch your partner, then gradually add in more mutual touch and slowly build up to intercourse, landes said. but only pursue that last step when you're both ready, comfortable and confident.
yes, they have these little badges for lgbtq+ friendly vendors but you can't filter for that, lucero told out, also saying he cried all day after receiving the email from wise and wound up canceling two other visits to venues who later disclosed their own anti-lgbtq policies. so the onus is also on the knot because they can do something to change the experience for gay couples.
for what it's worth, they both seem to be thrilled for each other's success. when aniston went up to accept her sag award for female actor in a drama series, brad was seen watching with a big grin on his face backstage:
what made this a little unusual is that we had already gotten married, two years before, in a huge old church, surrounded by friends and family. we didn't split up and get back together, but we are a queer couple, and our home state of michigan didn't legally recognize same-sex marriage until the supreme court forced them to.
aceh police detained 12 transgender women earlier this year and publicly shamed them by forcing them to cut their hair and dress in masculine clothing.
we'll go do whatever we want to, whenever we want to do it. i'll take her wherever she wants to go, he told the herald-leader.
she knows that illness, inability and despair cannot rule. she comprehends that we all have coping mechanisms that can spring like weeds from barren ground and create a foundation for success. i've shown her that.
kuala lumpur, jan 4 (thomson reuters foundation) - two gay men have launched separate legal bids to overturn hong kong's ban on same-sex marriage, the first time the law has been challenged in court.
judy ho, a triple-board-certified clinical and forensic neuropsychologist and professor at pepperdine university, said sometimes we find it hard to voice our needs to the people in our lives.

i found myself extremely annoyed by the petty fighting (why don't you seduce me!) and enthralled by the deep discussions on how family dynamics might affect their relationships (my dad is very vocal about keeping the black family structure strong). so, i'm a responsible tv viewer. right, emma?
in new york city, where both bleich and stone have offices, quite a few clients have been mulling big life moves. for instance, with rents so high, many are trading city living for the suburbs and the promise of a backyard. (and obviously, there are plenty of instances where people have no say in the matter; they're let go from their jobs or need to downsize or move back in with their families for financial support.)
you have to hand it to your date: he or she picked the restaurant, effusively recommended things on the menu and knew exactly what bar you should head to after dinner. it might be nice to have someone plan everything out for you for a change, but narcissists call the shots for a very particular reason, malkin said: open-ended plans might end with them not getting their way ― something they don't respond well to.
the relatively minor activity in mag's string of abuses remains only one of the many accumulating taunts she aims maureen's way--taunts that maureen doesn't shy away from meeting and raising. eventually, the mounting mother-daughter battle, particularly the disappeared letter, leads to a radical development that won't be described here.
the modern republican party often functioned with limbaugh as a fulcrum. president barack obama's former chief of staff, rahm emanuel, once called limbaugh the voice and intellectual force of the republican party. limbaugh would at times massage the failures of the party and its leaders, dismissing obvious policy or political failures as simply part of liberal conspiracies.

the economic fallout, persistent health concerns, uncertainty about the safety and availability of medical care and the closure of schools all combine to make this a very unappealing time for couples to start or expand their family, said emily smith-greenaway, an associate professor of sociology and spatial sciences at the university of southern california.
a lot of fun to be around, indeed.
in 3 years, it does not mean that you will have no more problems. you will have bigger problems. because you are as big as the problems you are dealing with. today maybe you have problems of quality control, you have problems of marketing, and maybe you have problems of hiring the right people. in 3 years, you will have a big problem: how to become an international company. by solving the small problems you can address the bigger problems.
her father, a bank employee, only showed them one movie but he made them watch it three times when they were growing up, varma recalled. that was richard attenborough's gandhi. many years later, they made him see ashutosh gowariker's lagaan.
king married his high school sweetheart, freda miller, at 19, though the couple's parents had the marriage annulled within a year.
gold cited the following as a catastrophic thought process that can quickly get out of control: i failed a pop quiz in class. this means i'm going to fail the whole class, and then that means i'll never graduate. then i won't ever get a job and i'll be living in my parents' home for the rest of my life.
the governor spoke against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and supported a ban on conversion therapy for lgbtq youth during the rally.
she knows that children change everything. that they are both a responsibility and a freedom and that the love of a new baby after a decade, only increases the love in the home, not divides it. i've shown her that too.
12. denise richards: the best gift a parent can give children is time ... single moms need to know it's okay to have a little 'me' time. you'll feel refreshed and you'll be a better mom!
in addition to everything in the last slide, married couples should consider having joint accounts:
again, depression and anxiety are considered medical issues. sometimes that requires treatment, care and time.
jafar, her sister said, quit her job at a reputed school when the teachers were told to fill up the seats at a function organised by the bjp government, and when the students were told to line up and wave at the cm's cavalcade.
however, at age 11, i realized something was wrong with me, so to speak, when i knew my grandfather was going to die right before he did. in retrospect, that knowing, too, was a gift, not a curse, because i got to spend one last day with him. he communicated with me in a dream after i crossed, which was also my first mediumistic experience. it took me decades, though, to understand that my abilities were a gift and to embrace them fully. at times, they scared and overwhelmed me.
as of last week, oscar winners nicole kidman and javier bardem were said to be in final negotiations to play ball and arnaz, respectively.
in every relationship, one person outearns the other. yet both partners contribute to the relationship in different ways, solomon said. one may generate more income, but the other is the primary caregiver of offspring or older relatives. one may work, but the other attends school to get an advanced degree and, ultimately, a better-paying job.
a couple years ago, when i was writing for american dad!, i needed an arabic speaker for a small part. our casting director recommended a saudi comedian, who happened to be in la for a couple months shooting a tv show. his name is fahad albutairi. — kirk rudell (@krudell) january 2, 2019
i want them to know it's not ok what they have done. these are people's lives they are messing with, said williams, 24, of minot, north dakota. we are deserving of love and acceptance, and we are not going away.
reverting to old patterns is a natural and expected part of making a deeper change, but it's certainly not helpful in times like these.
when you hear it, simply acknowledge it. when you hear the voice in your head adding toxic color commentary to whatever you're doing, pause for a second and in the most neutral, least judgmental tone you can muster--simply acknowledge it's happening. not, here we go again! just, it's happening. if you're aware of the voice in your head, when you acknowledge that it's there, separate from you, then it can't control you.

sometimes it would be two or three guys in a row. as soon as i closed the door on the last guy, i'd think, that didn't hit the spot, then i'd find another one. it went on like this for years. last thanksgiving, he was back home to visit his parents and felt a compulsive need to have sex because he was so stressed out. when he finally found a guy nearby who was willing to hook up, he ran to his parents' room and started rifling through their drawers to see if they had any viagra. so that was the rock-bottom moment? i ask. that was the third or fourth, yeah, he says. adam's now in a 12-step program for sex addiction. it's been six weeks since he's had sex. before this, the longest he had ever gone was three or four days. there are people who have lots of sex because it's fun, and that's fine. but i kept trying to wring it out like a rag to get something out of it that wasn't in there—social support, or companionship. it was a way of not dealing with my own life. and i kept denying it was a problem because i had always told myself, 'i've come out, i moved to san francisco, i'm done, i did what i had to do as a gay person.'

because you've taken the time to practice your financial skills before marriage, you should have a good sense of your money values. that is a critical first step to ensuring financial compatibility with your partner. one of my favorite kernels of wisdom from kevin o'leary's recent book cold hard truth on family, kids and money is that the person you choose to marry is the most important business decision you'll make -- so choose wisely.
you'll be able to find out how you live together, how compatible and how tolerant you can be toward one another. sharing a living space will help you figure out what annoys and upsets you in regard to your differences, needs and priorities and whether the two of you can manage and accept them. also, when you live together, you realize the importance of teamwork and respect while dealing with chores and responsibilities.

the national organization for women immediately called on fairfax to resign, saying, her story is horrifying, compelling and clear as day — and we believe her.
sex scenes in movies or on tv may inspire couples to get it on. they may see something they want to try, or they may get aroused just watching. if watching erotic scenes makes you uncomfortable, this may be indicative of a problem in your own sex life or trigger some aspect of your own sexuality that is shameful or confusing. being able to enjoy a sexy scene with you partner is a sign of sexual health. if shame or embarrassment is getting in the way, it may be a sign of a problem. if you struggle to maintain sexual attraction to your partner, watching a sexy movie may serve as a painful reminder that you 'lost that lovin' feeling.' it may also spark a conversation that you do not want to have. honesty is the best policy. communicating directly about your sexual satisfaction, expectations and preferences is the best way to avoid a sexless relationship. ― kimberly resnick anderson, sex therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at ucla school of medicine
you and your partner can genuinely miss each other and, at the same time, have an appreciation for some alone time, he said. this is a good sign because couples who seek balance between together and alone time generally have greater respect for each other's needs.
all this to say: there is absolutely nothing surprising about an institution that has amassed its wealth and privilege through colonization and exclusion being unsupportive of a mixed-race black woman. because the institution was not designed with someone like her in mind, no matter how much proximity to whiteness she may have. meghan, regardless of her light complexion, white husband and royal children, was always going to be seen as an outsider and a potential threat to the status quo. and, as princess diana suggested in her own infamous interview in 1995 after leaving the royal family, anyone who is considered an outsider to the institution is seen as a problem. full stop. 'what do we do with her?'
how to talk about finances early in a relationship

the hardest question of all! i tend to love certain authors' styles of writing and have a hard time picking singular works. some of the (many) poets who have inspired me are: dick allen, jehanne dubrow, jack gilbert, dorianne laux, david lehman, w.s. merwin, faith shearin, sharon olds. some of the (many) fiction writers who have inspired me are: geraldine brooks, willa cather, jennifer haigh, maile meloy, keija parssinen, james salter, elizabeth strout, richard yates. and i have to add, with great sincerity, that the book club selections by words after war are stunningly beautiful and intelligent; i had read almost all of the 2015 picks long before my book was selected.

rather than trying to fix' your partner, you focus on improving your own life. many individuals focus on changing their partner and avoid dealing with their own issues. rather than investing your energy into fixing your partner, you've made a commitment to improve some of your undesirable traits – since we're all flawed in some way.

claire: it does get pretty dark! what surprised me was that the first episodes, which rely more on quips and cracks, didn't really land for me. i was fascinated by her performance, which was so textured and ebullient, and by those of her friends maxine (greta lee) and lizzy (rebecca henderson), but i didn't laugh much. it made me feel like an outsider in new york again, after almost a decade of living here, because her brand of humor and the content of her jokes were almost too foreign to me to find them instinctively humorous. it's when the show started to get eerie that i, counterintuitively, fell in love.

we have seen couples who are really affectionate and really on each other all night ― and now they're divorced. i remember a specific wedding where i was with this super young, super fit couple. they had a very physical relationship and it was interesting to watch their body language and how they communicated with each other. at the end of the wedding, they invited me to photograph them in a private room for intimate and sexy photos. by the way they asked me, i wasn't sure if they wanted me to photograph them or join them. it was an odd feeling and i politely declined, finished my evening and went home. one year after the wedding, they were separated. ― sol tamargo, co-founder of del sol photography based in playa del carmen, mexico

i think the job of a journalist is to tell the whole truth, if they know something, if you have real facts and real sources, powell said. part of the challenge with r. kelly for many years[...] is that there were all kinds of enablers around him, and it appeared that many people who made allegations or knew things were paid off. on top of that fame, celebrity, is a very destructive thing. people turn their heads and ignore things because of their addiction to the famous, to celebrities.

in november of 2018, bobonick wrote a post on medium, insisting that kouprianova was hounding her online and on her phone. in our interview, spencer implied that maybe kouprianova had leaked nude photos of her online. when i asked kouprianova about all of this, she shrugged — not confirming, not denying. if anything illegal was done ― leaks, harassment ― let the police get involved, was her stance. it's spencer's stance, too. even in the falling apart, it's easy to see how the two of them got together.

no one has to impersonate lucy ricardo nor do the vitameatavegamin routine, or the chocolate factory routine or any of the silly things, she said. it's the story of lucille ball, my actual mother, not lucy ricardo, and her husband, desi arnaz, my dad, not ricky ricardo.
it's been 12 years since i was on tv, in my denim dress and exhausted eyes, happily describing for the cameras how i planned to live the rest of my life like this: diapers, baths, dishes, laundry, supervising children. but it's only been four years since i started to see that something was wrong with us. what happened?

i didn't watch the oscars; i don't know what went on, i don't care what went on, she said in a video posted on wednesday. i commented on something that i thought was funny … and to find that people are making judgment calls about me or them or the people that the comment was about is really psychotic.

native american nations set their own enrollment criteria in constitutions, articles of incorporation, and ordinances. these can include tribal blood quantum, tribal residency, or continued contact with the tribe. the criteria vary from nation to nation, so uniform membership requirements do not exist. the key is knowing which tribe or band your ancestor most often aligned with.

jane would have been in her teens when she wrote these fake marriage entries, commented hampshire county council's executive member for culture, recreation and countryside, councillor andrew gibson in a statement, and some could say it reveals a mischievous side during her younger years. given the mischief found in her spirited, witty novels, such a quality should hardly be a surprise.

imagine what it's like to be a student or professor at wheaton today and to know that it's not just required to be a christian, but to be exactly the right type of christian. will the next professor at franciscan who wants to challenge students with a complex, possibly offensive, book hold back in order to preserve their professional status? and no one, anywhere, ever, should risk employment because of who they love or what consensual activities they choose to engage in with other adults.
you are making a decision based on strength and choice rather than fear of being alone. for instance, you may have felt a nagging doubt about tying the knot with your ex-spouse, but proceeded anyway due to feelings of obligation or fear of being alone.

while this could be true of many couples in this day and age — when work can call upon you wherever you happen to be via email or text — the couples that leave some time for fun, pleasure and intimacy are the ones who have a better chance of committing to creating time for sex. there are also hints that one or both partners are unconsciously avoiding intimacy through the overloading of their schedule. ― cooper
as a result, i felt entirely alone and isolated, unable to talk about my journey to a new way of thinking with other mormons, even those i considered close friends. if i did try to gently get at the problem, i was encouraged to read the scriptures more, to pray more, and to do more church service, which felt like a brush off.

it was 2005 and i first spotted all five foot nothing of one of the world's most famous faces during the break of this behemoth recovery meeting held in a synagogue just off of sunset boulevard. it was carrie fisher and she was wearing a black cocktail dress, her hair a bright fuchsia color as she ran, barefoot, like a haight ashbury hippie, to the courtyard.
there were the christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside american flags. the rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of god, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white christian supremacy. last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. she felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.
it takes more time than one week to understand each other's habits and rhythms to see if you're compatible, or how the two of you go about solving differences, she said. it would be worth taking two to three weeks or even a month off to see what it's really like to live together under one roof.

hedger constantly finds inspiration in everyday life with her husband and daughters, ages 12 and 14. sometimes, she gets ideas from her married friends and family members. but either way, hedger always jots them down immediately ― either in a notebook, in an email to herself or by recording a voice memo on her phone ― so she doesn't forget.

second, be consistent with reinforcing boundaries. park said it's common for people to react poorly at first to newly established boundaries, but if you stay consistent, most people will adjust.
the best advice i can give is this too shall pass. there were times in the early days that i never imagined we'd have the relationship we have now. every single person involved has to have a kids-first attitude. when you do that, it's easier to let things go. it is a constant give and take but if you can put the needs of your kids first, everything else falls into place. whenever i feel irritated or inconvenienced, i always think, they didn't choose this life, this schedule. it puts things into perspective. wine also helps.
ben affleck's recent and very public redemption tour has seemingly led him into the arms of a new woman: ana de armas.
it's disappointing that you need a complete stranger to tell you this, but now is the time for you to step up like you never have before. and don't wait for her to ask you to do it, either. you're a grown-ass man. you know what it takes to run a household. so do it.

their marriage was annulled not long after their wedding.
11. be careful how you react: the way you react to a situation determines the outcome. if the outcome is not to your liking, then respond differently. instead of blaming the event or your partner, look honestly at yourself. the answers may surprise you.
i always just expect her to put on a show, belt a few songs out. but she never does, the 34-year-old said during an interview on siriusxm studios' sway in the morning on tuesday.
hysterical for every adult age, the wonderful vic dibitetto's timing is never off. the mr. rogers type bit with, these are the people in the neighborhood, was naturally thrown in at just the right moment to get the audience roaring. what makes dibitetto's comedy so wonderful is that he is so relatable. the fun never stops with vic as he seamlessly goes from one routine to another effortlessly. i say what you are thinking, he explains doing his comedy during his act. the statement could not be truer and is certainly why he is so loved. perhaps the funny man's most perfect commentary on life is his tag line, it is what it is.
in a candid post on his facebook page tuesday, ben affleck revealed that he recently completed treatment for alcohol addiction.
while loss is always challenging, when your loving adult is in charge you will not feel alone in your loneliness. you will be there for your own feelings with kindness and compassion, allowing yourself to grieve when the grief comes up. while you may always feel sad when you think of your departed loved one, you will not feel empty, alone, angry or fearful when you are being a loving adult, compassionately embracing all of your feelings.

this type of wealth creates power, and we've seen powerful men in hip-hop use their position to silence victims. recently, three brave women came forward to allege that they were raped by russell simmons, a legendary gatekeeper in the hip-hop community. these women described feeling powerless against the mogul and afraid that if they spoke publicly about what simmons allegedly did, they would be ostracized by the community in which they worked. we've known for decades that singer r. kelly repeatedly uses his power and influence to allegedly coerce minors into inappropriate relationships with him. we all know about his illegal marriage to a 15-year-old aaliyah. we've read the stories about his compound where he allegedly keeps a cult of underaged black girls against their will. yet this man is still able to sell tickets to shows and go on a world tour.

note: the following essay contains mentions of suicide. names and some identifying characteristics have been changed. because every transgender person approaches their identity, transition and the elements related to both in their own personal way, no two approaches will be the same. in accordance with tracy's wishes, male pronouns and the name she was given at birth are used for the first half of the essay and female pronouns and her new name appear in the second half.
beyond the history, however, there are many reasons ― practical, psychological and insurance-related ― to stick to this time frame. huffpost spoke to stuempfig and other therapists to find out why the 45- or 50-minute session has persisted.
still, hip-hop is black women's baby, and what mother isn't protective of her child? i suspect this deep sense of protection is part of the reason we choose to ignore the many ways the industry has violated women. we may never see a massive public reckoning with sexual harassment like the one we're witnessing in hollywood. respectability politics dictate that black people ― entertainers included ― overcome historical stereotypes that label us violent, sex-hungry criminals. having a public conversation around real-life crimes like sexual harassment and assault that occur within the hip-hop industry ― within our family ― would feel like pulling the curtain back and exposing your family issues to the world. it's uncomfortable, and it stands in direct contradiction to the adage, family business is family business.
i have another long-divorced friend who says it would take someone exceptional to take her out of her single life. while i love being single with the freedom to create my own life, i simultaneously miss the companionship of a partner. i have amazing friends who meet some of my needs. i wish i could create a composite person comprised of all the wonderful qualities of those i know.

fast forward to now - january 15th. the party was last sunday evening.
i started to take a hard look at my life. i couldn't ignore that the main thing driving my discontent was that i felt unsatisfied in my marriage. deep-diving into what was wrong meant i stopped holding back when i spoke to my husband. i railed against him about all kinds of things, like coming home late or being distracted by his phone. i was always on him for being unreliable. i let my anger come to the surface, and we had the same arguments over and over because i was no longer hiding my feelings about what i needed.
i had the worst mil-zilla — constantly driving me crazy throughout the wedding planning. i kept a lot of her demands from my fiancé; she was his mother, after all. but during the wedding rehearsal, when she started trying to stage-manage everything, i took ted aside and hissed at him, 'if you don't get her to back off, i will, and it won't be pretty!' he looked at me and i saw thought bubbles over his head with captions like 'hoo boy. if i don't start putting my wife first, there will be hell to pay!' he said, 'okay, but you've got to let me hang the mickey mouse picture you hate in our bathroom.' i shrieked, 'aaagh. i guess i have no choice!' and we went back to the rehearsal. we didn't discuss it again, but he talked to his mother, she was fine during the wedding, and i gnashed my teeth but let mickey be a part of our decorating scheme. —beth

her advice to them is pretty simple: if you're feeling an internal sense of peace, reciprocal respect and solid communication flowing with your partner, go for it, regardless of the pandemic.

and that is what we decided to tell our 7-year-old daughter when we explained our transition. we were intentional in not using the word divorce or separation, and instead we told her we were uncoupling. we told her he was moving downstairs (the beauty of multi-leveled homes in california) and i was going to sleep alone in the master bedroom. other than that, nothing else was going to change. we continued our family outings to the park on weekends. we continued having family dinners on friday nights at our favorite restaurants. we shared our house and our time with her.

my lived experience has convinced me that addicted persons need access to more than just treatment. while treatment is a good start, sustained recovery can only be achieved by ensuring that people are set up for success afterward. would we treat cancer patients with chemotherapy for just 30 days and then send them on their way hoping for the best? of course not. cancer patients receive a multiyear continuum of care, driving toward the best possible outcome. the same should be true with addiction — or as the medical professionals call it these days, substance use disorder.

young children take everything literally, so parents should avoid saying things like 'we lost the baby' because they might start worrying that their parents will lose them too, stuempfig said. an honest explanation can be easier for children to comprehend, such as 'we don't know why this happened. sometimes babies are born healthy like you were and sometimes it doesn't happen that way and the baby isn't born.'

classes at quest to learn also have unconventional names: sports for the mind stands in for media arts, and the way things work is the rough equivalent of mathematics. in this semester's sports for the mind, the students must save new york from a fictional apocalypse by designing a role-playing game. quests involve discussing infrastructure and the different roles city officials play to keep a city safe during emergencies. (hurricane sandy provided ample real-world examples.) a floor below, kids in a fourth-grade were designing their own superheroes on a complex-looking graphics program. my superhero is a girl, a young boy with curly blonde hair said, stepping aside so we could see his screen. because there aren't enough girls kicking butt.
last week, mary tyler moore passed away at the age of 80. moore made history in 1970 when she portrayed, for the first time in television history, a single professional working woman. in doing so, moore immediately became the epitome of a modern-day feminist and brilliantly maintained that moniker for nearly 50 years. today, it's almost impossible to imagine television without strong single professional women (where would we be without olivia pope and carrie mathison?!) and recall that there was a time when women were portrayed only as homemakers. it deserves a place in the used to be's list -- there used to be no cable television, no cell phones, no internet and no strong female characters on tv! who can imagine?!

to be honest, our relationship is the best it's ever been in the 10 years we've been married, she said. there's a stigma to sleeping separate, but being tired and resentful of your partner can't be good for your relationship. finding that balance of being independent but still needing each other without being codependent is a fine line to walk, and i think having your own personal space can help with that.

the family's reality tv show keeping up with the kardashians documented her troubles conceiving with ex-husband lamar odom. after undergoing fertility treatments, kardashian seemingly gave up at a certain point, saying she was fake trying to get pregnant as her marriage began to crumble.
sure, you may technically have a lot of alone time on your hands, but there's bound to be days ― or even a run of a few days ― when you need a little you time. maybe after a long day in front of the computer screen at work, you simply don't have the mental energy for a skype call. whatever the case, your partner should respect that, said gary brown, a psychotherapist in los angeles.

by parroting such conservative political views under the guise of christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. while all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

5. enjoy the freedom of being yourself. there is a misperception that long-term relationships bring with them a loss of freedom. in reality, a strong committed relationship provides the emotional support and space for you to be who you truly are. a healthy relationship is a sanctuary- a place to come home and let loose. a coveted marriage or relationship is an unconditional, reciprocal love that knows no bounds. relationships are not easy. they are, however, worth it.

weber, whose connection with prewett became more and more obvious as the final episodes dragged on, ended his engagement with sluss, who delivered an eloquently self-righteous speech and then gave weber a brutally necessary talk to the hand as she left his house. with nearly all the other moderates dropping out of the primary, biden emerged from super tuesday with a competitive delegate count and all but locked up the nomination after this tuesday's voting.
then in 2003, said kalapura, something terrible happened— she wouldn't reveal what this was— and she found that the only way to cope and heal was to scribble her thoughts down. she began by writing accounts of how she dealt with difficulties and moved on to composing short poems about nature and how she realised 'god lives in nature'. later, as the years passed and the restrictions of the convent began chafing, she also began jotting down her thoughts on love, marriage and life. all this was merely a process of catharsis until 2016, when some close friends suggested kalapura should publish her poems in the form of a book.
generosity is something freely given as a gift, with nothing expected in return. when a relationship feels secure, it is easy to want to offer more than your fair share of tasks or thoughtful gestures to show your love for your partner. whether moving their clothes to the dryer for them or going on their favorite hike again, highly fulfilled couples tend to maintain great satisfaction from being thoughtful and generous toward their partner rather than scorekeeping. ― kari carroll, couples therapist
here's hoping these two lovebirds have a great life lounging in his and hers recliners together forever!
one way to look at it? although it is the ending of your marriage, it is not the ending of everything. a divorce does not have to define you (and shouldn't) and limit you to the person that you think you are unless you allow it to. by focusing on you, what you need, and what your family needs, you will be able to get through your divorce and end up on the other side. often there are nuggets of opportunity that are hiding in plain sight if we just take a step back and refocus.

a few things i found interesting: the word race came up several times during the interview, but the more explicit, straight-to-the-point word racist was uttered only once or twice by meghan and her husband, prince harry. the entire conversation obviously hinged on the fact that a large reason why they left the u.k. was due to the out-and-out racism meghan experienced at the hands of the british press and the royal institution. there was discussion about the numerous double standards she experienced due to race, including how u.k. tabloids covered her as opposed to her sister-in-law, kate middleton.
claire: the birthday, being a day that many of us use to check in on our progress and panic about our ever-approaching mortality, is a relatable peg in that way. i like to think of myself as quite devil-may-care about aging ― and so does nadia, who insists to her friends that she wasn't freaked out about this birthday, her 36th, which will make her older than her late mother ever lived to be ― but i am full of it, and so is nadia. she's not at peace with her age, with her mother's death, with the complicated relationship they had when she was alive.

it's why i talked about the fight we had about the $65 raven shorts, which i wear all the time. it's hilarious. it's stupid because he was a real person. you can't live with somebody for six years and not have a fight with them. you can't not have dumb arguments about stupid crap that mean nothing. i wanted to talk about that, too, so i would say sometimes, oh, and he was a jerk sometimes.
we both love dinosaurs and we have two boys, pearson said. i wanted the boys to be able to have a story they will remember forever.

as a deputy minister and as an anc member of parliament, madikizela-mandela was a total rebel against the strictures and protocol of formal political life. she was a serial truant in parliament and, truth be told, a very poor deputy minister. far more powerful for her was the battlefield of street struggle and other arenas where she could sit on a people's pulpit and criticize what she believed was the compradorist politics of the anc.

nothing's actually surprised me. i've lived exactly what they're living. i've lived the torment of the names. i've lived the torment of boyfriends breaking up with me because they were afraid i was going to be too fat later in life, the 29-year-old model said at the urban arts partnership 25th anniversary benefit.

in an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. this decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. we are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.
the two stars separated in june of 2015 amid rumors that pegged affleck as the guilty party for an alleged affair with the couple's nanny. garner later shot down speculation that extramarital activities had contributed to their split in a refreshingly candid interview for vanity fair, explaining that their problems began long before nannygate.

parental criticism and overstepping may be well-intentioned (though certainly not always), but more times than not, such comments prove divisive and damaging to the relationship.
i met my husband just shy of turning 25. i wasn't looking for love but i fell head first into the most passionate relationship of my life. things evolved -- fast -- and one day there he was down on one knee with a ring that symbolized my future.
just as i have evolved, so too have public awareness and public policies regarding alcoholism and drug addiction. i wish we knew then what we know now. in 1989, the year i entered lasting recovery, our country was deep within the grip of the war on drugs.
unfortunately, this holiday scene has played out many times before, and it is often the final straw in a relationship.

earlier this month, bermuda made history, and not in a good way. the territory claimed the dubious honor of becoming the first place to legalize and then overturn marriage equality. bermuda governor john rankin, approved the domestic partnership act 2017, a bill that essentially took away marriage equality and replaced it with civil partnerships.
hobbies are important, which is why it's a good thing if you have a spouse who loves football, even when you hate it. ultimately, that means your spouse will have interests and things that make him happy outside of your relationship. in the beginning, most couples spend all their time together. but eventually, you are going to want to hang out with your friends and do the things that make you happy. if he doesn't have his own thing going on, he might guilt trip you by saying you don't care about the relationship. in a relationship, both of you need to have a life of your own.― caroline madden
having that moment to focus on each other without any distractions was a moment we will cherish forever, long told huffpost. there's something special about making a huge commitment in the space where you have been growing together for years. there's no place better than home, right?
i happen to be blessed in a very happy marriage and cannot imagine living a life in which i was told that it was sinful for us to be together.
four years after graduating, i stumbled into an underground art gallery in london and found myself standing amongst life-sized bondage sculptures. an artist approached me and it turned out that 9-year-old me had been right ― i could be a model after all. specifically, a bdsm model. i'd always been fascinated with stories about captivity, authority and punishment, but i hadn't dreamed that it might be a bona fide sexual identity that others shared.
motherhood. the great world of pretenders. you want golden globes and academy awards - ask us overachieving mothers. the ones who try to do it all, make it all, and fix it all. because that's what mothers do isn't it? we pretend. we hide. or we fall apart; i don't know very many in between moms. and i'm one of those great pretenders. or i use to be.

un-moving in might make the most sense for couples where one or both partners have children from previous relationships. sometimes maintaining separate residences until the kids are out of the house is ultimately best for all parties.
simply put, engaging in a physical relationship with another person is cheating. some suggest that flirting or having intimate conversations with someone else also crosses that line; we agree to a certain extent. for a couple to endure, it is essential for both members to be as honest as possible with each other. that said, having private conversations with other people, to us, does not necessarily count as cheating, but it is wholly inappropriate and unfair to the other party. to cheat is to act on the impulse which pushes you to look outside of your relationship for short-lived pleasure. that breaks the bond of your relationship, it jeopardizes the couple, and is an unforgivable betrayal. ― pascal and bryan, vloggers at him and him
it's easy to love somebody that's blood and everything else, but when you can love somebody just like it's your own child and everything else, that's what real love is like, he said.
finally, facing the prospect of a tsunami of lawsuits and their potential for financially damaging if not destroying the business of football, the nfl caved. in 2015 they agreed to a $1 billion settlement with over 5000 former players who accused the nfl of deceitfully hiding from them knowledge of the devastating long-term effects of concussions suffered during their careers.

no matter what your choice, always remember this. keeping your last name does not make you an unfaithful wife. keeping your last name does not mean you are a radical woman. women: you have a choice. you have a brain. you have an identity. women, you matter. (men, you do too.)

abbott's decision could have a crucial impact on refugee resettlement during a period when trump has already slashed refugee admissions to historically low levels. during the federal government's 2019 fiscal year, which ended on sept. 30, texas resettled more new refugees than any other state, according to the pew research center. and since the 2002 fiscal year, texas has resettled about 88,300 refugees, second only to california.

images from the capitol riot felt more familiar than shocking to 28-year-old mel garman, who grew up attending evangelical christian schools.
one way to end or reverse a sexless marriage is to make a plan and create an erotic date. it can be a daunting task and you may feel anxious that things will feel awkward, uncomfortable and the night may not live up to your expectations. that's ok. in fact, you may not want to have intercourse at all. the first date you might just touch, or lay naked in bed together. reconnecting sexually doesn't have to feel threatening. take it one step at a time and enjoy the process.

one reporter asked about outreach to queer mormons, many of whom have said they feel ostracized by the church. in november 2015, the church adopted a policy that deemed same-sex couples apostates. it also prohibited children of these couples from getting blessed or baptized until they were 18 years old, at which point they need to disavow their parents' marriage in order to join the church.

if implemented, these changes will render the supreme court judgment meaningless and even dilute the original aadhaar rules: one of the key safeguards in the current rules states that the information received from a person in an aadhaar-enabled transaction can only be used for the specific purpose for which their aadhaar information was sought. this information cannot be shared further.

to be young is to be selfish. that's not a theory based on psychological fact but on observations of the children that now surround me. exhibit a is my 2-year-old nephew's hilariously declaring, me! me! me! when pointing out whatever it is he wants, right here, right now.
this theory, known as minority stress, may also explain another surprising finding from the study: for high school students, bisexuals were more likely to have attempted suicide than their straight or gay peers.
the legislation drew criticism from religious advocacy organizations that said it went too far and would effectively punish people who oppose gay marriage for faith-based reasons.
remember that you are not the voice in your head. the voice in your head is a dramatic interpretation of what's going on in your life--as told by your fragile ego. it's not you. it's a story: a story with a plot created in your mind, overdramatized by your ego and fueled by your high expectations.
this is a definite red flag indicating a strong degree of selfishness. if you find yourself always giving weight to only your own point of view, you are setting your relationship up to fail. what you are really saying to your partner is that you are really only in this relationship to get your own needs meet, with little or no consideration for the needs of your partner. if that's the case, you really aren't a partner at all. ― gary brown, marriage and family therapist

being a medium is like being in the role of a translator, translating a universal emotional language into english ― and at times, hearing words and phrases, feeling impressions of things or watching little movie clips. it is a receiving of information rather than a retrieving of it.

i think the most impressive thing about lebron james is that he can convince his very famous teenage son to participate in a goofy full-family dance for instagram. — tom westerholm (@tom_nba) march 7, 2020
my aunt and uncle have been together longer than anyone i know and they were never married. my dad has been with his girlfriend for five years and is happier than he ever was while married. my mom was with her boyfriend for thirteen years and was miserable. there are all kinds of situations with relationships, but marriage, from my experience, doesn't seem to play any role in whether they are good ones or not.
perhaps it's more instructive to think about it as a spectrum. art that ignores politics altogether and actively tries to be apolitical is often misguided. on the other hand, making a piece of work that's too on-the-nose and inserting relevance for marketing purposes is inauthentic. sometimes, deliberately underlining a movie's modern-day parallels can have the opposite effect on moviegoers.

after our ceremony, we took pictures at a couple of quintessential d.c. spots, including the queer love mural in blagden alley. then just before sunset, we took pictures on the steps of the supreme court. it was surreal to be there as a newlywed queer couple in that moment. the grief and intensity of the year were heaviest in the days before the nov. 3 election — we could feel the fear and uncertainty in our bones. and we had so many black and brown and queer and trans folks on our hearts that day.

my parents split up before i was 2 years old. my father went on to marry a total of seven times. my mother found true love with another woman. and me? i've been divorced twice. but i still believe in marriage, partially because although it took my parents several tries to find their soulmates, they both eventually did. mom and pat have been together over 40 years. dad and tricia have been together over 20. they have taught me to never to give up on finding true love. ― lara lillibridge, author of the forthcoming girlish: growing up in a lesbian home
she's learned to subvert her femininity and her prettiness and her blondness to effectively hide and mislead — like lots of addicts do, actually, fennell said. and so she's just learned the tricks to keep things functioning on the surface, to stop people from asking too many questions. for me, if she's fluffy and pink and welcoming but she's boiling with this terrible rage, then i think it was important that the film itself reflected that, that it felt just as inviting as her and just as misleading as she is.
the japanese woman in the picture was the famous mother of the guy who had occupied this room before i came along--and who would continue to occupy it when he wasn't on tour or out of the country during the months i was there, when i would move to the house. his father had been in the beatles and, if you must know the truth, yes, i did use his soap on my nether regions just to have some beatles dna on me.

there should not be a 'oh, my god, the british family is racist' ― of course they're racist, lemon sad. that's what the entire monarchy is built on ― the racism, the family that is supposed to be in that only by birth. and so far by birth, it's only been white royals on the british throne.

we underestimate the importance of physical attraction in long-term relationships. in the beginning, couples make commitments to grooming, wearing clothes that make them feel desirable and feeling good about themselves. when you start to feel like roommates, you might need to change out of your sweats and comfy clothes and get ready for an intimate night together. take a long bath or shower, put on something that makes you feel good about yourself, and put energy into feeling sensual. even if you are staying in for the night, put something on that makes you feel open for sex and connection, like your favorite lingerie or use a new massage oil or perfume. ― shannon chavez, psychologist and sex therapist
on a crisp saturday night in september, a private party celebrating the hustlers premiere at the toronto international film festival could be marked by two halves: before jennifer lopez and after jennifer lopez. bjl spanned 11:30 p.m. to approximately 1 a.m. people were evenly dispersed throughout the bar, enjoying a routine soirée. a place card brandishing lopez's name sat on an unoccupied table. it was starting to seem like she might not show when murmurs rippled across the room. she's here! ajl had begun.
this was her modern family now. my actual family was a different story. my family is a very traditional, conservative mexican family, and they were having a really hard time understanding the situation. my parents were married till death did them apart. my father passed away after being married to my mother for 48 years. before, when we shared our decision to consciously uncouple, they were puzzled and upset. how would we make this living situation work? why would we want to continue to live together? this was crazy! think about your daughter!

lopez fielded question after question from the press about her supposed diva demands — america's way of telling a famous woman she's made it. (she's not high-maintenance, producer kelliann ladd contested when i spoke to her.) the single jenny from the block acted as a rebuttal, attempting to marry her down-home bronx upbringing with her newfound wealth. but if you have to inform people you're humble, they might not take your word for it.

like so many things in our family –- feelings, illness, conflict –- this was just another unspoken understanding. with the weight of this pressure on me (much of it self-imposed), i broke down multiple times throughout the last year of wedding planning. would they notice the little touches? oranges to signify wealth, chopstick favors for fertility, roast pigs to symbolize the bride's chastity? would they be able to hear the playlist i had painstakingly curated, full of nostalgic chinese ballads from the 1980s?

you do better in the gym with a trainer; you don't figure out how to cook without reading a recipe, she told good housekeeping in 2015. therapy is not something to be embarrassed about.
i can't vouch for whether the conceptual science of all this is airtight ― some of it seemed a little hand-wavy to me. why are the insides of fruit still ripe while the exteriors have apparently been hurtling forward in time, unaffected by the resets? does the fourth dimension distinguish between peel and pulp? someone explain this to me! but regardless, i loved that the show wasn't afraid to mess around with possible explanations and to land on something that feels both fantastical and functional instead of some bullshit like they were dreaming the whole time.

atwood has a penchant for facing contemporary problems head-on, exploring them through fictional stories set in the could-be near future. the heart goes last is set amid an economic disaster that has antiheroes charmaine and stan living in a car, moving often to avoid threatening visitors. the solution, it seems, is a community that functions by allowing its citizens alternating months of comfort and willful imprisonment, doing the grunt work that keeps the small society functioning. things go swimmingly for a while -- until they don't.

when you're in a long-term relationship, a discussion around merging finances is a really good idea. most often, cohabitation is the the right time to have the money conversation. before then, it might make your partner uncomfortable. moving in together means sharing costs, so it makes sense to start then, though it's ultimately up to you to decide the best time.
teddy zee, then an executive at columbia pictures, saw the same quality that phillips-palo did when lopez's manager, eric gold, encouraged him to pay attention to lopez while visiting the in living color set. zee was so committed to lopez's potential that he let her pick between two hot scripts before she was even a household name. fools rush in — a traditional romantic comedy released amid the glory days of julia roberts and meg ryan — had already booked the friends-anointed matthew perry as its leading man. zee was convinced lopez would favor fools over her alternative, the creature feature anaconda.

one of the best parts of her job is seeing readers share her cartoons with their significant others.
so i would dial out to get some meth delivered and check the internet to see if there were any parties happening. it was either that or watch a movie by myself. jeremy is not my only gay friend who's struggling. there's malcolm, who barely leaves the house except for work because his anxiety is so bad. there's jared, whose depression and body dysmorphia have steadily shrunk his social life down to me, the gym and internet hookups. and there was christian, the second guy i ever kissed, who killed himself at 32, two weeks after his boyfriend broke up with him. christian went to a party store, rented a helium tank, started inhaling it, then texted his ex and told him to come over, to make sure he'd find the body. for years i've noticed the divergence between my straight friends and my gay friends. while one half of my social circle has disappeared into relationships, kids and suburbs, the other has struggled through isolation and anxiety, hard drugs and risky sex. none of this fits the narrative i have been told, the one i have told myself. like me, jeremy did not grow up bullied by his peers or rejected by his family. he can't remember ever being called a faggot. he was raised in a west coast suburb by a lesbian mom. she came out to me when i was 12, he says. and told me two sentences later that she knew i was gay. i barely knew at that point.

futuracha pro isn't the first font to offer adjustments as people type, but it is a step beyond the usual. most fonts take advantage of ligatures and embellishments in an attempt for visual corrections, paparounis said. futuracha on the other hand, not only provides ligatures, but a wide variety of them to choose from. it places creativity beside functionality, play before instructions, experimentation before manuals.

beyatte and his wife have tried to get home on commercial transport but to no avail. they have booked seven different flights back to the u.s.; four have been canceled and the remaining three are likely to be. due to the lack of information from official channels, beyatte said he is in large part relying on a facebook group where fellow travelers stranded in nepal share information about their communications with the embassy, hotel openings and lockdown updates.

why the phrase has become particularly useless to audiences
what?! you're asking. why would i think about such a silly thing? what is there to think about? i'm so happy you asked. although i love my husband and even his last name, the fact of the matter is that it is not my name. changing my name felt like giving up my identity. i did a lot of research on the topic. i listened to lots of people. i have heard it all -- you're not losing your identity, you're gaining a new part of yourself. if you don't change your name, you aren't honoring your husband. if i had a different name than my husband, how would people know we were married? wouldn't that be confusing? but the most frequently asked question was, and still is to this day: how does your husband feel about it?

you have to use the apps in smaller cities, says michael moore, a psychologist at yale. they serve the purpose of a gay bar. but the downside is that they put all this prejudice out there. what the apps reinforce, or perhaps simply accelerate, is the adult version of what pachankis calls the best little boy in the world hypothesis. as kids, growing up in the closet makes us more likely to concentrate our self-worth into whatever the outside world wants us to be—good at sports, good at school, whatever. as adults, the social norms in our own community pressure us to concentrate our self-worth even further—into our looks, our masculinity, our sexual performance. but then, even if we manage to compete there, even if we attain whatever masc-dom-top ideal we're looking for, all we've really done is condition ourselves to be devastated when we inevitably lose it. we often live our lives through the eyes of others, says alan downs, a psychologist and the author of the velvet rage, a book about gay men's struggle with shame and social validation. we want to have man after man, more muscles, more status, whatever brings us fleeting validation. then we wake up at 40, exhausted, and we wonder, is that all there is? and then the depression comes.
instead of our evenings being tired all the time, we are able to have romance time more often, james said. and if we stay up late, it's not as hard to recover losing that sleep time as we sleep so much better apart.
bailey brazzel told wthr, we don't have an issue with her. we don't think she's a terrible person.
the barista was mad at spencer, but moments like that leave a mark. kouprianova is ashamed. she has some friends but doesn't open up to many people. she's worried about her children; she wants them to have friends and lives. she's trying to cobble together freelance work. but — she shrugs and gestures to the apartment, which is clean but cluttered with cloth hampers filled with toys, shelves of books, stuffed animals lined up on the couch. there isn't room for everything. most of the furniture, like the side table with gold-painted scrollwork, is a hand-me-down from her mother-in-law.

my husband and i were vacationing in maui with our son, then a toddler, which kept one of us on constant duty. while i took a snorkeling cruise, my husband watched our son. i love snorkeling in warm water, exploring the pristine habitat of fish. it had been years since i'd had the opportunity to do this.
granted, we like routines. it's nice to know we can count on our spouse being there when we go to bed and wake up. but this doesn't mean that after realizing he's (or she's) the one that the fun has to end.

do me a favor. think back to those first moments of falling in love with someone. do you remember the tingles and the thrills when you saw or thought of them? what if they suddenly broke up with you and your relationship came crashing down? or maybe you cheated on them, or they cheated on you — but you both stayed in the relationship. and even though you treated them like crap or they treated you like crap, you couldn't stop being with them. you got back together like, eight times, and each time your self-esteem shrank.
in the absence of legal recourse, the brazzels said, they had no choice but to share their story on social media ― prompting fivecoate to accuse of them of trying to destroy her business.

now is a time to let go of your wife title. realize that the label is not who you are at your core. it's the loss of an identity not the death of your soul. you are so much more than that. you are a person with hopes, desires and dreams, right? i realize that some of that ambition may have been set aside during your marriage.

that scene where we meet alan for the first time was such a wonderful surprise; just when i thought i understood the structure and universe of russian doll, things shifted just enough to keep me disoriented. i enjoyed the contrast between the characters' interpretations of such a surreal course of events. alan sees his death loop as some kind of moral quest, while nadia approaches the problem like a coder trying to fix a glitch in the system. i appreciated that they needed each other to escape the loop. it's a simple and powerful message, and one i didn't see coming. i was happy there wasn't some grand, cosmic connection tying them together. no, they just happened to be at the same bodega at the same time and were acting like selfish assholes. the mix of deep meaning and utter meaninglessness was on point throughout the show.
with the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against lgbtq people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension, she said. that it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-lgbt advocacy can become.
a good friend of mine said to me one day, they're just words and that's it.
there's something to loving and losing that builds our love character and muscle. certainly, we've been told that formula is better than never having loved at all. but it also demonstrates that we're capable of loving and being loved -- no small emotional feats. to love someone with your whole self -- while allowing yourself to be loved flaws and all -- is heart courage at its finest. because there are no guarantees. ever.
throughout the 1980s and '90s, limbaugh also frequently denigrated those who were hiv positive, saying the best way to stop the spread of the virus was to not ask another man to bend over and make love at the exit point. he spoke out against federal funding to fight the virus too, calling it the only federally protected virus.

making a tv relationship work after the filming ends might be the toughest thing i've ever had to do. fans might assume that because we were a perfect match, our relationship has been nothing but a fairy tale. they couldn't be more wrong. when the filming was over, we weren't supposed to be seen with each other until months later ― after the final episode aired ― to prevent any spoilers. but, of course, it would have been impossible to carry on a relationship without seeing each other for that long. so we snuck around to spend time together anyway.

you've got to know basics, he wrote in his autobiography. but if you have the time to draw people out, i find it's better to know very little. you can always get into the whos, whats, and whys. it's not only better than knowing too many of the whos ― it's more fun.
our concern is that he chose to build a law practice on mounting repeated challenges to tribal sovereignty, lands, religious freedom, and the core attribute of federal recognition of tribal existence, the letter says. his advocacy has focused on undermining the rights of indian tribes, often taking extreme positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal rights.
in situations like this, you might want to consider moving out after your lease is up.
isn't that more refreshing and honest than someone who plays the victim and takes no responsibility for anything that went wrong?? it's maddening how some people just can't see anything. it's like they are blind. who knows? maybe it's easier to point blame at someone else instead of owning up with the intent to do better moving forward.

power imbalance is definitely a factor that contributes to situations like these, kristen houser, a consultant and sexual violence expert formerly with the national sexual violence resource center, said.
they should care because the abuse kouprianova has described and documented would, yet again, put the lie to the whole idea of nonviolent white nationalism. because it would show us once again that violence that sips fine wine and dresses up is still violence. i don't know how often we have to learn this. after all, there is no more american story than taking a man at face value, giving him power, and only later seeing all the horror he has wrought.
most movies don't grasp this. they turn her into an underdog who comes out on top simply because, well, she's jennifer lopez. over the years, she's struggled to find romance (the wedding planner and the back-up plan), fled abusive lovers (enough and the boy next door), cleaned up after wealthy clients (maid in manhattan and second act) and ingratiated herself to contemptuous relatives (angel eyes and monster-in-law). lopez is good in these movies. a primo self-marketer, she makes herself accessible to the audience in a way that transcends her rarefied glamour. unfortunately, these movies aren't always good to her.

you have to be honest with patients, he said, explaining that doing so helps mitigate fear. if they are aware and then they have the symptoms, it gets rid of the panic. i had 24 hours of flu-like symptoms and then it went away and that's ok. it's a possibility and you don't panic.
you're not a bad person for having feelings for another person, madden said. you can't help your feelings, you can control your behavior. [but] once you recognize you have the 'feels' for someone else, you should stop all one-on-one meetings, lunches, twitter direct messages, etc. don't worry about how that person feels. worry about how your spouse would feel about you cheating.
susan jacobs, the music supervisor, felt at home with woman because it reminded her of working on little miss sunshine. when she first read the sunshine script, she thought it seemed quite dark, until learning that the filmmakers wanted yellow to be the central color, thereby sharpening its whimsical undertone. jacobs estimated that the rights to stars are blind totaled almost half of her music budget, but the high cost pays off. it's the centerpiece of a movie that starts dark, turns bright and then careens back toward darkness.
every time ethan got an uninvited nude or sexy dm, he'd show me and we'd laugh together about it. although being ok with that is something few normal relationships ever have to withstand, we had to put our jealousy aside and realize that we were not in a normal relationship. there was no guidebook for making a reality tv relationship work. we had to communicate, set our boundaries and figure it out on our own.

in fact, his cursory tone almost pokes fun at the scenario, using jokes that shift the onus of blame onto aaliyah, the minor, rather than the man 10 years her senior.
i'll never forget when another producer told me, watching you interact with everyone, it's safe to say that you may be too normal for this. regardless, she talked me into giving it a few more days. that same night, i sat down with ethan and we had our very first conversation. something big and dramatic was going on with shanley, another contestant, so the camera crew wasn't hovering around ethan and me, which probably made me feel more comfortable.
when i eventually talk to spencer, in the minutes before he yells at me, he insists he's a private person. he doesn't want to be there, talking to me. this is a private matter. plus, he adds, nina's politics aren't that much different than his. they were partners. can't i leave it alone?

so when we wonder why abused spouses stay in miserable situations, it's partly because our society still doesn't offer much support to those who are financially dependent on a spouse and have children but still wish to leave. i never felt the pain was bad enough to move to a shelter before, but now it feels like i'm forced to choose between continuing to endure psychological abuse or going to a place where i and my children might be exposed to a life-threatening virus.
but the more attention i pay to my thoughts, the more i worry that i've strayed from that sweet spot. while my actions are seldom selfish, my mindset is. every aggravation, every inconvenience i endure is interpreted as a personal attack, as if the guy who gets on the elevator before i can get off is determined to derail my universe. and it's wearing on me.

these days, couples can run themselves ragged trying to juggle everything: demanding jobs, children (if they have them), relationships with friends and family, their relationship with each other, grocery shopping, meal prep, laundry, staying on top of bills, all while trying to care for their own mental and physical health. so they prioritize and tackle only what absolutely has to get done on any given day. the rest — including tidying up — can wait.

the collective shrug can be attributed, in part, to the fact that fans and journalists alike saw kelly as a hitmaker beyond reproach. as writer and former entertainment journalist alexia hudson-ward put it, some folks want to enjoy his music without guilt, and that included writers and reporters within the entertainment industry. this much is clear in nekesa mumbi moody's 2001 obituary of aaliyah for the associated press, penned after aaliyah's tragic death in a plane crash, where she refers to kelly as an r&b superstar who had the greatest impact on [aaliyah's] career.

when my grandmother died, we had a shockingly good time at her funeral, not because we were happy, but standing among our other relatives' headstones, well, it felt like a reunion. people were telling funny stories about one dead aunt and another. anyway, all the laughing led to the rabbi admonishing us, but the reality is i think my grandma would have loved it. more than anything, she adored bringing the family together.

in other nations, anti-marriage campaigners have challenged court rulings that legalize same-sex marriage. in may 2017, taiwan's constitutional court, the judicial yuan, ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry. the court gave the parliament two years to amend the civil code to reflect its decision, in the absence of which same-sex couples will be able to marry using the institutions that are already in place. the ruling was met with exuberant celebration, but also with visible homophobic backlash. on feb. 15, 2018, the faith-based alliance of taiwan religious groups for the protection of the family launched its second appeal against the judicial yuan's decision and filed a petition to taiwan's central election commission to hold a referendum on same-sex marriage.

from the looks of a recent study published in the journal gender and society, we are certainly outliers in my house. reviewing survey data from around the nation covering the years 1976 to 2016, researchers from the university of chicago found that while attitudes in the u.s. have become more focused on a workload balance that's equal across genders, a majority of americans still believe cisgender women should do more homemaking and child-rearing. and while studies show the average modern dad is spending three times as much time on childcare as our granddads were in 1965, that three times as much is still just a self-reported (with wide margin for error) eight hours a week.
many of the adolescent patients i treat as a psychiatrist are navigating first love and difficult breakups. young adults often possess a deep yearning to find love. early romantic love typically occurs suddenly and powerfully. unfortunately, relationships, which begin quickly, can also easily fizzle out. with minimal experience, young adults working through romantic relationships are susceptible to intense heartache during breakups.
of course, the clever marital hack didn't come to james and his wife overnight. prior to realizing that they could just explicitly ask what the other needed, they'd often rush to offer each other advice in stressful times.
okay. sure. not everyone is going to make it to the hollywood red carpet. but did you ever watch a movie and think, wow, this actor isn't even that good -- or that good-looking -- but look at him doing his acting thing and making millions? yes, you have. because it's not always the best and brightest who rise to the top. sometimes it's just the tenacious -- the someone with that extra ounce of gumption -- who happens to catch a casting agent, or boss, or college admissions counselor at just the right moment. and sometimes that someone could be you.
in 2011, prime minister manmohan singh's united progressive alliance government embarked on india's first caste-based census since 1931. the 2011 secc, as its name makes clear, was a census, not a survey: this meant the government sought to collect data on the caste, incomes and set social parameters of every single indian citizen.

yes. yes. i think that my husband was not a super-serious person. he could be serious about things that we needed to be serious about. there's no one-size-fits-all memoir or anything. when [a critic] wrote that my memoir wasn't top shelf, i was like, i'm the mid-price vodka of memoirs. i'm happy to be the tito's vodka and courtyard by marriott memoir. i'm fine with it. it's cool.

when partners feel that it's like pulling teeth to get each other to divulge any thoughts or feelings, a relationship can feel very lonely. happy couples may not communicate constantly on a deep level, but they do it frequently enough to feel that they really know one another. ― samantha rodman

so much of the humor in the show is also quite dark ― whether nadia is inviting a homeless man giving her a haircut to kill her if he wants (he doesn't) or snapping her neck in a variety of ways after tumbling down the stairs. the tone of the show, though, grows darker as we get deeper and deeper into the story. while the plot remains relatively constant thanks to the groundhog day structure, the vibe shifts from feeling like an episode of high maintenance to something more like twin peaks. by the end i was in the spooky place.
this is a picture of me and my family when i was 9. my parents still claim that they had no idea i was gay. they're sweet. jeremy and i are 34. in our lifetime, the gay community has made more progress on legal and social acceptance than any other demographic group in history. as recently as my own adolescence, gay marriage was a distant aspiration, something newspapers still put in scare quotes. now, it's been enshrined in law by the supreme court. public support for gay marriage has climbed from 27 percent in 1996 to 61 percent in 2016. in pop culture, we've gone from cruising to queer eye to moonlight. gay characters these days are so commonplace they're even allowed to have flaws. still, even as we celebrate the scale and speed of this change, the rates of depression, loneliness and substance abuse in the gay community remain stuck in the same place they've been for decades. gay people are now, depending on the study, between 2 and 10 times more likely than straight people to take their own lives. we're twice as likely to have a major depressive episode. and just like the last epidemic we lived through, the trauma appears to be concentrated among men. in a survey of gay men who recently arrived in new york city, three-quarters suffered from anxiety or depression, abused drugs or alcohol or were having risky sex—or some combination of the three.

my husband told me he needed to be non-monogamous to feel whole. he said he was sincerely sorry for what he had done, and claimed he could be monogamous now, but would not be truly happy if he was. he also said he could be safely, honestly, and ethically non-monogamous, if i would allow it. he was willing to do the necessary work to address the dishonest parts of himself, he claimed, in order to enter this new chapter from a place of trust and respect.

sex is his way of connecting. this is the chicken and egg question of every marriage. wives say, if we connected more emotionally, we would have more sex. husbands usually respond, if we had sex more often, i would connect more emotionally. this is true for us, and almost every marriage i have worked with in the past 20 years. naming this as normal has helped me understand him and connect in his way more often!
that's what the birdcage is about, after all ― gender performance, a topic far less commonly discussed when the movie debuted 25 years ago, on march 8, 1996. adapted by elaine may from the 1973 french play la cage aux folles, it became hollywood's first blockbuster to revolve around open, well-adjusted lgbtq protagonists. nichols' film remained no. 1 at the box office for four consecutive weeks, earning $124 million and ranking as the year's seventh-highest-grossing release. even with williams' name on the marquee, no one expected such success, partly because queer visibility was still a struggle. ellen degeneres and rosie o'donnell hadn't come out yet, and needle-moving television like will & grace, queer eye for the straight guy and the l word hadn't premiered.

she was glamorous while i was just a middle-aged klutz who had no interest in playing games. wayo invited me to join them for dinner and i, of course, declined. the more i resisted, the harder he pursued. it wasn't until my single 70-something-year-old friend with a ranch full of cats pointed out i was going to end up just like her if i didn't give this handsome fella a chance. the crazy cat lady was right. so i told wayo i had no interest in playboys. that's when he informed me he had dropped his playthings the night after we met to exclusively be with me. in his words, he had waited his an entire life to fall in love.
when we lie about the little things, it gets easier and easier to lie about the bigger stuff, explains rice. and then one day you wake up and realize you've been lying about feelings or thoughts or concerns that should have been brought to light many months or years earlier. you don't have to be a rat about it. you can say, 'i like you better in the blue sweater.'
people's individual definitions of what covid-19 safety looks like vary widely. you think eating inside at restaurant is too risky right now (and infectious disease experts may agree with you), but your friends may believe it's totally fine. they figure restaurants wouldn't be open if they weren't safe, right? as journalist amanda mull of the atlantic pointed out, there are many people who are trying to do everything right, but run afoul of science without realizing it because of confusing policies and tangled messages from government leaders.

we live in a very independent-focused culture where oftentimes we aren't taught that it's ok to even have a need, let alone voice it, seely said. it's vulnerable to share how you're feeling, to ask for help, or to say, 'i'm feeling down, can i have a hug?' if you're in a safe and trusting relationship, practicing opening up in this way builds connection, understanding and support.

these christians instead choose to play god vying for the position of arbiter of whose life is worthy of protecting. this is antithetical to christian values of grace, love, kindness, gentleness and caring for those on the margins. in this political environment, it has become clear over and over again that a few lives of people considered unworthy are worth sacrificing for the moral control and power that oppressing them brings to powerful christians.
says arylo, there is something about world travel that is different from flying to another part of your own country. it expands your horizons, heightens your independence, and instills within you a confidence and a sense of the world being a much bigger place than just what you know. with those emotions and experiences under our belt, she says, you will also a sense of infinite possibility. that means if you hit a rocky patch in your marriage or you find yourselves stuck in a rut, you have the tools and perspective within you to realize there are way more opportunities in the world, arylo explains. it gives you freedom.

the 2016 election marked a turning point. search for phrases like the movie we need right now, and the results show a huge spike in articles in late 2016 and early 2017. over the last few years, it has been hard not to view everything through a trumpian lens.
there's not much democrats can do about any of this, beyond winning control of the senate in 2020. the minority typically has some tools for affecting judicial confirmations; it is a senate custom, for example, to wait for both senators representing a nominee's home state to turn in so-called blue slips before that nominee can move forward. but republicans have been bypassing the blue slip rule in their effort to fill up courts with trump's nominees.

i've been more attuned to how to optimize the flow of clients in my day instead of just scheduling as many as i can fit, back to back, gitlin said. now i take breaks and am more intuitive about my limits. i carry not only my own feelings and frustrations with our new normal, but also the weight of my client's own mood fluctuations. pre-covid i would've said i was proud of my ability to separate the two, but these days, it's definitely an ongoing struggle that i have to pay attention to.
i work with couples every day who said they were not sure how to bring it up, or if they did bring it up, it led to conflict so they eventually stopped bringing it up. couples collude in silence. they decide it is easier to have no sex at all than to deal with the hurt feelings and unpredictable emotions, such as guilt or anger. intervening before the problem takes on a life of its own is key. one way to bring it up is to say that you value both your and your partner's sexual health and overall well-being. remember that having sex on a regular basis has many emotional and physical benefits!
3. you may not end up with the love of your life. and that's okay. maybe that person was meant to show up in your life in a specific place or time to teach you something you'll never forget. once a year or so, i dream of an old boyfriend. the dream is some version of this: i embrace him and say, you know, i really did love you. and, you know what? i did. and he did. and when i wake up, i'm happy for it. not happy for losing him when i did, but grateful now for the gifts he brought me.

there were a few other comments she made that i don't really feel the need to go into.
democrats, i was told, just wanted to kill innocent babies waiting to be born in their mothers' wombs. once born, children were welcomed as blessings but brought up, above all, to be useful and to honor every whim of their parents. our home was often filled with chaos ― children scattered everywhere; piles of laundry and toys and dishes deep enough to wade through; one child or another practicing piano or riding through the house on a big wheel; my mother yelling and sometimes wielding a heavy cutting board or pizza paddle to dole out spankings. i was put to work early and quickly learned to do everything from bathing five children at a time to waking up in the night to tend to fussy toddlers while i prayed for the strength to handle my sisyphean workload. my parents convinced me that my work was a duty to god, so it was impossible to view it for what it was: exploitation.

but couples in sexless marriages don't have to go on quietly suffering. below, psychologists and sex therapists share their best advice for revving up your sex life.
amriphoto via getty images if your parent is constantly criticizing you, tell them what you need instead: support.
a marriage therapist ― even one who's worked in the field for years ― can't know a couple's full story by the first therapy session. they can tell quite a bit, though. (a spouse's tendency to avoid eye contact, for instance, reveals more than words could ever say.)
so starting today, i challenge you to take back your power. find that little girl inside of you. the one who was curious and was courageous enough to ask for what she wanted and bring her back to life. try it today with something small. does your boyfriend suggest chinese food for dinner but you are really craving italian? ask him, can we get italian food tonight and chinese food later this week? do you want to be aknowledged or recognized for something that you have accomplished? well, go tell the world. shout it from the roof tops! or email the editor of your local paper, sit back and watch how easy it is to start getting what you ask for. don't be mistaken though, this isn't about ego or showing off. this is about learning, as women that power isn't handed to us, it is taken. so if you are being overpowered at work and want that one-on-one time with your boss, or to take the lead on the next project, ask for it, stay humble, and kick some ass!

i think this is in the book. my sister had said, what do you want me to do?
there was a lady at a pie store who i thought might be the one. an anesthesiologist for dogs who i also thought might be the one. before we met, they all had the possibility of being the one. sometimes i felt the zing and rush of attraction, but it wasn't mutual. so i worked to be the kind of person who wasn't swayed by feelings. after all, when i was nineteen, i had fallen in love, and swept myself into marriage which ended in ruin. i wanted to be past falling in love as a concept. i needed to tamp down my feelings and think more. i told my therapist i was trying to be a robot. she didn't approve, but i still tried.
all of these findings challenge the presumption that greater societal acceptance of queer people will automatically result in better health outcomes. despite the massive gains in cultural awareness and advances in political rights, there are still profound disparities in openness to lgb students throughout the united states. according to the lgbtq anti-bullying organization glsen, over 70% of lgbtq students experienced verbal harassment at school in 2017.
a lot of critics and oscar prognosticators couldn't help but view that year's oscar season through the lens of trump's election. one of the prevailing narratives around the best picture race was that it served as a referendum on the election. on oscar night, when moonlight unexpectedly triumphed over the season's presumed front-runner la la land, it was seen as hollywood's rebuke or repudiation of trump's victory.

moments before going on air for the first time, the station manager called him into his office to suggest his new host drop zeiger in favor of a less ethnic last name. and so on may 1, 1957, he made his radio debut as larry king. (he didn't change his name legally until 1959.)
king suffered multiple heart attacks in the decades leading up to his death. he was a heavy smoker but never touched a cigarette again after his first heart attack in 1987. after receiving quintuple bypass heart surgery in 1988, king founded the larry king cardiac foundation to help patients afford expensive treatments associated with heart-related illnesses.

(one important exception: people ending a relationship with a physically or emotionally abusive partner.)
in reality, living with my ex-husband was not hard at all. we respected each other tremendously and shared the house responsibilities as well as parenting duties. our friendship and trust grew each day, and it honestly has been great to have the co-parenting support in the house without the expectation of having to make an unhappy marriage work just for the sake of it.

angelina jolie and brad pitt: this is perhaps the coup de grace of all 2016 splits. after 10 years of dating and 6 children between them, they got married in 2014, only to end it all in 2016. they seemed to be writing a new chapter in how you can have a completely organic family not bound by tradition or a rulebook. the untangling of these parties will be one for the record books but likely handled off the record despite initial, and very public, allegations of child abuse. of note, those stories have been all but silenced recently. they are likely being counseled of the benefits of keeping such matters private if at all possible for the sake of the parties, and particularly the children. these parties will be dealing with what the majority of couple's facing divorce deal with - support, property distribution, and custody of their children. the amount of money and property, and the family dynamics that blossomed in this blended family, will complicate this situation without question. however, the thing to understand is that it is do-able and it is do-able in every situation. divorce is often the most emotional and devastating event in someone's life and it is important to get the right counsel on all fronts from your attorney to your financial planner and therapist to help guide the process, and provide a voice of reason when emotions run high.

the uneven progress on hollywood representation has also been reflected at the top of the movie industry. major awards like the golden globes, the baftas (the u.k.'s equivalent of the oscars), and the directors guild of america awards all failed to nominate any women for their top directing prizes this year, despite a number of worthy contenders. some oscar prognosticators are predicting a similar result when the academy awards nominations are unveiled on monday.
but noah mockingly praised the virus for its stance on equality.
twelve years ago, my family's lifestyle was made into a spectacle for entertainment, alongside a host of controversial shows on the learning channel. i wasn't allowed to watch tv as a kid, so while my peers were getting to know fourth-wall-breaking humor through comedies satirizing the genre like the office, my siblings and i were uncertain in front of the camera crew. we were being under-educated, overlooked due to the sheer number of us, and the older kids were raising the younger ones, while also catering to our parents' every whim.
that was the case with poehler and fey when they were given the chance to host the golden globes three years in a row, thanks to their near-perfect rapport. their banter and charm was certainly a welcome distraction from the otherwise methodical format of awards shows, which is why people are campaigning for duos like john mulaney and nick kroll to host. except i'd rather just watch funny people perform their netflix specials than schmooze through a set of overly vetted jokes performed in front of the crème de la crème of tinseltown. maybe awards show hosts were more popular in the 1980s and '90s because we had few opportunities otherwise to see comedians like billy crystal and chris rock live. now, streaming platforms, social media and youtube make it easy to get your fix.
he added that he was glad his wife had kept working as a college professor over the decades, stressing that in order to keep a marriage strong, it was important for both parties to have their separate passions and goals.

it took me three more years to wake up to the idea of applying myself properly to my schoolwork. i realized i wasn't likely to become a ballerina (i'm 6′2″) or a model or a fictional victorian detective, so at 16, i started doing homework and studying for exams for the first time in my life. i turned out to be good at it. almost overnight i became a straight-a student. i was offered a spot at a london drama school and i took it.

sometimes, even those movies didn't lean into political narratives as much as one might expect. for instance, the discourse around 2008′s milk, starring sean penn as lgbtq rights pioneer harvey milk, was very politically oriented for obvious reasons. its release came at the dawn of the obama presidency, and california's prop 8, which banned marriage equality, had just passed, giving the movie something to fight against. yet when looking at its ad campaign, only some of the language and visuals directly referenced the political landscape surrounding the film's release.

i hear talk shows and see articles shared online where people talk about marriage tips and what to do when you are struggling in a partnership. i'm realizing that people think marriage is hard these days because you aren't always happy. because you feel tired and you work too much and the kids are always demanding something and the other person can't make all that go away. is that hard? really? because now that i've seen what the hard part actually is -- the grieving and the accepting and the letting go -- burnt dinner on the stove or noisy children or a cluttered bathroom counter don't seem like a cause for unhappiness. whatever happy means anyway; it's always a moving target when you depend on the other person to provide it.
throughout the day, i would cry for seemingly no reason at all, but inside i kept thinking of how horrible of a mother i was turning out to be.
these aspects of swedish culture are perfect examples of the quick-fix approach to happiness that has become the norm in nordic countries, the united states and the rest of the world's happiest nations. yes, the absence of acute threats to our well-being (which is a more accurate definition of what the happiness index is actually meant to measure) has likely helped make us happier. however, we've also consistently raised the bar of our expectations, resulting in the illusion that we can – and should! – be euphorically happy all the time.
it's perfectly acceptable and okay to be in a relationship and leave it and go to the next one and grow and evolve.

the details in many of the cases are shocking and disturbing. guy reffitt, a 48-year-old from wylie, texas, was arrested and charged with unlawful entry for rioting at the capitol. reffitt, described by federal prosecutors as a member of two far-right militia organizations, the three percenters and the texas freedom force, wore a combat helmet and other tactical gear during the insurrection.

but with women in power, there are going to be good bosses. and there are going to be bad ones. and criticizing a female politician doesn't mean that it's a sexist attack. feminism is, of course, ultimately about more than getting women into elected office.
5. the couple isn't on the same page about finances.
what was missing from early mainstream discussions of the marriage between r. kelly and aaliyah was a black feminist critique of the relationship. instead, critical analysis of kelly's conduct was confined to fan magazines serving mostly black readers. major papers weren't covering allegations of the urban artist's predatory behavior, nor were they exploring how misogynoir, which describes how hatred directed toward black women is influenced by both their race and gender, affected how the story was being framed.

we see both men and women interested in dominance and submission. while men are generally more interested in dominating and women more interested in being dominated, this isn't always the case. some women are dominant and some men submissive. fantasies of domination are about power, feeling like you are fully in control of an experience and that the other person will submit to your every whim. there are two super sexy things about submission: the first is the feeling that the sub has all of the attention of their dom, their full focus. the second is the feeling of letting go of control and being taken or used for the pleasure of another. ―danielle harel and celeste hirschman, sex therapists and authors of making love real: the intelligent couple's guide to lasting intimacy and passion

ok, sometimes this real talk feels … not so real. at the end of the movie, queen elizabeth shows harry and meghan a portrait of her ancestor queen charlotte, a german princess with portuguese roots who may have had african heritage. oh, yes, you're of mixed race, harry, says elizabeth. and so am i! a very sweet scene that also seems a tad out of character for the matriarch of the royal family, which has long been cool about research into charlotte's racial background.
in 2010, weinstein produced the king's speech, that year's best picture winner. some movies you see. others you feel, the movie's ads declared. its awards campaign used the extremely obvious slogan: find your voice. by 2014, when the ads for the weinstein-produced biopic the imitation game urged oscar voters to honor the man, honor the film, this approach had become the subject of mockery and derision.

there were plenty of those. no christmas, no birthdays, no easter. technically, jehovah's witnesses were allowed televisions, but we were warned frequently about worldly influences and my parents had elected not to have one. higher education was frowned upon ― it was considered selfish not to use all your available time and energy trying to convert nonbelievers, so as to save their lives during armageddon. many young jws left school as soon as legally allowed, took low-paying jobs, and spent all of their spare time and energy evangelizing, or storing up treasures in heaven. i banked on armageddon coming quickly enough to save me from having to become a window cleaner. i was keen for it to arrive before i turned 16. this, the jw literature assured me, was almost certain.

the appeal of the time period for readers is very much about being able to distance readers from certain kinds of social issues and then reframe them as a reflection of society now, maclean explained. in the 1970s, novels typically featured brooding alpha males who took what they wanted sexually ― a narrative device, maclean argued, for the fictional heroines of the time to have plenty of sex without being seen as loose and deserving of punishment. historical romance novels today often feature heroes and heroines having what seem like rather anachronistically tender exchanges about consent.

many people attach a stigma to this less conventional sleeping arrangement and assume it's a sign that a relationship is on the rocks. while some couples may sleep separately because of marital discord, it's often for a more practical reason like james and his wife: they just want a good night's sleep. maybe one partner snores and the other is a light sleeper. maybe they have different bedtimes and wake-up times. perhaps one needs air conditioning or a fan blowing year-round, while the other is perpetually cold.
he said she was upset by the request and told him, you're never gonna see the kids again. that's when watts said he went into a rage and snapped, putting both hands around her neck and strangling her.

anto kokkat, member of the kerala catholic reformation, an organisation which has helped organise several protest meetings, told huffpost india that the implementation of the church act would prevent churches from welding disproportionate amounts of power and make congregations safer for women. the act, which most political parties have refrained from touching and several christian civilian groups want implemented, gives the government power to regulate the land owned by churches.
this selfishness isn't anybody's fault, and with age, it's steadily filtered out of us. we learn to share when we make friends, and we learn to wait our turn when we enter the ballpark trough-urinal line. eventually, we settle in the middle ground, striking a balance between respecting others and taking care of ourselves.

claire: russian doll does end up being quite apropos. i think my initial reaction speaks more to how the soviet-era anxiety about russia has shaped american media portrayals of it, and specifically russian femininity. lots of honey-trap spies and contract killers, fewer brassy new york video game designers. in a more literal sense, the title perfectly evokes the idea of how our adult selves contain all the earlier versions of ourselves, or of how multiple selves can exist at once, which is the central question of the show.
i was so afraid of destroying my friendship, but i knew i'd never forgive myself if i let my fear get in the way of what could be real happiness. my mom always said the reason she married my dad was he was the first person who loved her for who she was. i never understood that feeling until now. it doesn't feel like a risk, it feels safe. it feels like safety to observe another person, gazing at you all starry-eyed, and know that half the joy you feel comes from them really seeing you, and enjoying you so hard, knowing that there is not one part of them wishing you'd change.
all the older kids helped out with the twins, which was great. we're really close, including my two stepchildren, jenni flynn and kalen keach. but we don't use the word stepkids. we do not distinguish. i'm very proud of all my children, and i spend a lot of time with them. all the fathers are very close to their children and the kids are very close to all the parents. the exes and everybody gets along. if i co-parent a child, as i did kalen and jenni, i'm incredibly close to those mothers and their stepfathers. jenni's sisters from her mother's following marriage will spend christmas or new year's with me. my twins refer to kalen's two brothers from his mother's then-marriage as their brothers from another mother.

we didn't have any children yet but we were expecting our first. i fantasized that someday i'd want to build the set with my daughter when we read the harry potter books together for the first time. so i purchased the set. someday came a lot sooner than my wife's due date. within hours of getting home from the store, the box was opened, transparent baggies full of plastic bricks were scattered all over the counter, and i was busy building a miniature version of diagon alley.

we feel very fortunate to have been able to still get married on our original date since eight is a very auspicious number in chinese culture. the micro-wedding was super intimate. we got to spend a lot of time with our parents and siblings, whom we don't see often since they are based in montreal. we feel very happy to have gone ahead with that route because now i still don't feel that i could have had the original perfect wedding this year, given the increased covid-19 cases and ever-changing public health guidelines. the only thing i regret was not wearing a wedding dress with a long train. since we decided to elope in a micro fashion, i had a short cocktail dress. maybe i will get to wear my original wedding dress one day in the future! — annie cao and jimmy wang

the cause: some parents take a very relaxed approach to raising a kid and, in the abstract sense, that can be all well and good. but, when the reality sinks in, it can be a game changer and one parent's fast-and-loose style of child-rearing might be at odds with the other parent's more focused and disciplined approach, and problems can arise. a lot of couples don't discuss this before the child is born and they can have a lot of difficulties later on, says silverman. the most important part of being a good parent is that the two of you work as a team together, not where one says one thing and then the other one does the opposite. kids are a lot more successful when they have two parents that agree.

a similar study shows that european women are also putting family planning on the back burner because of the pandemic. even in new zealand, a country that has come out of the pandemic relatively unscathed, birth rates are declining. (data collected by that nation's government found the birth rate for those of childbearing age has fallen to a record low of 1.63 per woman — far below the 2.1 needed to replace population numbers.)
it is self-centered to not make an attempt to communicate when you are hurt or angry at your partner. tough conversations often come up in a romantic relationship. you put your partner through a lot of distress when you refuse to talk. ― marni feuerman, marriage and family therapist

3. i'm matching with the wrong type of person
you 'think' you want marriage, a family and kids because social media is lurking at your doorstop every morning but it's just a plain mirage and illusion of success and the things you left behind that you did in fact did not want. however, this road leads us to be bitter, lashing out at others, and looking at the glass half-empty. well, it's time to change your perspective, because you did choose the correct path of higher education and grad school to become a professional, it was the right choice -i promise. although you may not see it yet or now in 2016, come back and read this article in hindsight in 2026 and you'll know that you made the right choice.

nick finally asks to steal jasmine, and the other women are worried because they know how insane she's acting. jasmine immediately launches into a diatribe about being overlooked, and how upset she is that she hasn't had a one-on-one yet. she starts crying, saying she sees a future with him and she's been the realest person in this whole thing but hasn't had a chance to show him her true (crazy) self yet. she says she wants to choke him so bad but when she sees how much that freaks him out, she tries to backtrack and say it's a sexual thing called a chokey, and asks if he wants one from her, and she says that she can be the first girl to give him one, and he is even more weirded out, and this gets cringingly (chokingly?) awkward. he then tells her that it may be best to say goodbye. after leaving, she tells the camera that nick doesn't know what he wants. this is untrue, as it certainly appears that he does not want to be choked.
high school students at quest are given harder missions, and they 'level-up' faster than middle-schoolers. the gaming terminology also extends to grades—there's no a, b, or c grades at quest. instead, it's novice, apprentice, senior, and master. the idea is that this holds more meaning for the students, motivating them in a way that random letters can't. teachers employ real-world examples whenever possible. one art and design mission involved energy-efficient food trucks. in ninth grade biology, students spend the year as workers in a fictional biotech company, where their job is to clone dinosaurs and create stable ecosystems. as in many games, there's also a 'boss level' mission. it usually takes place before the end of a semester, and involves teams of about 15 students undertaking a weeklong challenge. last semester it was a recycled fashion show; before that, to create a functioning rube goldberg machine.

the movie, shot on 16mm film in wintry romania, follows 19th-century woman abigail (waterston), a grieving mother isolated on an upstate new york farm with her withdrawn husband dyer (casey affleck). just as she's craving connection, new neighbors tallie (vanessa kirby) and finney (christopher abbott) arrive and the women strike up a friendship that soon turns romantic. with breathtaking cinematography by andre chemetoff and poetic narration by waterston, the world to come is a rumination on hardship, loneliness and female desire.
regardless of my strongly held religious views — or actually because of them — samaritan's purse treats everyone we help the same. we do not make distinctions about an individual's religion, race, sexual orientation, or economic status. we certainly do not discriminate, and we have a decades-long track record that confirms just that. our doors at the emergency field hospital in the east meadow are going to be open to all new yorkers who need our help.
back on the one-on-one, nick and kristina sit down to dinner, and he tries to plumb her depths again. since it's not fantasy suite time, he must use his words and not his penis. disappointing. she says that growing up, she didn't really have much, and we can see his rescue fantasy come to life. she says her mom wasn't around much, and she remembers not having any food and having to eat a lipstick. she ran away as a small child and ended up in an orphanage, where her mother never came to visit her. she says many turned to prostitution in russia, and she didn't want that, so, at age 12, she came to america and left her sister and friends behind for a new life and a new chance. she cries remembering her friends from the orphanage, and this is the most serious we've ever gotten on the bachelor. nick talks about her mature grasp and appreciation for life and of course she gets the rose. don't worry, kristina, even if nick doesn't marry you, dudes are going to be coming out of the woodwork to take care of you and make up for your unhappy childhood. many will be far cuter than nick.
i went to rehab for being 29 and partying too much and not having a lot of boundaries and to clear my head and try to get some idea of who i wanted to be, affleck told the hollywood reporter in 2012. it was more a 'let me get myself straight,' before it became a rite of passage.

you'd be surprised how many people get married with absolutely no clue that their beliefs about monogamy are incompatible, los angeles marriage therapist virginia gilbert told huffpost recently.

i was actually encouraged by his naive statements about not grasping the impact that her blackness would have on their lives together. here was a prince who, despite his world travels, hadn't given any real thought to what it was like to be something else, anything else than white. by marrying meghan, he was able to see and understand his own privilege for the first time.
we know that fear can lead to defensiveness and blame. i can tell myself that trump's dog-whistle tweets are an attempt to distract from his administration's failures in preventing and controlling the spread of the virus. but i will not feel compassion for his fear, as he clearly lacks any for the fear his words have ignited in the asian community ― or any concern about the very real and very dangerous acts that his words could inspire in others.

for those living in fear with their abusers, the coronavirus has compounded the time that they must spend together. it has magnified the stress levels in our homes and surely increased incidents of domestic violence. for many of us, the toxic spouse leaving for work provided needed relief from the barrage of intimidation, verbal battery and abuse. now many of these significant others are either working from home or unemployed.

it went on to note, the court recognizes that several federal courts have held otherwise in recent opinions, concluding that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination. however, the opinion said, the u.s. court of appeals for the 8th circuit, which is the immediate appeals court above hamilton's own, has not changed its position on the issue, and so the court must dismiss.

there is still a long way to go — the issue has exposed deep divides within kerala, and there are many women who have internalized biases and claim they are ready to wait until they reach menopause to visit the temple, sharanya said. the taboo around menstruation and temple visits will require a lot of work to be undone. but this is a spectacular start to the year in terms of gender equality.
a couple of extreme examples: i once talked with an acquaintance asking me for help. she who was sorry she'd left her husband for a shoe salesman. she told me that she was minding her own business, just buying a pair of shoes, and couldn't help that the salesman was going crazy over her. everywhere she went, men would flirt with her, something that turned her head and that led to her making poor choices in her life. she said it made her believe she was more desirable and attractive than other woman, and it wasn't her fault that she drew so many men into her life. i told her that i had the same kinds of encounters, and so do thousands of other women! but something prevented her from seeing the truth and she ended up living a lonely, solitary life.
before coming out, my sister and her girlfriend were very active members of the church. in fact, they were completely devoted to their faith and accepted any calling (or voluntary position) that was asked of them, and they visited the temple multiple times a month.
it's like our parents' generation gave us this nice idea [on household labor], but we didn't get sufficient guidance to put it into action, northey said. it's kind of like placing a strong value on being able to play an instrument, but then having very limited instruction on how to actually play it and being sent to perform on a concert stage.
cheating is murky territory: does following and sending flirty messages to a stranger on instagram cross the line? what about creating a deep but nonsexual emotional bond with someone?

how he might decorate the white house for christmas: emhoff and harris post holiday cards to her instagram page every christmas. his decor style is likely traditional and welcoming, just like the cards ― think classic golds, greens and reds on the tallest pine trees in every corner and crevice. emhoff is jewish, so it would make sense for him to use the holidays as an opportunity to pay homage to his heritage and holiday celebrations across cultures. the harris white house in december would likely be a spot of multicultural celebration.

when faced with the harsh truth, luann and matt faced eerily similar circumstances and questions that thousands of other same sex couples caught in this mixed-orientation marriage turmoil have faced. heart-wrenching questions like, do we try to make this work? or how do we undo the damage, un-tell the lies? and the ever so popular, what does the future hold for either of us, our kids, our family? yet, they found a path.

wheeler defended his comments thursday, saying they were not directed toward homosexuals.
obviously, you shouldn't let others call the shots on your relationship, but it helps to know what your inner circle thinks about your new s.o. try to find time when your friends and family can meet your partner, even if it just means hopping on the houseparty app and playing uno as a group. what you're trying to determine is, if i bring my partner into the mix, how do they act around each other? buehler said. do people seem uncomfortable with one another, and not just because it's someone new? then, ask for honest impressions. (your closest friends and family are no doubt going to have plenty of opinions, even without you grilling them.) the reason this is important is that when you're in a long-distance relationship, you really don't get a good understanding of whether a potential full-time partner is kind or brusque to others, she said. you'll get that here. you both keep your promises promises feel much weightier in an ldr because, at times, all you really have is your word. so when you make plans to get together every friday night, have every intention to stay true to you word. a long-distance relationship is much more likely to prosper if both partners do what they say they'll do ― if they match intention with action, harra said.

when i said to her that i no longer want to be the main caregiver in my family, she asked me if i was thinking of leaving my family. and when i told her that i want my work and career goals to take precedence in my marriage, she asked me if my husband was retiring. she went on to ask what my husband's career goals were, suggesting that if i put myself ahead of him i would be jeopardizing this career. i felt as if i was back twenty-three years ago when my husband and i left new zealand so that he could study for his doctorate in america. not a single person at that time asked me what my plans were or what i was hoping to get out of our move. everyone expected me to be the dutiful, supportive wife and again, that is how this therapist saw me.
news of his candidacy comes months after king narrowly secured a ninth consecutive term in congress. king beat his democratic opponent, j.d. scholten, by only three percentage points. it was a remarkably close race for the deeply conservative district, which king had routinely won by over 20 points in previous elections, and which president donald trump carried by 27 points in 2016.
i tried to suppress the panic i felt whenever i perused the pictures. to me, it looked boring ― because it was going to last forever. i had many opportunities to consider forever, sitting on a plastic chair under fluorescent lights, during the interminable jehovah's witness meetings. forever meant that eventually, the whole world would be so familiar to me that there would be no wonders left. one day i would have had every possible conversation with every single person still alive on the planet. it gave me a feeling like vertigo. so i told myself to trust what i was learning because if everyone else wanted to live forever, it would surely somehow be marvelous, and a more-than-ample reward for all the activities we missed out on in the present-day world.
if you're getting married or already married, that agreement is known as a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, a fairly common type of contract. you don't need to have a lot of money or assets to utilize these types of agreements, and they can help to make sure everyone understands who is responsible for what, tayne said.

when faced with the harsh truth, luanne and matt faced eerily similar circumstances and questions that thousands of other same-sex couples caught in this mixed-orientation marriage turmoil have faced. heart-wrenching questions like, do we try to make this work? or how do we undo the damage, un-tell the lies? and the ever so popular, what does the future hold for either of us, our kids, our family? yet, they found a path.

priscilla: what i wouldn't give to meet 11-year-old claire. if she were haunting me in an eternal loop, i would never try to escape it.
it encourages good use of time
i was so struck by the density of the script and the efficiency of the writing, waterston told huffpost in a phone call this week. one of the very first lines of voiceover, which didn't make it into the film, was, 'at night i often wonder if those who have been my intimates have found me to be a steep hill whose view does not repay the ascent.' and it told me so much about abigail. here's a woman who clearly was of very limited means and is kept up at night not by what she hasn't gotten from life but questioning what she has given. when i carried that notion through that first read, i was completely devastated.
what's missing, i think, when people talk about a discrimination policy like this, is the practical experience of what that actually looks like. it certainly sounds unfair. but it's so much more than that.

whether you live half a world apart or only a few hours away, you should make consistent effort to remain connected on a regular basis, said los angeles sex therapist nazanin moali, host of the podcast sexology. if you find yourself sitting by the phone for hours or feeling that you must compete to get your partner's attention, it might be time for you to voice your concern. if your partner does not prioritize the relationship, it might be time for you to move on.

welcome to the wild world of food stylists.
whatever you do, just don't lie.
if your wounded self spent much time withholding love, you might feel deep regret when you no longer have the opportunity to love. regret is a difficult feeling. what is done is done, and you cannot go back and fix it. regret might lead to despair when you realize you have forever lost the opportunity to express your love.
if you're feeling generous ― or, more importantly, want to lessen the resentment you may be feeling toward your parent ― try to understand some of the deeper reasons why they've encouraged what they've encouraged, smith said. maybe they always wanted to follow a certain career path and that's why they're pushing it on you. or maybe they just want to feel that their opinion is worthy of respect.
no, i can't change the past, but i hoped that i could change the future by stopping the next girl from being a victim. i wanted to show other survivors they are not alone. but it was me that needed help because after coming forward, i fell into a deep depression and nearly had a mental breakdown.

over you singer miranda lambert has moved on with a new husband.
my husband listens more to other women's problems than mine. the emergency phone calls at night and on the weekends used to bother me. i used to ask lots of questions as to why a female client needed to talk to him so badly at 7:30 p.m. on a saturday night. but then i listened to his conversations. some were true emergencies and others were him just be an attentive lawyer who knew when that his client needed to talk and needed advice right then. although it did not constitute an emergency to him or me, the person on the other line truly believed that it was. i have come to learn that a good divorce attorney must be attentive and on call if a client needs to speak with them. i know that my husband does not always want to return a phone call, but he puts himself in the position of his client that is experiencing one of the most traumatic experiences one can go through: divorce.
the moment i met kamala, i knew i was in love. not just because of who she is— the warm, funny, and compassionate woman who grounds our family — but also because of the deep resolve with which she fights for the causes she believes in. — emhoff
we cannot undo the darkness of our past or our present by protecting black men who abuse black women under the auspices of racial solidarity. furthermore, attempts to let men like kelly off the hook because of their race implies that black men are either inherently predisposed to sexual violence or that black girls and women are inherently incapable of being be victimized.

the usccb's response to biden is partly a result of the way white american catholicism has entered the mainstream, imperatori-lee said. she said white catholics have reached a level of economic success that has aligned them with the republican party, which uses sexual morality issues to get people to the polls and ensure the conservative court appointments. but there's no guarantee that pro-life judges will make pro-life decisions, she said ― referring to the fact that a mostly catholic supreme court allowed federal executions to go forward even though francis has said the death penalty is wrong in all cases.

being an r. kelly hater in early 2000s chicago was a mighty lonely experience, but the release of a video that featured him engaged in sexual acts with two teenage girls was all the proof i needed to let him go ― though his marriage to aaliyah in 1995 and the stories i heard about him approaching my friends when we were only in middle school should have done the trick.

i never knew i could have a relationship with god like i do now, he said. it's like the amazing grace with all of this, but i just wish nobody had to pay any kind of price for this.
for now, i am trying to focus on being more spiritual, as opposed to religious. as a friend and church member recently told me, you don't have to go to church to be a good person. i haven't been to church in a long time, a decision that has been both liberating and painful. when you stop attending the mormon church, you get the label of inactive. you begin to lose friends and (in utah especially) an entire community support system. it can be hurtful and has been confusing for my children.
and humphry davy, the chemist who helped discover chlorine and iodine, once said, life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little things, in which smiles and kindness and small obligations given habitually, are what preserve the heart and secure comfort.
my year without men has undoubtedly been my most productive to date. this isn't to say that we can't have love as well as ludicrous success; it's the dating game itself that can hinder productivity and siphon one's zeal. sifting through candidates and conducting interviews is a job in itself.
call my agent! (season 4, netflix original)
we all process things differently, and if someone writes about how weird things are and how funny the weirdness is, it gives you permission to acknowledge that in your grieving and your pain and to say, i'm not disrespecting my husband, my mother, my dad or my partner for having some joy, even in the middle of this awful thing.
rob scheidlinger, a licensed marriage and family therapist in westlake village, california, said that it's largely a myth that depression and anxiety run in families and therefore most people who suffer are predisposed genetically.

though quinn's bridgerton novels are entirely white, the shondaland adaptation featured diverse casting to controversial effect. in a medium essay on the series, tressie mcmillan cottom argued that the adaptation's addition of people of color to bridgerton coupled with a light-handed explanation of their presence, made historical escapism possible for black viewers, who are often confronted with brutal reminders of slavery and colonialism when consuming historical fiction. the show, she wrote, offered just enough realism to give a black viewer permission to suspend disbelief and enjoy the sumptuous sights and passionate sighs.
it may not be the traditional setup, but it works for them.

(lopez eventually dropped out due to scheduling issues. eva mendes took her spot.)
we worry about balancing work and home life--although i just looked up the average number of hours americans work per week and, having done so, now have no idea what the hell everybody's complaining about. apparently americans work an average of 34.4 hours per week. okay - add five hours a week commuting (including stops for a latte and scone) and we're almost at a 40-hour-work week. but who are these people? where are they? i don't know anyone who works that little!
haven't watched the britney doc yet, but just watched the entirety of the old diane sawyer interview. absolutely disgusting. misogyny executed by another woman. no wonder britney seems so lost. we all betrayed her by allowing that narrative. — gracie lou freebush (@chcachrycola) february 8, 2021
and be honest with your answer, arylo cautions. there is a lot of social pressure to get married, she points out. and if you are getting married to achieve the next milestone or to lock in the guy or girl, it's a reason that is full of future misery. if it's about anyone other than you and the person you are going to marry creating a life you both love together, it is potentially a mistake that could cost you a lot.

until i became widowed two months ago, i thought death was a finality. after it happened, i would have the time and space to mourn. i've since learned that death is actually followed by a long web of subscriptions, billing services and other minutia ― along with a series of arguments with customer service professionals reading from scripts.

still, the idea churned inside of me. i spent the summer taking care of myself by keeping this secret just for me. i needed something to hold onto and cuddle, and not ask for permission from other people. i needed time to think it through, and enjoy it. i needed privacy, which is something i had never learned to exercise before, never in my whole life. i gave myself permission to lie, and skirt the truth and obfuscate. i gave myself a chance to grow by making a choice that was only about me and what i needed and did not owe anything to anyone else. i didn't even tell stace, who was the other half of the equation.
you may not realize it, but your female friends have a strong impact on the success of your relationship, says arylo. if you go into a marriage without a strong, supportive tribe of sisters, you'll set yourself up to over-rely on your spouse and look to him or her to be everything to you, she warns. no one person can be everything. a strong circle of friends will keep you connected to yourself, out of isolation, and out of the potential to lose yourself in your marriage.
giving your profile a close read can be a game changer, chappell marsh said.

after being home-schooled all my life, i started attending local college classes at age 19. at first, i believed that my university was something of a mission field, or place to preach about my beliefs. in those first years, i developed a following of christian young people who admired me for my dedication and passion for my faith. but i also made friends with people who had never existed in my world before: atheists and people who are lgbtqia+.

outside of nepal's capital, nearly 500 trekkers are stranded in mountains after they were unable to make it down from their trails before the lockdown went into effect. earlier this month, the nepali government called off this year's hiking season — which includes treks to mt. everest — because of the coronavirus outbreak, hoping to deter the more than 700,000 tourists that visit the mountains every year.
people are still scorned upon when they say they're divorced. but if you think about it, when you go to check the box at the doctor's office or anywhere else and they ask you if you're single, married, or divorced, you almost hesitate to check the divorce box because you almost feel like you're going to be evaluated or judged in some way, shape, or form because your marriage and the perfect ideal of the marriage, or the illusion of the marriage, did not work out.
what designer he should wear to the inaugural ball: jonathan seems to favor simple button-ups and sweaters, but we're sure he would dress it up for an inaugural ball. the real question is, would he favor a designer from his native u.k. or an american designer, like tom ford? it seems likely that he'd go full american patriot for the occasion, just as american meghan markle chose a british designer for her royal wedding gown.
other ways she practices self-compassion include giving herself permission to take breaks, resting during the day, taking personal days off work and putting less pressure on herself. ward has taken a similar approach.
my parents spent every dollar making sure i was at the top of my class for the components they valued: academics and white-collar office skills. for years, they shuttled me from piano and violin lessons to advanced math classes and sat prep. and each year, they asked for perfect grades, glittering trophies from piano competitions and an obedient daughter.

like clockwork, these shippers came out of the woodwork this week to demand aniston and pitt reignite their flame. but why? what makes people feel so invested in the fate of these two once-wedded blonds? what do they think they'll accomplish by tweet-begging for brad to call jen?
but if historical romance is not, as a rule, a genre interested in undermining our nostalgia for an imagined, bygone golden age, it is also not empty of political concerns ― and the easily mocked anachronisms common to the genre, like the empowered heroines who are determined to find a love match or embark on a scholarly career, reveal what's really at play in the worlds of these books.
a year ago, meghan and harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to north america, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the british media. they recently bought a house in santa barbara, california.
editor's note: chris wayne, who died suddenly on jan. 14, was a dear friend of huffpost ― and of mine. i got to know chris when we hired his company, peak xv, to produce huffpost's two listen to america tours in 2017 and 2018, during which we crisscrossed the country to listen to everyday americans tell us their most urgent concerns for their families and the country. chris not only ensured these projects ran flawlessly; he all but literally held my hand when i needed it most. he showed me how to keep a cool head even in times of crisis, how to ask for help (which i am definitely not good at), and how to be a reasonable and thoughtful leader on the road. he was open and sensitive and empathetic, and i trusted him completely. i was crushed by the news of his death ― i had so many plans for us this year and next. but i am grateful he left us this story about his recovery and his 30-year sober anniversary so that huffpost readers can get a sense of who chris was, in his own voice. he was a wonderful person, and his impact will be felt at huffpost for a very long time. —hillary frey, executive editor, huffpost
do you believe that once you tie the knot everything will fall into place? if so, it may be time to realign your thinking. marriage is the start of a different journey, one that requires being content with the uncertainty that comes from a disagreement, from not knowing what's going to happen, and from dynamics that can change as months and years go by, says zimmerman. being ok with uncertainty will help every woman experience more ease, embrace change, and allow things to unfold naturally.
however you broach it, don't feel guilty or assume you're overreacting by asking your co-parent to actually parent.
granted, it's a common, and a completely acceptable, rationale human emotion to want to lash out, be angry, and desire the betrayer, pay, pay, pay for the lies they've laden into a 23-year marriage, that never really was the storybook version of the storybook marriage they thought they were living. however, by changing perspectives a little and dramatic shifts of thought, one begins to see the beauty of diversity, if one chooses to do so.

there's no right or wrong way to grieve, so do whatever you need to do to cope with the loss. talking to others who have experienced pregnancy loss can be helpful, although everyone's story and healing process will be different.
one morning, my husband woke up and saw me cuddling and talking to our baby and he said, you're feeling better. and you're feeling differently about him, aren't you? he looked so relieved. the entire time i thought i was suffering alone. but, in reality, my anxiety had affected us all.
following last week's dive into the followers of the potential 2020 democratic presidential contenders, we decided to turn things around and look at the interests of the politicians themselves: we've compiled an enormous data set that shows who people in both chambers of congress are following on twitter. the results point to a significant partisan divide and give a glimpse into the wildly different places where democrats and republicans get their information.
schock, who resigned from congress in 2015 amid claims he misused taxpayer funds, said the news would come as no surprise to his family, friends and associates. still, he said he felt compelled to make a public announcement to remove any doubt and to finally validate who i am as a person.
the other important aspect of the spectacle of the wedding is the bridal wear and trousseau. the ever-increasing bridal magazines and websites and the rise of the domestic fashion industry has propelled the indian bride to forsake dresses handed down by mothers and grandmothers in favour of high-end designer clothes.

you've learned to take responsibility for your part in the conflict or dispute. one person's ability to do this can change the dynamic of the relationship. drs. julie and john gottman write: one person's response will literally change the brain waves of the other person. apologize to your partner when appropriate. this will validate their feelings and promote forgiveness and allow you both to move on. love is not enough. saying you're sorry can heal a wound even when you didn't hurt your partner's feelings intentionally. resentment builds over time if couples aren't able to talk about hurt feelings that arise from unresolved grievances.
there were other people in the room when i was having that conversation, winfrey said. you turned me down nicely and said 'perhaps there will be another time, when there's the right time.'
the dynamic in my marriage fell into the category of chosen allegiances. if i wasn't siding with my husband against anyone who disagreed with him, i was not being loyal. i felt as if i was always being tested and found wanting. i thought i could heal the emotional wounds that he carried, but i realized that it needed to be an inside job. his pain spilled over into our home.
maybe that's the new norm. maybe that's exactly what our society is all about now. as we move faster through the world, things are changing. relationships are changing, people are changing, we're evolving, we're growing.

there was already this sexual tension, this roaringness, she told entertainment tonight last year. we had already established such a friendship that we had the two combine. which, in my mind, just made magic, because now not only am i sleeping with someone that i trust and i love, but i know that he wants me. he affirms me all the time and lets me know how sexy and beautiful i am.

take 2008′s the reader, which weinstein strong-armed into that year's oscar race. the slogan on its for your consideration ads sums up his entire approach: the one film that has everyone talking. (it's questionable as to whether it did indeed have everyone talking: in his opening monologue, oscar host hugh jackman joked about having not seen it.)
making a tv relationship work after the filming ends might be the toughest thing i've ever had to do. fans might assume that because we were a 'perfect match,' our relationship has been nothing but a fairy tale. they couldn't be more wrong.

6. practice self-awareness: it is great practice to reflect once in a while on what you are contributing to your relationship. look in the mirror and ask yourself if you are being judgmental, hypercritical, unfair, defensive and unkind. constantly course correct.

my brother left home a few months later. he told me those operations he needed were done on the west coast, but i wondered if he was also aching to get far away. he never wavered in his conviction that this was the right thing to do, but he'd been completely ostracized by everyone except a very few of us. as he drove off, even i felt a wave of guilty relief. now maybe everything could go back to normal.

as psychotherapist maura sills says,  i come from a family that was angry; it was the way we related to one another. i believed that if people had trouble with my anger, it was their problem, and i had a right to act the way i wanted. but when we express anger, we are creating more pain and suffering in ourselves than in others.

at first, i thought divorce was our only option. once a cheater, always a cheater looped in my head, along with the imagined porno film of what my husband had done. i couldn't sleep. i could barely eat. i lost weight. the walk to the std testing clinic felt like a funeral march. and through it all, that horrible movie kept playing on repeat, torturing me with all the visuals and sounds and smells that i imagined had occurred in his adulterous moments. in a frenzy of despair, i banished a couch ― the couch of sin i called it ― onto a truck-bound journey that assured i would never see it again.
why some folks choose to interpret the new book by pope emeritus benedict and cardinal sarah in anti-pope francis ways speaks volumes, he tweeted. let's pray for healing for the critics that they can rejoice in a new work from two great churchmen of our time, including a major theologian.

la la land just swept the golden globes. there are a lot of reasons for that which i'll leave to actual movie critics. i did enjoy the movie, but not in the typical i-laughed-i-cried (although i did) sort of way. but more in an i'm-wowed-by-its-life-lessons sort of way. because some of its offerings were stunningly and straightforwardly profound. who knew that a film featuring a tap-dancing ryan gosling would be a tutorial of wise counsel we'd be wise to follow and pass down to our kids? (warning: i'm not revealing a lot about the plot, but if you're particularly sensitive to spoilers, maybe don't read on.)
our original plan was to have about 80 people for a ceremony and reception in atlanta, where we met and where most of our friends and family live. we sent our 'un-save the dates' in early august. we didn't want to have anything looming over the day or to be remembered as a 'covid wedding.' it was frustrating at the time, but still felt like the right thing to do. we thought, 'what if someone we love got really sick from this?' and it seemed like an easy decision.
it seems absurd that someone won't know they are feeling so afraid they suffer anxiety or so down they are depressed, or a mixture of both. but often anxiety and depression show up as symptoms we might not consider to be anxiety or depression at all, said winfried sedhoff, a family physician specializing in treating mental illness in brisbane, australia.

we stayed in regular touch throughout but after a year, we made our plan to be together, she said. we didn't know what life would be like when we were both in the same city, but our bond was solid thanks to our time investment and our mutual determination to be together, so our transition was smooth.
the cause: personality traits have a lot to do with it, says david silverman, a licensed marriage and family therapist in new york. if you have one person who's a controller and one person who's more relaxed about the way they do things, you get a lot of resentment or fighting on both sides. it becomes the focus of their relationship. you can get into a power struggle and once you get into a power struggle, you're not going to be able to work as a team anymore.
people think they want me but they don't, i said.

having a partner is prestigious and a traditional marker of success. even the most accomplished women are deemed pitiful if they don't have a better half. when friends told me they hoped i'd meet someone soon, i know they meant well. however, it's apparent that singledom is still perceived as a problem to be solved hastily particularly for women in their pursuit of self-worth.
best guess at the cause he'd choose as first gentleman: according to his bio for his law firm, emhoff is passionate about many charitable causes, including those that impact the well-being of children. emhoff may focus on education, the foster care system, children's hospitals or any other area that would promote the well-being of america's future generations.

send special messages. make a point to send a special text of joy, says greer. think, 'i miss you,' 'i love you,' and 'i'm looking forward to seeing you.' anything that will make your partner happy or reference something you share together. always make sure your text conversations are not only about responsibilities like picking up the kids, what you'll have for dinner, when they're coming home, etc.
still, as nervous as i was, ethan was even more nervous. he had been driving an old beat-up car and was waiting tables to get through college. did i care about any of that? absolutely not! but it was not something he boasted about in hawaii or even brought up. i think he thought the reality of his lifestyle would scare me away. but the exact opposite was true: it wasn't until i visited ethan in colorado and saw him exactly as he was, living his life, that i actually fell in love with him.

4) place and memory play such central roles in when the men go off to war. a good example of this is the poem prayers of an american wife (one of my favorites, and also the title of your chapbook that preceded this collection) - i would dream back that too-bright place. that idea of dreaming back was something i found a lot of in your poems, but in a way that suggested immediacy and activeness over longing for the past or simple nostalgia. how did you convey that dichotomy, and why was it important to do so?

we were the girls next door, america's sweethearts -- classy and sassy but well-behaved. all sorts of men came through the door during the day. there were locals, lobbyists, politicians, attorneys, out-of-towners, and businessmen who wrote off strip-clubs as a business expense.
it's sort of funny because every time they find out, one of them gets a light in their eyes like they would love to do that, too, and the other one shoots it down, he said. i'll also say probably one out of 10 couples we know also have separate bedrooms for pretty much the same reasons we do.

the sharp observations in the birdcage are classic nichols and may, longtime collaborators who refused to over-emphasize themes the way lesser storytellers might have. take, for example, hackman's kevin keeley, a pat buchanan type who co-founded an archetypal right-wing group called the coalition for moral order. the heartbreak of armand (williams) reluctantly agreeing to strip his home decor, send albert (lane) away and play straight during keeley's visit is accentuated by what a ridiculous person keeley is. facing a very '90s sex scandal, he behaves like a child: irascible, self-centered and addicted to candy.

in the end, though, hustlers also underscored how much hollywood has slighted lopez. that buzz wasn't enough to land her the nomination, a fact that is surely rooted in how the academy of motion picture arts and sciences — and our culture at large — views women. someone as famous as lopez isn't serious enough to join such lofty ranks, especially when she's playing a thieving stripper.
the cult-like beliefs that shaped my upbringing belong to what is known as the quiverfull movement. it is based on psalm 127, which reads, children are a heritage of the lord, and fruit of the womb is his reward; happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. the metaphor of a quiver full of arrows defines children as weapons to be used to win the world for christian conservative values.

in india, hair and femininity are inextricable. the trendsetting industries of film and television, firmly in the grip of conservatism, haven't shown much interest in broadening our understanding of femininity ― on or off screen, no a-list actors sport hair that isn't well past their shoulders, and an artfully waved lob is considered radical. popular fashion designers like sabyasachi, who premised their careers on challenging conventions of femininity, are now associated with deeply traditional iconography that features women in long, demure hairstyles.

other moments feel more painfully honest. after a royal hanger-on at a tea makes a snide comment about meghan's hair, then tries to touch it, harry becomes righteously incensed. this is just how things are, she tells him. let's fight how things are! he exclaims. if anyone can, it's you and me. she replies, calmly, you have never seen how ugly people can get about this. to enlighten him, she relates a painful story from her childhood about being out with her mother, who is black, and seeing a white man call her the n-word.

if we are constantly thinking that others may not relate to our personality or our situation, we begin to excessively focus our mind deeply within ourselves and feel even more isolated, quazi said. however, when we recognize that there are actually other people who are feeling equally isolated, it becomes much easier to try changing our focus from ourselves to others and reaching out to those who may benefit from your support.

i wasn't terribly worried about not having a career. my dad, who'd grown up in a non-jehovah's witness family, was a nuclear physicist, having safely qualified before anyone told him that the end of the world was on the horizon. i certainly didn't want to do that ― his job seemed terribly difficult and jobs in general seemed scary, tiring and not sufficiently rewarding. rather like studying for spelling tests, i thought. the ones that appealed to me (being a ballerina, a model or sherlock holmes) weren't allowed by the jws. i might as well make friends with lions in paradise, i reasoned. and though living forever sounded overwhelming, not having to die certainly had some appeal. we learned a lot about death ― it sounded awful. the bible was full of violent, painful deaths, and all were presented to us with lurid pictures. if the price for my family staying alive was eternal boredom, that at least sounded better than torture and murder.
in addition, many roles for women still focus on their personal lives, like marriage or children, rather than their professional lives. by contrast, men on-screen were more likely to be depicted in primarily work-related roles and have an identifiable occupation, according to the research.

do no harm, i thought. i wanted to put work into the world that portrayed male dominance and female submission. i was worried about the impact it would have on people who found the images disturbing. i realized i needed everyone to know that it only represented my sexual tastes, not my worldview. if i wanted to produce bdsm images, i needed to also be a good friend to other women and to be the best feminist i could.

many queer period pieces have hit the cinema recently (the favourite, portrait of a lady on fire, ammonite), but the world to come seems to address the fear of being found out more potently. it wasn't uncommon for women to be reprimanded, raped or even killed for disobeying their husband's wishes in the 1800s, as waterston noted is referenced in heidi schreck's play what the constitution means to me.
the chairman of the virginia legislative black caucus, del. lamont bagby, said, we've got a lot to digest.
marriage is a slippery slope. there are so many moments in any given day during which your partner might do something to irritate you, or you them. it can be something small, like forgetting to take out the garbage or pay the bills, even after being reminded again and again. or it can be something bigger, like refusing overtures toward sex, for whatever reason, but it might serve to hit one of you right in the ego, conjuring up hurt and anger. one thing to keep in mind is that whatever it is that your partner is doing to upset you, it is generally not intentional. your spouse is not out to hurt you. more than anything, they are probably trying to please you as best they can, but their own needs get in the way. because of that, in your eyes you wind up focusing on what went wrong and overlook what they did right which keeps them in the minus column. in fact, very often there may be several plus moments in any given day, things that are done with caring but come to be expected and are overlooked and taken for granted, and as a result go unmentioned and unappreciated. a hot cup of coffee, a text to check in and see how you are, or a hello kiss can oftentimes get overshadowed by the tension of seeing what they're not doing as opposed to what they are doing.
it can encourage both therapist and client to get to the heart of the problem rather quickly, stuempfig noted. they know that if they engage in typical small talk, it will be a waste of valuable time.

in recent years, forward-thinking educators like flatt have helped build significant interest in the educational benefits of playing and designing video games. there is now increasing acceptance that the process of game making—the structuring of a world with constrained rules--enhances thinking and problem solving.
while romance is prevalent in the story (it's so juicy, oprah says), what's particularly profound is the nuanced exploration of mass incarceration and how it impacts the heads and hearts of those touched by it. jones tells the story through the perspectives of three alternating narrators, diving into the messy gray areas and complexities of love with full force.

lean into your work and healthy activities as a distraction.
we were pretty upset and anxious about having to cancel our elopement. it had been my dream since getting engaged to get married in such a surreal atmosphere. we considered ways to still make it happen when it was safer to travel. however, travel restrictions and general fears surrounding covid made it seem like we could be waiting for a long time. my husband is from australia, and we were in a long-distance relationship for over two years. we were getting married while he was here on a k1 visa, so it was a bit time-sensitive for us. we were ok with the idea of doing a town hall ceremony or even in our living room over zoom. however, i think after all the hardships we faced, especially with the pandemic, we wanted it to be more than about meeting the requirements of a visa, just as it was meant to originally be. once i started doing some research into what options we had to elope nearby, i realized that we can still have our perfect day, just with a different backdrop.
all of my kids are different. i've tried to keep them away from what i do for a living but they've all found really different and unique things that are very creative.
structured in the right way, shared in the right way, talking about your fears, upsets and frustrations over finances can bring you closer as a couple, he said.
every evening at dinner, practice telling your partner one thing you appreciate about him and have him do the same for you. it can be something specific like how he helped you solve a dilemma that day or more general like the fact that he works his booty off to support you and the fam! switch it up nightly, and let the love flow.

many young men envision meeting their soulmate, sharing their life with the person of their dreams, having a family, and living the life that's expected of them – married to a beautiful woman and being a supportive husband and father. yet some men are torn apart inside by the secret they keep that leads to heart wrenching guilt, shame, and fear of failing everyone they know.
this is an apparent web of organizations that seem to exist to pay compensation to sekulow and his family members, said owens, who is now in private practice. that pattern clearly raises questions for those entities that are tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) as to whether they're operating for a public benefit or the private benefit of jay sekulow and his family members.

experts say that communication is the cornerstone of a good relationship. that's why it can be deeply troubling when your partner is closed off and guarded.
it's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, pence spokeswoman kara brooks told huffpost.
he had hoped getting married would would make their problems go away, but four years later, that hadn't proved to be true and they were in the midst of a divorce.
if you're unsure of what to say, lamotte said to script it out like this:
they're not trying to deny employment to gay people out of spite. they're trying to keep gay and gay-friendly people from their students. that's not beneficial to the students, and it certainly wasn't great for me.
robert's problem is young girls, the fax ― later confirmed to be written by one of kelly's assistants ― said. i've known robert for many years, and i've tried to get him to get help, but he just won't do it. so i'm telling you about it hoping that you or someone at your newspaper will write an article about it and then robert will have no choice but to get help and stop hurting the people he's hurting.
and we're sitting here like, 'we have the best family, we're so great,' and yet we don't ever acknowledge the fact that we have four other siblings. four! she continued. so i've been thinking a lot about the hudsons, and thinking that it's important that we reach out to all of our siblings and maybe connect with them a little bit.
the primary role is social hostess: decorating the white house, holding events when foreign diplomats are here, giving tours, said jean wahl harris, a political science professor at the university of scranton, who has studied the role of the first lady for nearly two decades. many of the expectations are very gendered, not things we would expect men to do, like hostessing ― but i think the expectations for the [male] spouse are not going to be the same.
one of the best reasons to be in an intimate relationship is that we have someone to tell our troubles to, who will take our side when the world feels harsh. that feeling of being understood and accepted is what intimacy is about. if you become immediately bored, or act like your partner is a drag when he or she starts to tell you about their bad day, it's like slamming an emotional door in their face. even if your partner doesn't protest, it's still a recipe for loneliness in a relationship. ― amy begel, marriage and family therapist
i felt like i was in the bewitched episode where samantha acted like everything was normal even though ben franklin was lounging on the sofa.

a dean at a new jersey university resigned saying the school's decision to not consider bringing chick-fil-a to campus because of its opposition to the lgbtq community made her feel like i had been punched in the stomach.
the cable company, usually the boogeyman of the utility companies we deal with, turned out to be not-so-bad. i just had to threaten to not pay them if they didn't switch the name on the account. ditto for the propane company.
she points out that hair has always been weaponized to various ends since the beginning of time. and that even though shearing your mane off feels radical and original, it really isn't. i've seen my friends rebel, do so much with their hair ― turn it into a canvas, turn it into a war zone of self expression the moment they go through a revelation or heartbreak. aren't these learned behaviors, things we have seen, heard, been around? ... using hair to protest is rooted in ideas of sexualization and desexualization. it's a power struggle. and it will happen for as long as both genders fight over equality.
our long, scruffy national nightmare is over: justin bieber has shaved his mustache.
it's a cool dynamic we all have, ella recently told the new york times of their family. and i think it is a good model to show that you can have this and this isn't weird. like it's not weird to be friends or have a good relationship with your ex. it's actually very healthy.

small ways to reduce your feelings of loneliness right now.
the necklaces were a very simple thing, thornton said years ago about the matching accessories, which he explained were initially jolie's idea. 'hey, let's poke our finger with a pin and smear a little on there, and when we're away from each other, we'll wear the necklace.' that was that easy, but by the time it came out in the press, it sounded like we were wearing a bucket of blood around our necks.
this is an example of a conditional apology that doesn't truly acknowledge any remorse or personal responsibility. by using the word 'if,' you are communicating that the problem isn't really about what you did, but is about how the person reacted to what you did instead. essentially, this type of 'non-apology' places the blame back onto the person it's directed at. simply remove the word 'if,' and your apology can take on a whole new meaning: 'i'm sorry i offended you. i will make sure to be more considerate and careful with my words in the future.' ― tara griffith, marriage and family therapist and the founder of wellspace sf
6. you're dealing with suicidal ideation.
olsen said she and other therapists have experienced a new type of challenge in their professional lives during the pandemic. when i'm holding other people's traumas, it's usually removed. but i think it's a whole other thing to hold somebody's trauma in real time while you yourself are experiencing that same kind of trauma, she said.
the two men who filed a lawsuit tuesday against vistaprint — the popular printing company that sent the couple a boxful of anti-gay pamphlets instead of the weddingprograms they'd ordered — have prompted the printers to announce an investigation into the matter, as well as their commitment to marriage equality.
i just asked her if she'd like to do it over. she said, yes she would, he told today.com. we tolerated each other and talked all those years, but i guess deep down there was always that first love. it was always there.
she then declares that she feels it's now time to have another kid, which thompson enthusiastically agrees with, saying he's all for it.
all children deserve a life free of violence and fear, a life of hope and dreams. however, the previous century's hasty development agenda has neglected their needs. today, we stand again on the brink of leaving behind an entire generation. to alter the circumstances, we need to build a strong foundation which prioritizes children and their protection.

planned parenthood says they promote women's health, vitter said in a may 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new clinic in new orleans. it is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. the first step in promoting women's health is to let them live.
8. celebrate each other: lift each other up and celebrate the small and large victories together. sharing is caring. be happy for each other.
it's amazing how quickly it happens, isn't it? one day you're two. the next, you're three. not parents and then parents. all of a sudden there's this little creature who shares both of your dna staring at you from a bassinet. it's incredible how quickly a baby's presence completely retools every relationship you have — with yourself, your friends, your family, your job, and, especially your partner. and if you don't react to the change, your marriage can suffer.

there's been a big shift in public sentiment from last year when large majorities approved of the job newsom was doing, a university of california, berkeley, poll revealed tuesday. currently, the poll found, fewer than half of voters initially say they would vote to endorse newsom if a recall election is held later this year.
when both partners in a relationship are on board with this philosophy, it certainly allows for more time and money to spend on shared experiences and quality time to talk, dream and relate to one another, howes said. if you have four shirts to clean instead of two dozen, that means more time to spend with your partner.
the speech, delivered in front of the iowa house of representatives, was a response to proposed legislative efforts to end civil unions in the state. at the time, marriage equality in america was still four years away, and moments like this felt precious to many same-sex couples who often felt as though they would never win the right to wed.
a lot of couples enter into second marriages before the first one is finished. this can contribute to trust issues surfacing later on in areas such as communication with an ex or activity on social media sites. healthy boundaries are crucial in all relationships, but especially in second marriages. ― kurt smith, a therapist who counsels men

a highly skilled narcissist may casually mention the high-end gym that they belong to or that they only fly first-class, but it is done with such subtle sophistication that their target may not even register it as a red flag, she said. the less-skilled narcissist will openly and obnoxiously discuss their ivy league degree, or the square footage of their new apartment.
14. charlize theron: it's challenging but we manage. i work, but my children are my priority. nothing's better than the sound of little ones cracking up at something funny; i'm now at my most comfortable waking up with my kids, going to the beach and relaxing over a meal with friends.
when most of your communication happens via text, phone or video chat — and especially if you're living in different time zones — it's not unusual to feel out of sync at times. but is that feeling a temporary blip or a sign that you're just not on the same page anymore?

4. they expect their partner to be a mind-reader.
when the client knows a big issue won't be fully resolved in one session, they may feel more comfortable presenting it, discussing goals to counter the problem, exploring different aspects of it and learning coping skills to implement in everyday life.
while it's natural for couples to experience peaks and valleys in their sex lives, when a valley happens or stays too long, hurt, disappointments and rejection creep in. if your partner is starting to feel more like a roommate than a lover, this is a prime opportunity to come together and talk truth, all masks off about your desires, turn-ons and sexual expectations. how much sexual contact do you both want? what makes you feel connected and intimate? what are you going to do on the 'off' days? what do you each need to feel desired? how much experimentation is allowed?

what happens to debt if you are married
christians would be wise to ask ourselves some uncomfortable questions here. is the cozy relationship of faith and football an unholy marriage? has the time come for us to take a hard look at what we enable when we buy tickets and team jerseys, and cheer the big game on in our fellowship halls? are we guilty of turning a blind eye to a very ugly aspect of the game - the increasingly obvious and undeniable destruction of the bodies and minds of those who entertain us?
sharing and keeping the house made financial sense for the two of us, but i knew there were going to be awkward moments. the day did come when we had to have a conversation about overnight visitors and set some boundaries. it was a weird conversation to be having with someone i had been committed and loyal to for 13 years, but in reality we both just wanted to keep things civil and respectful. our compromise was to become more private with our lives (something that wasn't that hard since we'd led independent lives as roommates for years at this point) and only introduce new people to the family if they were totally and completely serious.
a genuine, heartfelt apology is a powerful step toward mending hurt feelings and finding a resolution. a half-assed apology, on the other hand, can be worse than none at all.
because, really, how else is life well-lived?
they reaffirmed the importance of youth voices in creating policies. in the post-world war era, the impetus has been on international coalitions and technological investments for a resilient and more peaceful world. but the gaps in our economic policies have proliferated child marriage, the number of children out of school, children in exploitative sexual and labor conditions and most of all, the disparity of opportunities between children of different ethnicities, regions and backgrounds.

some stylists ensure the food is as delicious as anything they would assemble for, say, a catered event. when tobin made beef stew for the nautical disaster thriller the finest hours, chris pine asked to keep leftovers in his trailer because it reminded him of his mother's cooking. other stylists focus only on making food functional. they're not looking for four-star dining, papier said. it's called acting for a reason.

keeping an organized home seems very daunting, and for people with a lot on their plates, it can easily fall between the cracks, psychologist samantha rodman told huffpost. since keeping the house clean isn't 'urgent,' it gets shelved in favor of more time-sensitive issues, like getting to work on time.

you had that figure of the 'tragic mulatto,' who's the mixed-race woman whose narrative requires her to have a bad end, matthew pointed out. [marina] is drawn with a different set of challenges to face that mirror daphne's around childbirth. but i think she's also a woman who is loved and respected. that's not how that narrative usually unfolds … they make her such a sympathetic character without making her weak or obsequious. she's beautiful and playful and making the best of a situation.
gay men are, as keuroghlian puts it, primed to expect rejection. we're constantly scanning social situations for ways we may not fit into them. we struggle to assert ourselves. we replay our social failures on a loop. the weirdest thing about these symptoms, though, is that most of us don't see them as symptoms at all. since he looked into the data, salway has started interviewing gay men who attempted suicide and survived. when you ask them why they tried to kill themselves, he says, most of them don't mention anything at all about being gay. instead, he says, they tell him they're having relationship problems, career problems, money problems. they don't feel like their sexuality is the most salient aspect of their lives. and yet, they're an order of magnitude more likely to kill themselves. the term researchers use to explain this phenomenon is minority stress. in its most direct form, it's pretty simple: being a member of a marginalized group requires extra effort. when you're the only woman at a business meeting, or the only black guy in your college dorm, you have to think on a level that members of the majority don't. if you stand up to your boss, or fail to, are you playing into stereotypes of women in the workplace? if you don't ace a test, will people think it's because of your race? even if you don't experience overt stigma, considering these possibilities takes its toll over time.
i might be skewered for that, but i think it's work. it's a lot of work. and the fact that it is such work for so many people — for everyone — the fact of that proves that it is not a natural thing, she added. it's something i have a lot of respect for and have participated in, but i think it definitely goes against some instinct to look beyond.

that was jan. 3, 2007. the date was imprinted in jackson's mind as sexual abuse continued over the ensuing months. jackson claims the pastor, cameron giovanelli, used it as a secret code to initiate intimate text conversations. giovanelli would text jan, and if she was alone, she would reply 3rd ― signaling that the coast was clear for him to text freely.

9. try practicing mindfulness before you hit the sheets.
cameron: just to pair it somewhat with what lauren said, the vulnerability was so high, the bar that you had to go to participate in the right way. to meet someone and fall for them. you had to put it all out there. anyone who's listening, caution against judging people for this. although we've talked a lot about it, it's hard to really know what the pods were like and the whole experience in general. so, yeah.

you can do or be whatever you want when you're single. it's also a prime opportunity to have fun discovering what you want your life to be about. i'd come across this advice before but i needed to experience it firsthand to get it.
1. i'm sorry you feel that way.
i stopped fighting, became part of the swirling melody, as the fish and i and the sea rocked back and forth for a while. boundaries disappeared; we were one. as i lazily allowed the ocean to hold me, face down, relaxed and continuing to breathing through the snorkel, one group of fish after another came to me. striped, bright colored, and speckled fish, and, long, thin iridescent blue ones.
the other half of the battle is choosing whether you listen to her or not.
however, there was another feeling overpowering any resemblance of joy. it was this overwhelming sense of responsibility and fear weighing down on me. here was this little, helpless baby, and his life was in my hands. thoughts of sudden infant death syndrome, illnesses and an immature immune system flooded my mind. i entered a state of panic. i've always been a positive, upbeat and rational person, and, although i've been known to be a planner and sometimes worry over little things, i'd never suffered from anxiety before that moment.
dewan responded by assuring degeneres that she was fine and it was all love.
not every royal fares well in the script. the fake kate, the duchess of cambridge (laura mitchell), takes on the tough but necessary job of making married life look miserable (marriage isn't so bad, is it, will? she asks her husband pointedly, as he evades her gaze), and the members of the royal family look calculating and cold. she doesn't like that americans are so loud, and sniffs her doubts that this upstart actress could handle the rigors of royal life. by the time we see her assuring meghan that us commoners have to stick together and confiding in her about feeling like a baby-making machine, it's too late: i hate kate now.
without a moment like that my mother had [in the '80s], i literally would not exist, he said. so to be able to pay that forward ― whether here in the united states or internationally, whether it's today or tomorrow or 10 years or 50 years from now, whatever the case may be ― that is its own reward.
as mentioned in tip #2, holding onto anger over time creates resentment. resentment is the key ingredient that destroys intimacy and happiness in any relationship.
attending my first same-sex wedding changed me, and ultimately it gave me more perspective. perspective that i hope to pass on to my three boys by teaching them to love and accept everyone as they are and instill in them the valuable lessons that i was taught at church and outside church; everything else i hope to figure out in time.

he also wrote that he had always thought of himself as a broken straight person ― someone who was meant to be straight and whom god would one day fix. but he realizes now that viewing himself as fundamentally broken has led to overwhelming sadness in his life and at times, to suicidal thoughts, he added.
emphasize that it's nobody's fault, just something sad that happened. if your child asks why the loss happened, you can explain that miscarriage is rather common and often due to abnormalities out of our control, not the result of anything anyone did or didn't do.
i do think that in cases where mothers reduced their paid work or are no longer employed, parents have likely gone back to specialized, more traditional gender roles, she said. and of course, for single moms, and those with fewer economic resources, the pandemic has hit especially hard ― they are doing an incredible amount of work to manage raising kids in a pandemic.

unfortunately, the deeper stuff is also the most tedious stuff. once the conversation has taken us up to clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer amal clooney, the show cuts to a filmed segment of a visit to clooney's boyhood home in lexington, ky. there, his dad, former broadcaster nick clooney, introduces letterman to hazim avdal, whose chyron reads, iraqi refugee sponsored by the clooneys. yes, the elder clooneys have taken in a nice young man at the bidding of george and amal, who works with people whose families have been affected by genocidal war. it's a pleasant enough interlude — until they're all walking down a leafy kentucky street chatting and letterman mock-yells at a guy riding on lawn mower. except it's not really a mock yell; he really does want the guy to shut off his motor so they can keep filming. again: rich and powerful person meets ordinary citizen as alien presence.

within the therapy community there is a general belief that counselors and psychotherapists are gender neutral and that they do not impose their personal beliefs about gender roles onto their clients. in my experience, this belief is incorrect. many of my clients tell me stories of how their previous therapists encouraged them to comply with gender roles and stereotypes that limited their voice and power. and last month i met with a psychotherapist whose unconscious and covert sexism biased her understanding of me and the advice she gave.
so, i'm out. i'm done. i could hair flip and gracefully lay down my super mom cape, but then i would be pretending again. and full of it. i promised myself i would stop. my house gets messy. i yell at my kids. my marriage isn't perfect. i am often terribly insensitive. i over analyze my body. i use boxed mixes when baking 50% of the time. ok 75%. i hire house cleaners and then pretend i do it all. and more. so much more bs i can't see straight.

zillow is similar to those, but even more realistic, and it's a nice escape for us during this difficult time. with the continued stress of the pandemic, people are seeking various ways to escape the overwhelming reality, and zillow is one very popular way to do that, morton continued. you easily move from state to state, area to area, and imagine what it would be like to live in that home, critique the flooring or dated cabinets in the kitchen, and for a few minutes you can forget about the stress we are going through, the job loss, political issues or whatever upset you may be feeling.

there was a twang to his voice and some grizzle in his chosen handle — they were clues to his identity. grandpa lampshade fretted about being exposed, but he'd been sloppy in covering his tracks. he used the name oilylizzard in one email address to collect donations and in another email linked to his real name. his wife advertised his now-defunct grandpa lampshade twitter account in memes she'd posted years ago.

will we one day move in together? maybe. when it feels right. but for now, we're too busy living our lives and loving each other just the way we are. it's not always easy, and it isn't like the marriages of any of the other couples we know, but it doesn't have to be. it's who we are ― together, apart, and everything in between ― and we love it and each other. and that's what really matters, right?
eg: so, basically what we're saying is that love is blind is a tonal, pacing, messaging mess, and yet it also has some deeply compelling — if sort of sad — moments. and we haven't even gotten to the weddings yet! sigh.

friends asked me if i was able to see how the rough pregnancy that i endured was worth it. but by the time i had a complete breakdown and snapped at my mother after she coughed during one of her visits, i was regretting the decision to ever become a mother. it was too hard, and my heart hurt too much. i used to be happy. what did i do? why did i cause myself and my family so much anxiety? whose idea was it to let me have a child? i had no training, no experience and no real knowledge. why did they ever let me walk out of the hospital with a baby? that didn't even sound safe. didn't they know this baby would die in my hands and under my watch? these thoughts were constantly flooding my mind.
mccormack voted in favor of same-sex marriage in australia last year, and has said his views on the lgbtq community have evolved in the 25 years since he wrote the piece.
whilst nelson and his robben island coterie had become more academic and statesman-like during their years cut off from grassroots politics, winnie, on the other hand, was forced to become a soldier on the ground. during her decades of police intimidation and harassment; her emotional brutalization (having had her family torn apart and her closest friends betray her); and her physical imprisonment and banishment, winnie had developed combative defenses against a world that was unfailingly hostile. since the latter stages of her exile, rumors had begun to circulate about winnie's increasingly erratic behavior; her recourse to drink and her occasional bouts of violent behavior. once established in soweto, these rumors refused to dissipate and her frequent public appearances in khaki uniform did little to quell speculation that her approach to liberation was becoming increasingly military driven and violent.

judging yourself for your emotions is like judging yourself for your body temperature. it's not in your control, said tina gilbertson, a denver-based psychotherapist and the author of constructive wallowing: how to beat bad feelings by letting yourself have them. it's common to believe we can choose our emotions, but if you think about it, that's nonsense. if we could choose our feelings, why wouldn't everyone be happy all the time?

trump is dramatically reshaping the nation's federal courts. with rushing's confirmation, he has now gotten 32 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two supreme court justices confirmed. that's so many circuit judges ― more than any other president confirmed by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on u.s. circuit courts is now filled by a judge nominated by trump.

we must listen to the voices of lgbtq people, many of whom are christians — to their stories of oppression, pain, joy and historical and present triumph. we must let their stories change those of us who are not marginalized on the basis of gender or sexual orientation and follow in the fight for a more equitable world. i must, as a christian reject any ideology, law or practice that strips people of their humanity.
of the tens of thousands of comments and questions i have received over the years, this one might be one of the most inspiring:
children pick up on and often rely on their parent's emotions to help them form their responses to situations, so it's most helpful to make sure you're in a headspace that will best allow you to guide your child through their own process as they digest the discussion, she noted.
katie's story shows how faith, and also lack of faith, can be contagious. katie's trust in her ability to succeed in marriage was strengthened by her interactions with happily married couples and with people who believed she could succeed. consequently, she became confident enough to end an unsatisfying relationship and enter a fulfilling, lifelong one.
dr. kristy money, mormon psychologist and founder of healthy mormon journeys, has created a new podcast that helps mormons along the way of faith transition. her new website offers free counseling to those who cannot afford it, in an attempt to save marriages and families that could be at stake when it comes to faith changes. there are too many mormons who are divorcing because they cannot see how to negotiate family life after a faith crisis, too many parents who won't speak to adult children, too many aborted family reunions.

huffpost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize nelson mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive south africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. many of the schools that use these books also ban lgbtq students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. at one point in an abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.
i hope that people see that if a child could understand two women marrying each other, then why can't lawmakers and people who have the power to make a difference see that too? she said. and give the lgbtqia+ community the same rights and treatment as heterosexual people.

the psychic part of laura really doesn't factor into our marriage as much as you might think. laura is largely unable to read people that she is very close to. therefore, it isn't a situation where i have to worry about her peering into my thoughts and activities without my knowing it. plus, even if she did, i am pretty well-behaved for the most part and spend virtually all of my time either at work or with our family. she knows where i am at all times and i am pretty predictable!
mary still lives with a small measure of pain — something she describes as completely tolerable, and avoids sex on days when she might have to do something else that might cause her pain to spike, like a long car ride that can jostle her body. but she cries thinking about the years of pain that affected her relationship with her husband.
on march 5, 2018, the prime minister modi signed off on a proposal to update the secc. the specifics and safeguards of the secc were yet to be ironed out, but one thing was clear — it was now a question of when the registry would be built, rather than if it would be built at all.

the fucking jungle. n no one ever told adam not to act effeminate. but he, like me, like most of us, learned it somehow. i never worried about my family being homophobic, he says. i used to do this thing where i would wrap a blanket around myself like a dress and dance around in the backyard. my parents thought it was cute, so they took a video and showed it to my grandparents. when they all watched the tape, i hid behind the couch because i was so ashamed. i must have been six or seven. by the time he got to high school, adam had learned to manage his mannerisms so well that no one suspected him of being gay. but still, he says, i couldn't trust anyone because i had this thing i was holding. i had to operate in the world as a lone agent. he came out at 16, then graduated, then moved to san francisco and started working in hiv prevention. but the feeling of distance from other people didn't go away. so he treated it, he says, with lots and lots of sex. it's our most accessible resource in the gay community. you convince yourself that if you're having sex with someone, you're having an intimate moment. that ended up being a crutch. he worked long hours. he would come home exhausted, smoke a little weed, pour a glass of red wine, then start scanning the hookup apps for someone to invite over.

this was a creature apart from the jane austen adaptations and sedate period pieces i already enjoyed, or sexy but bloody cable costume dramas. a regency romance is set in a fantasy version of british high society in the early 19th century, and the central action revolves around the courtship between a woman (often a well-bred beauty) and a man (often a rakish peer). they consummate their attraction in improbably acrobatic sexual encounters, and then they live happily ever after.

after my sister's wedding, she received a letter of excommunication from the lds church. i do not hold blame or ill will towards the church, she told me. they have to decide what they stand for, and i can respect that. but i can also hold my boundaries, which has given me so much peace in my life.
cheating is when you betray the trust established with your partner. for me, even if i kissed another person beyond a 'hello' peck on the cheek, it would be cheating on my wife if i did it behind her back. however, on the other hand, she and i may agree that we can explore sexual expressions with someone else if we're all together in the same room, and that may be ok since we haven't abandoned the implicit or explicit trust. in fact, even if we 'played' privately, it wouldn't necessarily be deemed cheating ― as long as it was agreed upon, we both understood what would be going on and, most importantly, we shared the experience with each other, which could then even turn the experience into a source of erotic energy for us to use at another time. cheating is really more about secrecy than anything else: keeping secrets from one another is where the trouble begins. besides, i have a great relationship with my wife, so why on earth would i want to screw it up for a momentary joy ride? ― bruce hirshfield

'yes' calls for flexibility and generosity, a willingness to sometimes go wholeheartedly with our second choice, reilly said. not in the mood for sushi? not a big fan of hugh grant movies? a, 'yes' on these sorts of things won't kill you. in my experience, generosity begets generosity. and generosity feels good, both giving and receiving.

what we know through research is that people have, what we call, a 'stereotyped rape script,' wilson explained. what most people assume rape looks like is a strange man raping a woman in a dark alley, there's typically a weapon involved, and she normally fights back. anything that doesn't fit that script, we don't know what to do with it. we don't know how to conceptualize it.
she and her husband, producer tim rosenman, post videos on youtube about their lives as parents. port, in particular, offers an honest look at motherhood in a series called i love my baby, but... considering her candid commentary ― it feels like someone's, like, slicing my nipples with glass, she says about breastfeeding in a video posted in august ― it's no surprise that relatable is a word that frequently crops up in the comments section.

the endorsements from rouda, sherrill and stevens stand out because house democrats are being unusually slow this cycle to make endorsements. more members of congress had endorsed hillary clinton by this point in 2016 than have endorsed any of the candidates running in 2020 thus far. of the 232 democrats in the u.s. house, more than 100 remain undeclared. nine are currently endorsing bloomberg.
as carrie got busier with work, we spent less and less time together, at which point the inherent problems in the relationship--the fact that when we were out in public together, fans and entertainment industry people would literally push me aside or flat out stand in front of me to get to her--were exacerbated. i had worked for celebrities before and was used to being shoved out of the way but this was different. i wasn't working for her. i was her friend.

but letting black men escape accountability isn't some sort of retribution for our ancestors who were murdered over false accusations, or for our peers who languish behind bars for crimes that they did not commit. those of us who really care about justice should focus on creating a world where the race of an abuser will not protect him from punishment, nor ensure that he will be unduly punished.

huffpost chatted with some individuals who have both anxiety and depression as well as mental health experts about what people commonly get wrong about living with anxiety and depression. here are some of the most common offenders:
7. stop lying about the little things.
eric murphy, 39, is up for a seat on the u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit. he has fought to make it easier to disenfranchise voters and argued against marriage equality in the landmark 2015 obergefell v. hodges case before the supreme court.
we cherish the love that they have between each other.
advertising began with static images, including fliers, billboards, and newspaper and magazine ads. today, it's evolved into a beast with many heads. print and traditional ooh advertising still exist, and they aren't going away anytime soon. but online, new opportunities for dialogue and tailored messaging are exploding every day.
richard spencer sits in the breakfast room of the best western in whitefish with a glob of mustard on his face. he's eating a sandwich from panera — roast beef and gouda. he doesn't notice the mustard and i try not to stare at it. he's talking about voting. he's talking about the death of the right. i let him talk while he eats his sandwich. i don't care about any of those things. i'm just here to find out what he has to say about the allegations in kouprianova's affidavit.
though it's true that austen was the inspiration behind the whole subgenre — the first regency romance novelist, georgette heyer, was emulating austen's work — it has evolved into a well-established genre with its own tropes, conventions and standards.
work on untangling your partner's feelings from your own.
7. they know that you should have pursued therapy a lot sooner.
he'd happened to see beau's name on a list of patients, and he texted linda a photo of the note he left for him: hi, mr. beaupre. it's chadd mowry . . . i came in to check on you and let you know you are in my thoughts and prayers. hang in there. i look forward to talking to you after you beat this virus. you got this!
when your partner is telling you about an issue they're having with a friend, co-worker or relative, your well-intentioned instinct might be to rattle off suggestions about how they could handle the situation. but if your partner just wants you to listen and validate their feelings, your input could backfire. instead, ask upfront what they need from you.
jariwala believes that women in visual professions, such as modeling, can sometimes pay for asserting their individuality. i know fashion models who lost work because they decided to chop their hair. i think this bias is deeply rooted in the idea that long hair hides the 'less attractive' features, like chubby cheeks and an undefined jawline.
with murphy's confirmation, trump has now gotten 34 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two supreme court justices confirmed. trump has gotten so many circuit judges confirmed ― more than any other president by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on the u.s. circuit courts is now filled by a trump nominee. correction: a previous version of the story incorrectly gave murphy's age as 40 and rushing's as 37.
that said, sweden is also a place where bookstores are filled with self-help manuals and where we manically renovate our kitchens but rarely cook; where every fridge is plastered with colorful sticky notes telling us to wake up with a smile! and no carbs after 6 p.m.
i survived a divorce in 2015 with a two-year-old and a four-year-old underfoot and an emotional minefield to wade through.
the blanket consent without a finite and legitimate purpose envisaged by these changes would be contrary to the directions of the supreme court, said prasanna s., a privacy lawyer who argued in the aadhaar case. any state action that impinges on a citizen's privacy, the court said in the puttaswamy judgment, must pass the following test:
be wary of divulging too much personal information about yourself or your relationship to this new friend. ranting about your partner to the other person can create an opening for emotional infidelity.
while i didn't believe in god or mormonism for that time, i also did not have the energy to become anti-mormon and to hate the religion i had grown up in. i had no frame for talking about a life after mormonism that wasn't filled with either hate or debauchery. i also didn't have any pattern for finding a path within mormonism that was different than the typical strict interpretation of the doctrine that i had followed before. i had been told all my life that mormon intellectuals (though i was one) were to be feared. i had stayed away from the very thriving community of thinkers represented by the sunstone symposium (sometimes called sinstone by those who are more rigid in their thinking) who might have helped me.
it's possible to find a middle ground between getting swept up in their feelings and ignoring what they're going through, gupta said.
imagine how diabolically opposed this quest for acceptance is to what we actually need from each other, and how it makes us even more receptive to the notion that happiness is a currency ― one that prospers independent of meaningful conversations, close relationships or a sense of purpose or engagement. believing our well-being is defined in the eyes of others, we keep renovating our already renovated kitchens to prove that we have our shit together, and when we still feel like crap, we make sure to wake up with a smile and stop eating carbs after 6 p.m.
when you've been holding up your end of the bargain, it is enraging to see that others are not doing the same, delawalla added.
in an already crowded field of democrats seeking to challenge president donald trump, several women are among the leading candidates: sens. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), kamala harris (d-calif.) and kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) ― each of whom would bring along a husband to run the east wing of the white house.
i just received my 10-year chip for continual sobriety in slaa, which for me still includes no cheating, no flirting or intriguing outside of my marriage. it means not doing anything i wouldn't like my husband to know about — which, in a nutshell, means having no secrets, because secrets are what kills an addict.
yeah. lauren, you left the room [for that conversation], too...

one major boundary that we've maintained is that he doesn't visit me at work. while some of the other girls have beaus come in, i wouldn't feel comfortable with mine seeing me flirt up other guys. we have visited my club together as patrons and made it rain on my girlfriends.
still, he didn't denounce his participation in the conversion therapy movement, adding, what you can take from this is that my time in a straight marriage and in the 'ex-gay' world was genuine and sincere and a rich blessing to me.
in 2002, timberlake dropped his first solo album, justified. the album included the song cry me a river, which had lyrics about infidelity, and the accompanying video included a spears-lookalike.
17. be best friends first: life can bring many challenges. one of the most wonderful things about marriage and relationships is that you have each other to share your sorrows and joys with. keep your friendship strong by going on date nights together, talk and laugh with each other. when you come from a place of true friendship, nothing will faze you because you will always know that you have each other's back, as well as the strength to overcome any adversity that life may bring.
the couple said they went to counseling and had many painful discussions about the state of their marriage before hillary ultimately decided to stay with bill, a choice she still faces judgement for today.
in a short video posted on her facebook page earlier this month, arnaz, who once endorsed messing for the role, addressed the casting controversy and defended kidman.
all three of the main characters are, we see clearly, ramblers. towards the end of the book, in a clio's notes on a walk in the ramble, she muses maybe that is the point after all? to be lost? clio, smith, and tate are all in their thirties, true adults, and all three reckon with this reality. it's time to make personal and professional decisions, and the questions that clio, smith, and tate face beat through the book like a pulse.
it's important to note that emotional intimacy is a two-way street; your partner should be in sync with your feelings, too.
movies don't need to be sold to us as what we need right now, or ever, to be relevant as art, but it's true that this form of relevance is the way our culture is currently swinging, and it's doubly true that art should strive to be about the world in which it exists, he wrote.
as they mature, they're either going to walk away from that parent, or they're going to finally say something to them.

they were hopeful but warned there was still a long way to go on human rights. which is why they'd moved to the uae.
unfortunately, music videos now reduce most black women to eye candy, and lyrics depict them as objects for pleasure. and in real life, male artists and executives across genres use their power and influence to silence and violate women. as we prepare to celebrate the world of music at sunday's grammy awards, where hip-hop happens to have dominated the nominations in multiple categories, we should ask: when is the industry we love going to collectively acknowledge it's legacy of sexual assault, shame and silence?
kardashian has long struggled to get pregnant as kim, kourtney and now sister kylie have welcomed new additions to the karjenner family.
rushing didn't even have a real confirmation hearing. the senate judiciary committee chairman at the time, chuck grassley (r-iowa), scheduled her hearing last fall when the senate was out of session and few senators were in town. not a single democrat could attend. just two republicans attended, and neither asked tough questions.

i'm hearing people saying, 'they just didn't know how to work in a high-pressure environment,' or 'they couldn't take the high stakes or the tough boss or the tough feedback.' it's incredibly insulting. it's gaslighting, said one of the former klobuchar staffers. it's the kind of thing people tell people who have been abused. it's not abuse, you just didn't live up to the standards, and that's your fault.

one chilly morning last january, twenty-five eighth-graders sat on the floor of a classroom in a brick building in manhattan's chelsea district, shouting at each other. they were playing a game called socratic smackdown, which calls for group of four students to debate the meaning of a particular text in front of their peers.
that's a huge shift for a party whose leaders have spent the last 30 years basking in the glow of the valley's mythology of innovation and entrepreneurship, courting tech titans for their support and campaign contributions. it's a marriage that reached its peak during the presidency of barack obama.
this is definitely not at all how i thought this appointment was going to go, kardashian said at the time. what if i can't get pregnant?
this isn't going to get better on its own, green said. in recent years, the va has significantly reduced suicide among veterans by providing comprehensive screening and follow-up services for patients receiving services from a va medical center. the u.s. could make a similar effort with the queer community.

i'll call this couple t & m, so we don't mention their names. as they walked into my studio for me to present my pitch for why they should choose me as their photographer, t asks for a bathroom break. as she walks away, m says to me, 'this wedding is taking me to the cleaners. our budget is double what it was at the beginning.' money is an important factor in all marriages and often plays a part in why they fail. it was definitely true for this couple. six months after their fabulous wedding with over 150 guests, they separated. ― carlos g. osorio, owner of miami photo in miami, florida

trying to exploit a global pandemic to advance a political career exposes his craven ambition, as does making the same 'i'm running!' announcement at the start of each month, waiting in vain for people to pay attention, he said, referring to hints faulconer has made in recent months about his plans to run.
blaming your partner for not immediately accepting your apology, forgiving you and moving on is unrealistic and unfair. for an apology to be effective, it must be clear that: 1) you accept full responsibility for your actions and inactions; 2) you are sincerely sorry for anything you've done to cause pain and 3) that you want to remedy the situation by giving your partner what they need to feel safe in order to move on and forgive you. not all apologies lead to immediate forgiveness. it may take time. and it may take apologizing more than once. start by asking what your partner needs in order to trust you and feel safe and then do it. ― sheri meyers, marriage and family therapist and author of chatting or cheating: how to detect infidelity, rebuild love and affair-proof your relationship
grant and reeves, 55, first collaborated on the actor's 2011 book ode to happiness. according to actor and friend jennifer tilly, the pair have been quietly dating for several years, though the november gala appeared to be their first red carpet appearance together.
when my opponent walks out onto the court, debbie pipes up: good luck beating that woman. she looks like a real tennis player -- unlike you. and she certainly doesn't have a muffin top hanging over her skirt.
i got such deep satisfaction from spending time with my old friends and made numerous new ones. studies of thousands of people around the world reveal that single people have more robust social networks than their coupled-up counterparts. they are far from alone and do more to maintain relationships. on a whim, i flew from argentina to london to pay my sister a surprise visit and i didn't have to check that a partner could make the trip, too.
before we go any further, let's be clear about something: erika jayne is 100 percent me. she's obviously a stage persona — a larger-than-life, over-the-top stage persona — but she's still, at her heart, me. i think there's a little bit of a showman in all of us, and it's just a matter of whether or not you bring that out of yourself — or allow it to show itself. we're all creative in our own ways, and either that part of you gets nurtured or you ignore it. i know it's a little unusual to rediscover your creative self at 35, and it's definitely even more unusual to still be doing it at 46, but that also makes the success i've had that much sweeter.
don't just give lip service to moving forward; truly and sincerely let it go!
right off the bat, i ask each half of the couple to describe for me and for each other why they reached out and how i can be helpful. the answer often involves excellent insights about what they wish their partner could do differently. then i ask each person if they can describe what they are contributing to the problem. if both people can provide even a modest answer to this question, the couple is well positioned to develop a more fulfilling relationship. i want to see a spark of ownership and awareness. the moment one spouse begins describing their contribution to the problem, a look of warmth and relief often spreads over the other partner's face that transforms the energy in the room. ― elisabeth j. lamotte, a psychotherapist and founder of the dc counseling and psychotherapy center
the world bank has 'assured cooperation', according to a file noting dated june 17, 2019.
your partner taking out the trash
whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. t travis salway, a researcher with the bc centre for disease control in vancouver, has spent the last five years trying to figure out why gay men keep killing themselves. the defining feature of gay men used to be the loneliness of the closet, he says. but now you've got millions of gay men who have come out of the closet and they still feel the same isolation. we're having lunch at a hole-in-the-wall noodle bar. it's november, and he arrives wearing jeans, galoshes and a wedding ring. gay-married, huh? i say. monogamous even, he says. i think they're gonna give us the key to the city. salway grew up in celina, ohio, a rusting factory town of maybe 10,000 people, the kind of place, he says, where marriage competed with college for the 21-year-olds. he got bullied for being gay before he even knew he was. i was effeminate and i was in choir, he says. that was enough. so he got careful. he had a girlfriend through most of high school, and tried to avoid boys—both romantically and platonically—until he could get out of there. by the late 2000s, he was a social worker and epidemiologist and, like me, was struck by the growing distance between his straight and gay friends. he started to wonder if the story he had always heard about gay men and mental health was incomplete.
i slowly came to terms with the fact that a big wedding wouldn't be possible. i still wanted to use my original vendors, as i had already paid a large deposit to secure them for the original date. we received the blessing of our parents to host a smaller ceremony. we still got married on our original date of aug. 8 on our home patio in ottawa using some of our original vendors. it was just us and our closest family for a total of eight people. it was truly a rollercoaster of emotions from being hopeful, to losing hope, to holding onto the original vision of the wedding plans, to finally being ok with a micro-wedding given the circumstances.
complaining about her bad leg--the chronic bone on bone pain--mag has no need to do for herself. she has forty-ish daughter maureen (aisling o'sullivan) to do for her. not uncomplainingly, though. mag buckles under with hatred lodged in her dominated heart.
but his tone was different sunday as he gloated about the enquirer's coverage of bezos. he had nothing to say about the enquirer's total miss on the daniels — and mcdougal — story.
seriously. all we are is a bunch of tired mothers doing the best we can. that's it. that's what it boils down to. and we can't seem to figure out how to measure success in this crazy world of trying to have it together. the emotional climate of parenting we hate, yet continue creating. when is being ok good enough?
we are here to save life, which is precious in god's sight — and we do it all in jesus' name. i hope you will be able to come by for a visit and see for yourself. this is a time for all of us to unite and work together, regardless of our political views. let's support one another during this crisis, and we pray that god will bless the efforts of all those battling this vicious virus.
conversion therapy, sometimes called reparative therapy, refers to attempts to change a person's sexual orientation. the practices can range from talk therapy to electric shock therapy, the ap reports. although this therapy doesn't happen as overtly as it has in the past, varieties of it still persist.
this is the cycle. i ask about the abuse; he tells me there is a greater context. i ask what context justifies the words he's not denying. he insists i'm being unreasonable; i ask again. he tells me he's a victim. he's left her five times. and where is the crime in what he did?
we have all worked extremely hard to keep things as consistent as possible for our children. my husband and my ex-husband's wife have selflessly adopted the same mantra. it's why we all live in the same neighborhood, sit together at sporting events, discuss punishments and try to keep the lines of communication open as much as possible. there have been struggles, bitten tongues and arguments over the years, but our collective job is to raise happy, well-adjusted children. end of story.

she was one of several hundred people who protested friday afternoon outside church headquarters in salt lake city to cap off a week of fury and heartbreak for lgbtq students and their straight allies. they sang hymns and chanted have no fear, god loves queers as they held rainbow flags. they held signs that read love one another, jesus loves everyone and bigotry wrapped in prayer is still bigotry.
corrin previously revealed that her depiction of the princess of wales left her hospitalized after filming a trying scene in a frigid swimming pool that left her with a depleted oxygen level.
the result is they bottle up their feelings and only ever bring up the topic after a night of drinks. the conversation always devolves into an argument, saunders said. they wake up the next day anxious about the fight and that much more uncomfortable with the overall subject so they sweep it under the rug yet again.
5. she wants you to practice work-life balance.
bucknell professor katelyn allers also accused tyson of grabbing her in 2009, and production assistant ashley watson accused him of making unwanted sexual advances over wine and cheese in 2018, patheos also reported.
as i noted earlier, it was during this time that we truly fell in love with each other. but what no one prepares you for is the time when your show starts airing, more and more people begin paying attention to you, and you can't be public about your relationship. this is the period when many reality tv couples break up.
the move was slow. like boiling a frog in water. by the time the frog realizes what's happening, he's holding a tiki torch.
when you're in a monogamous ldr, a wandering eye that you can't seem to control may indicate that you're either not invested in the relationship or that this type of arrangement isn't the right fit for you. (couples in open ldrs, however, may choose to establish ground rules about what's permissible while they're apart.)
you are not responsible for their happiness. - george james, marriage and family therapist
many americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that obama was inaugurated. unfortunately, americans' views of race relations declined after obama came into office. race riots in places such as ferguson, missouri, and baltimore, maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. president obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.

the renunciation of hair is acceptable only when sanctioned by religion or custom, not when it is a political statement or an act of self-love. class and caste readings of hair throw up depressingly predictable themes. for example, when priyanka gandhi, scion to the first family of india's oldest political party, cut her hair, she became the subject of fawning press that likened her look to her grandmother's, the first female prime minister of india.
ultimately, though, ross's desire to educate outweighed her concerns, a mission that has driven dodson throughout her decadeslong career.
streicher recalled a recent patient, a young woman whose problems were so severe that she hadn't been able to consummate her new marriage. she'd visited 14 other doctors about the pain she experienced during intercourse and was being pushed toward talk therapy as a solution.

in response to backlash it received for staver's position on the anti-lynching bill, liberty counsel released a statement thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the onenewsnow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the justice for victims of lynching act would limit the law's application.

because iranian, sudanese and syrian nationality is inherited from one's father rather than determined by one's country of birth, even individuals who have never traveled to any of the four blacklisted countries could lose their visa-free travel privileges, according to the american civil liberties union. the law doesn't bar these individuals from visiting the u.s., but they have to get a visa first -- a more time-intensive process.
when our wounded self has predominated in an important relationship, the sense of loss might be terrifying. if you handed a part of yourself over to the other person to love, define, take care of and validate, then you will feel deeply abandoned when that person ends the relationship or dies. it will feel as if a part of you has been torn away and the feeling of inner emptiness might be extreme. fear, anger, despair and grief become intertwined.
orange city, fla. (ap) — a florida man stole an engagement ring and wedding bands from a girlfriend and used them to propose to another girlfriend, according to authorities.
after that initial spark with ethan, i felt more comfortable really being myself. although committing to him might not have made for the most dramatic storyline, i know that it helped to lay a solid foundation for our future marriage and parenthood.
i was coming out of a messy divorce when i first encountered wayo at a charity event. though we hit it off instantly, i found it strange he kept interrupting me to announce he was on a date. fearing the wine caused him to confuse my cordial friendliness for flirting, i stepped away to talk to another group of people and he followed. again, he announced he was on a date and, since i still hadn't seen this woman, i commented that it's trendy to date ghosts in october. it was dumb, but i didn't care. it was not long before i caught myself smiling while talking to him ― laughing even. in fact, at one point i laughed so hard i accidentally spilled wine all over my shoes and, out of thin air, two beautiful women appeared to wipe up my mess ― that's how i met wayo's date.
the measures advanced on bipartisan votes, 59-35 in the house and 30-9 in the senate as newly empowered democrats continued to advance bills that republicans blocked for years. each chamber still must take up the other's measure in procedural votes before the legislation can be sent to the governor, who supports it, for final approval.

claire: i saw a tweet from critic inkoo kang about how the show captures the perilousness of new york:
what do you most fear will happen if you get angry at your child?
consider talking to a therapist together.
with your first child, you try to do everything to perfection. at the same time, i was at the height of my career. i had just starred on broadway in the original amadeus, which won tony awards, and had done east of eden (for which she won a best actress golden globe) and i had somewhere in time come out all in the same week. weeks later, i announced i was pregnant. nobody in those days did theater, television and film, and the last thing on your mind would be having a baby.
when you're planning for goals together, it's a good idea to segregate that money from the rest of your financial life in a completely separate account. we like using an online bank, which has the added benefit of keeping your savings out of sight, out of mind. you can then set up a monthly or biweekly automatic transfer from your checking into that savings account; and when you hit your goal, spend that money guilt-free. take that trip, or buy the couch!
i feel that marriage is something that needs to really be re-defined in today's modern society.

the blue team is similarly obedient to its leaders, with democrats following their leadership and their most recent president. the appearance of rep. adam schiff (d-calif.) is interesting: he's not in leadership, but he's chairman of the house intelligence committee, where much of the russia investigation action takes place.

at al's wedding, after he has suffocated cassie and burned her body, the aisle is covered in a river of crimson flowers, with a vibrant red ribbon draped across the archway behind the bride and groom. that's to reinforce her death, perry explained.
the people we love deserve to be told how much we appreciate them, as often and as freely as it is easy to complain or nitpick. the people we love deserve the best of us. the people we share our lives with every single day need to at least occasionally be reminded we're here because we chose it.

the arrest and beating inside the thana was payback, but not only for the facebook videos that embarrass the bjp government and raise questions about how the up police were operating on 19 december.
i'd recommend that partners not get too precious about 'my room' and 'your room' by restricting access or locking doors, howes said. this can challenge the trust the relationship was founded on, raise suspicions and cause a partner to feel shut out or rejected.
in the interview, meghan never used the word black to describe herself in any capacity, referring to herself numerous times as mixed race or a woman of color. it's her prerogative to identify as she chooses, but her omission of that word in a conversation that hinged largely on buckingham palace discriminating against her was striking.

the solution: a lot of it has to do with the feelings of security that one brings into the marriage. if you and your spouse are confident in each other and yourselves, then how you look won't make a difference. some of it also depends on your own upbringing. if your parents could weather the storms of deprivation and sacrifice, then it won't be that big a deal when you fight, luiz says. you might enjoy this unsexy phase of the marriage.

but, in the end, the monetary benefits mean less to me than the appreciation this hobby has given me for the kind of marriage i'm in. of all the many hobbies and collections that i pursue, this is the only one that makes others raise an eyebrow ― but not my wife. she loves that this is a hobby i can do from home. she loves that it helps me connect with our kids. she loves that it provides a kind of therapy for my overactive mind. and she loves that it satisfies my obsession with collecting in a way that can actually be profitable, instead of just being costly. more than anything, she loves that i love it. which makes me love her even more for supporting me.

it's all about that kind of love that you find, that kind of connection you find, and it was so helpful for me, she said. just separately — as a fan, not friend — just to be in a place where you're hopeless and then to have a record like that.

and then there were all the beautifully messy contradictions that came up when prince harry joined winfrey and his wife. while meghan dropped the bombshell that someone high up in the royal family apparently had concerns about how dark her child's skin would be, harry refused to name who in the institution had made these comments. this constant back-and-forth between calling out the firm and yet not naming names for fear of damaging reputations was simultaneously understandable and incredibly frustrating.

it's a bad sign when folks who met six months ago get engaged within the first 60 days or so. they're in a rush to get married in a matter of months, because 'they just met their soulmate!' i'm sorry, i just don't get it. how do you know if this person you're marrying pays their bills? how do you know if they are trustworthy? how do you know if they don't have a massive gambling problem? how do you know if you are going to be able to put up with this person for the rest of your life? you just don't. not in that amount of time, at least. my advice would be to enjoy dating the person until you have an idea of who they really are. spend at least a year being engaged and see how you both handle the stress of planning a wedding. ― emily reno, owner of weddings & events by emily in las vegas
in that sense, maybe there's some truth to the idea that only crazy people have voices in their heads. it's got to be pretty close to crazy to live in fear of letting down a person who doesn't even exist.

being happily single is only possible when you've fully recovered from the pain of a previous breakup, something i never let myself do until now. throwing myself into someone else's arms as soon as the sheets were cold was never going to alleviate underlying heartbreak; it's essentially panic buying. not devoting sufficient time to recovery also meant i'd be stepping into any new relationship with unduly low expectations, which is unfair to any new partner.

faulconer spent much of his announcement expressing his outrage that california's public schools were still closed to in-person learning while private ones have been allowed to open, blaming newsom for the decision. but the issue is more complicated than that. public school closures have been largely driven by teachers unions, which don't want their members to return until everyone has been vaccinated. newsom has said that benchmark might not be realistic.

it's a helpful question i use to break down large tasks with many moving parts. whenever there's a work project that is starting to overwhelm me, i take a breath, go for a walk, talk to a friend, make a cup of tea, bake a dessert —activities that i know force me to interact with the world outside of my head and outside of my phone. once i'm in that centered space, i give myself permission to not solve the huge task all at once. that allows me to stay on course with a task instead of going off on detours to my anxiety. then i think about what the next right move is, and the next right move, and proceed more strategically from there.

to stay on top, miranda is hands-on planning each page of runway, keeps abreast of industry knowledge and offloads her rivals to faraway jobs with a smile. she is definitely mean, and she definitely has a limiting, fat-phobic standard of beauty, but you can't deny her decades-long hustle to stay on top.
while staver says that he is generally opposed to lynching (does he really want credit for that low bar?), he and his organization have made it clear with their opposition that they would rather see lgbtq people dead without justice than see them alive and acknowledged as fully human. liberty counsel, which once advocated for kim davis and her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, uses quotes around language like transgender and gay on its website to invalidate the lived identities of people who obviously exist.

but murphy is perhaps best known for defending ohio's notorious voter purge law before the supreme court in 2018, arguing that the state should be able to drop people from its voter rolls if they don't vote for six years and don't respond to a postcard asking them to confirm their address. the court upheld the law in a contentious 5-4 decision, with justice sonia sotomayor writing in her dissent that the law will disproportionately make it harder for minority, low-income, disabled, homeless, and veteran voters to cast a ballot.

there's a way that those kinds of incredibly popular adaptations of austen will make you, i think, expect that you're watching a certain kind of thing, and romance novels are not trying to do the same thing at all, critic aaron bady said in a phone conversation. if you go in watching 'bridgerton' and say, 'i think i'm watching jane austen,' you're going to be disappointed. it feels a little jane austen-y, but it doesn't work like a jane austen novel.

additionally, chick-fil-a has a history of donating millions of dollars a year to anti-lgbtq organizations via its winshape nonprofit organization. since this became public knowledge, many members and allies of the lgbtq community have boycotted chick-fil-a. as huffpost's own noah michelson wrote in an op-ed last year, if you care about queer people ― or you yourself are queer ― you have absolutely no business eating at chick-fil-a. ever. it's really that straightforward.

my parents joined a run-of-the-mill evangelical church, and while i found it preferable to the jws because the services were blessedly less frequent, i remained unconvinced of its beliefs. if the jws could be wrong, so could everyone else. perhaps, if other people's rules were not to be trusted, i should make up my own rules for my own life.
moreover, blithely referencing the content of her first album ignores the fact that kelly helped write those songs, and reducing kelly to an older man in this scenario effectively normalizes his behavior and absolves him of accountability.
granbury is an ordinary town of about 8,000 people southwest of fort worth. cows and llamas graze in nearby pastures. the downtown is centered around a courthouse, surrounded by a few restaurants. fox news plays in the lobby of the holiday inn. though granbury was named for a confederate general, it was hard to imagine a neo-nazi cranking out propaganda for a national audience from this bland little burg.
her finest acting comes when she's exuding control, and when she can use that control to mask a character's vulnerability. think of the out of sight scene when lopez's slick federal marshal has to shoot the criminal (george clooney) she loves. or the moment in selena when she mocks the media's scrutiny by bragging that her diet consists of pepperoni pizza and doritos. like hustlers, those movies understand that lopez's charisma stems from her ability to win anyone over.
my dad, who's less anxious than almost anyone i know and has a healthy distrust of rules and authority, pushed back some, owens said. he trusts science, though, and doctors — especially me and my best friend, who's an infectious disease doctor —and said he'd think about it.

here, we're highlighting exceptional photos from around the world for the week of feb. 25–march 1, 2019. check them out below.
people assume you are a 'junkie' or a 'punk' when they see you with a buzz cut. i think coloring longer hair does not evoke the sort of response that coloring shorter hair does. i remember walking into a very popular bank and the lady at the counter openly mocked me to her colleagues and treated me poorly because of my hair. it got so bad that i had to escalate this to the manager. society, especially women, can be really quick to judge you based on your hair. people also tend to slander a woman's character, and although very subtle, i have personally experienced people thinking i am 'very open,' 'forward thinking.' they have taken the liberty to flirt even when i was clearly not interested.
one example of how a disorganized home can take a toll on a couple's relationship pops up in the first episode of the netflix series tidying up with marie kondo. married couple rachel and kevin friend say that, in addition to money, keeping the house clean is the biggest source of contention in their relationship. as parents of two young kids, laundry, dishes and clutter quickly pile up around them. because they're frustrated and overwhelmed by the disorganization, they nitpick at each other and don't always give the best of themselves to their children.

perhaps the closest the interview came to really divulging the desperate mess that is the royal family was when prince harry explained the symbiotic relationship that exists between the royals and the press, the invisible contract that dictates that as long as the family gives the media access, they will be largely unscathed. control by fear, prince harry called it. if only he and meghan had been able to delve further into that fear, a fear that has existed within the windsor family probably since the abdication, when harry's great-granduncle edward stepped down from the throne in order to marry a stylish american woman and threw the family into tumult.
at the hotel bel air in los angeles opened after the hotel's renovation in 2011, it seems he's shown he's deserving of all that fame. the dishes, which fall under california cuisine with mediterranean influences, looks so fresh, and the setting so stylish yet comfortable. seems apropros.

i tend to be a pleaser. but i just read a book that completely shifted my behavior as a parent. it's called 'get out of my life, but first could you drive me and cheryl to the mall?' by anthony e. wolf. they should hand a copy to every mother when their daughters hit 12. the basic premise is, you do not need to justify your decisions as a parent to your children. your job is to set the boundaries and keep your kids safe. so now, when my daughter says, 'why, mom? it's not fair!' my smile just gets bigger and more beatific, but i don't budge and i don't explain. i might say, 'i know it's not fair,' but that's all. otherwise, you watch your status and your usefulness as a parent disappear. there's a voice inside children that knows right from wrong. i call it listening to your inner jiminy cricket. i tell my daughter, 'if you're thinking this is not the best idea, it probably isn't.'
now, don't go mourning your old marriage for too long. luiz adds that this doesn't have to be the norm. if you and your spouse both can stay the course, communicate openly, and be willing to ride out the storms when they hit, then you'll be okay. in fact, you might just decide to do it all again. in any case, here are some common relationship issues new parents face and how to keep them from spiraling out of control.

once my husband was up in the morning, he'd take the baby and i'd let myself sleep for a couple of hours. i would dream that my baby died and wake up in a panic, never wanting to sleep again. i would spend my days in a room power-pumping, breastfeeding and breaking down crying every time my baby made a noise. in spite of my efforts, i wasn't producing enough milk. i was devastated.

through open, honest, transparent communication, matt and luanne have chosen to accept the truth of matt's same-sex attraction – him a little more easily, her a little more painfully. leaning into their relationship built on love, respect, support and brutal honesty, they're now, in their own words, trying to do this well. the this well being, creating an environment for themselves and their children where the family thrives rather than survives as their marriage unravels – she as a single, pained and saddened heterosexual mother, he as a single, excited yet sorrowful, gay father.

i was dating regularly, if you could call it that. mostly i was sabotaging every chance at a relationship i could find. i was nostalgic for a time when you could meet someone in a bookstore, in line for a concert, at the grocery store reaching for the same apple. texting with strangers through dating apps was fun and flirty, but until our knees brushed under the table i couldn't decide how i felt.
after a miscarriage, the emotional reaction from parents ranges anywhere from ambivalence to anger to complete despair, said misty richards, program director for the ucla semel institute's child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship. often times, this manifests in bouts of crying, wanting to be alone, and quiet moments of reflection that can be witnessed by a child. rather than hide this emotional response, help your child understand what they are seeing by naming the emotion ― 'mommy was crying a little bit because i am sad about the baby.'
when val's mother gets stuck in traffic and albert decides to fill the role himself, the birdcage borrows one of the oldest, most reliable comedy tropes: mistaken identity. seeing albert arrive at dinner in a barbara bush-style wig surprises us as much as it does armand and val. one might deem it shakespearean. but the farce extends beyond cross-dressing. lane is caricaturing the sort of prim conservative whose vote keeley would have courted. keeley is so enamored with her that he's convinced she's a scorned housewife disgraced by a pretentious husband, not realizing he is describing his own marriage. aristotle onassis was just like this, he hisses to his wife (dianne wiest, a stealth mvp), referring to armand.

as a marriage therapist i reach to see if there was a time in the relationship when the two people were truly connected and had an intimate bond that we can hopefully restore. usually, the tension softens as couples tell me about their courtship and the qualities that drew them to each other. when a couple is so entrenched in a negative space that they have difficulty recalling a special time in their relationship, resolution is less likely. ― linda lipshutz, a marriage and family therapist in palm beach gardens, florida

ferry is a veteran prop master — the person responsible for all the stuff seen in any given frame — whose first credit was the 1975 comedy sixpack annie. she says she's worked with food more and more frequently over the years, including on movies such as ed wood, how the grinch stole christmas and memoirs of a geisha. like with any full-time food stylist or prop master, sometimes that work is front and center, à la the memorable chocolate cake scene in matilda, which took roughly three weeks to shoot and required approximately 20 cakes. (it didn't help that jimmy karz, the young actor playing bruce bogtrotter, disliked chocolate.) other times, it's more like ornamentation, one of many meticulous but barely noticed aesthetic touches.

listen, weddings are how i make a living so telling couples not to dish out cash for their wedding is sort of unwise on my part. however, i do believe spending money you don't have and going into debt over your wedding before starting a life as a married couple is extremely risky. ― reno
then, try the positive sandwich method of bringing up a touchy subject, gerst said.
when nik was packing for d.c. he actually asked me whether he should bring jordans or stick to dress shoes, she tweeted. i didn't know which js he was considering, and apparently i was in a jolly mood so i said 'do what makes you happy.' he never followed up either way. anyway what a great day.
googling habits support these estimates. searches for pregnancy-related terms like ultrasound clearblue pregnancy test and morning sickness all fell in 2020, according to one study.
pop culture has always been a product and reflection of the world around us, whether that was the artist's intention or not. the best movies — and the best art in general — help us see the world in a new way, crystallize something we hadn't fully seen before, connect the past with the present and the specific with the universal. but overemphasizing a film's relevance or inserting real-life parallels when they aren't there isn't that.

not that i don't think, 'oh, this will never happen to me,' but lamar was so great at making me feel like i was the only one and i'm this princess, i never speculated cheating, said the 31-year-old author and reality tv star. so i didn't know about cheating until ... before the dui.
i may have just a few more complaints but i share my attorney wife's perspective on marriage. i also love hearing about how badly couples behave (no names, of course!) in court, marvel at how generous her clients can occasionally be with their estranged spouses in the name of their children, and often think how lucky i am to be in a solid marriage. i also know that i would be screwed if i tried to divorce her because she is the only person i would want to represent me in court.
samuel pinho camargo, 26, was arrested for battery in 2016 after he intentionally caused bodily harm to his sister, according to a police report. the report states that camargo broke a door off its hinges and attacked his sister. both the sister and a witness told police that camargo has a history of anger issues and a history of him hitting them and leaving bruises.
when we got married, we had seemingly perfect couples tell us we were doomed because we were doing it wrong. i even had a close friend tell me my marriage wasn't a marriage at all because it didn't fit into his narrow view of what one should be like. never mind he's been married four times; he acted as if our choice somehow personally insulted him. ironically, many of these couples are no longer together. many of them have dealt with strings of affairs while others live in perpetual misery by continuing to lie to each other, the world and themselves. that's not to say that traditional relationships can't or don't work. of course they do! but we know what works for us and, though wayo and i sometimes fight and we have tough times ― just like any two or more humans trying to make a relationship work do ― but we're still happily creating our ever-after four years later.
sorry, but what do you want for dinner? and did you pick up avery from gymnastics? does not qualify as quality communication. technology makes it easier to connect, but a few hastily sent texts throughout the day can't stand in for quality conversation at the end of the night, howes said.
roses and lisianthus and black-eyed susans. it was all so beautiful and romantic, and for a moment i let down my guard, and was overwhelmed with joy. stace was standing in the middle of bridge, in the middle of nowhere, for no other reason than that she knew it would make me happy. it felt so safe.

on the other hand, many couples in a mixed orientation marriage bravely join forces, standing tall in love, vowing to get support for overcoming the wicked temptation of same-sex attraction. prayer, therapy, retreats, hard work, and tear-stained conversations litter the landscape of a marriage in defense mode, all in the name of make it work, just make it work! however, even the most resolute attempts to stay afloat in the life ring of until death do us part, find many couples surrendering to the truth that fixing the same-sex attraction, or fixing it enough, as matt the husband your about to meet said in his tedx talk, isn't going to happen. to quell the truth of a spouse embittered in their own internal tug of war with who they are vs. who the rest of the world expects them to be, is practically a death sentence in and of itself.

at the capitol, lawmakers were dumbstruck over the day's fast-breaking developments, with democratic sen. barbara favola saying, i have to take a breath and think about this. this is moving way too quickly. gop house majority leader todd gilbert said it would be reckless to comment. there's just too much flying around, he said.
the academy overlooked pitt's performances for more than a decade after his first nomination until 2009′s the curious case of benjamin button, but he lost to sean penn for best performance by an actor in a leading role. in 2012, he received dual nominations for starring in and producing the baseball drama moneyball before finally taking home a trophy for the steve mcqueen-directed drama two years later. pitt's sixth oscar nomination came from producing the big short, which was nominated in 2016 for best picture but ultimately lost out to spotlight.
this is really a historical moment — whoever thought that anything like this would happen and that we were at the top of the list to be able to get this vaccine and get on with life as we knew it? she wondered in disbelief. even with all the bad, i just feel that life is going to be so much sweeter when this is all behind us. i think we're going to have so much more appreciation for life and for each other.

there will be times when your partner's phone runs out of battery or they fall asleep and forget to respond to a text, leslie said. trusting your partner is key to long-distance relationships. without trust, your brain will likely go to a lot of 'what if' questions. trust leads to feeling more at peace in a long-distance relationship.

when she coughed, i could feel the eyes upon us immediately. the furtive glances pushed me upright in my seat, ready to defend her if i had to. i was sitting right beside her, but even with her coloring in my features, my irish father's genes made me separate. and in that moment, being white-passing felt like letting her down when she needed me most.

it's bittersweet, for sure. you get comfortable in the role that you've been in for so long, and then you give them a pair of car keys and you're lucky if you even get a text. it happens pretty quickly, let me tell you. it's very unceremonious, that switchover, but i'll certainly miss her.

people grow, people evolve, people become different things than they were when they were in their 20's or 30's or 40's. a lot of the times when some people are married, one partner grows and the other one stays stagnant.
the one day, a friend of hers who was teaching a class on human sexuality came across a small blurb in her textbook on endometriosis, a condition in which the uterine lining that usually grows inside the uterus begins to grow outside the organ, rooting itself onto ovaries, fallopian tubes, the colon, and other surfaces in the pelvic region. then, during a woman's menstrual cycle, the lining begins to shed, causing severe cramping and pain.
i was in full-blown paranoia by the time i arrived at the hospital. in my mind, all of the white people i saw in the lobby, sitting at desks and on the elevator were just a pickup truck ride away from a cross burning and lynching. at that moment, walking into the icu to meet a white man on his deathbed felt like both the stupidest and the bravest thing i'd ever done.

score 1-10 as an instagram husband: 7/10 ― jonathan is a fairly private person, but he seems pretty game to show up for photos with his wife and kids (theodore ignatius and henry nelson). these insta appearances are especially frequent during the holidays, like christmas, thanksgiving and halloween, or on special occasions, like sen. gillibrand's birthday.
a couple months later, at the end of a spectacularly difficult week, stace insisted we take the day off and go for a road trip. she was swamped at work, but she told me i needed a break, and refused to take no for an answer. she packed the car with coffee and fruit and the little bags of popcorn i usually put in the kids' lunches. she drove me to the middle of the state to see the bridge of flowers, a garden bridge suspended like magic above a river.
with the advertising industry in a state of perennial disruption and viewers experiencing content on more screens than ever before, it's time that advertisers rethink the age-old 15- and 30-second spots. traditional television businesses have taken up that banner: nbc ran live commercials during its hairspray broadcast. turner is running half the commercials in originals on tnt in 2017. but that's only part of the story.

it is good to remind ourselves that celebrities are normal people facing the same basic human emotions and struggles that everyone else does, especially if you find your emotional responses to events in their lives seeming a bit disproportionate, she told huffpost. these are normal people who experience the same emotions as everyone else, but generally speaking with a much larger bank account with which to live their glamorous lives.

calls for brown to run were quickly amplified after he easily won re-election in 2018, dispatching then-gop rep. jim renacci by a nearly 7-percentage-point margin. brown was the only democrat to win statewide in ohio, a onetime presidential swing state where trump romped in 2016.
kansas is among at least eight states where lawmakers are considering such a measure. at least seven states are considering proposals to restrict transgender students' participation in sports, a measure that was introduced in the kansas house last year but died without getting a hearing. lawmakers in montana and south carolina are considering both ideas.

after a brief stop in gondar, the 17th century capital of ethiopia, noted for its medieval style castles, royal intrigue and history, we took a short flight further north to lalibella. this is where the familiar gets really weird. by familiar i mean christian religious practice and ceremony. as a jew my familiarity with christian ceremony is mostly secondhand though i have attended my share of christian weddings, including catholic and orthodox; i have even been best man at a couple. so christian ceremony is not that strange to me, but what i witnessed and experienced in lalibella was way off my cognitive grid.
congresswoman tulsi gabbard of hawaii, once touted as a progressive rising star who threw her support behind bernie sanders in 2016, announced that she's running for the democratic presidential nomination over the weekend.
that's the expectation, land said, but the reality is, a connection must be nurtured and developed, and you probably won't get a full scope or idea of a person's true character ― which is what you should be looking for in a person if you're serious about being in a committed relationship ― after one or two hours together.
even after monday's ruling, marriages officiated by reform and conservative rabbis in israel aren't recognized by the rabbinate ― and since israel doesn't have an option for civil marriages, liberal-leaning jewish couples often have to get married outside of the country.
i've heard all kinds of approaches. what usually seems to work best is the truth, kessler said. say something along the lines of, 'my family and i have always discussed and agreed that if i or my brother ever got married, we would sign a prenup,' or, 'my best friend went through a horrible divorce and all he can remember from it is his lawyer saying, 'if only you had signed a prenuptial agreement.'

probably the breastfeeding. before i had the baby, everyone was like, are you going to breastfeed? and i was like, yeah, if the milk comes in. i had no idea how challenging it was going to be. i seriously thought the milk comes in, you put the baby on the boob, and it just sucks and you feed the baby. i thought it was as simple as that. i didn't realize pumping was a situation, i didn't realize the pain you would go through, i didn't realize the time commitment, i had no idea it was going to be as challenging as it was.
i think every single person i knew called me in the first week of november, and that's fascinating, she said. but the question i've been asking in all of this is: 'what is the opportunity for good?'
the fix: if you're just waiting around for the perfect distraction-free window to arise, you could be waiting quite a while. the key is to be intentional about setting aside the time, even if it's just 10 minutes a day.
but having given it the multicultural world, she went on, i'm really looking forward to what they do with that moment. with marina, a young mixed-race debutante who gets pregnant out of wedlock and needs to enter a marriage of convenience, she sees possible groundwork being laid for a more subversive kind of story than the conventional, white regency romance.
garrett: i was intrigued by it. my stepmother had gone to psychics for years, and i was fascinated by stories she relayed to me. she was told very specific factual details about her life during some of these readings that the psychic could not possibly have known beforehand. i knew there had to be something to it.
kidman did, however, admit in a 2007 vanity fair interview that she was secretly engaged at one point, though didn't reveal the fiancé's name. the engagement didn't result in marriage, she said, because it just wasn't right. i wasn't ready. we weren't ready.

one common example: one partner might be ready to get married or have kids. but since the couple has never talked about their future together, it seems too delicate a subject to broach.
our relationships have blossomed during this time, for which i am profoundly grateful, mcdermott said.
it's a bad sign when i'm photographing the couple and one of them overcompensates for the lack of interest from the other person. maybe they have looked through hundreds of online photos and want their wedding images to look exactly like their pinterest boards. unfortunately, they didn't consider their relationship dynamics in their 'vision.' sometimes, they just lack the natural chemistry and emotional connection. too often, the focus is on having a great image to share on social media. the couples are less concerned with letting the photographer capture the love that's naturally there. it's tough to see a couple so obviously disconnected. ― gretchen wakeman, a wedding photographer in scottsdale, arizona
respondents reported smaller increases in fathers monitoring kids at school, reading, talking and listening to them, and physical care.
i am a huge believer in choice ― whatever anyone wants to do to feel confident. we should all have more options as to what beauty is, she said. there are billions of us.
it's hard. in terms of our romantic relationship and as partners in life, it's amazing. how we are different complements each other. when it comes to working, it's a little bit challenging. we obviously did not get into a marriage to then also work with each other, but because he knows how to operate a camera and edit as a producer, it was very natural that he fell into the role for this.
his decision not to run will come as a relief to other senate democrats – and not just because many of his colleagues are running for president. had brown won the presidency, gop ohio gov. mike dewine would've selected a republican to replace him in congress' upper chamber. (this also makes it less likely the eventual democratic candidate will select brown as their vice presidential nominee.)
cast members jamie bell and kata mara met while on the film and are now engaged, a rep for the actress confirmed to e! on friday.
scholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the u.s. capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of christian nationalism. before storming the capitol, some groups prayed in the name of jesus and asked for divine protection. they flew christian and jesus 2020 flags and pointed to trump's presidency as the will of god. the linkage between christian beliefs and the violent attack on congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with trump and their support for the rioters.

they describe my body in rudely intimate terms: the navel, the mons veneris, the armpits, the bones along the skin of the neck...the life of the pores, of the hairs along the shin-bone, of the veining of the pulse, and the liquid moisture on the upper lip... lucent unfathomable eyes, the gesture of chaste and impassioned surrender. it's the scandal that drew them. they're not after the art. i am his mistress. it's not a stranger's body they're describing, but mine. how could i not have seen this coming? i should have known. what was i thinking?
the other source of relationship tension is inside you. it is the self-doubt that has developed over a lifetime of compounding experiences of betrayal, abuse, and neglect.

during lockdown, i created an online sharing circle for mothers and also attended other virtual spaces for myself, von lob said. we all need community, a sense of belonging and somewhere where we can let go of the masks, and be vulnerable and authentic. i found it so helpful to have a supportive, safe space where i could share my struggles, challenges and all the highs and lows of living through a pandemic. listening to others always helped me to feel less alone and reminded me of how connected we all are.
be honest, i thought. i wanted to represent my sexuality truthfully. i was tall and statuesque, so people wanted to cast me as a domme, but i was submissive. i only accepted work if it represented who i was, not what people wished i were. it paid off. after being turned down for submissive roles early on, i discovered that by publishing reviews of shoots i'd enjoyed, producers who subsequently booked me would know more about the things i liked and could do well.
beyond lyrics and in the real world, industry heavyweights like rapper, producer and business executive dr. dre can still have a lucrative career after admitting to physically abusing women. in 1991, dre physically attacked pump it up host dee barnes, who alleged that he threw her down a flight of stairs, slammed her head against a wall, kicked her and stomped on her fingers. dr. dre told rolling stone shortly after the incident, it ain't no big thing – i just threw her through a door, while his groupmate eazy-e cosigned: bitch deserved it.

faulconer and other challengers with their eyes set on a recall election have the benefit of a california electorate that's increasingly critical of newsom. he's now contending with voters who are angry about business shutdowns, voters who are angry about the recent reopenings amid high case counts and voters from both of those groups who are angry about the stalled covid-19 vaccine rollout. his legacy also continues to be haunted by an ill-fated trip he took to the french laundry restaurant late last year when coronavirus cases were increasing.

for two decades, i have been begging people to stop playing this man's music. stop purchasing tickets to his shows. stop acting like he isn't to blame for every single relationship he's had with an underage girl.
shawnee custalow the two said the decision to cancel their original wedding was difficult but ultimately the right choice.
kouprianova and i discuss her complicity and her relationship. she says she now denounces his ideology. but only as the visit was ending did i think to ask about my complicity — the media's complicity in making spencer who he is, in enabling all of this. after all, if kouprianova deserves to be implicated in spencer's actions because she enabled him, what does the media deserve? what do i deserve?
every now and then, there were ads that referenced a movie's relevance, trying to convey that it was about something serious and important. the dark knight: this is the zeitgeist movie. doubt: a movie that is actually about something. but most of these kinds of narratives were applied to movies with more overt political and social themes, such as documentaries, political thrillers and biopics.
in his post, josh weed wrote that this conservative religious approach toward queer sexuality was both cruel and dangerous. he said the church's stance can fill queer mormons with self-loathing and internalized homophobia.
working on the crown was the most magical experience in no small part thanks to the incredible cast and crew that supported and help guide me through thank you, she wrote on instagram at the time.
self-awareness is defined as knowing self well, but put in the context of divorce, i think it means having the courage to look in the mirror and say, hey, a lot of this (or all) was my fault. that is something i rarely hear from any men or women getting divorced, and so many refuse to take any accountability for the split.
the couple, who are now parents to daughters sunday and faith, celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in june. these days, urban is undeniably smitten with his wife.
democrats have expressed fear that the uproar over the governor could jeopardize their chances of taking control of the gop-dominated virginia legislature this year. the party made big gains in 2017, in part because of a backlash against president donald trump, and has moved to within striking distance of a majority in both houses.
as a swede, i agree our winters are dreary, and tax days can be pretty bitter. but to solve this, we need to dig deeper than that.

nor is period romance merely a form of realist period fiction. in her review of the show, patricia matthew, an associate professor of english at montclair state university, placed it in a long artistic tradition of black women depicted in regency settings. but ultimately, she said in a phone interview, nobody's reading julia quinn because they're looking for disquisitions on historical precedent.
now we can only hope our relationships are as loving as the one between bon jovi and hurley — or jessica and louis.
there's an upside, though. at the time, that was considered a plus because your movie was getting publicity in advance of the eventual release, he said. that was sort of the pre-instagram way of taking advantage of celebrity to create awareness for your movie.

the appeal of the quest to learn curriculum is similar to that of a well-designed game: it requires participation and interaction, and there's immediate feedback. challenge is a constant, and learning is achieved as much through failure as through success. ross flatt, a former assistant principal at quest to learn and one of its founding teachers, said the kids who thrive at quest are often the ones who don't mind making mistakes. imagination and play are important, but the real key is collaboration and a desire to be challenged in a way that sometimes isn't possible in other school environments. (the school has an advisory program for new students, to help them—and their parents—understand how the school operates. it consists of sample missions and quests.) teachers too, need to be onboard. we look for teachers who are okay with letting go of absolute control, flatt said. who can command respect while allowing the students to explore things beyond what's written down. and who don't mind going on tangents.
i'd been divorced for about a year when alison and i met and started dating. i proposed a few months later. my friends asked me, why are you getting married again? and to a family law attorney!? so i explained, 'this will guarantee that it will last. it has to!' all kidding aside, divorce attorneys are participants in the end of a chapter -– the death of a relationship. but if they're like alison, they are also witness to the beginning of a new chapter -– a rebirth of sorts. guiding people through the divorce process creates wisdom if you're open and paying attention. alison pays attention. she brings the wisdom she's learned to our relationship. i love her more today than the day we were married over 18 years ago.
the light then completely shone on me, he said.
first up, let's take a look at the twitter accounts most likely to be followed by house republicans. the most followed accounts are directly related to their work, with the gop leadership and recently departed speaker paul ryan at the top of the table. according to our data, not everyone in the house follows president donald trump.
the nuclear scientist, also known as fidelito, or little fidel, because of how much he looked like his father, had initially been hospitalized and then continued treatment as an outpatient.
[this week's nominees] may lack life experience and will be serving many years after trump … enjoying life tenure on the 'supreme courts' for their regions because the supreme court hears so few cases, said carl tobias, a university of richmond law professor and an expert in judicial nominations. many are also being confirmed on extremely close votes and some on party-line votes with insufficiently rigorous vetting.

sometimes people have sex because they don't feel good enough. because they lack self-worth, the singer said in an interview with the magazine that features the couple on the cover of its march issue. women do that, and guys do that.

they're absolutely atrocious with communication, beyatte said. it's a nightmare.
this was fennell's vision from the moment she sat down to write the movie. she wanted color, as well as songs like stars are blind and boys, to create a cohesive irony. cassie, in fennell's eyes, is a spiritual descendent of the murderous weather girl nicole kidman portrays in the delicious 1995 satire to die for. and the movie as a whole takes cues from the virgin suicides, which coats its gloom in a dreamy guise. a lot of nasty things happen in beautiful places, fennell said. this is a movie about appearances being deceptive. in that sense, promising young woman parallels the hbo series i may destroy you, which also depicts the aftermath of sexual assault, using surrealism and bold fashion to capture its heroine's mindset.
as an art teacher, i suspect [pence] is aware of that, she said.
associated press ed rowe, left, rebecca wilson, robin hager and jill zundel, react to the defeat of a proposal that would allow lgbt clergy and same-sex marriage within the united methodist church at the denomination's 2019 special session of the general conference in st. louis on feb. 26, 2019. america's second-largest protestant denomination faces a likely fracture as delegates at the crucial meeting move to strengthen bans on same-sex marriage and ordination of lgbt clergy.
citing her late mother's advice, she tells clarkson things happen for a reason. she also says her divorce freed her to meet joe biden and have a family with him.
the 58-year-old attorney is a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn't tell senators about her extreme comments on the topic.
there is a supreme moment of destiny calling on your life. your job is to feel that, to hear that, to know that. and sometimes when you're not listening, you get taken off track. you get in the wrong marriage, the wrong relationship, you take the wrong job, but it's all leading to the same path. there are no wrong paths. there are none. there is no such thing as failure really, because failure is just that thing trying to move you in another direction. so you get as much from your losses as you do from your victories, because the losses are there to wake you up.
pleasure is about self-love and independent orgasms, dodson told huffpost. once a woman is orgasmic, she's dangerous because she can't be kept down. she's in her power. i'm an old feminist warhorse who never thought we'd see a vulva and an orgasm on any screen, let alone netflix. fuck me, it feels wonderful.
but democrats and progressive groups aren't just alarmed by the number of trump's picks sailing through. many of these nominees have spent their careers attacking lgbtq rights, abortion rights and voting rights, and now they're on their way to holding lifetime seats on federal courts.
pomeranz tells them ― or any other client who brings this issue up ― that who we are attracted to in the real world is often different from the idealized version that we seek online.
as pato, rea has a masculine sincerity about him. he's especially effective sitting in a square of light at the act-two beginning reciting the crucial letter he sends brother ray to put directly into maureen's hands. monaghan's ray starts many of his lines with a high, breaking voice that then settles in a moderate range. it's only one contributing factor to his kimberley-loving, easily-gulled-by-mag performance.
i feel that after 30 years, looking back on brown v. the board of education, it has made an impact in all facets of life for minorities throughout the land, brown said during the interview. i really think of it in terms of what it has done for our young people, in taking away that feeling of second class citizenship. i think it has made the dreams, hopes and aspirations of our young people greater, today.

maybe they experienced the polio epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s. or maybe your grandpa was born just a few years after the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 675,000 americans among a staggering 20 million to 50 million people globally.
while some people feel their s.o.'s student debt is not their responsibility, we remind them that over the course of their relationship, they will benefit from the higher income that their s.o. may obtain because of that debt. (by virtue of being more marketable.) so, if one person can help their s.o. pay down that debt even faster, both can start working toward other, more fun goals much more quickly.
best guess at the cause he'd choose as first gentleman: as a business consultant, perhaps he could focus on pushing comprehensive financial education for young people.

it's a brand new year, which means we will all face brand new challenges. but before you decide to bury your head in defeat, here are five ways to win in 2016 from a biblical perspective.
spencer's father is a doctor in the dallas area. his mother, sherry, is a socialite and artist whose home on big mountain in whitefish, montana, is full of tiles she painted herself. kouprianova, an artist and photographer, got along with sherry, who had one of her own mother's rings resized as the engagement ring. it's a beautiful large diamond in the middle of an art deco setting.
ultimately, however, smith doesn't ask those questions. the same year smith's vibe story was published, la times reporter cheo h. coker profiled kelly in a piece titled media shy, music savvy: r. kelly ― a writer, producer and singer with the midas touch. at one point coker describes kelly's demeanor as drained, as if the weight of the world is on his shoulders, almost as if questioning kelly was subjecting him to unjust suffering. even after smith opened the doors to discussing kelly's past, reporters were still hesitant to press the celebrity on what appeared to be his documented marriage to an underage girl, fearing they'd lose access to him.
in the screwball thriller parker (2013), lopez brought comedic relief and demonstrated the texture of her charisma. (this may be lopez's most appealing screen performance since she traded barbs with george clooney in steven soderbergh's 'out of sight,' the hollywood reporter raved.) she delivered a committed, delightful performance in the schlocky the boy next door (2015), which targeted latinx audiences by hiring step up breakout ryan guzman, a process she was deeply involved with, according to casting director nancy nayor. for the crime twister lila & eve (2015), co-starring viola davis, she secured a part that once had director charles stone iii eyeing charlize theron, cate blanchett, julianne moore and robin wright.
i had been sexual with very few people, and i couldn't undo what had already happened, said mann. it was at that point, mann said, she decided to be in a relationship with weinstein. that first alleged assault was the beginning of a four-year relationship between mann and weinstein, which included both consensual and non-consensual sex acts, she testified. weinstein allegedly raped mann twice during this period.
clearly prepping for his next role of instagram boyfriend, affleck even stopped to take photos of de armas before they continued to walk barefoot on the sand.
ryan and i got to be alone and have our time to soak in the moment, laugh, cry and for me to process through the shock! she told huffpost in an email. if we were in public, i probably wouldn't have felt as comfortable if people were around or watching.
i can't even imagine because even with the bachelor, it's like three to four months of secrecy. that seems like a long time.
ideally in any healthy relationship, people can feel safe enough to talk directly about anger openly to increase the chances their emotional needs will be understood and met by others, land said. developing this type of healthy assertiveness can be healing not only in close relationships, but can also provide the energy and motivation necessary for healthy forms of advocacy and social change.
she will have witnessed me second guess myself, then strike a power pose and fire on. she was there the moment i realised my own value, charged accordingly and changed our lives.
the boy's father and brother both survived. aj did not.
i recommend that you two see a couples counselor as well as a financial planner. a therapist can help with the resentment that is creeping up on both sides, and explore how financial issues lead to emotional disconnect. a therapist can also help you explore how each of you grew up financially, which may be impacting your different ideas about how much money should be spent on the kids and the home. a financial planner can help you figure out what exactly you need to spend and to save, as well as how to budget. (for instance, buying multiple elves on shelves may not be the most financially sound choice when you have less than $5 in your bank account. one elf can do the job.)
earlier this month, a hong kong court ruled that married same-sex couples have the right to apply for public housing.
consider what you can do to help make her life easier, whether it's helping to coordinate carpools, bulk-cooking on sunday evenings or proactively caring for her and the kids on the weekends, she said. take an active interest in what they are learning in school. anything helps.
in fact, bring up the subject when you are still dating, meyer said. that way, you can gauge your partner's reaction to one. if the reaction is to move to the other room, then you know you will need to handle with extra sensitivity.

kids of divorce treat relationships with the gravity they deserve. we not only want love to be successful ― we'll do everything we can to make it happen. that includes not settling, staying open and working through our own issues to make sure we're approaching our unions in the healthiest possible way.
based in provo, utah, byu is owned by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds). to attend, students must abide by an honor code that prohibits homosexual behavior. the princeton review ranks byu as the second-most lgbtq-unfriendly college in the u.s.
what i discovered, to my disappointment, was that even with my mad skills as a professional therapist, i was at a loss to facilitate a healthy relationship between michael and myself. a month after we adopted him, i had an ectopic pregnancy. a few months after that, we lost our home to the raging winds and rising waters of hurricane andrew in homestead, florida. it could have heralded the end of the marriage, but we pulled together.

5. they assure you they're looking for long-term love, but most of their relationships were short-lived.
despite receiving multiple such warnings, kalapura has soldiered on.
the windsors are obsessed with the survival of the monarchy, largely because generation after generation, the existence of a monarchy built on colonization and conquest becomes more and more tenuous. and yet, rather than adapting, changing, perhaps even holding themselves accountable as an institution, the royal family remains under the impression that maintaining a good relationship with the media (and the public) is more important than its individual members' happiness and certainly more important than meaningful change in regards to rectifying the harm the family as an institution has made, particularly to its so-called commonwealth.
fourteen years after the character first appeared on screen, miranda priestly from the devil wears prada is still on our minds.
two indiana women said a local tax service refused to do their returns because they are a married couple.
i can live openly now as a gay man because of the extraordinary, brave people who had the courage to fight for our rights when i did not: community activists, leaders, and ordinary lgbt folks, the 38-year-old wrote in the post, which also touched on his christian upbringing and ascent into the political sphere. i recognize this even in the face of the intense and sometimes vicious criticism that i've received from these same people.
and of course, plenty of couples have gone ahead with their pregnancy plans, along with resuming fertility treatments that many put on hold (or were forced to put on hold) earlier on in the crisis.
the two have known each other for 11 years are raising a 7-year-old and a two-month-old together.
early on i noticed a trend with the discipline delinquents. after a few sessions, a large percentage of adults still couldn't get their kids to change no matter how hard they tried.
my sister had already graduated from high school and as i sat down at our kitchen table, i was relieved she'd slept in late that day. i was planning my escape to the bus stop before any awkward encounter with her when i heard the creak of the stairs. my stomach knotted as she appeared at the doorway and sleepily shuffled past me. she looked exactly the same. i had thought the hormones my mom said she started taking might instantly transform her.
india's safeguards for state surveillance have always been weak. but this near-complete orwellian surveillance would overturn the balance of power between citizens and the state, arun said. it may be safe to say that if the state manages successfully to watch us so closely, india's democracy will gradually become unrecognisable.
høly all the letter designs that make it happen.
the saving grace was getting trained in the back to basics parenting model.
when david and i met, i was certain i was done having kids. i felt lucky to have two healthy, happy children and had mentally moved on from the baby phase. the experience of having a child from birth was really important to my husband. we decided to leave it to fate and i got pregnant six weeks later (insert shock and awe). now that gavin is here, i cannot imagine life before he existed. he has completed our family. watching the relationship our three kids have developed is inspiring.

she said harry was proud to have served in the british armed forces for 10 years in her majesty's name and has maintained active links with those forces ever since and will continue to do so in the future.
ultimately, imperatori-lee said, she thinks most american catholics see biden as a devout catholic, doing his best for his country and his world, trying to advance the common good in a pluralistic society.
on saturday, november 6, 2016 matt and luanne bravely, both in their own unique way, took the stage at tedx sonoma county to share their story, their journey, and their truth -- a truth that demonstrates with respect, support, honesty, and a deep dive into forgiveness and understanding that both of them are trying to navigate the waters of unraveling a marriage of deception and lies, with dignity and love.
establishing a schedule offers a sense of routine and normalcy. you can also shake it up and move things around if your pandemic schedule starts to feel monotonous.
i was sitting on the couch with my husband when a reply popped up: what a coincidence! i just finished that book. i saw the name on the twitter account, gasped and threw my phone onto the couch. i checked the profile several times ― in shock to hear from james in this way after all of these years ― and i wondered what he wanted.
prior to tying the knot, the two revealed to vogue that they didn't engage in pre-marital sex. bieber said he had a legitimate problem with sex.
not everyone will understand your decision to sleep in separate bedrooms, and that's ok. some people are envious, while others seem confused and say we just seem like roommates, kimberly said.
today, the birdcage holds a knotty place in the queer canon. its plot, however witty, is dated. a happy couple going back into the closet to impress a bigoted politician (gene hackman) whose daughter barbara (calista flockhart) is engaged to their unlikable son val (dan futterman) doesn't pass 2021's progressivism test. some activists, like the writer bruce bawer, who called the movie cruel and heterosexist, didn't even think it passed 1996's test. but it's more thoughtful than bawer gave it credit for. (glaad agreed, praising the film's depth and humanity. larry kramer liked it, too.) last year's holiday comedy happiest season, which employed a similar concept, suggests that code-switching is still a reality, no matter how far lgbtq equality has come.
i always think as women, especially, we're trained ― alicia (keys) and i were talking about earlier ― to take it all on and you deal with it and you're fine, but it's your babies that you worry about.

before we both know it, she'll have to reminded she was once my little big girl.
but in spite of these facts, you might decide that you're up for the challenge that comes with a second marriage. however, it's key to pause and examine what went wrong in your first marriage – and create a vision for a successful second one.
it's going to take some time to get in a sexy frame of mind. to get there, new york city sex therapist megan fleming recommends reminiscing about a really hot sex experience from your past.
i was thrilled to read an advance copy of my friend aidan donnelley rowley's the ramblers, and i'm even more delighted to jump on the table in support of this book.
while emphasizing that he's generally in favor of banning lynching, staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts.

this can become so intense that it produces empathic distress in [you] and in the long run could lead to burnout and withdrawal, social neuroscientist tania singer said in an interview with the cognitive neuroscience society.
watkins recently said in an interview that her aim in creating a story about characters living in an apocalyptic wasteland was to make them self-aware -- almost worn tired of the whole dystopia cliche. she achieves that with luz dunn and her partner-in-everything ray, who while away their days in an abandoned la mansion before they meet a child who changes all that. faced with the task of keeping a living thing safe, they set out on a journey through the expansive and expanding desert -- and meet some shady characters along the way.
however, her mom was in on the prank and faked a call to 911, which gave the signal to steele ― and a few of his firefighter buddies ― to ride to the rescue in full gear, according to swns.com.
seriously, though, my boyfriend doesn't mind dating a stripper. unlike the legions of guys who fetishized my occupation during the courting period, he never brought it up.

and i completely agree! new york is terrifying. but i was surprised that my biggest big-city phobia, the subway tracks, was not represented. how did nadia and alan not die even a single time by being shoved on the subway tracks? in my imagination, this is how most new yorkers die.
people are very opinionated about my bump, she wrote on twitter. i choose to cradle my bump because it's mine. i've waited for this very short moment for years. i have only months to enjoy this phase in my life, so i will touch my bump and love my bump as often as i choose.

explain the reasons for your celibacy and how you expect it to affect any potential relationship.
i had to let go of my brothers and sisters, which is by far the most difficult decision i have ever made in my life. as soon as i got the phone call about losing access to my siblings, i began writing on my blog about my parents' abuse. the best evidence i have to back up the abuse claims i detailed in those blog posts came from my dad's attempt to save face. the day after the first post, he released a podcast in which he blamed my delusions on mental illness and left the microphone open for my siblings to respond to what i had written. my dad deleted the podcast within hours. i reported my parents to local authorities for child abuse, as did my therapist. i don't know whether an investigation was conducted, but the following year, six of my siblings were enrolled at the local charter school, and today the eight youngest are in school.
most likely domestic household initiative he'll take on: as someone who offered his wife a newly installed and organized hallway closet for their anniversary, mann would likely be a good steward of the white house's interior decor. combined with his affinity for u.s. history, he may choose to switch up some of the busts and portraits in the storied halls, and may enjoy giving white house tours to visiting students.

your purpose as a business owner and a human being, is bigger than your marriage or the loyalty of one customer. if you happen to lose one or both. it is critical that you don't lose sight of your purpose.
it's 2019. if we all do something big or small to eliminate bad behavior this year, we'll help make the world a better place.
only by recognizing what the real emotion is behind the anger can there be more honest communication and heart opening. forgiveness meditation can be very helpful here, as it not only invites us to witness anger but also to make friends with it. meditation may not be a cure-all; it may not make all our challenges go away or suddenly transform our weaknesses into strengths, but it does enable us to rest in an inclusive acceptance of who we are. this does not make us perfect, simply more fully human.
dunlap, 27, said yes, and then attempted to hug her in the inflatable outfit.
i think that's a blessing in itself. anytime you go through some life, it's such an awesome thing to have that outlet, regardless of whether people hear it or not.
i've been separated for about a year. there are challenges, but sleeping alone isn't one of them. i always desired more space in my marriage ― which is, in part, why i decided to leave it. for a long time, i wondered if i'd ever have the strength. i wondered if it would be too devastating for my kids, who are now 4 and 9. i worried about whether i'd be able to support myself financially. friends gave me phone numbers for couples therapists, and we saw them. three, in fact.
come 2002, after the internet-defining versace dress and a short-lived marriage to backup dancer cris judd, lopez's movie career tried to take the julia roberts route. maid in manhattan looked a lot like pretty woman, and enough was a cousin of sleeping with the enemy. both were modest box-office hits. then gigli happened.
the solution in such disputes is to dig a little deeper and figure out the underlying issues. set mutual goals for your finances and determine the best route to reaching them.

in another classy move, before his tribute to the former joker great, phoenix highlighted how his fellow nominees had inspired him throughout his career.
if the birdcage were made today, its refusal to let albert be as peacockish as he pleases wouldn't sit well. ditto the hilarious hank azaria playing a swishy guatemalan houseboy. but even if its ideas weren't all radical, its cultural footprint was. queerness had thrived in indie filmmaking thanks to directors like todd haynes, gus van sant and cheryl dunye, but rarely had it made such a dent in mainstream multiplexes — and almost never with a happy conclusion. the following year, in & out, starring kevin kline, would be a modest box-office hit. three years later, will & grace won the emmys' top comedy prize. shortly thereafter, queer as folk, buffy the vampire slayer, queer eye for the straight guy, brokeback mountain and transamerica helped the country grasp more of the nuances of queer life. along the way, marriage equality and anti-discrimination initiatives started to become realities.

when asked why he would ever take that risk and jeopardize his family's future, bill explains he never thought of his extramarital relationship with lewinsky in that way. nobody sits down and thinks, 'i think i'll take a really irresponsible risk. it's bad for my family, bad for my country, bad for the people who work with me.' that's not what happens. it's you feel like you're staggering around, you've been in a 15-round prize fight that's been extended to 30 rounds and here's someone who will take your mind off it for a while.

it can be helpful for parents to have the discussion together with their child so that partners can feel supported by one another and if one partner becomes flooded with emotion, the other partner can take over the discussion, stuempfig said. it's okay for a child to see parents grieve, but it is important that parents are emotionally available to the child during the conversation and not so overcome with their own emotion that they are unable to attend to their child.
soon enough your school days will be longer and our time apart will stretch out farther. in a few years even when you're home, you'll be distracted by friends, homework, or your own interests. and so it will begin. your flight into the world with your own wings.
the first song i remember being truly obsessed with was stewart's do ya think i'm sexy when i was 7. my mom used to wear daisy dukes and dr. scholl's and when we would go driving in her red 442 cutlass, i would bounce in the passenger seat while we sang that song back and forth to each other as she drove.
my mom sounded offended by my question. why would she need to know about that? it would only cause problems.
juno star elliot page filed for divorce tuesday from emma portner after three years of marriage, entertainment tonight reported, citing court records it obtained.
we could try to take all questions about our relationship off the table for the rest of our lives, and just be incredibly boring, or we could sort of open the kimono — as they say — and allow people to see what our marriage is like, bell told e's daily pop last year.
when you consider the chaos, uncertainty and instability of the last year, your frustrations with other people (and the state of the world) are completely understandable.
4. follow jesus: it seems simple, but it really isn't. following jesus doesn't mean that you simply know him. it means that you know him intimately. it means that your heart is in sync with his heart. it means that you obey him, you trust him, and that you allow him to lead you, even when you do not understand the journey. you will never go wrong by following the one who will never lose his power, credibility or popularity. allow him to be your spiritual navigation system as you learn to discern his voice. let his word be a light unto your feet and a lamp unto your path. do not worry about making unplanned or unexpected detours. god has a way of getting you back on his divine path. and when the road gets hard and lonely, he promises to never leave you or forsake you. when you feel too weary to continue the journey, let him carry you. trust in him with all your heart, do not lean on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge him and watch him make your paths straight.
the more i listened, the more i began to heal. i started looking at myself more positively, understanding that i was not a terrible person, a bad partner, a breaker of people and relationships. it was as if by learning about james' transformation, i was experiencing my own kind of transformation.
all told, bloomberg spent $8.9 million supporting rouda, sherrill and stevens — nearly a quarter of his total spending in the midterms.
if a partner cheated on me emotionally, it would be worse than if she did so physically. i'd be unable to forgive her, and our relationship would be forever broken. we're all human, and it's natural to become interested in other people, but my sense of trust and fidelity would be crushed if a partner engaged with another woman in an emotionally intimate way, including kissing, texting or whatsapping. ― julia zelg, lifestyle vlogger
i have held wedding ceremonies in which i have married myself. i take myself on dates. i have no fear of going anywhere alone. movies, dinner, concerts, walks in the park ― all things i would love to do while holding hands with a significant other. i have written cards and poems to give to this person.

2. fear not: we are commanded numerous times in the bible to fear not. in john 16:33, jesus warns that trials and tribulations will come, but to be of good cheer. why? because he has overcome the world. we live in a fallen world, where it can be easy to give in to fear and panic. but do not be moved. go ahead and start that new business venture. give love another chance. go back to school if that is what you desire. do not allow the what ifs to hold you hostage. live your best life in 2016, with no regrets. when challenging circumstances arise and try to paralyze you, stand on this promise from isaiah 41:10: fear not, for i am with you. be not dismayed. for i am your god. i will strengthen you, i will help you, and i will uphold you with my righteous right hand. that means whatever you face in 2016, god will be there with you every step of the way. he will protect you, give you peace and will calm your heart in the midst of the storm.

regardless of the scenario, whether it's a man or a woman hiding their secret, at some point, the pain of pretending to be someone they're not becomes greater than the transparent truth of living and being who they're meant to be.
week by week, many christians in political power seem to try to one-up the bigotry and oppression of their colleagues. it's the now-proverbial hold-my-beer ideology, with those christians vying to be the most powerful and, by consequence, the most oppressive and violent. the sad reality is that significant elements of christianity in the united states are entrenched in political power, on sundays teaching that jesus loves everybody but then moralizing people out of the gospel that they say is free.
my client has the right to the constitutional protection of the law and that has been infringed as a result of the dpa, pettingill said on monday. he seeks to render the dpa void for contradicting bermuda's constitution, which guarantees freedom from discrimination.

one day, i got an invitation to a show from a woman i knew who was also married to a lawyer and i thought it was interesting that we were in such similar situations, but even more interesting to me was that at the bottom of the invitation was the name of the show's director and he happened to be a friend of mine from high school. so i called him up and i said, what are you doing? and he said, no, more importantly, what are you doing? i said, nothing — except shopping and going to dinner. and he said, i think it's about time you started creating again, and that's how erika jayne was born. from there, it was just about me putting one foot in front of the other, and it's taken me where i am today.

it can be as simple as taking a regular chore, such as walking the dog, and turning it also into an opportunity to also spend some time together as a couple connecting with each other, smith said. this is one of the things my wife and i do.
with work, kids and other life obligations pulling us in a million different directions, it's hard for couples to find time to spend together by themselves.
we do, we get over that. it's not that big of a deal, but yes, it works. also for him to be on the other side of the camera, it gets the most raw, real version of me. if there was just a producer talking to me on the other end, you wouldn't get the same answers. it's nice that i can really feel comfortable being brutally honest because it's only him in the room.
here we have two exes supporting each other, there's not one winner and one loser, it's so platonic, she said. their connection reminds us that even when things don't end the way you were expecting them to, you can still have a happy ending in other ways. in true hollywood fashion, we all love a happy ending, perhaps that why we can't get enough of these two. 
to try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of hawaii, she said. as democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.

the secc's decade-long mutation, from a foundational census to ostensibly efficiently deliver benefits to the poor into an mass-surveillance system, reveals how the indian government is rapidly building surveillance infrastructure under the guise of poverty alleviation and how organisations like the world bank are happy to offer advice to developing countries building intrusive systems that may not pass muster in places like europe.

fennell sent carey mulligan the playlist, alongside a mood board full of bright colors, while courting her for the lead role. she also gave it to the movie's production designer, michael perry, who had worked on the tv show sweet valley high, one of fennell's key influences, and would be responsible for the film's aesthetics. most vitally, she dispatched music supervisor susan jacobs to secure the rights to hilton's ditty before shooting began. other songs could be replaced during the editing if needed, but again: this one was more important than all the others.
i actually have faith that partners will step it up once we take this problem more seriously, she said. we can stop enabling the inequality by taking more seriously how pernicious it can become. most people would understand why someone might freak out over cheating or a pattern of hurtful detachment. we need to lean in to calling out toxic patterns of unequal labor as well.

communicate your needs directly to those who are in your inner circle, and do the same in return. ask them what they need or want most, and try to help them with attaining that if you can, she said. research shows that even when we feel sad and down, helping others can help boost our mood and increase meaningfulness in our lives, and also make us feel better about ourselves.

on the sunday morning of our wedding, i finally found the right words to express what i felt. i realized i wanted to tell them that i had been watching them, observing quietly and learning from the way their relationship grew through the years. under a canopy of lush red florals, i told the story of my parents' whirlwind romance: how they met during a typhoon, married after three months of dating and moved to a new country together. i shared that they were not college-educated but had forged fulfilling careers for themselves in dallas, where my father runs the city's leading chinese newspaper and my mother found her calling as a professional bridal seamstress.
the best way to protect yourself and each other from a potential breakup if you're not married is to have a cohabitation agreement, where you decide in advance how your property and debts will be split between the two of you if you break up, cochran said. a cohabitation agreement won't supersede the law when it comes to ownership of debts, but it can help facilitate a more civilized discussion about how the two of you will handle them.

lgbtq couples do have other options for their wedding search. sites such as love inc., rainbow wedding network and pridezillas promise listings of vendors that support marriage equality. if couples want to go beyond those listings (something that might be necessary for people who live in smaller towns, for instance), love inc. founder brittny drye shared some tips on the knot for sussing out whether a vendor is open to serving them. she recommended looking at photos of past client weddings, browsing their social media accounts for clues, and searching for gender-inclusive language on their site.
sitting down in the uncomfortable metal chairs, my inner dialogue was running rampant and my ego was out of control. these people are nothing like me. what if someone recognizes me? look, i know, i'm not famous by any means, but sometimes i have been asked for an autograph before. i have been on television a lot.

i ran after her and tapped her on the shoulder. i hope you don't think i'm a stalker, i said. i just want to introduce myself and tell you that i worship the ground you walk on. as those stalkerish sentences came out of my mouth, i had second thoughts about approaching this writer/actress/icon. why would a woman who was best known for playing a role in a series of blockbuster movies in which she who wore a bikini of a golden variety want anything to do with me?
i find music has the capacity to change my mood in an instant, so if i was feeling a bit down, i would put on uplifting spotify playlists and dance around the living room with my daughter, von lob said.

i didn't want to talk about it. she tried to remind me how we'd promised to always tell each other the truth, but i had been working so hard for the past couple years to stay protected. i wanted to say something mean, something like, where will you live when we break up? but i knew i was just searching for a way to push her away.

futura, paparounis told huffpost in an email, had become something like an obsession during his graphic designer studies. when he was tasked with creating a typeface as a class assignment, he found himself examining two caribbean cockroaches he was using for an illustration class. inspired by the antennae and thorns on their feet, he garnished the futura framework with rounded spurs and swooping ligatures.
there are many logistical factors keeping session lengths around this time frame, rather than a full hour.
when a woman gets married, her last name changes. in order to promote a single family unit, carry on the american tradition, and show allegiance to your husband, women change their names. it's a very nice sentiment and certainly one i will not criticize -- every woman is entitled to her choice. however, since this is the most widely accepted behavior, i will not spend time promoting nor defending this tradition -- society and my uber conventional family forcefully advocate this tradition enough.
i know! i know what you're thinking. but if you're even mildly interested in both subjects, bear with me. (i hope it goes without saying but, to be perfectly clear, i don't think the stakes of the bachelor are as high as those of the democratic presidential nomination process.)
after hearing enough of her complaints about their minor imperfections, her therapist finally said after she expressed annoyance about one such man, there you go again. he was saying that she was finding flimsy excuses to reject men who threatened to be good marriage candidates. she was trying to head them off at the pass. by remaining single she would be safe from experiencing what she most feared: another marriage failure.

for me, it was just, 'what song, if somebody knew every word to, would you fall more in love with them?' what's the song that you'd be like, 'ugh, you know every lyric to that? ok, you're marriage material,' fennell told me during a recent zoom conversation. i think in another movie, it might've been like, 'you know that indie deep cut of that band that only existed in the '70s?' who cares about that? who cares about the velvet underground? i want to know who knows every line of 'stars are blind.'

our situation is a little different: i'm a full-time divorce attorney. my wife does divorce work, but it is a minority of her practice. we apply what we learn from our practices to our relationship and it helps steer us on the right track. and i think, as we transition from what divorce lawyers call a short-term marriage to a medium-length marriage (we have been married seven years), we are still on strong footing. much of it is thanks to her!
claire: despite all the comparisons russian doll inevitably evokes, i have to say it's like nothing i've ever seen before. the title suggested a cold war-era spy thriller starring natalie portman; the premise is reminiscent of groundhog day, happy deathday or, unfortunately, the netflix rom-com when we first met. instead, it was a mesmerizingly original dramedy with a digital steampunk flavor and a warm heart. i'm still processing it!

while the reversal in bermuda is the first of its kind, we cannot assume that what happened here is an isolated case. to the contrary, bermuda's backtracking sheds a light on where marriage equality stands globally, and where it is headed. simply put, lgbtiq people and our allies should be prepared for the long haul if we want to spread and protect marriage rights.

living four hours apart would never be possible if either wayo or i had pretended to be ok with it when one of us was truly not ok. thankfully, we were both brutally honest with our expectations, wants and needs from the very beginning. it's also crucial that neither of us is jealous or has trust issues. i think the fact we were both in our 40s when we met allowed us to explore, know ourselves and understand what we want more than perhaps if we'd met when we were younger.
marriage therapist jennifer chappell marsh hasn't been single in roughly 10 years. to put that in perspective, tinder wouldn't be created for another two years. the online dating app landscape was considerably different back then, with sites like okcupid and match.com appealing to some daters, but certainly not the masses.

my sexuality is as much a working part of my personality as my wit. it doesn't lie dormant in an underwear drawer, waiting for my lover to get into the mood. i express it openly and profit off it because that feels natural to me. it doesn't take away from the well of deep intimacy that my partner and i share. the sexuality i sell is surface-level, not the shared trust of two people in love, walking hand-in-hand through hardship.

how many of us mourn the one who got away? we fantasize about what a lifetime would have looked like with that person. here's the reality: maybe it would have been pretty frickin' great or perhaps you dodged a bullet. best case, it would have been like any other functional marriage: a combination of sweet moments, blow-ups, rising and falling passions, quiet rages, and differences of opinion that may never be reconciled.

historical romance does a different kind of work than historical fiction, sarah maclean, a popular historical romance author, told me during a phone call. the work of the romance novel is not to tell the story of the past. it is to hold a mirror to the present.
both my husband and i are balancing our push toward radical open-mindedness with a mitigating dose of risk management. covid-19 exposure and testing are now a part of the conversations we have with potential partners about their sti history. we try to coordinate dates at someone's house rather than at restaurants or bars, and we've focused most recently on seeing just one or two regular partners, bringing them into our quaranteam, so to speak, rather than further expanding our bubbles.
one of the most obvious red flags is lack of compromise for even the most trivial of details. sadly, i have so many examples of the frustration this can cause. on one occasion, i had a bride change half of the music directly with the band instead of going with the list that the groom had compiled with her help. the groom was so upset thinking the band had played the wrong song for their first dance, he walked off the dance floor to yell at the vendor. this, of course, ruined the moment and the photos. it was only then that he realized his wife had gone behind his back to make those changes. it just goes to show how important listening and allowing for flexibility is ― you'll have to make compromises in your marriage, too. ― regina young, owner at meant2be events in scottsdale, arizona
i'm so grateful for every bit of it -- my own pain in the earliest days of discovering something that felt like a knife's edge, the itchy pain of being alone and figuring out what it all meant after the dust settled, and even the hardest pain of watching this season happen in the lives of the couple who was always my fixed center point and likely always will be.

after months of study and practicing on my close friends, i was able to successfully read a palm. i could tell how many significant relationships one would have in their life, how much they would travel, what kind of musical talent they had, if they were free-spirited or if they were workaholics, if they had any business sense and whether they had been arrested. i understoodwhat the different bumps, lines, curves and lengths of the fingers meant.

firstly, my life truly exceeds my expectations every day. i didn't think i'd ever earn money for myself, have a bank account, own a home, fall in love, get married. i was told i'd stop aging when armageddon came and i'd be a teenager forever. growing up ― and growing older ― comes with inconveniences, illnesses and fears. but they're also privileges of a sort, as is the whole human experience, complete with joy, grief and challenges to overcome.

at one point, my husband said he was worried about me, and my sister told me i should talk to someone. but at my six-week checkup appointment, when the doctor asked what the most surprising thing about motherhood was, i looked down, embarrassed i didn't have a better answer, and quietly said, the overwhelming anxiety. i wasn't expecting that. he smiled and told me it was normal. but it didn't feel normal. i wanted to scream and cry and beg him to help me. i wanted to tell him i couldn't be a mother. i wanted to tell him my baby was going to die. instead, i smiled back and told myself that maybe this is how it felt. that maybe others just never shared that with me. that just maybe i would carry this pain, tightening in my chest and shortness of breath the rest of my life. i remember thinking it couldn't be possible to live like that forever.
before emerald fennell started writing promising young woman, she made a playlist. it included playful pop confections (britney spears' toxic, charli xcx's boys), dance anthems (it's raining men) and broadway standards (something wonderful from the king and i). but one track was more important than all the others: paris hilton's stars are blind. by the time fennell finished the script, hilton's 2006 debut single had made its way into a pivotal scene, with 30-year-old protagonist cassie thomas relinquishing her austerity as she and her sweet new beau, ryan, lip-sync the song in a convenience store.
many therapists utilize 45 minutes, rather than 50, to extend the break between sessions, or to schedule back-to-back sessions on the hour and half-hour marks.
4. your partner isn't willing to work through problems in the relationship.
trump, sekulow's star client, has faced similar legal questions. trump agreed to pay $2 million as part of a settlement with the state of new york in which he was forced to admit he misused charitable funds from the donald j. trump foundation to promote his 2016 presidential campaign, pay off business debts and buy a $10,000 portrait of himself hung at one of his florida resorts. trump's charity also cut an illegal $25,000 check to support the reelection of then-florida attorney general pam bondi, who now works with sekulow as a member of the president's defense team.
i recall one couple where the wife, a writer, felt like she couldn't concentrate on her work unless the kitchen was clean and the laundry folded, while her husband said he worked best when his desk was a disaster and the garage was 'in process,' psychologist ryan howes said. this conflict in styles and needs certainly contributes to interpersonal distress.
vaibhav maheshwari, the spokesperson for the aam aadmi party in up, said there were two reasons for jafar's arrest. her name, he said. and the absolute power given to the up police.
over the past two months, since the coronavirus outbreak began making news, i've scrolled past countless articles with click-bait headlines and commentary that perpetuate stereotypes and prejudices against asian people and set off xenophobic alarm bells. the posts are being shared widely by strangers, but also by people i know. my outward appearance and father's last name perhaps make it easy for them to forget that my family is chinese.
cameron: yeah, we talked about how we would raise kids together and sort of have similar family values. we talked about spirituality; we talked about family life ...
the bill has faced opposition from christian groups which slammed the proposed jail term.
it really doesn't make much difference what profession my wife is in. she's a strong woman and i like that. it's true that sometimes when we're talking, she hits me with her 'lawyer's logic.' our discussions get broken down into points and sub-points with supporting evidence. when she flips into lawyer-mode, it can feel like you're in a court room. but, i know who she is inside. her profession is not the primary thing in our marriage.

keeping therapy sessions under an hour may also motivate both parties to make the best of the time allotted.
i went to see the psychotherapist because i wanted help with how to facilitate a new normal in my marriage. i chose her because she said on her website that she had a background in women's studies, did couples and family therapy, and understood that clients live in social contexts that impact the choices they make. i thought that these ingredients would help her understand the subtle power issues i was trying to navigate. power issues that involve examining the deeper issue of what it means to be female in a world where men's voices and men's needs still dominate.
then there is the tale of tyler sash, a 27 year old from iowa whose life spiraled out of control after being released by the new york giants. he had experienced five concussions during his brief career in the nfl, a career which also included a super bowl appearance.
while the gses are under the control of the government, we're making a plea to the regulator to use deeper cover mortgage insurance (the proven method of credit risk transfer), to protect the taxpayer and benefit the homeowner as well. almost two thirds of taxpayers are homeowners. why should they be ok with the government experimenting with their tax dollars to benefit the government controlled gses? how about benefiting the taxpayer homeowner instead?
international banks and law firms operating in the asian financial hub have been keen to see visa rules for people in same-sex relationships eased to help attract global talent. thailand could become the first asian country to legally recognize same-sex couples under a bill that would allow civil partnerships.
i believe we're all better off in the long run, but i often can't get through the day without feeling bad that what broke my family was me needing something different. if i'd kept my mouth shut, found a way to be content in my life as it was, no one else would have suffered. my husband wouldn't have gone through all of the struggles he has dealt with over the past year. my kids wouldn't have to go back and forth between houses.
occasionally i see couples where one partner refuses to hang out with the other partner's friends, or belittles them, looks down on them or is otherwise unpleasant toward these friends. this creates a troubling imbalance in the relationship, where one person becomes the arbiter of who's 'in' and who's 'out.' it also implies a sense of superiority on the part of the partner who pronounces him/herself as the judge of high-quality friends. ― begel
the conventional wisdom says that most latin american migrants who come to the united states are looking for a better life, inspired by the american dream. and it's hard to deny that there's a lot of truth in that. <br> <br> but there's another side to the story. people leave latin america because life there can be very hard. poverty, political instability and recurring financial crises often conspire to make latin american life more challenging than in the u.s., a wealthy country with lots of job opportunities. <br> <br> living on the northern side of the u.s.-mexico border, it's easy to view latin america as another world, isolated from the united states. but the truth is that the u.s. government has historically made life in latin america harder by overthrowing democratically elected governments, financing atrocities and pushing trade policies that undermine latin american industries, dealing blows to local economies. perhaps instead of building walls, the united states should focus on being a better neighbor. <br> <br> <strong>here are 19 ways the u.s. government has helped spur immigration by making life harder in latin america.</strong>

my mind works at warp speed, and i communicate for a living. my husband is a methodical thinker and a high introvert. just imagine our conversations! once i learned that his silence meant he was thinking and processing, and not ignoring me, i learned to stay quiet and wait, instead of adding more information, asking questions, or changing topics.
i think some people are naturally immune to the panic even though they are not immune to covid19, said shane g. owens, a psychologist and the assistant director of campus mental health at farmingdale state college (suny).
i'm not the first person to say it -- it's expensive out there. during these challenging financial times we live in, when a coffee on the run can cost you anywhere from $2.00 to $7.00, how do we as parents, ever expect to be able to the cut the financial umbilical cord with our kids?

limbaugh's radio career was also one long exercise in misogyny, perhaps best summed up by his thesis that feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society.

for years the nfl stonewalled research and denied football's culpability in such tragedies, borrowing a page from the playbook of the tobacco industry in ferociously defending their dangerous product. that story is currently being told in the feature film concussion starring will smith.
i'm sort of toying with the theory that chemistry is bullshit or it's not what we think it is, waterston said. when a script is really well-written and there's tension built in the structure of a scene, it creates the electricity that we feel when we watch two people on screen.
for more than a decade, married... with children was a satirical ― and intentionally crude ― counterpart to squeaky-clean sitcoms like who's the boss? and full house. as controversial as it was for its time, however, the fox series also offered a progressive take on same-sex marriage well before it became the law of the land in the u.s.

negendank's intense curiosity and her husband's indifference highlights an interesting divide: when it comes to other people's body count, interest levels vary. if you are intrigued and want to know, there's nothing wrong with casually bringing it up like negendank did. it's quite a different story if you take the question seriously and get judgmental about your s.o.'s response.

there's an important distinction between developing comfort with anger on the one hand and, on the other hand, acting out aggressively or violently, land said. ironically, it is often the case that being more aware of and comfortable with our angry feelings can actually reduce the chances that it ends up leaking out in impulsive, hurtful ways.
five years ago, he said, he believed that a gay person could choose to live the life of a straight person. but now he knows that isn't possible without serious consequences to mental health.

i also loved how the show turned new york into a rube goldberg machine of possible death traps. it was a fun play on the sometimes overwhelming, threatening feeling of being in the city to see every step, subway station and elevator transformed into a deadly weapon.
you say you're helping out as much as you can, but what does that mean, exactly? are you offering to cook (and are they healthy meals)? are you doing the laundry without asking? do you know what an arabesque is or how to braid your daughter's hair? i hate it when husbands talk about helping out around the house as if they're being heroic by lending a hand.
the news clip, a brief entry in neil rubin's names & faces column, epitomizes the way many mainstream media publications in the 1990s and early aughts addressed the then-rumored marriage between r. kelly and aaliyah. rubin doesn't express particular concern about the alleged union of a grown man and a girl under the age of legal consent; despite being a journalist, he doesn't attempt to confirm or deny the persistent speculation.

for decades, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints taught that queer people could be cured of same-sex attractions. more recently, the church has denounced conversion therapy and the idea that homosexuality is a sin. however, it still maintains that same-sex relationships are sinful and that mormons in those relationships are apostates. lgbtq members who want to remain in good standing with the church are expected to either commit to a lifetime of celibacy or marry partners of the opposite sex.

in 1990, a lot of tv shows were struggling with the right way to talk about marriage equality. some shows treated it like a big joke, but others went out of their way to show that same-sex couples are totally normal, he says. it's wild that 'married... with children' was one of them.

indiana's rfra allows business owners to cite their faith as a defense when sued by a private party, meaning they can legally discriminate against lgbtq people.
i first learned how to read palms using my own palm despite the inherent bias of doing so. to make matters more difficult, reading my own palm is difficult because i am ambidextrous. your dominant hand is what informs your future while your less dominant hand informs your past (or what you were born with). when you're ambidextrous, it's hard to tell which side is more prevalent.

i'm not saying larry's not an aggressive hothead at times, he's an old air force fighter pilot. that's sort of the character of those people, lister said, adding that brock can be verbally caustic. he has a tendency to let his mouth run away from him. but it's not different than any other political group, say a trump supporter or a [black lives matter] advocate. they let their mouths run away from them and say stuff they shouldn't say. they say stuff that's just not true. ... but free speech, right?

many refused to believe i could genuinely be happy without the prospect of love; you'll always invite criticism when you start to question societal norms. did i sniff pity? most certainly. i also spent a lot of time fending off questions about when i would finally bake a cake in my womb oven.
of course, you're probably wondering how this all works since my husband lives a solid four-hour drive north from where i reside. right now we are both where we need to be to thrive in our careers. we have never actually had a conversation on the nuts and bolts of how our relationship would work, we've just been winging it. and so far, we're still flying together through blue skies, storm fronts and everything in between.

one reason many couples choose to solve or deal with marital problems is because they don't want to go through the turmoil of breaking up their family and divvying up community property. if you don't share children and significant assets, there's less incentive to try to make second marriages work. and if a stepparent has never bonded with stepchildren, there's less guilt for splitting up a blended family that never felt blended ― in fact, it might even feel like a relief for all parties. divorce is not as scary as it was the first time around. it's now the 'devil you know:' if you've been through it once before, you know you can do it again. ― virginia gilbert, a marriage and family therapist based in los angeles

after discussing my concerns with my husband, i was not surprised to receive his support. although i was not asking his permission to keep my name, it was important that he understood where i was coming from. hyphenating my name was also not the right choice for me, as this was still changing my name and my identity.
when they went public with their story in 2012, josh weed said that he and his wife had very little exposure to gay people. but not long after their post went viral, they began to receive messages from queer mormons about how the weeds' mixed-orientation marriage had been used as an impossible standard.
but the affidavit that kouprianova filed, alleging abuse, is public. the judge refused to seal the divorce records, citing the public's right to know. so, what can the public know from this mess of personal pain, tragedy and loss? why should anyone care that someone like spencer is accused of beating his wife?
my guy, your wife is a woman in america. she's probably fully aware she's gained weight, no matter how depressed she is (not to mention that depression and weight gain often go hand-in-hand). i'm curious as to whether you're more concerned about her physical health or mental health. you describe yourselves as a normally fit and healthy couple, so my guess is her weight gain has become an issue for your relationship. i get it: sex and attraction are extremely important in a marriage. but i'll be honest: it sounds like this might be more about you than her.
around the same time, the hollywood trades were littered with the corpses of failed j.lo projects. any actor's career is a combination of talent, timing, wise decision-making and sheer luck, and lopez's missed opportunities tell us a lot about the career she hoped to design. she was considered for kate beckinsale's role in serendipity, according to producer simon fields. she developed a modern take on the opera carmen, an adaptation of the latina friendship novel dirty girls club and a movie about a psychiatrist who treats superheroes. none of those manifested; one even resulted in a lawsuit. lopez turned down unfaithful, which netted diane lane an oscar nod. she lost at least two gigs to angelina jolie: first, paramount thought of her for 2003's lara croft: tomb raider, and secondly, she reportedly exited a prestigious frida kahlo biopic to pursue the lead in 2004's taking lives. (that role will be the most challenging thing i'm sure i'll ever do, lopez had said of kahlo.) she was also supposed to make a big-band musical with nicole kidman and a live-action carmen sandiego.

i'm in shock, pirro said. i went to bed last night having read the list assuming i wasn't getting a pardon. it certainly is a nice act on the part of the president. it has been 20 years since i served my time and it allows me to engage again in public companies which i haven't been able to do previously.
spotting a narcissist in the early stages of dating isn't as easy as you'd think, which is why so many people end up in relationships with them.
four months ago, i never would have imagined that i could feel truly happy when my husband had a nice date with another woman, just as he now has the capacity to feel happy for me when i enjoy time with other men. we talk frankly about our experiences, about what worked and what didn't, and though at times there's still jealousy, we have an emotional toolkit to work through it healthfully.
when couples are sexless, it is almost always the case that they are touch-less and kiss-less as well. what i like about kissing is that it activates the same pleasure centers in the brain as sexual activity. in fact, it is one of the most important sensual activities for intimacy and closeness. kissing can be highly arousing and our mouths are underrated sex organs.
though higgins said she doesn't necessarily have a solution for this issue, she sometimes wishes her clients would adopt a two or three date minimum before ruling out a promising match completely.

but not always. in the beauty queen of leenane, one of martin mcdonagh's earliest plays--perhaps the first, but that's uncertain--he introduces a terrifying mother-daughter pairing (the toughest in theater annals?). now the participants' high-voltage family fracas is on scandalizing display in an immaculate revival at bam.
at the end of the day, we keep choosing each other whether we're chatting over our morning coffee in the same room or over the phone. a true happily ever-after is never perfect or always happy. but it is lasting. and it lasts because it inspires us both to be better by being honest, understanding and caring enough to care enough. no two relationships are alike, and for wayo and me, what we have now not only works, it allows us to be ourselves and support each other without the pressure to try and be or live in a way that just isn't us. we simply embrace what is.

much of the book, then, involves a woman trying to imagine the inner life of a man she's fallen out of love with, trying to re-inhabit his thoughts in order to find him. the resulting, meandering observations earned kitamura praise from karl ove knausgård, who said even minor deviations in the book seem loaded with meaning.
my parents believed that god created the universe in six days about 6,000 years ago, and they refused to have my mother give birth in a hospital or to vaccinate me or my siblings. i was home-schooled from pre-kindergarten through high school, and my curriculum touched briefly on science as a subject that merely magnifies the handiwork of god, while for history i was taught that divine providence had bestowed america to christ's faithful.
the staffers clearly don't know how to deal with a tough work environment. she is also getting criticism, albeit anonymously, as a tough boss who mistreated her staff. she has had some of the highest staff turnover on capitol hill, but the stories would have more credibility if the critics lent their names. perhaps the senator is simply less tolerant of millennial demands, wrote the wall street journal editorial board in one such example.

ultimately, smerling believes we get hooked on what happens next in a celebrity's life in the same way we get hooked on soap operas or reality tv. we're obsessed with the drama and the scandal, she said. for some people, it ― albeit, unfortunately ― is like a drug. we as a society are addicted to escapism in many forms, and celebrity fanatics are no exception.
after months of grooming and emotional manipulation, sarah jackson says the pastor of her maryland baptist church called her into his private study and kissed her. she was 17, trembling and numb, while he was 29, married with children. it was the first time she had ever been touched this way.

stu talked me into going to law school while he was studying for the bar exam. four years later we started our own firm. i didn't choose family law. i backed into it. i was the only female lawyer in my location when we hung out our shingle, and the divorce clients came as a result. and they kept coming, and i loved doing it. stu and i worked as a team. he did a lot of my legal research and all my appellate writing in the early years. we'd discuss strategy, law and the clients all the time. i think we were more careful of each other in our marriage as a result. marriage and divorce law have been a fun partnership.
when it comes to her own profession, she plays it safe. i work in a creative field where people are more accepting of your choices and appreciate nonconventional haircuts/colors, but i find myself at a crossroads when it comes to a conference or business summit. i do not remember ever leaving my curls open in a meeting. they are either tied in a bun or styled. then, colored hair signals sexual adventurism and could get women into trouble. women with crazy hair colors are [believed] to be asking for it, just how they're asking for it when they wear short skirts or tops with deep necklines, she told huffpost.

2. so how do you get past that? it's a choice you have to make. this is a different type of choice though; it's the kind of choice/decision that you make between you, your spouse and god that no matter what, you are in it till the very end. don't get scared by that! it's ok to be in it till the very end. why go into something to leave midway? too commonly, people treat marriage like a car. the minute stuff starts going sour, (transmission, engine, got over 100k miles, etc) they find every reason in the book to trade it in or even sell it. it's too much work and too expensive at times so lets cut ties. and with cars, that is realistic and understandable, but not when you are dealing with a human being. but, if you have that mind set, as it relates to marriage, then when this new car starts going sour, it will be traded-in too. now, i'm not saying that cutting ties aren't necessary in certain cases. surely if you total your car, there's no fixing that. likewise in marriages, if its totaled beyond repair then you do what's necessary.

head to your local drug store this time of year and you'll see armies of smiling teddy bears, a vast array of familiar heart-shaped boxes and overpriced and occasionally clever cards for your sweetheart. love it or hate it, valentine's day is as inescapable as the weather, and it's impossible not to reflect on what it means to truly build a lasting relationship.
but as any formerly long-distance couple now living together can tell you, the hassles, the setbacks and the temporary lack of cuddles can be worth enduring. and in the thick of it ― when you're miles apart and missing each other something fierce ― there are usually signs that your relationship has sticking power.
top lgbt executive there have been other signs of growing acceptance. hong kong is set to become the host of the 2022 gay games, a sports and cultural event dubbed the gay olympics, after fighting off bids from cities in the united states and mexico. in a rare victory, a hong kong court last year ruled that a british lesbian whose partner worked in the city should receive a spousal visa. the charity big love alliance - of which chao is a founding member - organises an annual pink dot gathering to campaign for lgbt rights and it has attracted sponsorship from embassies and investment banks. chao also works with the united nations on lgbt rights and became the first asian to be named as the top lgbt executive on an annual outstanding list compiled by the financial times which ranks lgbt role models in business. a qualified helicopter pilot, chao said the marriage bounty episode did not tarnish her ties with her father - who like her also shares a passion of flying. you build a much stronger bond in these relationships after you have been able to live your full self, be a full person and live as an honest person in front of your mum and dad, she said. it is an important process to go through although in the short term it does jolt them into a bit of shock.
in the past four months, kalapura has received two notices from her convent, accusing her of not following the 'principles of religious life' and allegedly violating the rules of the congregation.the first was served around christmas last year, but that did not deter her from rallying behind the rape survivor with social media posts and comments to the press. so on 9 january, the convent served her another notice—this one, she said, contained a thinly-veiled threat of expulsion.

i agree with carmen knudson-martin, who comments in her article why power matters: creating a foundation of mutual support in couple relationships, family process, vol. 52, no1, (2013), that therapists are not gender neutral and that successful couples therapy must include an understanding of the socio-cultural context couples live in, and the subtle power hierarchy within their relationship. i would go further and suggest that all therapy must include an understanding of the client's family system and the gender roles and expectations that have been passed down from generation to generation.

when aniston and pitt announced their separation back in january 2005, after nearly five years of marriage, the world mourned hard. once news surfaced that pitt had apparently fallen for his mr. and mrs. smith co-star jolie, and reportedly left aniston as a result, media coverage spiraled out of control. did pitt cheat on aniston? did jolie pressure him into getting a divorce? was aniston ok?
one of the reasons i wrote this book is because people still are icky and weird about grief. they expect grief to be poignant, but that has nothing to do with me, or how most people that i know deal with things. when people say, it's a funny book about grief, and they go, oh, no. it's bob hope. it's slapstick, slipping on a banana peel and falling into a casket. it's not that at all. it's just living your life in a way that you usually live it, and sometimes things like eating chips in a graveyard happens, and it's funny. saying, can we go to key west now to go drinking and not go to this funeral? because that's how you feel.

we do share a history—most couples do. most couples have a story of their own special romance hidden inside of the 9 to 5, dinner-making, and school bus meeting; tucked inside of a peck of a kiss we wish lasted longer; buried beneath laundry piles.
you might think your desire to hook up with someone else is solely the result of the physical distance between you; in other words, if your partner were closer, you wouldn't be having these thoughts. but, as madden pointed out, even couples living under the same roof may go through periods of sexlessness for one reason or another.

i always considered myself a fiction writer and a poetry reader until my husband's deployment inspired me to write when the men go off to war. i will say that this collection was written in great humility because when i began it, i never intended to publish it; it began as a kind of a literary exercise. now, i feel blessed that i can consider myself both a novelist and poet. for me, physical space doesn't inspire different genres. it is really about the idea. some ideas are more suited to poetry while i know others would make better novels, or short stories. i knew immediately when i started thinking about bess houdini that i had to write a novel about her search to communicate with her dead husband's spirit. but while when the men go off to war also tells a story--of a marriage, tested by war, that ultimately finds redemption--i found it easier to write that story in verse form.

tyson said she suffered deep humiliation and shame and stayed quiet about the allegations as she pursued her career, but by late 2017, as the #metoo movement took shape and after she saw an article about fairfax's campaign, she took her story to the washington post, which decided months later not to publish a story.

even when we visited our cousins from my mom's side in a bigger city, we would face jeers while visiting playgrounds and swimming pools. i felt great empathy for them, knowing they faced racism more often and perhaps more viciously than we did, because our biracialism kept us safe a lot of the time.
relevance is one of the great shibboleths of criticism, and after a real-life event as dramatic and complex as this year's election, the temptation to seek clues and answers in works of popular art is almost overwhelming, new york times co-chief film critic a.o. scott wrote in the introduction to his list of the best movies of 2016, following the election of donald trump. but cinema is better at exploring than explaining, and the screen is more like a prism or a kaleidoscope than a mirror or a window. we seldom get the news from movies.

fennell, who also wrote the script, isn't satisfied with concrete notions of heroism and villainy. some of her bolder choices will be polarizing, but that's what makes this film a treat. it's unpredictable and cleverly cast (look out for a parade of crush-worthy actors like adam brody, max greenfield and sam richardson), with a soundtrack that peaks with paris hilton's stars are blind and a piercing instrumental cover of britney spears' toxic. i can't wait to see it again, and again, and again.

he is 6'2 with clear blue eyes and an uncommon steadiness and more strength and integrity than anyone i've ever met. i was there in june when a hospice nurse told us it would likely be less than a week or so until the end, and after the nurse left, i could hear him sobbing in the room where she was laying as i waited downstairs. never once pushing her to abide by his own plans and always holding steady in the hard work of compassion.

i love the term debbie downer because the voice can be downright mean. it's a second-guessing, critical, backseat-driving, constant companion who analyzes every decision we make and action we take -- past, present and future. it's relentless, judgmental, competitive, what-if-ing and worst-case-scenario-ing. all day. every day.

claire: ugh, i wish i thought so. the opulent, saturated visuals keep getting dialed up in every installment. i thought the first movie was perfect eye candy; the assisted living facility severely tested me. this one almost felt feverish. the musical cues also went over-the-top for me. i still listen to some favorites from the soundtrack of the first movie — and, as a millennial, i bopped happily to the opening number (girls' generation's gee was a hot thing when i was in college! 12 years ago! it still bangs!). but for the most part the songs were heavy-handed, like they were being used to glue together a narrative that didn't quite feel cohesive. when lara jean dreams about her heteronormative fantasy future with peter to the ear-shattering strains of wannabe, i rolled my eyes — and i am the queen of heteronormative fantasy futures! it was all a little unsubtle.

slavery was illegal in philadelphia while it was the national capital in the 1790s. enslaved africans brought to pennsylvania would officially be free after six months in the state. to evade the law, washington rotated enslaved africans back to his virginia planation before that would have to be emancipated. apparently hercules so enjoyed being enslaved by george washington that he later escaped to freedom. when hercules escaped bondage in 1797 washington wrote a letter to his personal secretary tobias lear where he demanded lear assist in hercules' capture. after discussing new carpets, furniture, pots, and pans, washington requested that lear desire mr. kitt to make all the enquiry he can after hercules, and send him round in the vessel if he can be discovered & apprehended.

in this piece, writer kellee terrell spoke to asante mcgee, one of the women who appeared in the lifetime docuseries surviving r. kelly. mcgee talks about her accusations of emotional abuse by r. kelly during their relationship, the scrutiny she faced for coming forward to the media, and why black survivors need to be treated as human beings who deserve support, not just as a means to boost page views and ratings.
never one to shy away from a camera, my mom threw her head back and gave me a dazzling smile. it's always a surprise when people learn she's almost 70 — she's playful and vibrant, with the high cheekbones and beautiful skin often seen in chinese women. i always say i hope to inherit her agelessness to join the dark eyes and olive skin she gave me. i drove away with tears in my eyes; my desire to keep my parents safe overwhelming me. i'm grateful they moved close to us years earlier, so i can take care of them now.
the conflict and stressors from these competing roles are evident on a daily basis and it usually appears in a pair of arguments: either a mother works hard and feels guilty for not spending more time with her children or she doesn't work and suffers the scrutiny of her peers for not doing enough. in either case, there is stress and plenty of it.
the dinner-party ruse lets the birdcage smuggle in some pretty effective ideas about the queer experience. armand struggling to teach albert to pass for butch is a gleeful indictment of the idea itself; it makes the grunting mannerisms of heterosexual men look absurd. for any gay man who has deepened his voice or thrust his hands into his pockets so they wouldn't give him away, those absurdities are all too familiar. plus, lane is a brilliant comedian capable of embedding both social commentary and interpersonal conflict in his broad physicality.
and of course, afterward, i still felt like shit ― because i was supposed to feel like shit. i'd lost someone who was important to me. it was natural to grieve.
the study opens with the following established facts:

in fact, a trio of factors led me down this dry path. it dawned on me that i had invested so much time chasing the highs of dating that i failed to realize the heart-twisting terror that it actually caused me: assaults on the self-esteem, anxiety, drained energy and hours wasted in the throes of sorrow when things didn't pan out.
don't come at your relative with judgment, just concern and facts.
besides that, don't act if you haven't fully examined your rational side and your emotional side, stone said.
jeffreys eventually worked his way up to manager at another auto parts store in a nearby town. it was, as he'd later say on a grandpa lampshade podcast, a normie job where he interacted every day with different people, including mexicans and niggers. his wife opened an auto body paint shop specializing in custom painting, flames etc. she posted hundreds of pictures of her bright orange muscle car on instagram. her business's twitter account follows duke, the former ku klux klan leader.
the senators were, however, doing their jobs, questioning a judicial nominee who has used his religious faith to justify his policy positions. for gabbard to say this amounts to religious bigotry is to drag out another right-wing trope.

did you want to raise your children differently from how you were raised?
claire: i think you're right about the central flaw — options for a second and third story are limited and unsatisfying. a rom-com is about two people falling in love, and once they're together, that story has been told. you can separate them or create a huge obstacle for them to overcome, but typically this also lessens the perceived strength of their connection. the emotional payoff when they make it work again is smaller. for some reason, this bothers me more in a movie than in other formats. i read the jenny han books on which the movies are based after seeing the first film, and the movies are reasonably faithful to the source material. but where a book can get away with just letting us spend some more time with characters we love, navigating their changing relationship in an episodic fashion, a genre movie calls for a strong cohesive arc. it's difficult to conjure that for a story about a relationship hitting the skids and then recovering.
and my marriage isn't over, and it hasn't stalled. it's been gifted with rebirth.
with readler's confirmation, trump has now gotten 33 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two supreme court justices confirmed. the number of confirmed circuit judges is more than any other president has achieved by this point in his first term, and represents one out of every six seats on those courts.
lauren: for me, it was kind of a struggle at first. i'm not going to lie, because at that point in my life i was kind of a hermit. i was independent; i enjoyed my own space. i had my own business and my dating life wasn't really that good. so i was kind of used to being by myself. so having to move in with someone ― i've never lived with a man before, besides my family ― so having to share a space and just being there with each other all the time was something that i had to get used to. and cameron is very affectionate with that, which i appreciate, but i had to learn how to be, i guess, comfortable with sharing that space 'cause that was different for me. so it was definitely a transition.

i certainly understand that it seems bizarre, dr. laura wilson, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at the university of mary washington told huffpost by phone on thursday. but in actuality, when you think about how people respond to victimization it makes a lot of sense. wilson, whose research focuses on post-trauma functioning in sexual assault survivors, explained that most survivors don't initially use the terms assault or rape to describe what they've experienced. instead, they might conceptualize the assault as bad sex or a miscommunication.

dibitetto's bio states he has been called a cross between rodney dangerfield and ralph kramden but he is certainly his own man when performing and should not be compared to anyone else. that is the beauty of who he is and his comedy, that it is from a fresh perspective, a natural perspective. dibitetto allows his audience inside his home to see the humor in his everyday life as well as his commentary on life around all of us.

the idea that historical romance would be able to unpack and solve these big issues of colonialism and race and gender and sexual politics and identity from a massive lens is unrealistic when the books are really doing a very specific kind of work around the domestic role of women and other marginalized people in our current society, maclean said. the work of the romance is to show characters in hope and prosperity and joy and love.

some spouses try to create a happy marriage through grand romantic gestures like sending flowers, planning romantic dinners, or wearing sexy lingerie. while that is a pretty good plan for creating a happy valentine's day or happy anniversary, it is a woefully inadequate plan for sustaining a happy marriage.

you would think that with all i've seen and learned through the years, i'd be great at marriage and not make the same mistakes divorcing clients have made. not always the case. for years, john's common line to me when we were having a marital spat was, 'can't you just use your mediator skills for a goddamned minute and try to understand my perspective?!? and stop interrupting me!' what i've learned from being in this profession is we all make the same mistakes in marriage. some of us are just lucky enough to have the marriage survive until we figure it out. i think we made it through the rocky stretches because john is as strong a person as i am. he's an attorney too and he held his ground. even when we were furious with one another, we never lost mutual respect. i'd be lost without him.
josh and i are both trying to advance our careers, build businesses, pay off debt, make smart investments, save money, and still have the time and capital left over to enjoy ourselves. i can't think of any worthwhile reason to have a wedding, even if it somehow only cost $100. our friends and family know that we love each other. we can celebrate it with a house party if we wanted to.

for me, those days are over. thirty years after that glaring flashlight and my night in the drunk tank, i am finally comfortable recovering out loud, with pride and purpose, hoping others will join me and the estimated 23 million-plus americans who proudly identify as in recovery from addiction.
let's face it, marriages are as unique as the people in them. for example, there are those who've lived together for over 30 years yet never married. does that make their union any less legitimate or loving? i know of a couple who divorced only to reunite after they married and divorced other people. in their case, they didn't realize how perfect they were for each other until they recognized that different isn't always better. so why not redefine marriage in a way so genuine, it's perfectly customized for our imperfect lives?
he was unconscious by then, with his hands tucked under a sheet. she sat next to his bed and talked to him for nearly an hour. when she got home, she wrote down more things she wanted to say to her husband ― about their life together, their four sons, hockey, and his love of sailing, woodworking and cabinetry.

by building a love story between the primary couple, one that is guaranteed to end happily ever after or happy for now, a romance novel not only provides escapism and the heart-pounding rush of vicarious passion, but a space in which to explore how romantic relationships can and should be, and how women can find fulfillment and happiness. and that means these stories have little to do with how the marriage market of regency high society actually functioned; they're about what readers — predominantly women — want to see in their lives today.
mann's relationship with weinstein may have been complicated, but it's not unimaginable. multiple experts told huffpost that some sexual assault survivors do have consensual sex with their attackers after an initial assault.
sometimes the self-talk gets so loud and distracting that i can't remember the score of the match, which i'm supposed to call out before i serve.
cash rules everything around music. use yours to send a message that even though no one is stopping artists from bragging about assault at the production level, we, the listeners, will stop them at the consumer level. supporting musicians who brag about raping and killing women provides those artists with the money and power they need to continue to silence their victims. we can no longer be passive spectators, complicit in a performative type of love. real love demands better.
cameron: it was very fast by most measures. but you all know that i was going to say yes. i think that was pretty clear.
lb: that touches on an important draw for me, which was that all of these people dated each other! we see another layer of that messy, complicated side with jessica, who fell for barnett in the pods, was turned down and went with her second choice, mark. (she claims he was always her first choice, but we see your agenda, jessica.) the whole polyamory thing is compelling in that sense. we, as viewers, see jessica grappling with her feelings for mark while also contemplating a relationship with barnett after she sees him in the flesh. barnett, however, knew jessica wasn't his person long before he proposed to amber.
it's time to move beyond the hatred and the division and treat everyone the way that they're supposed to be treated, he said. for me, it's a matter of faith, morals and doing what's right.

i loved being single and gave it up only because i loved tim more. but still there were times when i feared what not being sole captain of my life would feel like. so right before the wedding, i lashed out at him: 'if you think i'm going to be homemaker hannah, then you're marrying the wrong girl.' he got all huffy: 'if you seriously think i don't know the woman i'm marrying, then maybe we are making a mistake!' i immediately deflated: 'what? you don't want to marry me?' tim said: 'of course i do. but i want you to understand that i want you to be who you are, not make you a stepford wife.' in that moment, my fears fell away. marriage to this wonderful man would enhance me, not cage me. —sheila
slowly, lee said, she's embracing the quarantine time frame as a blessing in disguise for her healing process. my ex and i been through so many cycles and whenever we hit a rough patch, he'd still always answer the phone and come over ― we'd always met up when we needed each other, she explained. but now, we can't do that. if social distancing makes for a cleaner break for us, all the better.
marina: all of the above, i think? to outline the plot, our adorable couple has reached the spring of their senior year and have to figure out whether they're going to try to stay together in college. i think i've seen this plot line far too much. there's only so much agonizing over college acceptances and planning elaborate promposals that i can take. even condor and centineo's winsome chemistry wasn't enough to keep me interested. yes, peter continues to be the ideal good guy, supporting and respecting lara jean's choices, but i hate to say it: his charm has worn off a bit.

what i do know is any school can be a rough place for a gay kid. there are always bullies. it doesn't help when the teachers are in on it. once, in my public high school, when some boys made a cruel, homophobic joke, the teacher cut them off. he then berated them to the point i thought they would cry. i had never seen an adult stand up for people like me before. i didn't even know that was possible. ics made sure of that.
claire: sadly, i agree. as much as i love a couple hours with lana condor and noah centineo, it's hard to capture that lightning in a bottle twice, let alone three times. there were cute moments (i did tear up here and there, maybe just because the idea of high school love is so foreign to my harried new-mom lifestyle), but it doesn't hang together enough that i could relax into it. i'd love to hear more about what you thought the first movie did that was missing here! is it the plot? the writing? the music?
most new refugees have a family member or friend in the u.s. that they hope to unite with, news site crux reports. abbott's decision means that for the next fiscal year, refugees won't be able to initially settle near loved ones in texas ― although they could move to texas after first being received by another state.
when i watched the movie as a teenager, i rooted for young andy and her glamorous chanel boots to get away from her rude, unpleasant and demanding boss. but after rewatching as a working adult, i'm struck to find i have a much more complex understanding of miranda, and of how many missteps her runway staff take in their careers. why is no one reahhhdy? miranda archly asks her inept staff, as i agree.

i feel that anything sooner is too... i don't know, presumptive? she said. if a guy starts pushing for physical stuff sooner i will tell him earlier, but date three has always been my rule. anything later than that feels like i am hiding it from the guy and not being honest.
that tight-knit family control runs afoul of standards issued by multiple watchdog groups to help stem the likelihood of self-dealing and graft.
i hope so. i really hope so. someone asked me the other day, who is this for? i was like, people. it's for people. i think it's because i'm writing as a black person and being honest about that experience, filtering a very common experience like grief through a prism that's not always seen. i think it's me and tembi locke, who wrote from scratch: a memoir of love, sicily, and finding home. we're like your black widows. she's really wonderful and completely different. have you read the book?
we want to say how incredibly saddened we are to hear this story. to know that any person could be treated in such a way especially during a time that should be filled with joy is extremely disheartening. imagine a customer who took the time to create something personal to mark this special day and instead, the day before their wedding, goes to open their wedding programs and finds these judgmental messages. we have never been more disappointed to let a customer down.

cameron: for me, the main focus after we got engaged was focusing on our relationship working out. the filming aspect of it, of course, it's there, but i realized that these are conversations that we need to have if we're going to have a successful marriage when everything ... all this stuff disappears, the filming and all that. we're still going to be married and we're going to have children and we need to make sure that they're taken care of in the world and our family at large.

my dad keeps saying 'it's just like the flu' and that 'a lot of people die every day,' she said. they don't seem to understand how social distancing can help other people because they are not worried about getting it and they don't seem to listen when i try to talk to them about it.

so the real question is: why are we expected to stay together and make each other miserable? that wasn't part of the story we were sold as kids. we were sold the story of the illusion of marriage. how beautiful it is love to somebody. you work on a marriage and you continue to grow and love each other.

still, williamson said he and the eastsiders cast and crew were always aware of the fact that existing incarnation of the show would end after its fourth season. wu, for instance, was unable to appear in the final installment because of her fresh off the boat shooting schedule.
marina: 100% agree. it was too fragmented. you bring up a good point about whether rom-com sequels are even effective, and i'm struggling to come up with a rom-com movie franchise that actually held together from installment to installment. as a writer or creator, there's only so much you can do: maybe add a love triangle, insert a second (or third) round of will-they-won't-they intrigue, have the couple grapple with how their professional ambitions affect the relationship, etc. if the couple is married, maybe add some marital tension. what are some other reasons rom-com sequels generally don't work, and was it inevitable that this one wouldn't work?

the dawes commission ended up rejecting almost two-thirds of the applications for various reasons, but census cards and application jackets were created for each applicant and are available for research, whether they were accepted or rejected. ancestry has most of these records, as well as applications made to the dawes commission during an earlier attempt to enroll the tribes in 1896. (here's an insider's tip: when you check the dawes census cards,be sure to look at the front and back of each card and read all the notes. this will often lead to other cards you should check.)

2. your partner should be your biggest cheerleader. the protagonists in the film --played by emma stone and ryan gosling -- are both chasing their dreams. their dedication to those goals despite crippling fear and anxiety (click to read about how art imitates life in emma stone's case) -- is an awesome and honorable thing to behold. they're both industrious self-starters, but they are also each other's most avid fans. when one deviates from his/her stated goals, the other is there saying, wait. what? that wasn't in your plan. and please don't compromise. i'm here to support you.

those two people, jennifer aniston and brad pitt, got married, said some lovely things about one another in public and then ― like many celebrity couples ― got divorced. they had subsequent relationships (hi, justin theroux and angelina jolie), but their once-perfect union remained tabloid fodder throughout. people couldn't help but fantasize about an eventual reunion.
in first marriages, it's expected that couples will split finances as well as share financial goals and responsibilities. because of the higher age of couples in second marriages, couples often get together with much more financial assets than they had in their first marriages. they also probably had independent financial goals they've been working towards for a long time before they got married a second time. and just because they're married now doesn't mean that their goals should change from what they were before they were married. there are also questions about how to split household finances and how to divide assets that were accrued before the current marriage. money is already a top issue that couples fight about. with more complicated finances, couples in second marriages are more likely to fight about finances, which often leads to divorce. ― aaron anderson, a marriage and family therapist in denver, colorado
our wedding day was more personal and intimate than anything we'd originally planned and was certainly memorable. we exchanged our vows in a small garden outside of the supreme court building. even though the streets were bustling with people, the garden was secluded and felt like our own personal venue. after we married, we bounced around the supreme court building and library of congress with our photographer, shawnee, for some amazing shots that we could share with friends and family. we were able to enjoy an incredible dinner on the outdoor patio at tyber creek wine bar. the owner worked with us to craft a special wedding night menu, which could not have been more romantic.

his attempts to fix things were sloppy but well-intended: bags of my favorite candy brought home from the grocery store to cheer me up, calls home to see if i'd like him to pick up pizza for dinner. they'd work to thaw my frosty demeanor, and i'd take care of the dishes, the laundry, the vacuuming and the dusting. but then the house would start to get messy again, and the cycle would repeat itself.

if you notice your self-critic above, the best thing you can do for your relationships and yourself is to work on accepting yourself as you are, flaws and all. looking back at the years of work i have done on myself, i am grateful that i have been forgiving of my mistakes and imperfections. it has made an immense difference as a healthy relationship teacher and lover.

many times a president of a company has asked me, dr. adizes, have you ever failed? i say, yes. not every company succeeds.
looking back, i now know what i was feeling was extreme anxiety ― a lot of it irrational but still very real to me. my child is now 8 months old and insanely happy. i'm now amazed that my body created this big, healthy, beautiful human being. i don't know exactly how things started to get better. but thankfully they did. had they not, i would have eventually sought help. therapy and medication, if needed. i still struggle with wanting to overprotect my child. i still panic and overreact at moments. but i'm working on it every day.
whether we chose the right route, even though all the other ones seemed much easier and lavish, bearing more fruit. questioning ourselves as to why we picked the road less traveled, which only leads to sleepless nights, debt, unemployment, stress beyond imaginable, further creating wrinkles and baggy eyes, peaked cortisol levels, and of course losing sight with all the things we love with family and friends, missing birthdays, engagements, weddings, graduations, etc., replacing memories with stacks of loans on loans on loans which is not ideal nor the american dream.

religious conversions matter in israel because the country grants jewish people certain immigration rights under the law of return. this law gives jews around the world ― including people who convert to judaism ― the right to live in israel and gain citizenship. since 1995, the law of return has applied to reform and conservative conversions that happen outside of israel.

to have someone who understands what you're going through, who's the same age, who came from pretty much the same background — that is so rare, she said. and we've had the same struggles in terms of dealing with body image and puberty and growing up in the public eye. but i found my strength in her, and i think she found her strength in me.
i can promise you one thing: if you do a diagnosis of your company, and you identify problems which are chronic -- they come back, and back, and back, and back--this is what is blocking your growth of the company -- this is what you lose sleep over at night -- i promise you--because we have the experience of 50 years, thousands of companies -- 40% of these chronic problems will disappear. minimum. 40% will be better; 20% will not change; and the second year, what was better will disappear, what did not change will become better. in 3 years, all problems you have today should disappear. that is on average. some companies do it faster. it all depends on how committed you, the ceo, are to give time and energy.
we have a saying, 'sometimes it's not the ex, it's you that's the problem.' unfortunately, we see repeat customers. those who frequently marry are often quick to commit and quick to leave. for some, being married, just being married, makes them feel like they fit in. ― randall kessler, a divorce attorney in atlanta
the addition of a second character caught in the loop was, i thought, a brilliant move. while groundhog day places main character phil's moral development at the center of the narrative, russian doll accomplishes this more effectively by removing these two characters from the center of their own narratives.

brie: brie's would be juliette barnes in nashville, who's played by hayden panettiere.
acknowledging the show as a certain kind of fluff, even giving oneself over to the pleasure of the escapism, doesn't mean disengaging critically. some critics who love the romance genre hated bridgerton; others loved it; others felt all kinds of complicated things about it. the shocking scene in which daphne, season 1's heroine, sexually assaults the duke in order to get pregnant against his wishes, has received particular scrutiny. some romance lovers, like matthew, cringed at the sex scenes, while others (guilty) found them deliciously steamy.
my baby had a perfect latch. he was born big and strong, and was doing everything right. yet my body refused to cooperate and do what was supposed to be natural. breastfeeding advocates reiterated that formula wasn't the best, it wasn't even second or third best, for that matter. over and over again, support groups screamed that every mom could breastfeed, and if i wasn't, i was just being selfish and i was surely hurting my child.
for black women, this is particularly true. though the romance world has been undergoing a painful and overdue reckoning with racism in its institutions (most notably the romance writers of america), black romance novelists including alyssa cole, vanessa riley, and literary legend beverly jenkins have found in the genre a way to center black women's happiness and care, both in contemporary settings and in historical ones.

for me, this pressure has always manifested in the form of a singular, overarching goal throughout different junctures of my life. as a youth, i was expected to graduate at the top of my high school class and get into an ivy league university. in my 20s, i had to land a well-paying job and establish a solid career. and now, in my 30s, i needed to find a life partner they approved of and get married. done, done and done.
we know that there are effective ways to prevent suicide, but we need a much stronger national effort to begin actually reducing lgbtq youth suicide. amy green, trevor project research director

if you're more interested in those writers working in the spare, weird camp of fantasy where haruki murakami and steven millhauser's work resides, helen phillips might be a great pick for you. as the title implies, phillips's novel starts out as a story set in a slightly off-putting workplace, but as strange happenings keep getting stranger, protagonist josephine begins to question just what she's signed up for. think the adding machine meets 1q84.

we're not seeing lgb youth catching up once they move out of the home and start independent lives, said amy green, the trevor project's research director. this indicates that the suicide disparity isn't just the result of overt abuse from fellow students or parents during adolescence. queer young adults may be experiencing lingering trauma from the time they spent in the closet or ongoing discrimination.

mann's experience seemed to be in line with this phenomenon. during her testimony, she read an email she wrote to her then-boyfriend in 2014. i remembered the day i realized i was controlling my world because i was sexually assaulted, and that story played out where i played into sexual dynamics with people to feel like i would never be taken advantage of again, mann read from the email before breaking down in tears.
herring would be next in line to be governor after fairfax.
i do think kids learn through stories so either if a child has a hard time talking about it or if we want to normalize it, it's super helpful to say, 'look, it's in this book,' she told huffpost. when we distance it and it's not about the child, it's just about this character in this book.
equal pay. affordable, quality child care. debt-free community college. paid family leave, biden listed as key priorities. both moms and dads are facing the chaotic reality of working from home while toddlers climb all over them. essential workers have to go to work every day without anywhere to send their kids. we're seeing how badly we need better balance for us all.
i could not help but recognize that they only meant well and had paved the way for me to have a better life. like so many of my peers, i grappled with this never-ending cycle of nagging resentment and immense guilt toward my parents, a constant inner battle between my american independence and chinese reverence.

but promises aren't guarantees, and miranda ultimately orchestrates the situation so the job goes to one of her rivals. it's a painful lesson in never trusting an offer of employment until you see it in writing.
i've always wanted to try out acting, but maybe in a couple years. i really believe in activism and i want to do bigger things, she said in cr fashion book. i'm hoping that this year my generation will get to a point where we will rise up, not in a violent way, but start pushing for more liberalism. this happened with same-sex marriage. we pushed so hard for equality and it happened.

when you're focused on trying to know steps 1 through 50, you get way ahead of yourself and this keeps you from making any progress at all, said sumayya essack, a mindset and life coach in boston. big goals like changing careers and starting businesses don't have paint-by-numbers formulas, so you can't actually know all the steps.
from the beginning, o'keeffe had an exalted agenda: when someone looks at something i have painted, i want them to feel what moved me to paint it in the first place. i paint as i feel it. light, sky, air. as i want it to be felt. but o'keeffe wasn't just heralded for her drawings. she was also a model -- a nude model -- for her photographer lover. which she liked. a lot: i've begun to crave the way his eyes rake over me, so i am only a body. no inhibition, no thought. pure sensation. there is a strange freedom in that, and it begins to fuel my art.
it's the same cycle, it doesn't matter what generation we are in, she continued. every kid is going to go through the same thing.

the term 'five civilized tribes' came into use during the mid-nineteenth century to refer to the cherokee, choctaw, chickasaw, creek, and seminole nations. although these indian tribes had various cultural, political, and economic connections before removal in the 1820s and 1830s, the phrase was most widely used in indian territory and oklahoma. americans, and sometimes american indians, called the five southeastern nations civilized because they appeared to be assimilating to anglo-american norms. the term indicated the adoption of horticulture and other european cultural patterns and institutions, including widespread christianity, written constitutions, centralized governments, intermarriage with white americans, market participation, literacy, animal husbandry, patrilineal descent, and even slaveholding. none of these attributes characterized all of the nations or all of the citizens that they encompassed. the term was also used to distinguish these five nations from other so-called wild indians who continued to rely on hunting for survival. elements of 'civilization' within southeastern indian society predated removal. the cherokee, for example, established a written language in 1821, a national supreme court in 1822, and a written constitution in 1827. the other four nations had similar, if less noted, developments.

those who may struggle to pay for mental health care can find success through pro bono counseling services, community mental health centers, local churches or affiliation groups, or nonprofit organizations, such as the boris lawrence henson foundation that provides funding for mental health services, graham added. some colleges and universities provide mental health services to the public and sometimes at reduced rates.

children of divorce can sometimes be more sensitive during arguments as they may have witnessed their parents arguing in front of them, jacqueline newman, a new york-based family law specialist, told huffpost. they may take more extreme positions and think that a small tiff could be the end ― simply because as children the fights they did see led to the ending of the relationship.

two months after her stint on weber's season ended, weier deviated from the bachelor playbook of basically ignoring politics. on feb. 3, she posted on instagram, it's caucus day in iowa! make sure you go out and do your part! and in bachelor nation, that's analogous to announcing a plan for big, structural change.

it's important to always keep moving, growing and evolving, williamson said. good stories have endings, and i wanted to leave all of the characters in a satisfying place. i don't want to keep imperiling these relationships unnecessarily.
the oscar winner, of course, was famously involved with pitt and affleck before her 10-years-plus marriage to coldplay frontman martin, which resulted in two children and a conscious uncoupling. she announced her engagement to falchuk in january, more than three years after they met when paltrow did a guest arc on glee.

a full accounting of limbaugh's lies and exaggerations; his racism and his misogyny; his homophobia and his islamophobia; and his sheer cruelty could fill books — and have — but even a cursory overview of his lowlights makes his prejudice clear.
one of the more eye-opening moments of the series involves hillary's heartbreak at the lewinsky news. with pain in her eyes, she admits she was shocked by the extramarital relationship and says she was just devastated that bill would lie to her. colleagues who were interviewed also said that, despite reports claiming otherwise, hillary did not know about the affair prior to bill's confession. (while that may be true, one can't help but consider that she at least knew of bill's inappropriate behavior, after juanita broaddrick's rape allegation, an alleged affair with gennifer flowers and paula jones' sexual harassment accusations. hillary mentions those incidents, but doesn't examine them with the same level of detail as, say, a&e's recent six-part docuseries, the clinton affair.)
each relationship is different, but we're monogamous, so cheating means sleeping with another person. however, cheating isn't as black and white as a physical betrayal. with the emergence of social media, it's easier now than ever to have an emotional affair by simply sliding into someone's dms. i could eventually forgive my partner for a physical affair but not for an emotional one. while a physical affair would be devastating and a breach of trust, the betrayal of an emotional affair for me is something you cannot come back from. my husband and i have been together for nearly 10 years; he gets to see a part of me that no one else does and understands me more than anyone else, largely because i feel comfortable enough to be that vulnerable with him. the thought of that intimacy and vulnerability being breached is a betrayal far greater than physical intimacy. ― tyler gibbon-thorne, vlogger at tyler and todd
remember the old adage -- sticks and stones may break my bones, but names and words will never hurt me.
in the post-2016 election malaise, these novels became my anxiety palliative of choice. they piled up next to my bed and in my e-reader. but sometimes i wanted more, wanted to see the gossamer petticoats and lingering glances and gently unfastened bodices. the piece i pitched never materialized, but the object of my longing did. on christmas day 2020, shondaland's bridgerton arrived on netflix.

learning to talk about and process losses together as a family is a critical skill that a child can take with them into adulthood and draw upon for the rest of their lives, said neha chaudhary, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school. the more we talk to kids about tough topics like pregnancy loss, the more we can model what it means to experience the hard parts of life and navigate big feelings together, head-on.

cut to the interview proper. clooney comes out onstage, he and letterman sit down in chairs, clooney does the obligatory joke about letterman's beard, referring to this soggy bottom boys thing you've got going, and they ramble on the subject of clooney's childhood, with a fair amount of letterman's childhood thrown into the bargain. it's nothing you haven't heard if you've ever seen clooney profiled, or read a letterman interview, but here's the thing: to each other, this is all new material, because clooney and letterman live inside their separate fame bubbles, so letterman's never heard the clooney stories about all the bad tv acting gigs he had before er made him a star, and clooney hasn't heard letterman talk about how his mom was emotionally withholding. basically, watching all this on netflix, you're waiting for them to get these niceties out of the way to dig down a bit deeper.
things took a turn for the worse during the third quarter of the game when authorities say harp physically assaulted one of the women.
who doesn't love weddings, or the reception parties afterwards? i particularly love attending weddings with friends and family but i don't plan on ever being the one at the end of the aisle. you may think this leads to the ever-rising eloping trend but that's not it either. some people just don't want to get married, with a million reasons behind them, and here are mine: when i was little, my brother and i would tease each other about who was going to get married and have children first. my brother and i would joke about having to keep the family name going, but in reality we both never wanted to do so in the first place. i was never one for life-like child dolls or babysitting. i always, and still today, have preferred rescuing and taking care of animals. now, all baby-carriage nursery rhymes aside, children aren't the sole reason behind exchanging marriage vows, but in some families, if you're not bearing children after your wedding, what are you doing?
2. clutter can affect your relationships more than you think
let's say you wanted to become a member of the cherokee nation. how would you go about it? well, first, cherokee nation citizenship requires that you have at least one direct cherokee ancestor listed on the dawes final rolls. this roll (census, really) was taken between 1899 and 1914 and lists indians, white citizens, and black freedmen (former slaves) residing in what was known as indian territory (now northeastern oklahoma). if your ancestor did not live in this area during that time period, they will not be listed on the dawes rolls. certain requirements had to be met in order to be placed on the dawes roll, such as being listed on previous cherokee rolls and a proven residency in the cherokee nation. many modern-day applicants do not qualify for citizenship because their ancestors did not meet the enrollment requirements of the dawes commission and were not listed on the dawes rolls.
2021... i don't know what you will bring... but for my family we will continue to believe that love is the way! he added.
martin said ireland must acknowledge the scandal as part of its national history and show our deep remorse. he apologized on behalf of his government for the profound and generational wrong visited upon mothers and their babies who ended up in the institutions.
once a couple stops having sex, or more importantly, stops valuing sex as an important part of relationship maintenance, it is a fast and slippery slope into sexual oblivion, resnick anderson, who is also an associate professor of psychiatry at the ucla school of medicine, told huffpost.
the troll-y online gathering place for today's millennial neo-nazi movement, the daily stormer has featured numerous posts calling for the genocide of jews. a few years ago, it surpassed stormfront — an older white nationalist message board that jeffreys has said didn't grab him — as the leading hate site on the internet. the daily stormer's founder and editor, andrew anglin, has perfected a humorous meme-laden style of blogging that makes the lies and hate he pushes appealing to a younger audience already steeped in internet culture. but the daily stormer, which has also celebrated violence against minorities, journalists and women, appeals to older racists, too. jeffreys, a middle-aged, working-class texan, thought the site was funny and kept coming back.

7. they're technically married but separated.
this typically happens when we start focusing on our feeling of disconnection from others or loss of relationships. saad said some people may not be consciously aware of this shift, but their bodies and minds will still show the negative effects of being alone.
soon a current was jolting me toward hazardous sharp coral reef. when i resisted, it pulled me closer. after what seemed like an eternity of struggling, i noticed scores of fish beneath and around me, tiny black and gold striped ones and larger gray news, all swaying gently, so peacefully, like a metronome, slowly moving back and forth, toward the shore, toward the open sea, but just a foot or so in each direction.

really, beds should be used for only two things — sleep and sex, he said. when you walk into your bedroom, your mind should start focusing on sleep or intimacy and not on things like work or watching tv.
the timing was purely coincidental, but the abruptness of it all made the experience so much worse.
as with nelson mandela, winnie madikizela-mandela's death was announced with gravitas by the presidency. this time, south african president cyril ramaphosa hailed her role as a heroine of the struggle and said she had lived a rich and remarkable life.
wedding cakes can be trouble. during the wedding planning for one of my clients, the bride asked the groom multiple times in a serious manner to not smash the cake into her face during the cake cutting. the day finally came and ... he did it. she annulled the marriage soon after that. ― anita dybala, founder and lead planner at anita dybala events in new jersey and new york
krasinski added: for me, i love acting and i'm so lucky to be doing it. but she's on another plane. this weird intersection happened while filming where i totally forgot i was her husband. i was just watching her performance and was lucky enough to be in the front row.

once, when kouprianova was pregnant, she and spencer went into town to get coffee. the barista started yelling and refused to serve them. i was just standing there, watching her yell, my belly is out to here, she says, holding her hand a foot from her stomach.
at the same time, the democrats nationally have taken a hard line against misconduct in their ranks because women and minorities are a vital part of their base and they want to be able to criticize trump's behavior without looking hypocritical.

limbaugh was still the most popular radio host in america by the time of the 2016 election. although initially supportive of sen. ted cruz (r-texas) during the republican primary, he became a staunch supporter of the eventual nominee, donald trump. limbaugh could be counted on to support the president during some of the most disgraceful episodes of trump's sole term in the white house.
self-deprecating thoughts can batter your self-esteem, self-worth and self-confidence, said karen donzaldson, a communication and body language expert and certified confidence coach in toronto.
stotzko and wojciechowski are believed to have left the country, the guardian and radio free europe/radio liberty both reported. (all russians over 16 are required to have internal passports that document their place of residence and marital status. a separate, external passport must be used for foreign travel.)
i'm watching biden talk about the inflation index, economic growth, how restructuring small business loans will benefit real small businesses and i'm thinking that maybe tucker is reaching a bit on this senility claim.
although palm reading can be exhausting, i find it fascinating. it's not the different curves and bumps that intrigue me―it's what people will reveal about themselves. since what i tell people is often fairly vague, they often feel the need to elaborate on what i do tell them. this sometimes leads to rather shocking facts being revealed.
the lds church opposes same-sex marriage, and though leaders maintain that same-sex attraction is not a sin, members are expected not to act on such feelings.
klobuchar faced allegations of mistreating her staff as far back as 2006, when she was the hennepin county attorney in minneapolis ― undercutting the wall street journal's view that the upset aides are just a bunch of snowflake millennials.
i will keep calling out donald trump and his phony populism, the third-term senator continued. i will keep fighting for all workers across the country. and i will do everything i can to elect a democratic president and a democratic senate in 2020. the best place for me to make that fight is in the united states senate.
on going back to work shortly after giving birth
and the reason it doesn't work is because the physical world isn't reliable. life is, by nature, mutable. situations and people change. you can have a 401k, money in the bank, and a house in the burbs and still lose it all. you can sign a marriage contract in blood and still end up divorced. accidents happen. people die. pets run away. children get sick. hurricanes, floods, tornedoes and earthquakes level whole cities.
i run, i bike. it clears my head, so that's really important to me and i think all women should have something, it doesn't have to be exercise, although hopefully it would be, she said. just to take a moment for yourself.
dissent and politics runs in the family, said varma. their father's brother s.m. jafar was a renowned freedom fighter in lucknow, who had worked alongside mohandas gandhi and subhash chandra bose. their grandfather's brother syed ali zaheer was the law minister in jawaharlal nehru's first cabinet and india's ambassador to iran. their great grandfather was sir syed wazir hasan, a prominent jurist who served as the chief justice of the awadh court.

in 2003, he was forced to resign from espn after stating that philadelphia eagles quarterback donovan mcnabb was only receiving praise because the media was very desirous that a black quarterback do well. in 2004, limbaugh said the nba should be renamed the t.b.a. —the thug basketball association. he then added: stop calling them teams. call 'em gangs. he similarly whined that watching the nfl was like watching a game between the bloods and the crips without any weapons.

futuracha pro is poised to change that.
i'm engaging in more self-compassion practices.
death is tricky. i was brought up to believe that i'd never die. coming to terms with the idea of my own eventual death, and that of everyone i love, was difficult at age 13. as jehovah's witnesses, we saw our current existence as a sort of warmup ― a qualifying stage, perhaps. the main event would be paradise. but now, i recognize that i probably have just one shot at life. everything i want to achieve, i must do now, because there likely isn't another chance. the people whom i want to feel loved by me, i must love them now, as completely as i can. i remember those elderly jehovah's witness ladies, waiting forever for paradise, not marrying, not having careers or children. i will not wait for paradise. i am making my own right now.
if one has not seen any of dibitetto's videos, they are all a must see. beware they do have some crass language but definitely appropriate as a part of his amazing talented act. what makes dibitetto so funny is that his comedy seems effortless. he speaks from the heart and states, in his comedic way, what most are feeling.
the cause: it's not just a question of being tired all the time. there's also a sense of neglect that can build up when all of the attention is being lavished on the squalling newcomer in your home. because there's so much neglect and competition when a new baby is born, says luiz, that can arouse anything that's been unresolved.
the key is to agree on your goals and work together toward them. my husband, josh, and i like to make a date night out of our financial discussions. you know, that romantic time where you sit down to review your income, expenses, assets and debt and make sure you're on track to hit your goals? no, really! this is the top thing you can do to ensure you don't end up like 45 percent of couples who divorce over financial disputes, so make it fun. open a bottle of wine, get out your favorite board game, and when your financial chat is over, enjoy the feeling of accomplishment while you have some fun together. you're ahead of the game.
i don't do salons, said redhu, a photographer and visual artist who likes cutting her hair herself. the last time i went i asked for a men's hairstylist and told them to shave my head with a trimmer. i said they'd better charge men's prices! i don't think i've seen a lot of 35-year-old women with buzz cuts in india. with mine, i was trying to say that age is just a number.
in 2004, kentucky voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman. but in june 2015, the u.s. supreme court ruled the 14th amendment to the u.s. constitution guarantees same-sex couples have the right to marry. the ruling overturned same-sex marriage bans nationwide.
you can't always say yes to your partner — a healthy no is an important and wonderful thing. but happy couples adopt a yes mindset with each other wherever possible.
putin said last month russia would not legalize gay marriage as long as he was in the kremlin. he said he would not let the traditional notion of a mother and father be subverted by what he called parent number 1 and parent number 2.

students who attend byu in provo, south of salt lake city, agree to adhere to the code of conduct known as the honor code, and nearly all are members of the church. punishments for violations range from discipline to suspension and expulsion. the code bans other things that are common at other colleges, including drinking, beards and piercings.
wayo was unlike anyone i had ever met before. every word he uttered seemed to be kind, open and true. i had come from a cobwebbed world of sticky manipulations and here was someone who made being together easy. no ulterior motives. no schemes. he was just refreshingly honest. everything fell into place in such a perfect way, a part of me braced for it all to sour as affairs of the heart so often do ― at least for me, anyway.
there are various theories on the origins of the 50-minute therapy session and some reports that trace back to freud, becky stuempfig, a licensed marriage and family therapist in encinitas, california, told huffpost. there does not seem to be a consensus on exactly when the 'therapeutic hour' was established, but it has remained the industry standard.
if the registry is implemented in its current form, privacy experts warn, the government can use opaque algorithms to sift through reams of data and arbitrarily designate individuals as citizens or non-citizens. huffpost india has previously reported on how the use of such algorithms may have robbed millions of citizens of their right to vote in the telangana and rajasthan state elections in 2018.
it's ray who mentions the unpleasant odor in the folan home, which maureen and the audience know results from mag's pouring her urine in the kitchen sink rather than venturing to the unseen bathroom. (or it is an outhouse? could be, given this squalor.) mcdonagh has her witnessed indulging this habit relatively early in his script. mag denies the action, of course.
consider the alternates: social distancing with your ex could have been pretty terrible. let go of the pipe dream that self-quarantining with your ex would have brought you closer together or fixed any longstanding issues you had. stressful times don't usually lend themselves to positives like that. madden said she has a few clients who are still living together post breakup because they hadn't moved out before stay-at-home orders were established. it's generally not pleasant. some are even co-parenting and homeschooling together, she said. it's not easy: my advice to them is to create your own space if possible ― and move out as soon as you can. if you are still living together, it's especially hard if one ex suspects their former partner is talking to someone new: you can't ask any questions about new partners without looking jealous, even if you're legitimately asking because of covid-19 concerns, madden said. it's not a good situation. recognize that this gives you an opportunity to make a clean break. take the time to process the myriad emotions and feelings you have now. fall out of love, if you haven't already. mourn the relationship, good and truly. but eventually, make a concerted effort to see the few upsides there are to a breakup during a time like this. sometimes i do wish my ex was here, usually for reasons other than the breakup and pandemic, lee admitted. but i'm starting to see the distance and space as a means for a clean break.
even before i was a stripper, i was a stripper: free-spirited and exhibitionistic. i've been allergic to people controlling me since twerking my way out of the womb.
cameron: i really hope they can work it out and that they are working it out now.
they couldn't tell though, and i wouldn't have dared say it. i could barely admit it to myself back then. but time marches on, and i'm now happily married to my husband (despite what my 6th grade teacher would say about that). i made it out. still, i carried that sense of fear and isolation well into public high school. i grew depressed there. i never attempted suicide, but i certainly thought about it a lot. i wonder sometimes about the other lgbt+ students who went through immanuel christian school, before and after me. were they as resilient? have any killed themselves?
the project was coordinated by the ministry of rural development but conducted by three different government agencies: the ministry of rural development handled rural india, the urban census was carried out by the ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation, and the politically-sensitive caste census was administered by the ministry of home affairs: registrar general of india (rgi) and census commissioner of india.
connie and i have spent the last few months traveling around the country to make dignity of work a centerpiece of democrats' 2020 campaign, and we are so grateful to everyone who has welcomed us into their communities and into their lives, brown said in a statement, referring to his wife. we've seen candidates begin taking up the dignity of work fight, and we have seen voters across the country demanding it – because dignity of work is a value that unites all of us. it is how we beat trump, and it is how we should govern.
according to marriage therapists and dating experts, the best defense against divorce is having a keen eye for people who simply aren't cut out for marriage during the dating process.
winfrey's approach to managing challenges is one i apply all the time when i multitask. as part of her career advice on how to get through hard times, winfrey tells the stanford students, the way through the challenge is to get still and ask yourself, what is the next right move? not thinking about, 'ohh, i got all of this to —.' what is the next right move?
such profiling of the entire population, through seeding of aadhaar, was never our recommendation, said himanshu, associate professor of economics at jawaharlal nehru university (jnu), delhi, who was part of the sumit bose committee that recommended creation of the social registry in 2016.

we asked couples therapists to share the signs that it might be time to reevaluate your ldr.
the newlywed said that because she had never previously had a serious relationship, it contributed to the scary factor for her (she and bieber, 24, dated briefly a few years back, broke up then reunited as a couple last year).
i think the beauty of the phrasing is it sets us on the same track together, right from the start, he said. i'm not brainstorming solutions while she's trying to vent, or vice-versa. when you're on the same page, arguments are few and far between.
when we think things are worse than they are, or assume that because one bad thing happened that more bad things will happen, it can cause a lot of emotional turmoil, said robyn gold, a psychotherapist in private practice in new york city.

do you want orange or grape juice? my mom called out cheerfully as she dropped two frosted brown sugar cinnamon pop-tarts into the toaster the next morning.
the people you love are going to die.
so in the wake of my husband's infidelity and the philosophical renaissance it catalyzed in me, i found myself at a crossroads, wracked by cognitive dissonance. i understood intellectually that ethical non-monogamy could perhaps be a truer expression of love than traditional monogamy, but emotionally i was still bound to the traditions into which i was raised. disney princesses. happily ever afters. all or nothing. good or evil. true or false. i felt that familiar fear of abandonment ― of being replaced ― clawing at me.
i have been dating a man for the past 7 months and have recently moved in with him. we are blending our families (his two sons aged 11 and 7) whom he has 50% of the time and my two children (aged 4 and 8) whom i have full time. both of our prior relationships with our children's parents were very dysfunctional and we are both trying very hard to proceed in this relationship being careful not to repeat past mistakes.
kidman revealed the news in a recent interview with net-a-porter's the edit. while discussing her new show, big little lies, and her co-stars ― one of whom, zoë kravitz, is lenny's daughter ― kidman said she already knew the divergent actress because i was engaged to her father.

lil wayne has previously voiced his support for trump and endorsed him for a second term in office, posting a photo of the pair after a great meeting. trump also pardoned the rapper kodak black, who had also been prosecuted on federal weapons charges.

some american bishops have expressed concern that biden's policy positions will create confusion in the pews about church doctrine. gomez has said he plans to create a working group to address the matter.
no sentence is more worrisome to hear in a relationship than we need to talk. if you set up a time to talk, your partner is liable to go on the defense and bottle up his or her emotions; instead, pick a casual time to pursue the conversation, said kurt smith, a therapist who counsels men.
you may have had conversations about big-ticket parenting issues prior to baby: you weren't going to co-sleep, you were firmly team breastfeeding. that's all well and good, but once your little one arrives, you might feel differently. a baby can complicate even the best-laid plans, gatter said.
evan wolfson and mary bonauto, key figures in the fight for marriage equality, are the subjects of the new documentary the freedom to marry. wolfson and bonauto took their battle to the supreme court, ultimately securing this cornerstone of equal rights for same-sex couples.

there are no prizes for finding the negative in your very human loved one. the stresses of life can make you both more aware of your weaknesses.

online dating as a gay male is particularly difficult for those men whose bodies do not look a specific way, she said. all of this can take a toll on an individual's well-being and self-esteem.
although very painful and difficult, it is important for parents to take the step of explaining pregnancy loss to their children because even at a very young age, children can pick up on others' emotions, said becky stuempfig, a licensed marriage and family therapist.
for a moment, we're not living in the same groundhog day that has become that loathsome phrase of 'the new normal' anymore, said jenny maenpaa, a new york-based psychotherapist.
historical romances live in these tensions — the escapism of another time battling against the more enlightened social attitudes of the modern era; sheer fantasy coexisting with a critique of gender roles, or even the slave trade and colonialism. happily ever after has a tremendous amount of power that i think is subversive in many ways, said maclean. much of that has to do with telling stories in which women find joy and comfort rather than being harmed or neglected.
according to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. they encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and god, reads the abeka american history textbook. however, many conservatives and christians within america have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn america into a united, moral nation.
it is urgent and necessary for everyone — bishops, priests and lay people — to stop letting themselves be intimidated by the wrong-headed pleas, the theatrical productions, the diabolical lies and the fashionable errors that try to put down priestly celibacy, they write.

beads of sweat plop down onto my phone. i wish i had better lighting; the glare of my cell phone's flashlight makes the palm lines hard to see. i wonder how many drinks this man's downed. considering this is australia and it's $10 for all-you-can-drink, it's a miracle that he's still standing.
long-distance pairs have to work extra hard to stay in sync. when you're not seeing each other in person for months at a time, phone calls and video chats are your only opportunities to connect. occasionally rescheduling is not a big deal; sometimes things pop up. but if bailing on your phone dates turns into a pattern, it's worth bringing up your frustrations with your partner.
due to pregnancy, young children, work stress or aging parents, one partner might not be available for physical connection, she said. strong couples work through those challenges without going outside the relationship.
rep. mikie sherrill of new jersey and rep. haley stevens of michigan each received $2.2 million in support from bloomberg's super pac in 2018; in the past week, each has given him a glowing endorsement.
the proposal, officially called the protocol of reconciliation & grace through separation, still needs to be approved by delegates to the umc's general conference, which is scheduled to take place in minneapolis in may.
it feels easier to steer clear of certain subjects because we're scared of how our partner might react if we honestly express our feelings: will we be judged? hurt? rejected?
you both likely have leftovers from earlier relationships. if you understand your own history and seek to learn about your partner's, you'll stop repeating past mistakes. talking about your past will help you understand each other, and resolve guilt, fear and jealousy about past loves. learn about your similarities and differences, hopes and dreams. familiarity with what went wrong in the past will help you recognize problems before you repeat them. ― tina b. tessina

2. successfully resolve a big argument.
even in used condition, complete lego sets appreciate handsomely. my family has put together many of the sets we've purchased, but not all. many remain unopened and secure in a storage unit, with each set appreciating more and more every day.
hearing their stories of pain, the pain of attempting to put aside their feelings for each other, moved me deeply and made me wonder. if two people that devoted were not worthy to be members after coming to an acceptance of who they are, as the mormon church declared, what did that mean for someone like me? mostly it broke my heart. i happen to be blessed in a very happy marriage and cannot imagine living a life in which i was told that it was sinful for us to be together. i can't comprehend having to choose between the church i love and the person i love, and i won't judge another who is forced to make that decision.

meanwhile, limbaugh used his platform to condemn policies designed to actually help working class americans. he fervently opposed the expansion of public health care and said an obama-era health insurance program for low-income children ought to die. he condemned taxes against the ultra-rich, such as himself, and fled new york after the proposal of increased taxes on millionaires.

at the same time, she said, we don't want to see heroines who are marriage-obsessed and weak. she pointed to the scene in which daphne bridgerton punches a loutish suitor who attempts to compromise her, as a moment that would not have appeared in a regency romance even a few decades ago. i think it's a response to our audience needs, not to see women as simply in the service of strong, often wicked men, she said.

in fact, my clients often suffer from embarrassment due to their mental health status and the often-uncontrollable nature of their symptoms, she said. although some of the symptoms may appear to be melodramatic in nature to bystanders, there is no joy or attention-getting benefit in a dual diagnosis of anxiety and depression.
talk to a few folks with a hand in jennifer lopez's ascendancy, and you'll hear the same thing: everyone knew she'd be a star. that's easy to say in retrospect, a convenient pat on the back for showbiz veterans who love to be in the know. but the anecdotes about a young lopez brightening room after room sound similar enough to be believed.
meanwhile, negotiations and conversations between the government and the world bank's india office continued apace. but by march 2017, some officials in the ministry of rural development appeared unimpressed by the bank's suggestions.
when i was getting married, i assumed i would change my last name. my husband has a great last name; it didn't rhyme with my name nor was it too difficult to pronounce or spell. when our two year engagement was getting down to the wire though, i realized i actually had to make this commitment, which is when i did something really dangerous. get ready for this, and don't say i didn't warn you: i thought about the decision to change my name.

ladd, who was producing life, couldn't have anticipated what a calamity gigli would be when she and prestigious auteur robert altman (nashville) were debating whether to heed weinstein, who urged them to cast lopez. altman instead courted naomi watts (opposite paul newman as a brusque wyoming rancher who lends his battered daughter-in-law refuge). when weinstein later replaced altman with swedish director lasse hallström (what's eating gilbert grape), in turn losing the initial actors, he again advocated for lopez. by then, gigli was in the can but wouldn't hit theaters for another year. hallström was open to the idea right away, but newman's replacement, robert redford, wasn't quite as keen, ladd said. ever the dark horse, lopez was willing to convince anyone who needed convincing.
regardless of the scenario, whether it's a man or a woman hiding their secret, at some point, the pain of pretending to be someone they're not becomes greater than the transparent truth of living and being who they're meant to be.

oftentimes we aren't taught that it's ok to even have a need, let alone voice it. it's vulnerable to share how you're feeling, to ask for help, or to say, 'i'm feeling down, can i have a hug?' - lynsie seely, marriage and family therapist
after the initial clinical diagnosis, mary went on to have laparoscopic surgery to confirm the presence of endometriosis and to remove the lining from other parts of her body. the surgeon told her he removed endometriosis from 80 percent of her pelvic region, as it was affecting her bladder, appendix, ovaries, pelvic wall and the area near her rectum. the lining had also created an endometrioma, or large cyst, on mary's right ovary, pinning it to her pelvic wall.

at this point, 300,000 fewer births in one year, one time, isn't really that big of a deal for the broader economy and society as a whole, levine said. but you start finding yourself down close to a million births a year, for several years, so those trends continue, and that's going to have important implications for the country going forward.
the pope has long been a vocal advocate for refugees and has called on the nations of the world to take in as many refugees as possible. in december, francis gave 33 refugees from afghanistan, cameroon and togo a chance to build new lives in italy. their resettlement was financed by the holy see and by the community of sant'egidio, a catholic charity.
heather and brian are an unlikely couple. heather is a frenetic and disorganized actor-teacher. brian is as dependable as the hands of a clock. when their baby daughter, gracie, is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, the two must navigate her needs and their own differences. adding to this, just are they are settling into an understanding that a second child was out of the question and beyond [their] limited powers, harpham finds herself staring at a positive pregnancy test. there is no way for the family to know, of course, that this new son will be the key to saving gracie's life and their own. writes harpham, i know other parents in this hospital, on this ward, in this room ... have tried to lash their child, psychically to their own body with the twine of love, righteous anger, magical thinking, with anything, everything, they had. harpham does all this and more, bringing us along on her raw, real journey of healing—not just of her child but also of her marriage.
the more i listened, the more i began to heal. i started looking at myself more positively, understanding that i was not a terrible person, a bad partner, a breaker of people and relationships. it was as if by learning about james' transformation, i was experiencing my own kind of transformation. i forgave her for her anger, her abusive behavior and all of the trauma that i had experienced when she left me.
priscilla: i did do some laughing. lyonne has such a booming, debauched energy, she had me cracking up with her unorthodox pronunciation of the word cock-a-roach alone. i am mesmerized by her voice, which is part woman with a hole in her throat in an anti-smoking psa, part sing-songy clown at a kid's birthday party. her throwaway lines (this whole building used to be a school for jews!) become bizarre and memorable mantras. her movements are equally intoxicating and beguiling ― very cartoonish and grumpy old man, which seems to be her brand.

for real. my husband vic was the master of the remotes. the black one for on/off. gray one for volume. blackish-gray one for channel changing. or at least that's what i think they do. throw in a few remotes that used to control a dvr and the little basket that houses them overflows.

i was born into the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (or mormon church) and was an active member for most of my life. there are many things that i love about the lds church. it's where i was taught that people should love one another. it's where i learned about the value of honesty, integrity and the importance of helping others. it's where i was taught never to judge another person and that we are all flawed. living the life of an active member worked for me, but that was partly because all the people i loved most fit the mold of a church member the same way that i did ... until they didn't.

the temporary reprieve is not worth it. i'm telling her, i have eternal health care and it's free. doctors can give you a little temporary reprieve, but they cannot save you from physical death. the doctors who treat you, they die, too.
as far as the future goes, there are so many things i still want to do, but it all comes back to performing. that's my true love. there's absolutely no feeling in the world like when the house lights go down and you pop up on stage and everyone goes fucking berserk. in those seconds before the show starts, i'm like a racehorse in the starting gate. everything is electric. i still get nervous — if you don't have a little bit of nerves, then you've quit caring about your job. nerves are a sign that i still care about what i'm doing. but there's really nothing that compares to that rush of adrenaline that crashes over you the second you hit the stage. you could maybe compare it to a billion dollars or a really good game of craps or the best sex of your life — those four things are pretty hard to beat.

we woke up that morning feeling like the sun decided to shine extra bright for us that day. the roxbury pulled out all the stops for us and did everything in their power to make our day extra special. we were married by the owner, greg, at the base of stratton falls. the day looked nothing like our original big church wedding, but it was magical to speak our vows to one another against the backdrop of the rushing waterfall.
while most new parents need to focus much of their time, energy and resources on the newborn, it's important to recognize that you need to nurture yourself and your relationship once the baby is a couple of months old. there are many parents who struggle to go out on a date after having children due to financial constraints. it's important for partners to engage with one another as adults with a variety of interests other than their kids in order to keep the erotic energy going. you can have sex while your kids are sleeping, but if all you've been doing night after night is reading stories and cleaning up after dinner, the routine can become old and exhausting. it leaves little time to connect romantically and sensually with your partner.― sari cooper, sex therapist and director of the center for love and sex nyc

what sets jeffreys apart from his fellow neo-nazi podcasters is his oddly pleasant demeanor. unlike the jabbering cantwell, who has the on-air presence of archie bunker on meth, jeffreys delivers his sales pitch with a sing-song southern drawl that belies the inherent violence of his worldview. he prefaces holocaust-denying rants with a perfunctory my gosh!

then there's mullen's mag. the irony here for longtime beauty queen of leenane fans is that mullen appeared as maureen in the original production. now she's turned into her mother (as so many women eventually do, while men turn into their fathers) in the most impressive way. ceaselessly needling o'sullivan's maureen, she's savage. maybe the cruelest of her traits, though, are the pleased grins she lets slip (out of maureen's view) when she thinks she's one-upped her unfortunate daughter.
one partner will need to join the other for cuddling, sex and other intimate expressions of love and desire, howes said. they can trade off. sleep may be a problem, but affection doesn't need to be sacrificed as well.

justice clarence thomas wrote separately to say he would have used a different part of the 14th amendment to achieve the same result. thomas has long been a critic of the court's application of the due process clause, which also is found in the fifth amendment. he wrote that cases that employ the provision are some of the court's most notoriously incorrect decisions, including the abortion rights landmark case roe v. wade and the 1857 dred scott case that held that african-americans were not citizens.

for most women, comprehensive care is out of reach
i wanted to write for the young people living through this time and say something important to them ― something that matters, said sáenz, who is based in texas. it's not only the pandemic that makes us feel isolated. it's also our politics and our hate and our bigotry and our racism that work to disconnect us from each other. but these terrible and powerful discourses will not succeed if we stay in solidarity with one another and if we stay true to the beauty that resides within us all.

it allows you to incorporate your findings
for the better part of my journey, i remained mostly silent. maybe because even after decades of personal recovery, i still felt the societal shame that leaves so many too terrified to ask for help. or maybe i succumbed to the belief that people like me are expected to stay silent, hiding our authentic selves in some dark place.
the historical victims of lynching should not, as i do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda, he said.
we were immediately talking about what other projects we could do together because we all really did click and just had the best time working together, she said. i think we all are pretty obsessive and hold ourselves to a high standard, so when you get with other people like that it's kind of a relief. it's a group of quite nerdy actors who really love to work at the scenes, so you don't feel like you're dragging someone to a sunday rehearsal that they don't want to be at.
we have to talk about the twist halfway through, which really kicks the show's metaphysical search for answers into gear: while riding a plummeting elevator to one of her deaths, nadia learns that another man in the elevator, alan (charlie barnett), is caught in exactly the same loop as she is. i die all the time, he tells her wearily. what did you think of alan's introduction and what he brings to the show?

i managed to deflect—something like sorry, you're not my type—then i spent weeks afterward worried about what he was thinking about me. but he never brought it up. all the bullying took place in my head. the trauma for gay men is the prolonged nature of it, says william elder, a sexual trauma researcher and psychologist. if you experience one traumatic event, you have the kind of ptsd that can be resolved in four to six months of therapy. but if you experience years and years of small stressors—little things where you think, was that because of my sexuality?—that can be even worse. on tv i was seeing all these traditional families, james says. at the same time, i was watching a ton of gay porn. ... so i thought those were my two options. or, as elder puts it, being in the closet is like someone having someone punch you lightly on the arm, over and over. at first, it's annoying. after a while, it's infuriating. eventually, it's all you can think about. and then the stress of dealing with it every day begins to build up in your body. growing up gay, it seems, is bad for you in many of the same ways as growing up in extreme poverty. a 2015 study found that gay people produce less cortisol, the hormone that regulates stress. their systems were so activated, so constantly, in adolescence that they ended up sluggish as grownups, says katie mclaughlin, one of the study's co-authors.
i worshipped my big sister. we both loved bringing home stray animals and filling our home with those misfit pets, and she never tired of trying to teach me to be handy with tools no matter how hopeless i was. even though she often had dark, intense moods, i knew i could always charm my way to her tender side.

it's christopher's mother, isabella, who persuades the narrator to travel to greece; she's close with her son, but never approved of his marriage. in mani, the ground is scorched from fires, and the few landmarks away from the beach ― ancient churches, mostly ― are in disrepair. at the swanky seaside resort ― the same place christopher had been staying before he disappeared ― the narrator imagines her husband's dalliances with a young woman working at the front desk (his type). she imagines christopher hitching a ride with the same driver who carts her off to meet a professional mourner, under the pretense of working on a book about mourning herself. the lie affords her access to christopher's probable experiences from a few days prior. she speaks with a woman who, in keeping with an ancient tradition, is hired to offer lamentations at funerals, performing loss for those who are unable to do so, mired as they are in the stillness of grief.

i kinda figured maybe since i didn't get a chance to do it at the time, maybe it would be cool. back then, i never even thought that i had a chance to win, and we had just performed lose yourself on the grammys with the roots a couple of weeks before the oscars, so we didn't think it was a good idea. and also, back at that time, the younger me didn't really feel like a show like that would understand me.
when women and men will see through this behavior and egotism and not buy into it, we'll all be better off. in the words of pope francis,  let us never lose hope! there are also many strong, spirited men and women, a special breed who know better, and i've been blessed in having some around me. i thank them with all my heart for their great examples that they set, and for leading the way for all of us. their examples helped save my own marriage and family and i'll always be grateful.

if the plans of modi's bureaucrats and advisors are realised, this system will automatically track when a citizen moves between cities, changes jobs, buys new property, when a member of a family is born, dies or gets married and moves to their spouse's home. the interoperability of modern database systems means there is no technical limit to the extent of data that can be collected and indexed by this master database of databases. in a meeting on october 4, 2019, for instance, a special secretary of the niti aayog even proposed geo-tagging every single home and integrating it with bhuvan, a web-based geo-spatial portal developed by the indian space research organisation (isro).
we'd planned to get married in 2021 with about 100 or so guests on a friend's farm on a beautiful piece of land in virginia. the night we heard the news that ruth bader ginsburg had passed away, we were sitting in our living room, and i turned to richael and said, 'love, let's just get married.' and that was it. we planned everything within a few weeks. there was something about that stretch of time, with the new addition to the supreme court and growing uncertainty around the upcoming election, that moved us as an interracial queer couple and as two people deeply committed to social justice and liberation.
washington ― it's hard to keep up with everything going on in washington, but if there's one thing constantly humming along in the background, it's the republican effort to push through president donald trump's judicial nominees.
too often when a car cuts someone off, they end up in a line that isn't moving, their luggage gets lost, their flight is delayed, or they end up receiving an item that comes broken or destroyed, their first negative impulse is to say that this always happens to them. really? always? said toni coleman, a psychotherapist, relationship coach and divorce mediator in mclean, virginia.

as i discuss here, there is a lot to be concerned about when a partner is cheap, and particularly when they renege upon financial agreements. this man doesn't sound like he wants to split money evenly. he is generous with his own kids, providing them with a lot of christmas gifts, but with you, he is far from generous with you, financially or emotionally. he is dismissing your anger and sense of injustice about finances, which is emotionally hurtful.

in 2012, josh weed wrote a viral blog post in which he came out as a gay mormon who was very happily married to a straight woman. he wrote that his wife, a childhood friend, knew about his sexual orientation before they were married and that he decided to marry her because he believed in the doctrines of the mormon church, wanted to have a traditional family and genuinely loved his wife.
when we see the telltale signs of a period piece, we have reason to expect something that will submerge us in the era being depicted, in all its grit as well as its glamour. as jane hu wrote in a skeptical vulture review of netflix's other recent soothing period hit, the queen's gambit, the visually ornate period piece approaches something like a nostalgic fetishization of whiteness in decline. they should not make one feel: 'i want to go to there.' instead, the effect is more like: 'i can never go back there again.'
2. respect your individual and shared values. in long-term relationships and marriages, it is crucial to display unwavering respect for each other as well as your shared and individual core values. approach your partner from a position of character. trust, honesty, and empathy are action words. by placing the same level of sensitivity on issues important to your significant other, you are demonstrating how much you value the one that you love. in addition, the three words i am sorry can be more powerful than i love you.
after three months, holland decided to pop the same question he asked in 1955.
i said to jennifer the other day, 'oh, my god, one year ago we would have begged to be in this conversation and now we're passing on this movie,' she said. we're incredibly aware that this is a club that we've wanted to be a part of. we take nothing for granted.
i had been looking for work the months while living with carrie but not until i came to this realization did i find a job. it didn't pay much but it allowed me to move into my own place. and slowly, little by little, i've been able to build a life back up. i would love to say that carrie and i remained as close. we didn't. still, i will be forever grateful to her for everything she has done for me. she truly was my guardian angel--one who eventually taught me that i didn't need live in the shadows any longer.

i felt i was failing this innocent child i had just brought into the world. throughout the day, i would cry for seemingly no reason at all, but inside i kept thinking of all the ways a newborn could die and how horrible of a mother i was turning out to be. i didn't feel joy, and i didn't feel connected to my baby.
the senator said in her affidavit that she turned down the opportunity to be president donald trump's running mate because her husband hated any successes i have, the guardian reported on tuesday.
it is an interesting study of two very different men's responses to a system that's designed to serve them, waterston said. without a doubt, both the men in the story are in the privileged position of being able to have the final word, be the decision-makers in control of their partners, make each and every final decision on any matter regarding the home or other desires. obviously the whole thing is an imagined history, but i was moved by (the scriptwriters') choice to present one person who would've been permitted to be a much lousier husband [be more accepting]. the writers chose to go, sorry, there has always been a broad range of individuals and the individual does have the choice, regardless of how the system is set up. dyer is flawed and doesn't have the tools to communicate well, but he does respect his partner. 
and that was when it hit me, the enormity of the promise to be with someone for as long as you live. in one very small way, it was a gift, to have that chance to slow down and remember that we were in love with each other. how many people would take the time to reaffirm their commitment to their spouse while caring for a brand new baby? i know i certainly wouldn't have without prompting.

i had once smelled like chanel number 19. i had lived in a lovely two-story townhouse in pasadena with a zen garden. i was highly educated and had worked for one of the richest men in the world. in other words, while everything looked great from the outside, on the inside i was dying of alcoholism. i was married to a guy i'd met when we'd both worked at a hollywood studio--a guy who'd courted me, had sporadic and lousy sex with me for three years and then married me, at which point we had no sex at all. yes, i went through two different presidents without my husband probing my department of the interior.

an un-move may mean a temporary living arrangement. or you might find that separate spaces make sense in the long-term. this all might sound a tad unconventional, but who said your relationship needs to follow charted territory?
our immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.
as a practicing psychiatrist as well as a spouse of nearly two and a half decades, i am able to provide patients with guidance to navigate relationships. i accept love as an enormous, complicated tapestry. the tapestry of love is a mix of friendship, humor, support, and understanding. challenges, compromise, and acceptance do not destroy the tapestry, but instead are interwoven into the fabric to make it stronger and richer. with my own 25th wedding anniversary just around the corner, i feel inspired to share some lessons i learned along the way.
quality sleep is a thing of the past with a newborn. when your baby is teeny-tiny, count yourself lucky if you get more than two or three hours of shut-eye.
i was also a woman in love, who had left a yearslong abusive marriage and swore i would never get into another relationship like that again. so there i was, not seeing the red flags, believing that he loved me and would protect me. but when the red flags got too hard to ignore — he was telling me what to wear, making other women have sex with one another, i had to ask him when we could eat or use the bathroom — i was terrified. after years of dating and three weeks of living with him, i packed up my things and left.

then there's the money question. whereas romance novels are relatively cheap to publish, printed in the most inexpensive format (mass-market paperbacks) and typically garnering small advances for authors who churn out multiple volumes per year, the vision they conjure is decadent, over-the-top. there's a sumptuous world that has to be depicted, and it seems like that's a very expensive endeavor, matthew said. (bridgerton reportedly had an eye-popping budget.) on camera, the heroine's jewel-encrusted gown costs far more than some well-chosen keystrokes. the visual equivalent of a $7.99 mass-market volume calls for a prestige tv budget. and for a prestige tv budget, many viewers expect a period piece to be an ambitious work of art, not a faithful adaptation of a cheap paperback they might see in a grocery store aisle.
passing a comprehensive nondiscrimination law isn't just the right thing to do – it's crucial to the state economy, those companies and more than two dozen others wrote in a letter to legislative leaders. because many lgbtq and non-lgbtq workers prefer to live and work in communities with nondiscrimination protections, such a law will give virginia's employers tangible advantages in recruitment and retention.
clio is the central character of the ramblers. all three central protagonists are compelling, but for me it was clio's themes that formed the book's animating core. her mother haunts the narrative, and we hear her voice in the form of a letter towards the end. in their own ways, though, all three characters struggle to define themselves apart from strong family legacies. clio's mother's bipolar is the clearest example of this, but both smith and tate also wrestle with where they're from.
for research, kidman said she's been screening episodes of i love lucy, as the film will reportedly take place over one week behind the scenes of the classic sitcom as the couple face a crisis that could end their careers and another that could end their marriage.

it's only his second netflix special, but david letterman's new edition of (deep breath now) my next guest needs no introduction with david letterman already seems to be straining for effect. the guest this time is george clooney. it starts with the two of them standing outside an in-n-out burger joint in los angeles, munching burgers and fries — you know, just a couple of regular guys, you're supposed to think. that is, until an in-n-out employee comes out to give them chocolate milkshakes and they look at him as if this worker was a martian. the most these two wealthy showbiz fellows can summon in his presence is the idea that maybe one of them should have given the guy a tip. that's how celebrities look at you or me: maybe we should give this person a few bucks.
a zippy drama about new york strippers who fleece their male clientele after falling on hard times, hustlers harnesses lopez's power without sacrificing her vulnerability. she makes an entrance even splashier than the one from gigli, pole-dancing to fiona apple's criminal. as ramona, whom director lorene scafaria said would have cited j.lo as her style inspiration, she commands the film. like lopez, ramona constantly sells her personality in exchange for admiration. also like lopez, ramona is resourceful and bewitching, which makes the performance a clever extension of the actor inhabiting it. it also exemplifies the world-weariness that undergirds her screen presence. the role that is so well-suited it acts as a sort of destiny fulfilled.
since a new session of congress has begun, the senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the house that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.

as survivors, we deserved better. here we are, telling our stories, sharing our pain, while they profit from it, win awards, with no regard for our mental health.
for gay people, the effect is magnified by the fact that our minority status is hidden. not only do we have to do all this extra work and answer all these internal questions when we're 12, but we also have to do it without being able to talk to our friends or parents about it. for more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter. sign up john pachankis, a stress researcher at yale, says the real damage gets done in the five or so years between realizing your sexuality and starting to tell other people. even relatively small stressors in this period have an outsized effect—not because they're directly traumatic, but because we start to expect them. no one has to call you queer for you to adjust your behavior to avoid being called that, salway says. james, now a mostly-out 20-year-old, tells me that in seventh grade, when he was a closeted 12-year-old, a female classmate asked him what he thought about another girl. well, she looks like a man, he said, without thinking, so yeah, maybe i would have sex with her. immediately, he says, he panicked. i was like, did anyone catch that? did they tell anyone else i said it that way? this is how i spent my adolescence, too: being careful, slipping up, stressing out, overcompensating. once, at a water park, one of my middle-school friends caught me staring at him as we waited for a slide. dude, did you just check me out? he said.

i proudly proclaimed that i recognized that they tried their best, that what they did for me was more than enough, and that i loved them so much. the irony is not lost on me, that the same words i wanted to hear my whole life were the words i tearfully told them as a newly married woman.
how do you feel when you think about seeing that person again? if you can't contain your excitement, that may be a major red flag.
