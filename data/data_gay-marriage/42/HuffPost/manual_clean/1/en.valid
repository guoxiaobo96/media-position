@realDonaldTrump finally admits he wants to take away everyone's civil rights as directed by @Franklin_Graham and other #fakechristians #fakeevangelicals. — mhp_1776 (@mhp_1776) February 8, 2019
I don't feel that she has the empathy or the emotional experience to do a good job in this role, she said. Once again, we are looking at another Trump nominee that will do the exact opposite than what is required of the position.
JAKARTA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief on Wednesday criticized proposals in Indonesia's parliament to criminalize gay sex and extramarital sex, saying such laws could hurt the country's beleaguered LGBT community and other minorities.
California repealed the law against consensual sex between same-sex adults in 1975, and in 1997 created a way for those individuals to be removed from the California Sex Offender Registry. But neither step changed the original convictions.
A date for Goessling's nomination hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee has not been set.
Activists have raised concerns that, if approved, the new rules could violate basic rights and be misused to target minorities.
Gabbard's announcement comes as the coronavirus pandemic drastically changes the presidential race and other 2020 campaigns. The leading Democratic candidates — Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have been forced to suspend typical campaign fixtures such as rallies and door-to-door campaigning as cases of the disease have been reported in all 50 states.
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to women's equality, told HuffPost that Goessling is an unsuitable choice and wholly unqualified for the position.
Police in Aceh and elsewhere have stepped up raids on what they call gay spas and gay sex parties in recent months, detaining people on charges of violating strict anti-pornography laws.
As seen in the above Entertainment Tonight clip, Kody and Meri Brown's 21-year-old daughter, Mariah Brown, came out to her Mormon Fundamentalist family in the episode, which aired Sunday night. It's difficult to gauge from the clip how Mariah's family members reacted, though her words prompted some surprised looks for sure.
Suddenly, Corden had a mission: We've got to get them back together! It's the only way to fix all of this.
She said she endorsed Sanders at the time because he supported ending unnecessary wars.
That is not an exceptionally high priority of this administration, he said.
Michael McCormack, 53, on Monday took up the post as Australia's new deputy prime minister after the previous occupant, Barnaby Joyce, quit following weeks of controversy over his affair with a former staffer.
But Gabbard lagged behind much of the crowded 2020 field in polling over the past year, failing to win even 1% of the vote in Iowa or New Hampshire, the first two states to hold primaries.

A day before the episode aired, she seemed to hint at things to come in a Dec. 31 tweet.
Here's to hoping that the Browns put those actions into words and continue to support their daughter moving forward.
Newsom first gained national prominence in 2004 when, as San Francisco's mayor, he ordered officials to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The practice was overturned then but eventually became the law nationwide.
We don't hate gay, bisexual or transgender people. What we hate is their actions, and if we can prove their actions, they will be punished, Aceh governor Irwandi Yusuf told the small crowd.
Trump finally said something honest at the National Prayer Breakfast.
Gabbard, who has spoken out against interventionist wars in the past, was heavily criticized for a 2017 meeting with Assad on what her office called a fact-finding mission. She said had not initially planned to speak with Assad but when the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so, because of the possibility of achieving peace, Gabbard told CNN's Jake Tapper in 2017.
He needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.

Weber said the pardon helps leave Rustin's legacy in the civil rights movement uncompromised.
Critics say the law contradicts Bermuda's constitution, which protects against discrimination.
A national police spokesman confirmed that police chief Tito Karnavian had ordered the investigation.
Later in February, Arquette also called on followers to boycott Bermuda.
Some might find it to be an appealing idea, but we don't have any research that supports it, she said. What we do know is that women who purchase a handgun are more likely, in the days, weeks, months and years afterwards, to be the victim of homicide and suicide.
As the first female combat veteran ever to run for president and the first American Samoan member of Congress, she was neither a traditional Democrat nor a traditional candidate.
These brands and their business leaders should demonstrate true leadership and stand for those customers they've courted by helping to combat this harmful decision, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement.
Indonesia's parliament is also drafting revisions to the national criminal code that could ban all consensual sex outside marriage.
Michael Wyke/Associated Press Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) answers questions at a She the People presidential forum at Texas State University in April.
CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated with additional information to clarify that the Browns identify as Fundamentalist Mormons. That denomination is separate from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the mainstream Mormon church.
Australian's overwhelmingly voted yes in the national survey, and same-sex marriage was legalised in December last year.
There are a lot of challenges that are facing the American people that I'm concerned about and that I want to help solve, she told CNN.
Guns are, indeed, known to make domestic violence incidents more deadly. One study found that victims are five times more likely to be killed if their abuser has access to a gun.
Assad was accused by the United States and its allies of using chemical weapons to attack civilians during Syria's civil war. Gabbard, however, said she didn't think there was enough evidence to hold Assad responsible then and still doesn't now.
Gabbard also clashed with Hillary Clinton shortly before a Democratic primary debate in November. The former secretary of state suggested the congresswoman was being groomed by Russia. In response, Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against Clinton, alleging the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee lied about Gabbard with obvious malicious intent to hurt her 2020 presidential campaign.
Women's rights groups are sounding the alarm about President Donald Trump's nominee to head a key federal agency charged with reducing violence against women.
During the November debate, Democrats piled on Gabbard over her support for nationalist and authoritarian foreign leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, as well as her close ties to Fox News, Trump's favored news network.
Rustin was a great American who was both gay and black at a time when the sheer fact of being either or both could land you in jail, she said in a statement praising Newsom. This pardon assures his place in history.
The world is consumed with problems, James Corden lamented on The Late Late Show Monday night.

According to Variety, Mayor Pete promises to go behind the scenes of Buttigieg's historic victory in the Iowa caucuses, and show him and Chasten at their Indiana home.
Now, a pack of celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres, Tegan and Sara and Patricia Arquette, are calling to boycott the vacation hot spot ― at least until its residents make equality the law of the tiny land.
Whether or not the Browns would adhere to any of the mainstream Mormon church's stances on LGBTQ issues in any way is unclear. In a 2013 HuffPost Live interview, however, the family said they supported marriage equality. We have established our family the way we've chosen to, we've organized it the way we wanted to, Kody Brown said in that interview, which can be viewed below. We believe that all people should be allowed to have that right.
Indonesia's parliament is currently deliberating revisions to a Dutch colonial-era criminal code, including proposals to outlaw sex outside marriage, same-sex relations, and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated by law.
Sister Wives viewers will just have to wait until the show's Jan. 8 episode to see how the family comes to terms ― or doesn't ― with Mariah's sexuality. Of course, their devout faith could be an issue. As Fundamentalist Mormons, the family still practices polygamy, which has been explicitly rejected by the mainstream Mormon church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) dropped out of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race on Thursday and offered her full support to former Vice President Joe Biden in his bid for the White House.
Prior to his chat with Meyers, Buttigieg briefly alluded to his personal connection to O'Hare in December, while accepting the nomination to serve as transportation secretary under President Joe Biden.
Legislators responded by creating the Domestic Partnership Act, which allows same-sex couples to form domestic partnerships, not marriages, and claims to offer such partnerships equal rights. Same-sex couples who are already married in Bermuda can remain married.
Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population but Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, is the only province that enforces Islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.
While welcoming McCormack's apologies, just.equal spokesman Rodney Croome called on him to walk the talk and support initiatives to help LGBTQI Australians overcome isolation, prejudice and suicide in parts of rural Australia.
He would be correct. They are leading the abolition of civil rights today. https://t.co/LmqOmEB5XJ — Rep. Poncho Nevárez (@poncho_nevarez) February 7, 2019
Discussions of (revisions to the criminal code) betray strains of intolerance seemingly alien to Indonesian culture that have made inroads here, Zeid told a news briefing, adding that he believed the proposed rules were discriminatory.
However, Gabbard reversed her public position on LGBTQ rights.
He served 50 days in Los Angeles County jail and had to register as a sex offender before returning to his home state of New York. He died in 1987.
Appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers this week, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor shared select anecdotes about his nearly three-year marriage, including the reason he opted for a somewhat unlikely location ― Chicago's O'Hare International Airport ― to pop the question in 2017.
Trump credited people of faith with the 'abolition of civil rights'??? pic.twitter.com/lo7eKcUus8 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) February 8, 2019
Some LGBTQI rights activists have expressed concern over McCormack's elevation to the office of Deputy Prime Minister.
Gov. Gavin Newsom pardoned Rustin for his arrest in 1953 when he was found having sex with two men in a parked car in Pasadena. He was in town as part of a lecture tour on anti-colonial struggles in West Africa.
Gabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.
Noting that she had very close LGBTQ friends, Robyn added, All adults should be able to choose who they love, and how they structure their family.
In the days after the historic vote, former Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie urged Gabbard to resign her congressional seat. Abercrombie, a Democrat who served nine terms in the House from 1993 to 2010, expressed concerns that Gabbard had been unable to juggle her responsibilities as a member of Congress and her presidential campaigning.
Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, said that when she reviewed Goessling's background, she was overcome with a sense of fear.
Rustin was stripped of his leadership post at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist organization involved in the civil rights movement, after U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina read Rustin's arrest file into the Congressional Record.
She supported transitioning to 100% renewable energy. She wanted to get rid of tuition and fees at four-year public universities, and she supported free community college for everyone. She also advocated for raising the federal minimum wage to $15.
I haven't felt good about anything since 2013, Corden said. Barack Obama was the president. Same-sex marriage was legalized. Justin Bieber bought a monkey. I mean the list is endless.
Smeal said she was especially concerned with Goessling's record on guns. In 2008, Goessling authored an amicus brief arguing that firearms help protect women from violent attacks, and quoted a researcher who wrote that women who are confronted with a sexual assault are significantly less likely to experience a completed rape if they resist with a weapon.
After the emotional episode aired, Mariah thanked viewers for their support on Twitter.
Smeal noted that domestic violence affects people of all classes, ethnic groups and backgrounds.
I told him [marriage] would be a lot like being in the airport, Buttigieg recalled. Life with me would be hard to steal private moments, but also full of adventure. Luckily for me, he said yes.
Corden's band leader, Reggie Watts, responded: 2013 was pretty cool. It's just a shame that the Jonas Brothers split up.
Don't let anybody tell you that O'Hare isn't romantic, he quipped.
I know that not everybody understands that O'Hare can be a romantic place, but it absolutely can, Buttigieg said Monday. The first time Chasten and I ever communicated was on this app called Hinge, and he was sitting at Gate B5 at the airport. ... I always remembered that, in a certain technical sense, even though it was remotely, that was where we first met.
Some audience members at this year's annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington likely did a double take when President Donald Trump hailed people of faith for their abolition of civil rights.
Dozens of protesters on Friday staged an anti-LGBT rally outside a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh.
But he also urged Jakarta to address past atrocities - like the 1965 massacre of nearly half a million suspected communists - and human rights abuses in the easternmost province of Papua, and the use of the death penalty.
Still, in November 2015, the Mormon Church adopted new, rigid guidelines on same-sex couples. Under those guidelines, any Mormon in a same-sex marriage would be deemed an apostate, or having abandoned the religion, and subjected to disciplinary hearings that could lead to excommunication.
The Hawaii representative was the only member of the House to vote present on the two articles of impeachment during the December vote to impeach President Donald Trump. She later explained that she could not in good conscience vote either yes or no on the two articles.
The revisions have broad support in parliament, where few politicians have stood up for LGBT rights for fear of alienating a largely conservative voter base ahead of legislative and presidential elections next year.
Gabbard did two tours of duty in the Middle East and is currently a major in the National Guard. She went on to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee for over six years. Gabbard was also the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee until 2016, when she resigned in order to endorse Sanders' presidential campaign.

Same-sex couples have until the end of May to wed there before the new measure goes into effect. The self-governing British territory became the first to reverse its stance on the issue, according to GLAAD, as countries increasingly move to legalize marriage between people of any gender.
In California and across the country, many laws have been used as legal tools of oppression, and to stigmatize and punish LGBTQ people and communities and warn others what harm could await them for living authentically, Newsom said in a statement. He thanked those who pushed for Rustin's pardon and encouraged others in similar circumstances to seek a pardon to right this egregious wrong.
Shannon Lee Goessling, a Republican, is under consideration to lead the Office on Violence Against Women, which administers grants to support victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Advocates say Goessling has limited experience working in the domestic violence field, and has a history of opposing rights for LGBTQ people and immigrants.
Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith, Trump declared in his speech Thursday.
Less than a year after legalizing marriage equality, Bermuda passed a law last month to ban same-sex marriage once again.
Many officials in President Widodo's government have said LGBT people, like other citizens, should be free from discrimination and violence. But top officials, including the president, have said that Indonesia's cultural and religious norms do not accept the LGBT movement.
Touting his personal love of transportation, he said: Travel in my mind is synonymous with growth, with adventure, even love ― so much so that I proposed to my husband Chasten in an airport terminal.
She had a meager showing on Super Tuesday, the most important day of the Democratic primary race. Her most successful contest was in American Samoa, an unincorporated U.S. territory where she was born.
Both O'Hare and United Airlines commemorated the site of the Buttigiegs' first meeting and subsequent engagement with heartwarming photos on social media.
Actor Bradley Whitford called for a boycott last month, shortly after the news broke.
The LGBTQ segment of the global tourism industry is significant and growing, according to a 2017 report by the World Tourism Organization, which states that locations supportive of LGBTQ rights are (unsurprisingly) appealing to LGBTQ travelers.
Bayard Rustin was a confidant of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a key organizer of the March on Washington in 1963. He also helped plan other nonviolent protests and boycotts to end racial discrimination.
Religious police and vigilantes in the ultra-conservative province often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia's national police chief has ordered an investigation into the detention of 12 transgender women in the province of Aceh, officials said on Friday, after reports that they were stripped, beaten and forced to cut their hair before being released without charge.
With roughly 29% of the support, she finished a distant second in the territory's caucuses, behind former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who garnered about 50%. Bloomberg ended his presidential bid a day later.
Zeid, a member of the Jordanian royal family who has been in the U.N. post since 2014, said Indonesia was among the most progressive states in Southeast Asia on human rights.

In 2018, Gabbard introduced the No More Presidential Wars act, a resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from Congress in order to engage the military against any enemy. She also introduced a resolution that would make a presidential war an impeachable offense.
A father of three, McCormack was elevated to the post after he was elected leader of The National Party ― a move which automatically makes him deputy prime minister thanks to a long-standing agreement with conservative coalition partner, The Liberal Party.
If confirmed, as the head of the Office on Violence Against Women, Goessling would have a large influence over which domestic violence and sexual assault programs get funding, Smeal said, and which issues take priority.
Given her views, which are most obvious from her tenure at Southeastern Legal Foundation, we are very worried about her ability to enforce the Violence Against Women Act, and to understand all the complexities of the communities that it serves, Smeal said.

However, Susan Sorenson, a gun violence researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that Goessling's brief relied in part on research that is more than 30 years old.
He issued an executive order creating what he called a new clemency initiative to identify those who might be eligible for pardons and swiftly consider those applications. He encouraged Californians to apply for clemency for people they believe meet that criteria.
There were photos circulated that led us to suspect that there had been physical action taken against the suspects, Misbahul Munauwar, a spokesman for Aceh police, said. The national police chief has instructed us to investigate those photos and to determine if there was any...procedural or ethical violation.

During Goessling's time at Southeastern Legal Foundation, the group filed an amicus brief arguing in favor of same-sex marriage bans, and sued the governor of Alabama for offering driver's license exams in languages other than English.
Generations of LGBT people — including countless gay men — were branded criminals and sex offenders simply because they had consensual sex, Wiener said in a statement praising Newsom's actions. This was often life-ruining, and many languished on the sex offender registry for decades.
Abercrombie pointed to Gabbard's present votes and frequent absences from the Hill as examples of this imbalance.
The last time Congress officially declared war was Dec. 8, 1941, the day that the United States entered World War II, she said at a news conference. Ever since, Congress has failed to uphold this constitutional responsibility and has ceded this power to the president ― presidents of both parties.
I have grown and learnt not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique, he said at the time.
The parliamentary commission drawing up recommendations has still to finalize its proposals, but a draft seen by Reuters includes measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated.

The California Legislature's LGBTQ and black caucuses last month asked the Democratic governor to pardon Rustin.
Police in North Aceh raided hair salons - where transgender people often work - last weekend and briefly detained 12 individuals. Rights activists and media reports said they were forced to cut their hair and were stripped and beaten.
GLAAD has called on tourism businesses to speak out against Bermuda's reversal on marriage equality.
President Barack Obama honored Rustin posthumously with a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013 for the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and King's famous I Have a Dream speech.
Last year, the provincial and central governments drew international condemnation after authorities in Aceh tried two young men on charges of engaging in gay sex and then publicly caned them - the first such case in the country.

Australia's new deputy prime minister is being called on to heal the wounds left by a shocking anti-LGBTQI rant he penned 25 years ago.
McCormack replaces Barnaby Joyce, who made global headlines last year when he threatened to execute Johnny Depp's dogs and more recently when he was forced to quit the role of deputy prime minister following weeks of controversy surrounding his extra-marital affair with a former staffer who is now pregnant.

With that, Corden and Watts were off on a caper involving kidnapping and an encounter with Dr. Phil.
Human Rights Watch and other rights groups welcomed the move, which comes amid a rising tide of hostility against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.
There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, Gabbard said on CNN when she announced her run for office in January.
We have learned a lot about sexual assault and other violence against women in the intervening decades, she said. The person who is most likely to sexually assault a woman is a man she knows — and resistance takes a different form when it's someone you know.
Currently, Indonesian law does not regulate homosexuality, except in the ultra-conservative Islamic province of Aceh.
Bermuda's Supreme Court ruled in May 2017 that a registrar's decision to deny a marriage license to a same-sex couple was discriminatory, legalizing marriage equality in the socially conservative Atlantic territory.
That's probably not exactly how the president intended to put it.
Newsom's office could not say if other states have taken similar steps.
This is a top job, for God's sake, Smeal said. You should have a person here who has experience in this field.

Officials at O'Hare have taken notice of Buttigieg's rare affection for the world's sixth-busiest airport. In December, the airport thanked the transportation secretary on Twitter for appreciating all the connections we make possible, and pledged to work with him as we continue to make our airport lovable for decades to come.
McCormack issued a fresh statement in August last year apologizing for the editorial. When he issued the August apology, he was small business minister and had ministerial responsibility for the same-sex marriage postal vote.
On Wednesday, pop duo Tegan and Sara sent a tweet saying they were thinking of our friends in the LGBTQ community in Bermuda, and encouraged followers to support efforts to overturn the policy.
Things took a surprising turn on the Jan. 1 episode of Sister Wives when a member of the TLC reality show's polygamist family announced she was a lesbian.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's governor announced Wednesday that he is posthumously pardoning a gay civil rights leader while creating a new pardon process for others convicted under outdated laws punishing homosexual activity.
Trump's announcement about Goessling's nomination noted that she previously worked as the director of the Crimes Against Women and Children Prosecution Unit in Atlanta after almost a decade as a state prosecutor. However, her LinkedIn page indicates she only held that position for nine months.
Some worry the law will create problems for Bermuda's $431 million tourism industry. Cruise lines registered in Bermuda ― including Carnival's Cunard, P&O Cruises and some Princess cruises ― will not be able to host same-sex marriages regardless of where the ships travel, CNBC reported.
Sorenson said she is unaware of any current research that supports the idea that a woman who resists with a weapon is less likely to be sexually assaulted.
She also came under fire for her former anti-LGBTQ views. Gabbard worked with her father at The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, a political action committee aimed at opposing lawmakers and legislation that promoted gay rights.

Two years after that initial 2015 exchange, the couple were visiting O'Hare before embarking on a vacation, where Buttigieg had planned to propose. And as it turns out, air travel turned out to be a fitting metaphor for their relationship.
Newsom noted that police and prosecutors nationwide at the time used charges like vagrancy, loitering and sodomy to punish lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people.
The apologies Mr. McCormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he has stepped in to, he needs to walk the talk, Croome said in a statement.
The hateful rhetoric against the LGBT community that is being cultivated seemingly for cynical political purposes will only deepen their suffering and create unnecessary divisions, he said.
Rustin's close friends knew he was gay, but his religious and political associates distanced themselves after his arrest, Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblywoman Shirley Weber told Newsom on behalf of the caucuses.
Check out the video below to see what Corden did when he came face to face with Nick ... Kevin ... this guy.
In each of these different communities, there [are] different complexities. The person who runs the office must not only understand that, but also be sympathetic to it, she said. We're worried that a vote for her would exclude LGBTQ and immigrant survivors from protections and resources.
In a statement last year, the White House pointed to Goessling's record as a district attorney in Georgia, where she prosecuted crimes against women and children in the 1990s. From 2004 to 2015, she was the executive director and chief legal counsel of Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest law firm and policy center with a record of advocating for gun rights and religious freedom.
She said she regretted the views she previously held and noted her recent support of LGBTQ legislation. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey, she said in January.
Meanwhile, Pete and Chasten's love story will soon be making its way to the small screen. On Monday, Amazon Studios announced plans to release Mayor Pete, a documentary directed by Jesse Moss that will examine Buttigieg's 2020 campaign as the first openly gay presidential hopeful from a major party.

No matter, because some gleeful Twitter users enjoyed another opportunity to chortle at an apparent Trump gaffe. Amid the religious right's efforts to limit such rights as abortion access and same-sex marriage, others concluded that the president may have seen the light.
In addition to distributing grants, the Office on Violence Against Women is meant to give victims a voice on the national stage, said Richard Gelles, professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
I think that the evidence needs to be gathered, and, as I have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such, Gabbard said at a CNN town hall in March.
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said he had raised the issue with President Joko Widodo during a three-day visit to the world's largest Muslim-majority country, where hostility toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community has risen sharply in recent years.
