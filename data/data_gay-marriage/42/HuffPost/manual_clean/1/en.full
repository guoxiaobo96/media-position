They found that the gay kids didn't have a greater number of stressful life events (i.e. straight people have problems, too), but the ones they did experience inflicted more harm on their nervous systems. Annesa Flentje, a stress researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, specializes in the effect of minority stress on gene expression. All those little punches combine with our adaptations to them, she says, and become automatic ways of thinking that never get challenged or turned off, even 30 years later. Whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. We don't have the tools to process stress as kids, and we don't recognize it as trauma as adults, says John, a former consultant who quit his job two years ago to make pottery and lead adventure tours in the Adirondacks. Our gut reaction is to deal with things now the way we did as children. Even Salway, who has devoted his career to understanding minority stress, says that there are days when he feels uncomfortable walking around Vancouver with his partner. No one's ever attacked them, but they've had a few assholes yell slurs at them in public. That doesn't have to happen very many times before you start expecting it, before your heart starts beating a little faster when you see a car approaching.

All the bullying took place in my head. The trauma for gay men is the prolonged nature of it, says William Elder, a sexual trauma researcher and psychologist. If you experience one traumatic event, you have the kind of PTSD that can be resolved in four to six months of therapy. But if you experience years and years of small stressors—little things where you think, Was that because of my sexuality?—that can be even worse. On TV I was seeing all these traditional families, James says. At the same time, I was watching a ton of gay porn. ... So I thought those were my two options. Or, as Elder puts it, being in the closet is like someone having someone punch you lightly on the arm, over and over. At first, it's annoying. After a while, it's infuriating. Eventually, it's all you can think about. And then the stress of dealing with it every day begins to build up in your body. Growing up gay, it seems, is bad for you in many of the same ways as growing up in extreme poverty. A 2015 study found that gay people produce less cortisol, the hormone that regulates stress. Their systems were so activated, so constantly, in adolescence that they ended up sluggish as grownups, says Katie McLaughlin, one of the study's co-authors.", "augmented": []}

We replay our social failures on a loop. The weirdest thing about these symptoms, though, is that most of us don't see them as symptoms at all. Since he looked into the data, Salway has started interviewing gay men who attempted suicide and survived. When you ask them why they tried to kill themselves, he says, most of them don't mention anything at all about being gay. Instead, he says, they tell him they're having relationship problems, career problems, money problems. They don't feel like their sexuality is the most salient aspect of their lives. And yet, they're an order of magnitude more likely to kill themselves. The term researchers use to explain this phenomenon is minority stress. In its most direct form, it's pretty simple: Being a member of a marginalized group requires extra effort. When you're the only woman at a business meeting, or the only black guy in your college dorm, you have to think on a level that members of the majority don't. If you stand up to your boss, or fail to, are you playing into stereotypes of women in the workplace? If you don't ace a test, will people think it's because of your race?

{"original": "You should subscribe. SIGN UP The researchers I spoke to explained that gay guys inflict this kind of damage on each other for two main reasons. The first, and the one I heard most frequently, is that gay men are shitty to each other because, basically, we're men. The challenges of masculinity get magnified in a community of men, Pachankis says. Masculinity is precarious. It has to be constantly enacted or defended or collected. We see this in studies: You can threaten masculinity among men and then look at the dumb things they do. They show more aggressive posturing, they start taking financial risks, they want to punch things. This helps explain the pervasive stigma against feminine guys in the gay community. According to Dane Whicker, a clinical psychologist and researcher at Duke, most gay men report that they want to date someone masculine, and that they wished they acted more masculine themselves. Maybe that's because, historically, masculine men have been more able to blend into straight society. Or maybe it's internalized homophobia: Feminine gay men are still stereotyped as bottoms, the receptive partner in anal sex. A two-year longitudinal study found that the longer gay men were out of the closet, the more likely they were to become versatile or tops.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Researchers say this kind of training, deliberately trying to appear more masculine and taking on a different sex role, is just one of the ways gay men pressure each other to attain sexual capital, the equivalent of going to the gym or plucking our eyebrows. The only reason I started working out was so I would seem like a feasible top, Martin says. When he first came out, he was convinced that he was too skinny, too effeminate, that bottoms would think he was one of them. So I started faking all this hyper-masculine behavior. My boyfriend noticed recently that I still lower my voice an octave whenever I order drinks. That's a remnant of my first few years out of the closet, when I thought I had to speak in this Christian Bale Batman voice to get dates. Grant, a 21-year-old who grew up on Long Island and now lives in Hell's Kitchen, says he used to be self-conscious about the way he stood—hands on hips, one leg slightly cocked like a Rockette. So, his sophomore year, he started watching his male teachers for their default positions, deliberately standing with his feet wide, his arms at his sides. These masculinity norms exert a toll on everyone, even their perpetrators. Feminine gay men are at higher risk of suicide, loneliness and mental illness. Masculine gay men, for their part, are more anxious, have more risky sex and use drugs and tobacco with greater frequency.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "One study investigating why living in the gay community increases depression found that the effect only showed up in masculine gay guys. The second reason the gay community acts as a unique stressor on its members is not about why we reject each other, but how. In the last 10 years, traditional gay spaces—bars, nightclubs, bathhouses—have begun to disappear, and have been replaced by social media. At least 70 percent of gay men now use hookup apps like Grindr and Scruff to meet each other. In 2000, around 20 percent of gay couples met online. By 2010, that was up to 70 percent. Meanwhile, the share of gay couples who met through friends dropped from 30 percent to 12 percent. Usually when you hear about the shocking primacy of hookup apps in gay life—Grindr, the most popular, says its average user spends 90 minutes per day on it—it's in some panicked media story about murderers or homophobes trawling them for victims, or about the troubling chemsex scenes that have sprung up in London and New York. And yes, those are problems. But the real effect of the apps is quieter, less remarked-upon and, in a way, more profound: For many of us, they have become the primary way we interact with other gay people. It's so much easier to meet someone for a hookup on Grindr than it is to go to a bar by yourself, Adam says.", "augmented": []}

Even relatively small stressors in this period have an outsized effect—not because they're directly traumatic, but because we start to expect them. No one has to call you queer for you to adjust your behavior to avoid being called that, Salway says. James, now a mostly-out 20-year-old, tells me that in seventh grade, when he was a closeted 12-year-old, a female classmate asked him what he thought about another girl. Well, she looks like a man, he said, without thinking, so yeah, maybe I would have sex with her. Immediately, he says, he panicked. I was like, did anyone catch that? Did they tell anyone else I said it that way? This is how I spent my adolescence, too: being careful, slipping up, stressing out, overcompensating. Once, at a water park, one of my middle-school friends caught me staring at him as we waited for a slide. Dude, did you just check me out? he said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "You have to use the apps in smaller cities, says Michael Moore, a psychologist at Yale. They serve the purpose of a gay bar. But the downside is that they put all this prejudice out there. What the apps reinforce, or perhaps simply accelerate, is the adult version of what Pachankis calls the Best Little Boy in the World Hypothesis. As kids, growing up in the closet makes us more likely to concentrate our self-worth into whatever the outside world wants us to be—good at sports, good at school, whatever. As adults, the social norms in our own community pressure us to concentrate our self-worth even further—into our looks, our masculinity, our sexual performance. But then, even if we manage to compete there, even if we attain whatever masc-dom-top ideal we're looking for, all we've really done is condition ourselves to be devastated when we inevitably lose it. We often live our lives through the eyes of others, says Alan Downs, a psychologist and the author of The Velvet Rage, a book about gay men's struggle with shame and social validation. We want to have man after man, more muscles, more status, whatever brings us fleeting validation. Then we wake up at 40, exhausted, and we wonder, Is that all there is? And then the depression comes.", "augmented": []}

It feels like I'm scratching an itch, but it's scabies. It's just going to spread. The worst thing about the apps, though, and why they're relevant to the health disparity between gay and straight men, is not just that we use them a lot. It is that they are almost perfectly designed to underline our negative beliefs about ourselves. In interviews that Elder, the post-traumatic stress researcher, conducted with gay men in 2015, he found that 90 percent said they wanted a partner who was tall, young, white, muscular and masculine. For the vast majority of us who barely meet one of those criteria, much less all five, the hookup apps merely provide an efficient way to feel ugly.

In our lifetime, the gay community has made more progress on legal and social acceptance than any other demographic group in history. As recently as my own adolescence, gay marriage was a distant aspiration, something newspapers still put in scare quotes. Now, it's been enshrined in law by the Supreme Court. Public support for gay marriage has climbed from 27 percent in 1996 to 61 percent in 2016. In pop culture, we've gone from Cruising to Queer Eye to Moonlight. Gay characters these days are so commonplace they're even allowed to have flaws. Still, even as we celebrate the scale and speed of this change, the rates of depression, loneliness and substance abuse in the gay community remain stuck in the same place they've been for decades. Gay people are now, depending on the study, between 2 and 10 times more likely than straight people to take their own lives. We're twice as likely to have a major depressive episode. And just like the last epidemic we lived through, the trauma appears to be concentrated among men.

That was the idea I had, too, Salway says, that gay suicide was a product of a bygone era, or it was concentrated among adolescents who didn't see any other way out. And then he looked at the data. The problem wasn't just suicide, it wasn't just afflicting teenagers and it wasn't just happening in areas stained by homophobia. He found that gay men everywhere, at every age, have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, incontinence, erectile dysfunction,⁠ allergies and asthma—you name it, we got it. In Canada, Salway eventually discovered, more gay men were dying from suicide than from AIDS, and had been for years. (This might be the case in the U.S. too, he says, but no one has bothered to study it.) We see gay men who have never been sexually or physically assaulted with similar post-traumatic stress symptoms to people who have been in combat situations or who have been raped, says Alex Keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the Fenway Institute's Center for Population Research in LGBT Health.", "augmented": []}
