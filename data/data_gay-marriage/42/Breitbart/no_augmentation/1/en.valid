Here's the icing on the forcibly-baked-by-threat-of-imprisonment-same-sex marriage cake: Rankin is a 30+ year career diplomat from the British government, propelled into high office by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government in 2003 when he became Britain's Consul-General in Boston. He has since served in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Nepal, and now in Bermuda.
Steven Samuel Grantham – President Trump granted a full pardon to Steven Samuel Grantham. This pardon is supported by Mr. Grantham's friends and family who praise his moral character, Acting Attorney Jeffrey Rosen, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Grantham was convicted in 1967 for stealing a vehicle. He received 18-months imprisonment, and 2 years' probation. Since his conviction and release from prison, he has demonstrated remorse and accepted responsibility for his crime, which he committed approximately 50 years ago when he was just 19 years old. Mr. Grantham has lived a law-abiding and stable life. Most notably, he stepped in and assumed custody of his grandchild when the child's parents were unable to care for him. He now seeks a pardon for forgiveness and to restore his gun rights.
Scott Conor Crosby – President Trump granted a full pardon to Scott Conor Crosby. Mr. Crosby is supported by Senator Martha McSally, the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Mesa, Arizona, and the Bishop of his church, all of whom attest to Mr. Crosby's service to his community and upstanding character. In 1992, Mr. Crosby made a 'spur of the moment' poor decision to participate in a co-worker's plan to commit a bank robbery. Mr. Crosby was arrested the same day and cooperated with the authorities. Since his release from prison, he has spent significant time volunteering at his church, mentoring youth, and has earned a certification as an Emergency Medical Technician. Mr. Crosby's civil rights were restored by the State of Arizona in 2003, and this action restores his Federal civil rights.
I'm not surprised by the continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward . . . She's shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections — her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins, McCain said in a statement released to the Arizona Republic late Tuesday.
Paul VI was pope from 1963 to 1978 and oversaw the close of the Second Vatican Council, which introduced sweeping changes in the church, including the introduction of the use of local languages in the liturgy and a rapprochement between Catholics and other religions, notably the Jews.
An Argument for the Death Penalty

Democrats are opposing Nielson because of his work defending traditional marriage at the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2013, as well as his work at OLC defending presidential power to subject enemy combatants to enhanced interrogation. He is a partner at Cooper & Kirk, the powerhouse law firm headed by one of the most accomplished lawyers in the nation, Chuck Cooper, who headed OLC as its assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and Attorney General Ed Meese.

Riddle me this: How much white supremacism can there be in America when the long-dead Kate Smith has to be disinterred for a Two Minute Hate? Good grief, there is so little racism in America, we are forced to dig up corpses just so we can have something to virtual signal at. And even then, the racism charge is still a hoax. Kate Smith was no racist.
Also, eventually, the blight moves outside the cities and into surrounding areas. Let me put it this way… If you do move to the suburbs, be prepared to move again the moment you see graffiti. Graffiti is always the beginning of the end.
First off, the so-called boost in hate crimes is a hoax based solely on the fact that more agencies have been added to those reporting hate crimes.
To be fair, though, Alyssa Milano's sex strike, her refusal to have sex with anyone until she gets her way on abortion would have been a legitimate crisis … in 1998.
The Return of Back Alley Abortions
Similar to Hungary, Bulgaria has erected a border fence on the Bulgarian-Turkish border to prevent illegal immigration. Both barriers are lined along the top with barbed wire and guarded by border patrol.
If we know that more teens are waiting to have sex today than 25 years ago, then shouldn't we be reinforcing those healthy decisions and building upon that? HHS asked. Similarly, we know that teen pregnancy rates have decreased and yet sexually transmitted diseases and infection have increased to record levels. There's something going on there, and we need to learn what it is and to make sure we make some amendments to the messages we're communicating, because we can't be satisfied with those numbers.
Lynn Barney – President Trump granted a full pardon to Lynn Barney. This pardon is supported by Senator Mike Lee, as well as numerous notable members of the Utah business community. Mr. Barney was sentenced to 35 months in prison for possessing a firearm as a previously convicted felon, after having previously been convicted for distributing a small amount of marijuana. Since his release from prison, Mr. Barney has been a model citizen and has devoted himself to his work and children.

The miniature aircraft will spin its rotors at about ten times the speed of a terrestrial one, due to the extremely low density of Mars' atmosphere — only about one percent of Earth's. JPL Mars Helicopter Project Manager MiMi Aung explained that the altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet [12,000 meters], and when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet [30,000 m] up. Therefore, designers had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.
Most young women – and the general population of the United States – are no longer as supportive of abortion as were the old guard feminists in the 60s and 70s.
The section in my book about Mike Pence begins with that quote from Lincoln where he says, Both sides in great contests invoke God, think and hope that God's on their side. Both may be, and one must be, wrong, Buttigieg told Father Edward Beck in a wide-ranging interview on faith and public service for CNN. The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit.
Planned Parenthood's ideas about sex education have been exposed on other occasions.
Eliyahu Weinstein – President Trump commuted the sentence of Eliyahu Weinstein.

The reason I recommend Rural America is because Democrats hate Rural America. They want their foofoo theaters and their foofoo cafes and their foofoo nightclubs. Rural America is Red America… I love it out here. Calm, peaceful, serene… Not a single drop of this social justice madness has touched my community.
The first slaves we brought to Bermuda in 1620, oppressed, segregated, discriminated against… And that is why leaders like Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Barack Obama have not just fought for race rights, but they have fought for rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.
Bloomberg's radical transgender agenda included supporting the Do No Harm Act that would gut the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's provision to protect Americans right to live and act according to their religious convictions.
Fred Keith Alford – President Trump granted a full pardon to Fred Keith Alford. This pardon is supported by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Alford was convicted in 1977 for a firearm violation and served 1 year's unsupervised probation.

Attorney and writer Jane Robbins observed at the Witherspoon Institute's Public Discourse:
The previous administration tried an approach that just didn't work, the HHS official said. And our commitment requires that we change that approach.
It saddens me because when I think about the blessings of marriage, first of all it's one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional, the 37-year-old said. It is morally one of the best things in my life. Being married to Chasten makes me a better person. I would even say it moves me closer to God.
However, that agreement would severely undermine U.S. sovereignty, as explained in a legal white paper from Americans United for Life in 2010:
I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for something that was wrong, she said, sharing the story of how she found herself as a divorced single mother of five children after 19 years of marriage. She admitted that she became addicted to gambling, lost her job, and lost a 12-year-old son in a scooter accident.
According to ABC News' translation, the lyrics urge the viewer to be a trustworthy youth.
In the survey of 1,700 Americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, Abortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.
The paper was prepared by canon lawyer Vincenzo Turchi, which served to throw some doctrinal heft behind the pope's sometimes casual statements on the subject.
I've lived in the south for nearly 20 years and my interracial marriage has never brought my wife and I so much as a double take.

A California bakery owned by Christians has been forced to take down its website and social media accounts after a bombardment of criticism and a boycott followed their decision not to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding involving two lesbians.
They should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.
Salomon Melgen – President Trump commuted the sentence of Salomon Melgen. This commutation is supported by Senator Bob Menendez, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, numerous members of Brigade 2506, Col. Mark D. Holten, as well as his friends, family, and former employees.

Numerous patients and friends testify to his generosity in treating all patients, especially those unable to pay or unable to afford healthcare insurance.

Mr. Ashley was convicted and sentenced to 3 years in prison for bank fraud. Notably, Mr. Ashley's sentencing judge said, I don't have any concern that you are not truly remorseful. I know that you are a changed man. Since his conviction, Mr. Ashley has spent time caring for his ailing mother and paying his debt back to society.
This is a really vital time, I think, the artist said during her acceptance speech. I want Planned Parenthood to start coming out of the closet, and I want to take our cues and inspiration from the marriage-equality movement.
Trump's list also included many nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to prison.

Tommaso Buti – President Trump granted a full pardon to Tommaso Buti. Mr. Buti is an Italian citizen and a respected businessman. He is the Chief Operating Officer of a large Italian company and has started a successful charitable initiative to raise funds for UNICEF. More than 20 years ago, Mr. Buti was charged with financial fraud involving a chain of restaurants. He has not, however, been convicted in the United States.
Marriage and cohabitation have been on the decline since 1990, according to Pew, which projects that one-in-four millennials will never marry. In addition to the decline in marriage, Pew also cites the economy as a central fact causing the adults' retreat to mom and dad's house — simply put, fewer young men have decent jobs.
All Cuomo is doing here is prepping a battlefield CNN wants to see bloodied.
The media cannot defeat Trump in 2020 based on the mostly positive results of his policies; they cannot argue against the first era of peace and prosperity we've enjoyed in almost two decades, so they're trying to stress us out with these absurd hoaxes even though the planet is cooling, eggs are 98 cents a dozen, and our guys are not dying in futile overseas wars.
Minter photographed Cyrus, now 23, as if she was behind a steamy shower door.

Beginning with a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of early 2000s American punk-pop, the video features its stars in various public settings encouraging the listener to participate in communist society as the Party decrees, whether at school, in the workplace, or playing sports. The stars lead business meetings, study in libraries, and grocery shop, the implicit message of the video being that only by obeying the Party can a young person have access to the necessary resources to participate in society.
He's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, Noel Tichy, the author of a 1993 book on Welch and a former leader of GE's vaunted training programs, said in 2001. He'll make snap judgments. He's a human being that has temper tantrums.
Bloomberg also supports passage of the Equality Act, which would bar governments and sports organizations from recognizing the biological/physiological difference between men and women and replace it with gender identity.
Moreover, the Act would exclude people from the careers and livelihoods that they love, just for maintaining the truth of their beliefs on marriage and sexuality and discriminate against individuals and religious organizations based on their different beliefs, they argue.

In his discussion with Beck, Buttigieg took aim at Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation that Pence, then governor of the state, signed into law in 2015. The law allows both individuals and business to assert as a defense in legal proceedings that their religion has been burdened. The small town mayor called it a license to harm others in the name of religion.
It will be used, he wrote presciently, to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.
Adrianne Miller – President Trump commuted the remaining sentence of Adrianne Miller. This commutation is supported by former U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman and the Clemency for All Non-Violent Drug Offenders (CAN-DO) Foundation. Ms. Miller has served 6 years of a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and possession of a list I chemical. Ms. Miller, who has struggled with drug addiction, has fully committed to rehabilitation while in prison.

McDaniel was reacting to an initial draft of the McCain resolution that included inflammatory language about both Cindy McCain and her late husband, Sen. John McCain. That language was removed from the resolution that will go to a vote in two weeks. The chairman of the Republican Party nationally understands that the chairman of the Republican Party locally is a complete goofball, said Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general and longtime McCain family friend. . . Sen. McCain was censured by the state party in 2014. He went on to win re-election two years later, defeating current party chair Kelli Ward in the GOP primary.
Luis Gonzalez – President Trump commuted the sentence of Luis Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez is a 78 year-old non-violent drug offender who has served more than 27 years of a life sentence.

Mr. Gonzalez has an upstanding prison record and has worked for UNICOR for over 20 years producing military uniforms.
In order to be admitted to this meta-religion, the only price the Church would have to pay is giving up her truth claim, the cardinal told the students. No big deal, it seems, as the relativism dominant in our world anyway rejects the idea that we could actually know the truth and presents itself as guarantor of peace between all world views and world religions.

Allen condenses the Church's opposition to gender theory into three bullet points, all contained in Turchi's talk:
You need to keep a close eye on what your school is teaching because the left only wants to teach your kids to engage in loveless sex, the sanctity of abortion, why America is evil, that men are women and women are men, and that Global Warming is real. (It's not.)

Some of the headlines on the 2012 blog read:
We will be happy and free when in the spirit of love we embrace the form of life to which God has called each one of us personally: in the sacrament of marriage, in celibate priesthood, or in religious life according to the three evangelical counsels of poverty, obedience and chastity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, he said.

When you have a sense of entitlement, it's extremely dangerous, Crews said. What entitlement does is it gives you self-pity. And self-pity — it feels good. It feels good.
Steven Benjamin Floyd – President Trump granted a full pardon to Steven Benjamin Floyd. This pardon is supported by Representative Mark Green. Mr. Floyd joined the United States Marines Corps at age 17 and earned a combat action ribbon in Iraq. He pled guilty to one count of bank robbery by extortion. Since his release from prison in 2009, Mr. Floyd has exemplified the power of second chances, and is raising a family and owns a successful car repair business. Mr. Floyd's dedication to service includes helping extinguish fires set during the recent unrest and repairing widows and disabled veterans' cars free of charge.

This pardon is supported by former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Sigmund Sig Rogich, Jason Greenblatt, Michael Steinhardt, Wayne Allyn Root, Salvador Moran, the Aleph Institute, and numerous members of Mr. Odzer's religious community. Mr. Odzer pled guilty to conspiracy and bank fraud, for which he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Numerous individuals testify to his substantial philanthropic and volunteer activities. His philanthropic endeavors include providing personal protective equipment to front-line workers in New York City hospitals; visiting sick children in hospitals; and donating religious materials to prison inmates and U.S. Service Members around the world. He has also dedicated resources to support and build synagogues in memory of his late cousin who was kidnapped and killed by Muslim terrorists while in Israel. The pardon requires Mr. Odzer to pay the remainder of his restitution order.

Overall, and as I said earlier, the left is eating its own. Let them fight. Enjoy the show. It's a total waste of time to try and care about people more than they care about themselves. Democrats are getting the blue on blue violence they voted for. It's not your problem. It's not my problem.

This commutation is supported by Caroline Bryan, Luke Bryan, Ellen Boyer, Amy Davis, Kim Davis, Brandon McWherter, Sheila McWherter, Dr. Jeff Hall, Dr. Brad Maltz, Brent Ford, Mark Lotito, Keri Rowland, Mark Rowland, and Stephen Stock.

It was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion, he said. Like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now? Making it easier to harm people in its name?
The rest is history, as video of her case made it's way on Twitter to celebrity Kim Kardashian, who shared it on Twitter and brought her case to the attention of President Trump.
The practice of unregistered polygamy appears to be more commonplace than might be expected, Dame Louise said. The existence of matchmaking sites like secondwife.com and the prevalence of unregistered marriage is particularly concerning.
Speaking to The Daily Wire, Benham said, This is selective enforcement of the law. You are coming after us because we're standing in front of an abortion clinic … I am not going to let the government have unlimited power and use this crisis to their advantage. Benham says his federally recognized public charity, Cities For Life, is considered an essential service. However, police officers claimed that more than 10 people had gathered, an accusation that Benham denied.
This isn't an easy one to accomplish. I know because I've done it twice already. But you have to get out. The Democrats that run these cities did not only stand by as their cities were burned and looted, as predominantly black neighborhoods were burned and looted by predominantly white, left-wing terrorist groups like Antifa — these Democrats encouraged and continue to encourage burning and looting.

After a nosey member of the community found out Shelly Fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. Not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. For 15 years, Shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School (RHS), a Catholic High School in Indiana. And when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. They gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. Shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. And she plans to hire a lawyer. But should she have to? The school says they have every right to force Shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the Catholic Church both in and out of school. That includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.

On March 19, two other young men were injured when Conditt changed his tactics. This time a tripwire bomb exploded — sending the two men to a local hospital.
They're a bunch of babies. College is supposed to prepare you for the real world, not shield you from opposing opinions, and safe spaces do exactly that. Who doesn't want as an undergrad Chick-fil-A on their campus? I would have killed for a c on my campus when I was at Duquesne, he said.
When Jesus died the sun hid its face in shame because of what happened, Ogebe said. Now the world should hide its face in shame because it has forgotten the 195 girls that are still missing.

BOSTON (AP) — Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric Co. into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate and parlayed his legendary business acumen into a retirement career as a corporate leadership guru, has died. He was 84.
It is surely no coincidence that Pope Francis had cited this same quotation in a positive sense just days before Christmas in an address to the Roman Curia, calling for epochal change while insisting that resistance to change always hides some mental disorder.
In a similar case the following year, Mr Justice Holman said: I have been told there are a number of incapacitated adults who have been the subject of arranged or forced marriages and that it is important to send a strong signal to the Muslim and Sikh communities that arranged marriages, where one party is mentally incapacitated, simply will not be tolerated.
A month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. It was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.

The editorial board further condemns what it calls Trump officials engaging in savvy rebranding of teen sex ed programs by using innocuous sounding terms like 'sexual risk avoidance' and 'healthy relationships.' The editors do not apparently take offense, however, at the abortion industry's attempt to smooth over the elective ending of an unborn child's life by defining the procedure as women's health care.
Paul Erickson – President Trump has issued a full pardon to Paul Erikson. This pardon is supported by Kellyanne Conway. Mr. Erickson's conviction was based off the Russian collusion hoax. After finding no grounds to charge him with any crimes with respect to connections with Russia, he was charged with a minor financial crime. Although the Department of Justice sought a lesser sentence, Mr. Erickson was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment—nearly double the Department of Justice's recommended maximum sentence. This pardon helps right the wrongs of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American History.
This is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.
They should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.
The previous administration tried an approach that just didn't work, the HHS official said. And our commitment requires that we change that approach.

I was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work, she wrote.  I did what I thought was right. But I made the mistake of immersing myself completely in his world.

Hostility toward proponents of traditional marriage was foreseen by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in his potent dissent of the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that made gay marriage the law of the land.
DeWayne Phelps – President Trump commuted the sentence of DeWayne Phelps. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Phelps has served 11 years in prison for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. He has served over a decade in prison with clear conduct, has trained as a dental apprentice, participated in UNICOR, and is noted as being a reliable inmate capable of being assigned additional responsibilities. Most notably, Mr. Phelps's sentence would unquestionably be lower today under the First Step Act.
My friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic, Cruz tweeted. If NC deems abortion 'essential,' then pregnancy care services are as well. This is WRONG; Governor Cooper should be ashamed.

2.) It wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about Obamacare. He also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.
Shame doesn't say you did something bad, shame says you are bad, he said. And when you think and believe that you are bad, there's no way out. You say: 'You know what, forget it, I might as well use drugs, I might as well overeat, I might as well use porn.' Because if you believe that are bad, then you act accordingly. What you have to change is that paradigm in your life, you have to believe that you are good.
Lambda Gay-Straight Alliance, the LGBT student organization on campus, considers Chick-fil-A's commitment to traditional marriage potentially offensive to gay students, despite the obvious fact that no one is required to patronize the restaurant who doesn't want to.
These are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.
Conservative David Benham was arrested outside of a clinic in North Carolina over the weekend for allegedly violating the state and federal coronavirus rules.

The fascist mob is going to declare certain toys, books, movies, and television shows problematic, and these corporations, that are either cowardly or infested with social justice warriors, are going to disappear these things. Problematic books, movies, and TV shows will vanish off proverbial store shelves — physical and digital.
Just this week, the far-left Washington Post demanded an immediate and total shutdown of all police movies and TV shows.
We will be happy and free when in the spirit of love we embrace the form of life to which God has called each one of us personally: in the sacrament of marriage, in celibate priesthood, or in religious life according to the three evangelical counsels of poverty, obedience and chastity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, he said.

This commutation is supported by Professor Alan Dershowitz, Pastor Darrel Scott, Rabbi Zvi Boyarski, The Aleph Institute, Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, Gary Apfel, and Bradford Cohen. Mr. Ashley was convicted and sentenced to 3 years in prison for bank fraud. Notably, Mr. Ashley's sentencing judge said, I don't have any concern that you are not truly remorseful. I know that you are a changed man. Since his conviction, Mr. Ashley has spent time caring for his ailing mother and paying his debt back to society.

Kane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was handcuffed in court and led out a side door. She will remain in custody until she posts $75,000 cash bail, higher than she had previously posted.
MaryAnne Locke – President Trump commuted the sentence of MaryAnne Locke. Ms. Locke has served roughly 11 years of a nearly 20 year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. Despite the difficulties of beginning her sentence just 6 weeks after having a Caesarean section, her prison record has been exemplary, with extensive programming and work. Ms. Locke was authorized to work outside the perimeter of the prison, and was granted home confinement under the CARES Act last summer. Today, she lives with her father, is building a relationship with her children, and works fulltime at a major retail store.
Aside from the conviction, Kane's political career will be remembered for her investigation of pornography that she said was being traded on state computers by judges, lawyers and other public employees. Two state Supreme Court justices resigned amid the fallout.

Evidence showed that numerous of these offenses involved him carrying BB guns rather than genuine firearms. While incarcerated, Mr. Vernon has worked steadily, programmed well, and recovered from a bout of cancer.
But Cuomo already knows this. Fredo's watched Antifa assault police offers, assault journalists, terrorize Tucker Carlson's wife, assault everyday people simply enjoying their right to assemble, and like the Southern Democrats of old, he's watched Antifa bully a black woman out of a restaurant.

This is how intolerant the left and media are — they don't even want one buoy in their ocean of lies.
She added, This means that he's looking for a nominee who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women. That's what's at stake in this one. And then from there, so much more. This is about health care cases that are percolating up through the courts, including the one we know about right now about pre-existing conditions. This is about the swing vote in our environmental protections, whether or not giant corporations are going to have the right to poison the water and foul the air. This is about workers' rights and whether or not the Supreme Court is going to stay on the path of trying to bust unions. This is about voting rights, whether or not democracy fundamentally works in this country. This is one of those moments where Justice Kennedy has been the swing vote. Look, I'll be blunt, he swung a lot of times in a direction I don't like, but he's been a swing vote. He was the one who helped stand up for equal marriage. All of that is now at risk—whether he, Donald Trump, gets to replace the swing vote with somebody off a pre-approved extremist list.
To gin up this lie, media outlets, most especially CNN, are spreading provably false statistics — lies easily debunked by anyone who can Google.
This is what we do not know about Mark Conditt. Police are continuing to investigate the young man's background and his Pflugerville home to search for clues as to why Conditt would suddenly launch a bombing attack that would kill two people, injur six others, and eventually take his own life.
Pope John Paul II spent the first five years of his 27-year papacy explaining the theology underlying Humanae Vitae in a series of weekly addresses in what he described as a theology of the body.

Mr. Nelson is serving a mandatory 20 year sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of 5 kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. Following the First Step Act's changes to the definition of serious drug felony, Mr. Nelson would no longer receive a mandatory minimum term of 20 years' imprisonment. Instead, he would likely face a 10-year sentence. He has already served more than 11 years in prison. Throughout his incarceration, he appears to have demonstrated commendable adjustment to custody.

When I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, 'So how exactly are you running the company?' Jack was still in it – committed to GE's success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling, said GE's current CEO, Larry Culp.
States should focus on funding public schools, not private ones—especially not ones that maintain anti-LGBTQ+ policies. We must ensure every kid—especially LGBTQ+ kids—can get a high-quality public education. https://t.co/hxKap5Ofjm — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 26, 2020

Pacquiao backed down on a Facebook video, stating: I'm sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals. Please forgive me for those I've hurt. But in an Instagram post, he simply stated:
Chris Young – President Trump commuted the remaining sentence of Chris Young. This commutation is supported by the Honorable Kevin H. Sharp, Mr. Young's sentencing judge, former law enforcement officials and Federal prosecutors, and multitudes of criminal justice reform advocates, including Alice Johnson, Kevin Ring, Jessica Jackson Sloan, Topeka Sam, Amy Povah, the Aleph Institute, Mark Holden, Doug Deason, and David Safavian, among others. Mr. Young, who is 32 years old, has served over 10 years of a 14 year sentence for his role in a drug conspiracy. Although initially sentenced to a mandatory life sentence that Judge Sharp called not appropriate in any way, shape, or form, Mr. Young has made productive use of his time in prison by taking courses and learning coding skills. He also has maintained a spotless disciplinary record. Mr. Young's many supporters describe him as an intelligent, positive person who takes full responsibility for his actions and who lacked a meaningful first chance in life due to what another Federal judge called an undeniably tragic childhood. With this commutation, President Trump provides Mr. Young with a second chance.

He has maintained clear conduct while incarcerated and has notably taken advantage of significant vocational programs, including an electrical apprenticeship. He receives outstanding work reports and is described as hardworking and respectful by the Bureau of Prisons staff. Mr. Canady takes full responsibility for his criminal actions and would like to find gainful employment to help support his children.

David Benham posted a video of his interaction with police on the brothers' Facebook page.
Overturning Roe v. Wade means the states get to decide on the legality of abortion, which means it will always be legal somewhere. With all the government money they receive, I'm sure Planned Parenthood will be able to offer a free bus pass with every child murder.
Amy Povah – President Trump granted a full pardon to Amy Povah, the founder of the CAN-DO (Clemency for All Non-violent Drug Offenders) Foundation. In the 1990s, Ms. Povah served 9 years of a 24 year sentence for a drug offense before President Clinton commuted her remaining prison sentence in 2000. Since her release, she has become a voice for the incarcerated, a champion for criminal justice reform, and was a strong advocate for the passage of the First Step Act.

She is extremely remorseful, regrets her destructive choices and has taken full responsibility for her actions.
The social credit system is an all-encompassing control method in which the government assigned a numerical value to the credit of a person to society. The number is based on both loyalty to the Party and general courtesy in public – both political dissidence and general misbehavior, such as littering or jaywalking, could hurt a person's score. The consequences of a low score make it harder for a person to participate in society by limiting access to flights, trains, and public transportation or depriving people of access to government services.
In a strongly worded letter to the U.S. Congress, the bishops assert the Equality Act would impose novel and divisive viewpoints regarding 'gender' on individuals and organizations while dismissing sexual difference and falsely presenting 'gender' as only a social construct.

In a forceful statement, the Nigerian Anglican primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, said that the Anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.
Sorry, decent people do not split hairs to excuse, champion, and encourage evil. Decent people remember that every one of history's monsters, from Hitler to Lenin to Castro to Pol Pot, believed they were fighting a good cause — some even believed they were fighting against bigotry and for social justice. So let's use this opportunity to examine Cuomo's definition of social justice.
Some people in the Church are longing for a Catholicism without dogmas, without sacraments, and without an infallible magisterium, Müller proposed.
Six years ago, almost to the day, I was roundly laughed at for warning people to hold on to their hard copies of Blazing Saddles and Gone with the Wind.
This, to me, is the dumbest crisis of them all. To begin with, none of the tariffs Trump has so far raised have had any effect on consumer prices or economic growth. In fact, in almost every area, our economy is doing much better than our lousy experts predicted last year.
On Tuesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel issued a statement opposing the censure resolution of McCain.
As President Obama's last year in office winds down and he comes to the realization that he won't be able to close the Guantanamo Bay terrorist detention facility like he promised in 2008, he's been busy transferring inmates to other countries as a fallback plan. This month, Obama has sent Osama bin Laden's alleged bodyguard to the country of Montenegro.
Johnson thanked the president for commuting the sentences of three other women that she singled out for a second chance last week, noting that she had become the face of criminal justice reform.
Pacquiao had responded to an inquiry from the TV5 network in which they asked celebrities about same-sex marriage, which he opposes. He asserted, It's just common sense. Have you seen any animal having male-to-male or female-to-female relations? Adding that even animals understand gender differences, he opined, if you have male-to-male or female-to-female [relationships], then people are worse than animals.
Corporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.
The editorial board further condemns what it calls Trump officials engaging in savvy rebranding of teen sex ed programs by using innocuous sounding terms like 'sexual risk avoidance' and 'healthy relationships.' The editors do not apparently take offense, however, at the abortion industry's attempt to smooth over the elective ending of an unborn child's life by defining the procedure as women's health care.
Mary Roberts – President Trump commuted the sentence of Mary Roberts. Ms. Roberts has served 10 years of a 19-year sentence for a non-violent drug offense.

Upon her release, Ms. Roberts plans to spend time with her daughter and enjoys strong support from her family. In addition, she has various employment opportunities available.
During his college years, Conditt appears to have written some conservative blog posts as part of an assignment, NBC News reported. The blog, Defining My Stance, provided a platform for a host postings ranging from anti-gay marriage to his positions on free abortions to why sex offender registrations should be ended. The posts were allegedly authored by a Mark A. Conditt, but NBC News said they were unable to confirm with school officials if the bomber actually wrote the posts.
The goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.
I love my wife very much, Fitzgerald said. I didn't have any intention to resign a job that I adore. For me to walk out was like saying I didn't want to be there anymore and that wasn't the case.
Actually, this is the opposite of a constitutional crisis; this is the constitution at its best: the war is political and legal as opposed to physical.

However, his daughter did not have others take standardized tests for her and she is currently earning a 3.9 GPA at the University of Southern California. Mr. Zangrillo is a well-respected business leader and philanthropist.

Report: Ex-Labour Councillor and Immigration Lawyer Asama Javed Is Forced-Marriage Fixer for Girls as Young as 15 https://t.co/FChON70O39 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018
We don't think the Nigerian government is doing anything much about rescuing the girls, Seshugh Akume of the Bring Back Our Girls organization, told USA Today on Thursday. We are disappointed.
One of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.
And Welch freely acknowledged his mistakes. One was Calma, a computer design firm that GE bought in 1981. The company wound up losing $50 million annually until GE sold it in 1988.
Benedict Olberding – President Trump granted a full pardon to Benedict Olberding. Mr. Olberding was convicted on one count of bank fraud.

After completing his sentence, he purchased two aquarium stores, as well as a consulting business to train prospective mortgage brokers.
Blanca Virgen – President Trump commuted the sentence of Blanca Virgen. Ms. Virgen has served 12 years of a 30 year sentence. Rather than accept a plea offer of 10 years, Ms. Virgen exercised her constitutional right to trial and received triple the amount of time the government offered her to plead. She has received countless achievement awards from her educational programming in prison. Upon her release, Ms. Virgen will return home to Mexico to care for her four children.
Crews also cautioned both men and women to take more responsibility to combat the problem.
The pope has repeatedly warned against the dangers of ideologies that separate sexual identity from biology, decrying gender theory as against the nature of things. It seems, Allen writes, that folks at the Vatican have picked up on Francis' war on gender theory and have decided to throw themselves into the fray.
But soon after, people—and public figures—started getting behind Planned Parenthood publicly, she said. Lena Dunham was one of the first, and all the women who contributed to her PSA, and then Miley [Cyrus], and now Marc [Jacobs]. Maybe he'll convince other companies to support, too.
The Arizona Republican Party will vote on resolutions to censure Cindy McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, when it meets on January 23.
Welch moved to Boston after his career at GE, living in a townhouse in the city's Beacon Hill section.
In his homily, Müller told the students that the antidote to secularization within the Church is a life of faith, since people of faith do not crave the gratifications that the world offers.
Dirty Little Secret Posted by Terry Crews on Thursday, February 11, 2016
I had a family, and they would tell me that visiting me in prison was like visiting a graveyard because they would come and see the place where my body lay but they could never ever take me back home again, she said.
When you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule.
A separate resolution to censure Flake cites his opposition to President Trump's re-election, and a third resolution to censure Ducey cites his failure to remove emergency coronavirus pandemic restrictions.

My issue was and is with pornography is it changes the way you think about people. People become objects, people become body parts, they become things to be used rather than people to be loved, Crews said. You start to use people, you start to feel like you're the man and they're just whatever.
Ferrell Damon Scott – President Trump commuted the sentence of Ferrell Damon Scott. This commutation is supported by former Acting United States Attorney Sam Sheldon, who prosecuted his case and wrote that he … strongly does not believe that [Mr. Scott] deserves a mandatory life sentence. Ms. Alice Johnson, the CAN-DO Foundation, and numerous others also support clemency for Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott has served nearly 9 years of a life imprisonment sentence for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Under today's sentencing guidelines, it is likely that Mr. Scott would not have received such a harsh sentence.
For years, Tastries has been referring gay customers who want a wedding cake to a competitor called Gimmee Some Sugar, so they can receive the service they ask for.
Quite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he added. We're not here to buy up or change or take over Denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. We're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of Denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.

This is typically followed by an extended journey to a Boko Haram base in the forest where the girls are forced into early marriage and sexual slavery, UNICEF reported.
The poison paralyzing the Church is the opinion that we should adapt to the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, and not the spirit of God, he said, that we should relativize God's commandments and reinterpret the doctrine of the revealed faith.
Bloomberg said in a statement on his campaign website:
From the beginning of the Trump administration, Democrats have continually criticized current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos for not having worked as a regular public school teacher. Most Democrat 2020 candidates have represented the views of the teachers' unions whose leadership has condemned the administration's support for school choice, viewing it as a threat to public schools.

He has mentored incarcerated individuals and taught business classes to those in prison—including at the prison where he was incarcerated. Mr. Smith has also been heavily involved in mission trips throughout Latin America.
I have been honored to stand with the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for equality and justice, from New York, where we won marriage equality in 2011, to states across the country. That fight – true to our nation's highest ideals – has achieved historic progress, but we still have a long way to go. As president, I will work to protect every member of the LGBTQ+ community from hatred, violence, and discrimination. We will close disparities in health care access and quality, stop violence against transgender people, and advocate for equal rights across the world. We cannot settle for anything less – and I won't.

Upon his release, he has a job offer and will help care for his six children and three grandchildren.
I guess it's a good thing Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy is backing off her claim we will all die in 12 years, but she's still assuring us Global Warming is a real threat that will kill us, but you'll have to pardon me if I don't take my climate advice from a 29-year-old who freaks out over her first look at a garbage disposal.

David Tamman – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Tamman. Mr. Tamman's pardon is supported by the Aleph Institute, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh, and former United States Attorney Kendall Coffey. Mr. Tamman was a partner at a major American law firm when he doctored financial documents that were the subject of a Federal investigation. These actions were done at the behest of a client who was perpetrating a Ponzi scheme upon unsuspecting investors. Mr. Tamman was convicted of his crimes following a bench trial and completed his seven-year sentence in 2019. Mr. Tamman accepts full responsibility for his actions and numerous friends and colleagues have attested that he is a decent man who experienced a terrible lapse in judgment for which he has already paid a significant price.

The craft will launch onboard the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July 2020 and is expected to arrive on Mars in February 2021. Because of its immense distance — Earth will be several minutes away, traveling at the speed of light — Aung said that direct control will be impossible. Instead, the craft will have an autonomous capability that will be able to receive and interpret commands from the ground, and then fly the mission on its own.
In other words, Cuomo and CNN are justifying violence against all of us, everyone to the right of Bernie Sanders.

As Artsy reports, Minter – now in her 60s – has been known for her depictions of women in the throes of sexual pleasure or adorned with dirt and diamonds since the 1970s. A supporter of both the LGBT agenda and abortion rights, she joined forces with Planned Parenthood last year for its most lucrative benefit auction, which raised $2.3 million for the abortion business from the sale of works by various artists.
Prosecutors called her crimes egregious and pushed for jail time. They said a paranoid Kane ruined morale in the 800-person office and the wider law enforcement community through a calculated scheme to embarrass rival prosecutors who had left the office.
Following Jordan, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) argued that language in the text of the bill also attempts to create a statutory right to abortion by prohibiting discrimination regarding a related medical condition connected to pregnancy.
The Senate is considered unlikely to pass the Equality Act, for the reasons of religious liberty Jordan mentioned.
Ten years ago, in a conference commemorating Humanae Vitae's 40th anniversary, Pope Benedict XVI referred to the encyclical as crucial for humanity's future, declaring that it constituted on the part of Paul VI a significant show of courage in reasserting the continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition.

Though Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in October announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. The organization and its leftwing media supporters continue to insist the videos, produced by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), were deceptively edited.
Obama hailed from Chicago. While some Republican members of Congress echoed his views, his criticism was mostly derided by economists and by former Labor Department officials from the Bush administration, who vouched for the accuracy of the data.
Overall, and as I said earlier, the left is eating its own. Let them fight. Enjoy the show. It's a total waste of time to try and care about people more than they care about themselves. Democrats are getting the blue on blue violence they voted for. It's not your problem. It's not my problem.
I said it starts with the Secretary of Education who has a lot to do with where we spend our money, with what gets advanced in our public schools, with what the standards are. And I said I'm gonna have a Secretary of Education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf and only if this person believes that our secretary or secretary of education nominee is – is committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone, will that person actually be advanced to be Secretary of Education.
Firearms are not only necessary for self-defense and for you to honor your primary responsibility in life, which is to protect your family and property; they're an excellent deterrent. I own four firearms. Two are within reach of my bed. Peace of mind, baby.

Conditt does not appear to have any kind of military or law enforcement service in his background. He worked for Crux Manufacturing for about four years, overlapping the time he spent at Austin Community College, the Austin ABC affiliate reported. His former boss said he hired the then-19-year-old because he seemed like a smart kid who showed a lot of promise. He reportedly worked in sales and purchasing and did a little bit of everything. However, after his performance slipped and he received several unheeded warnings, Crux Manufacturing let him go in August 2017.
Unapologetic about his own desire for multiple wives, he told his own wife early on in their marriage, which was arranged by his family, that she would not be the only one.
Jordan was responding to a speech by Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY), who accused Republicans of using freedom of religion as an excuse to hate on gay people, and claimed that religious freedom would still be protected under the Equality Act.
Given the profits Youtube, Twitter and Facebook make in France, and the few taxes they pay, their refusal to invest in the fight against hatred is unacceptable, she said.
If you can afford private school, great. If the public schools in your area are not yet polluted with social justice propaganda, great. But you must be prepared to home school because with the left emboldened and almost entirely in charge of academia, the last thing public schools will be teaching is reading, writing, and arithmetic.

Todd Farha, Thaddeus Bereday, William Kale, Paul Behrens, Peter Clay – President Trump granted full pardons to Todd Farha, Thaddeus Bereday, William Kale, Paul Behrens, and Peter Clay, former executives of a healthcare maintenance organization. Widely cited as a case study in overcriminalization, these men have attracted a broad range of support, including from the CATO Institute, the Reason Foundation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and various scholars and law professors. In 2008, Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay were criminally prosecuted for a state regulatory matter involving the reporting of expenditures to a state health agency. The expenditures reported were based on actual monies spent, and the reporting methodology was reviewed and endorsed by those with expertise in the state regulatory scheme. Notably, there was no evidence that any of the individuals were motivated by greed. And in fact, the sentencing judge called the likelihood that there was any personal financial motivation infinitesimal. The judge imposed a range of sentences from probation to 3 years' imprisonment, reflecting the conduct as an aberration from these individuals' otherwise law-abiding lives. Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay are described as devoted to their family and their communities, and have weathered their convictions without complaint.

Craig Cesal – President Trump commuted the sentence of Craig Cesal. Mr. Cesal is a father of two, one of whom unfortunately passed away while he was serving his life sentence for conspiracy to distribute marijuana.

Upon his release, Mr. Cesal looks forward to reintegrating back into society and to contributing to his community while living with his daughter with whom he has remained close. Mr. Cesal hopes to be a part of her upcoming wedding.
After making an exhaustive reference to the human rights jurisprudence worldwide in this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Article 14 of the Constitution of India which affirms that the State shall not deny to 'any person' equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India would apply to transgenders also, he said in his ruling.
Other opposition leaders, such as anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, claim that the election will be rigged in Putin's favor after being barred from running, meaning that he is extremely likely to win another six-year term.

Notably, Ms. Navarro was chosen to speak to at-risk youth in the community through the SHARE program. Upon her release, Ms. Navarro wishes to reunite with her daughter and seek employment.
And yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.

Closing the detention center was one of Obama's main campaign promises, but in spite of his promises and the Executive Order he immediately issued upon entering the White House, Obama never did shutter the facility. Instead, he began a campaign of transferring prisoners from the facility to nations that volunteered to take them.
Amy Povah – President Trump granted a full pardon to Amy Povah, the founder of the CAN-DO (Clemency for All Non-violent Drug Offenders) Foundation. In the 1990s, Ms. Povah served 9 years of a 24 year sentence for a drug offense before President Clinton commuted her remaining prison sentence in 2000. Since her release, she has become a voice for the incarcerated, a champion for criminal justice reform, and was a strong advocate for the passage of the First Step Act. Those assisted by Ms. Povah's organization include Ms. Adrianne Miller, whose remaining prison sentence the President commuted.

Mr. Wall was convicted of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in 1992. He completed a 60 month prison sentence with 4 years' supervised release.
Cuomo and his far-left confederates regularly encourage these terrorists.
Grey exited Paramount in February after running the studio over a 12-year tenure that saw him oversee massive hits with films in the Star Trek and Transformers franchises.
Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.
Elliott Broidy – President Trump granted a full pardon to Elliott Broidy. Mr. Broidy is the former Deputy National Finance Chair of the Republican National Committee. This pardon is supported by Representative Devin Nunes, Representative Ken Calvert, Representative Jack Bergman, Representative George Holding, Ambassador Ric Grenell, Bernie Marcus, Malcolm Hoenlein, Eric Branstad, Tom Hicks, Saul Fox, Lee Samson, Rabbi Steven Leder, Dr. Alveda King, Father Frank Pavone, Major General Clayton Hutmacher, Lieutenant General Bennet Sacolick, Mr. Bruce Brereton, Rabbi Steven Burg, Rabbi Pini Dunner, Rabbi Meyer May, and Rabbi Mordechai Suchard.

Let me tell you exactly how this is going to work…
Many parents throughout the United States say they have had enough, in fact, of the pornographic and gender-bending sex education curricula taught by organizations like Planned Parenthood – which profits from abortion and also boasts that it educates students about how to have LGBT-inclusive sex:
This is not hyperbole. This is history repeating itself. The gangs and cartels are about to take over your city. Welcome back to the urban blight of the 1970s.
In 2012, the Los Angeles shopping center The Grove banned Pacquiao from its grounds after an interview in The National Examiner wrongly attributed remarks to Pacquiao. The 57-6-2 fighter later told The Los Angeles Times, What I said is a reporter asked me about gay marriage … I am against gay marriage, but I'm not condemning gays. I have family — a cousin — who's gay, and friends too. I'm just against gay marriage. I don't even want to talk about the issue, but I was asked about it, so I gave my opinion.
What will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.
John Nystrom – President Trump granted a full pardon to John Nystrom, who, other than this conviction, was described by his sentencing judge as a model citizen. His clemency is supported by Governor Kristi Noem and Senator Michael Rounds. Over 10 years ago, while working as a contractor on a school reconstruction project, Mr. Nystrom failed to alert the proper authorities when he learned that a subcontractor was receiving double payments for work performed. Mr. Nystrom took full responsibility for this oversight and even tried to pay the Crowe Creek Tribe, who was paying for the work, restitution before he pled guilty. Mr. Nystrom has since paid his restitution in full. Mr. Nystrom teaches Sunday school and volunteers for the Knights of Columbus and Habitat for Humanity, among other organizations, and has previously served as County Commissioner.
I love my wife very much, Fitzgerald said. I didn't have any intention to resign a job that I adore. For me to walk out was like saying I didn't want to be there anymore and that wasn't the case.
The day after his arrest, David Benham tweeted about how North Carolina police seem to be selectively enforcing the coronavirus rules.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is outspoken about his Christian beliefs, but now some critics are attacking him for racy photos posted to social media by his pop singer wife, Ciara.
The actor added that pornography can change the way human beings view each other, not as people but as objects and body parts.
This is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.
Eileen Del Rio claimed that she and her girlfriend suffered discrimination because Tastries Bakery refused to grant them a wedding cake tasting due to the Millers' Christian belief in marriage as the union between a man and a woman.
Chris, Antifa is not a good cause, he said. Antifa does not have good aims, Antifa wants power, wants political power, taken through force. That's what Antifa is all about.

Page Six also reported several other details related to the split: Jolie reportedly wants to become more involved with her humanitarian work, while Pitt wants to continue to make movies and enjoys Hollywood parties. Jolie appeared at the United Nations just last week to lobby on behalf of Syrian refugees.
The miniature aircraft will spin its rotors at about ten times the speed of a terrestrial one, due to the extremely low density of Mars' atmosphere — only about one percent of Earth's. JPL Mars Helicopter Project Manager MiMi Aung explained that the altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet [12,000 meters], and when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet [30,000 m] up. Therefore, designers had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.
7. The 2016 Democratic National Convention's Security Walls
My issue was and is with pornography is it changes the way you think about people. People become objects, people become body parts, they become things to be used rather than people to be loved, Crews said. You start to use people, you start to feel like you're the man and they're just whatever.
Trump also issued a full pardon to former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, sentenced to 18 months in prison in August 2020 for stealing a trade secret from Google related to self-driving cars before changing jobs to work at Uber.

Monstsho Eugene Vernon – President Trump commuted the sentence of Monstsho Eugene Vernon. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Vernon has served over 19 years in prison for committing a string of armed bank robberies in Greenville, South Carolina.

While incarcerated, Mr. Vernon has worked steadily, programmed well, and recovered from a bout of cancer.
Axios reported that compared to 30 years ago:
In addition to states passing more laws banning abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy, requiring higher levels of safety in abortion clinics, and eliminating taxpayer funding from the abortion group, Planned Parenthood is still reeling from a series of videos exposing its apparent practices of selling the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and altering the positions of babies during abortion in order to be able to harvest the most intact organs.
Science, however, is not pro-sex or pro-abortion. And encouraging young teens to respect themselves and their bodies – and to view their sexuality as a special part of who they are – does not equate to teaching sex is abnormal, aberrant, or shameful.
Michael Harris – President Trump commuted the sentence of Michael Harris. Mr. Harris is a 59 year old who has served 30 years of a 25 year to life sentence for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Mr. Harris has had an exemplary prison record for three decades.

He dedicates his time to his three young children and is an advocate for Type 1 diabetes research.
Though failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke out against border walls for the U.S., her 2016 Democratic National Convention made sure to keep protesters and Bernie Sanders supporters out of the general area by erecting steel and iron fences. Sanders supporters can be seen standing plastered outside the barriers where police and guards stood opposite, ensuring no person made it past the fence.
Alito prophesied that the misguided decision would be used to damage citizens who do not share a contemporary view of marriage as an elastic arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons.

Jessica Frease – President Trump granted a full pardon to Jessica Frease. This pardon is supported by Governor Kristi Noem, South Dakota State Senator Lynne Hix-DiSanto, the United States Probation Officer responsible for Ms. Frease's supervision, and many in her community. Ms. Frease was 20 years old when she was convicted after converting stolen checks and negotiating them through the bank where she worked as a teller. Upon her arrest, however, she immediately relinquished the stolen funds to the authorities. After serving her two year sentence, she was granted early termination of her supervised release due to her commendable conduct. Currently, Ms. Frease is studying to become an Emergency Medical Technician and devotes her time and energy to raising funds for cancer patients.
Unfortunately, it's going to take a while for voters to come to their senses. Things are going to get worse before they get better — thankfully, this worsening will be contained in Democrat-run cities.
Cable news is poison. Hollywood's idea of entertainment today is either pushing sex on your children or straight-up propaganda. Why are you paying to pump this garbage into your home? What, you like paying $125 a month to have CNNLOL deliberately misinform you and then call you racist, to have MTV glorify degeneracy?
Though Pope Francis has routinely blasted the enforcement of international borders, Vatican City and St. Peter's Square are completely walled off from Italy.
Dr. Kesten Green of the University of South Australia will continue our discussion of the recent research revealing that fewer than 1 percent of papers published in scientific journals actually follow the scientific method. Dr. Green and his colleague Professor J. Scott Armstrong of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School have created guidelines for assessing scientific research.
This, to me, is the dumbest crisis of them all. To begin with, none of the tariffs Trump has so far raised have had any effect on consumer prices or economic growth. In fact, in almost every area, our economy is doing much better than our lousy experts predicted last year.
El Reno, Oklahoma, is home to one of the country's many Federal Correctional institutions. This facility, which former President Obama visited in 2015, is surrounded by a chain link fence and barbed wire.

Archbishop Okoh said his province will shun next month's Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Lusaka, Zambia over the way the worldwide church has handled the wayward Episcopal Church in America, which he described as a toxic relationship.
Luis Gonzalez – President Trump commuted the sentence of Luis Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez is a 78 year-old non-violent drug offender who has served more than 27 years of a life sentence. Under the First Step Act, Mr. Fragoso would not have been subject to a mandatory life sentence. Mr. Gonzalez has an upstanding prison record and has worked for UNICOR for over 20 years producing military uniforms.
The Castle of Versaille near Paris, France is one of the most recognizable barriers in the Western world. This beautifully gold fence and gate keep the castle safe and secure. Barriers don't have to be eyesores. Versaille proves that.
Young girls are spotted in the markets, and nighttime raids drag them from their beds, UNICEF reported. In some cases, parents are killed in front of the girls during the process.
Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.
Robert Cannon Robin Hayes – President Trump granted a full pardon to Robert Cannon Robin Hayes. The former North Carolina Congressman is serving a 1-year term of probation for making a false statement in the course of a Federal investigation. In addition to his years in Congress, Mr. Hayes has served as Chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and Chair of the National Council of Republican Party Chairs. Senator Thom Tillis and several members of the North Carolina Congressional delegation strongly support clemency for Mr. Hayes.
The president did not pardon Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, two whistleblowers who illegally shared America's intelligence and national security secrets. The two individuals enjoyed bipartisan support for a pardon as their supporters had hoped that the president would ignore the intelligence community elites and prominent members of Congress in Washington who were deeply opposed to a pardon.
Not three days, or three months, but three years, Sa'a, who now lives in the United States, said at an event at the Newseum's Religious Freedom Center in Washington D.C. to mark the anniversary of the event. Every individual that has power to do something that would bring those girls back should just do something.
It would not be unreasonable to suggest that Cardinal Müller's homily Wednesday was in fact a response to the pope's call for modernization.
In 1986, Welch made one of his boldest moves, a $6.4 billion acquisition of RCA, including the NBC television network. The deal energized GE, which made hundreds more acquisitions as the company moved aggressively into financial services, medical equipment and jet engines.

Mr. Nelson is serving a mandatory 20 year sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of 5 kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. Following the First Step Act's changes to the definition of serious drug felony, Mr. Nelson would no longer receive a mandatory minimum term of 20 years' imprisonment. Instead, he would likely face a 10-year sentence. He has already served more than 11 years in prison. Throughout his incarceration, he appears to have demonstrated commendable adjustment to custody.
Steven Samuel Grantham – President Trump granted a full pardon to Steven Samuel Grantham. This pardon is supported by Mr. Grantham's friends and family who praise his moral character, Acting Attorney Jeffrey Rosen, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and the Office of the Pardon Attorney.

Since his conviction and release from prison, he has demonstrated remorse and accepted responsibility for his crime, which he committed approximately 50 years ago when he was just 19 years old. Mr. Grantham has lived a law-abiding and stable life. Most notably, he stepped in and assumed custody of his grandchild when the child's parents were unable to care for him. He now seeks a pardon for forgiveness and to restore his gun rights.
Dr. Mahmoud Reza Banki – President Trump granted a full pardon to Dr. Mahmoud Reza Banki.

In 2010 Dr. Banki was charged with monetary violations of Iranian sanctions and making false statements. The charges related to sanctions violations were subsequently overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. However, the felony charges for making false statements have prevented Dr. Banki from resuming a full life. In the years since his conviction, Dr. Banki has dedicated himself to his community and maintained a sincere love and respect for the United States.

ThinkProgress has tried to smear Sullins for his religious faith and his priesthood. The author, Zack Ford, a columnist and not an expert in sociological research, called the study hugely flawed and ran a picture of Sullins in his priestly garb.

Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?

American servicemen are not coming home in body bags. There are no race riots, which also wasn't the case a few years ago. There seems to be fewer domestic terror attacks. For the last two years global temperatures have dropped and this year, so far, has certainly been a cool one.

Stephen Odzer – President Trump granted a conditional pardon to Stephen Odzer. This pardon is supported by former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Sigmund Sig Rogich, Jason Greenblatt, Michael Steinhardt, Wayne Allyn Root, Salvador Moran, the Aleph Institute, and numerous members of Mr. Odzer's religious community. Mr. Odzer pled guilty to conspiracy and bank fraud, for which he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Numerous individuals testify to his substantial philanthropic and volunteer activities.

He has also dedicated resources to support and build synagogues in memory of his late cousin who was kidnapped and killed by Muslim terrorists while in Israel. The pardon requires Mr. Odzer to pay the remainder of his restitution order.

Scott Conor Crosby – President Trump granted a full pardon to Scott Conor Crosby. Mr. Crosby is supported by Senator Martha McSally, the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Mesa, Arizona, and the Bishop of his church, all of whom attest to Mr. Crosby's service to his community and upstanding character. In 1992, Mr. Crosby made a 'spur of the moment' poor decision to participate in a co-worker's plan to commit a bank robbery. Mr. Crosby was arrested the same day and cooperated with the authorities. Since his release from prison, he has spent significant time volunteering at his church, mentoring youth, and has earned a certification as an Emergency Medical Technician. Mr. Crosby's civil rights were restored by the State of Arizona in 2003, and this action restores his Federal civil rights.

Most notably, Mr. Phelps's sentence would unquestionably be lower today under the First Step Act.
Honestly, any rational person who lives in the real world — and I like to count myself among that group — must be baffled by the news media's ongoing meltdown; the screech of one crisis after another, which reflects nothing close to reality.
Darrell Frazier – President Trump commuted the sentence of Darrell Frazier. Mr. Frazier is a 60 year-old who has served 29 years of a life sentence for non-violent conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine.

1. The Walls of Vatican City and St. Peter's Square
One of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

A 2016 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows nearly 60 percent of high school students today have never had sex, an increase of 28 percent since 1991. This data complements research that also shows a historic drop in teen pregnancy rates since 1991.
My friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic, Cruz tweeted. If NC deems abortion 'essential,' then pregnancy care services are as well. This is WRONG; Governor Cooper should be ashamed.

Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.

Blue slips are a courtesy that Senate Democrats have abused during the Trump presidency, which formerly allowed a home-state senator to insist on consultations but which were never intended as a one-senator veto on a nominee with majority support. Democrats' misuse of blue slips to derail nominees led to Grassley's discarding of the process, and last month, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) led the full Senate to confirm the first Trump nominee to be initially blocked by a blue slip, Judge David Stras to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

Notable figures, including the Honorable Michael Hogan who served as the Federal judge overseeing Sunwest's bankruptcy and receivership, Ford Elsaesser who served as counsel to Sunwest's creditors in receivership, and multiple other individuals involved in the litigation support Mr. Harder's commutation. Mr. Harder was serving as president and CEO of Sunwest Management Inc., a large management company overseeing residential senior care facilities, when he misused investment funds during the real estate crisis. Mr. Harder fully accepted responsibility, pled guilty, and cooperated with the government's civil and criminal actions against him at great personal cost. According to former Chief Judge Hogan, Mr. Harder's full cooperation against his substantial financial and penal interests helped secure the sale of the company's assets, ensuring that Sunwest's investors recovered more of their investment, seniors could continue living in their facilities, and employees could retain their livelihoods. Mr. Elsaesser stated that of all the financial wrongdoers that [the court and the Government] dealt with during the real estate crash of 2008, Mr. Harder acted more responsibly than any of his 'peers.' President Trump commends Mr. Harder for choosing to put his employees, investors, and the senior citizens residing in Sunwest's homes above himself.

Dr. Corkern served in the Mississippi Army National Guard and has generously provided his services to low-income patients.
To be fair, though, Alyssa Milano's sex strike, her refusal to have sex with anyone until she gets her way on abortion would have been a legitimate crisis … in 1998.
A massive 439 of the marriages in 2017 either took place or were due to take place in Pakistan, followed by Bangladesh with 129 reports, and 91 in Somalia. The list continues with India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Romania, and Saudi Arabia.
The post-Christian world welcomes these efforts to remake the Church as a convenient civil religion, Müller said.

We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles, he said.
The study flies in the face of recent claims by gay advocates that there is no difference between being raised by gays or by straights.
After we won the election in 2010 with a two-thirds majority, we decided to build a family-friendly country and to strengthen families raising children, said Hungary's Minister for the Family, Katalin Novak.

Pope Francis beatified Paul VI in 2014 after a first miracle was attributed to his intercession. In early February, a Vatican commission consisting of theologians and doctors approved a second miracle attributed to him by a unanimous vote.
Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.
Fred Dave Clark – President Trump commuted Dave Clark's remaining term of incarceration after serving over 6 years in Federal prison for a first-time, non-violent offense. Mr. Clark's commutation is supported by Professor Alan Dershowitz, Ken Starr, the Aleph Institute, his family of seven children, and former business colleagues and investors, among others. While in prison, Mr. Clark has lead Bible Study and developed a Promising People program to teach inmates technical skills and connect them with faith-based support.
According to Müller, the crisis facing the Catholic Church today has arisen from attempts to align with secular culture while abandoning the teachings of the faith in the process.
MaryAnne Locke – President Trump commuted the sentence of MaryAnne Locke. Ms. Locke has served roughly 11 years of a nearly 20 year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. Despite the difficulties of beginning her sentence just 6 weeks after having a Caesarean section, her prison record has been exemplary, with extensive programming and work. Ms. Locke was authorized to work outside the perimeter of the prison, and was granted home confinement under the CARES Act last summer. Today, she lives with her father, is building a relationship with her children, and works fulltime at a major retail store.
Earlier Monday, Kane's 15-year-old son, Chris, pleaded for leniency while her former deputies described an office demoralized by her leadership and terrorized by Nixonian espionage.
Democrats are opposing Nielson because of his work defending traditional marriage at the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2013, as well as his work at OLC defending presidential power to subject enemy combatants to enhanced interrogation. He is a partner at Cooper & Kirk, the powerhouse law firm headed by one of the most accomplished lawyers in the nation, Chuck Cooper, who headed OLC as its assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and Attorney General Ed Meese.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott told KXAN's Phil Prazan that Conditt was unemployed when he died and had no military background.
Less than 24 hours later, law enforcement officials tracked down Conditt through a variety of techniques and identified the young man from Pflugerville as the suspect. Using cell phone technology, police tracked Conditt to a motel parking lot in neighboring Round Rock. A few hours later, Conditt killed himself by exploding a device inside his car.

When the right of the transgender persons to marry has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the very nature of things, they cannot be kept out of the purview of the Hindu Marriage Act, he added. One can have a civil marriage. One can also have a sacramental marriage. The petitioners' marriage was solemnized in a temple. Therefore, their fundamental right under Article 25 has also been infringed in this case.
Cassandra Ann Kasowski – President Trump commuted the sentence of Cassandra Ann Kasowski. Notably, her warden recommended her for home confinement under the CARES Act. Ms. Kasowski has served more than7 years of a 17 year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. She has been an exemplary inmate and has worked extensively, including as a part of the PAWS program and in UNICOR. Upon her release, she plans to spend time with her son and seek employment.
The Welches resumed writing a regular column in 2012, this time for Reuters. They used the column to dole out advice for business and political figures, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, whom they supported.
Asked by Artsy about why she chose Planned Parenthood as her charity, Minter replied:
Chaiwala's Sharia marriage websites were directly cited in the review on social integration by cohesion advisor Dame Louise Casey on how foreign cultural practices contrary to British values are being tolerated. The report largely blames the tolerance of regressive cultures for segregation and said that pressure should be put on migrants to integrate.
After making an exhaustive reference to the human rights jurisprudence worldwide in this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Article 14 of the Constitution of India which affirms that the State shall not deny to 'any person' equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India would apply to transgenders also, he said in his ruling.
A chemical engineer by training, Welch transformed the company from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse. During his tenure, GE's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.
Luis Fernando Sicard – President Trump commuted the sentence of Luis Fernando Sicard. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Sicard was sentenced in 2000 for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of a firearm during and in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. He has served 20 years with clear conduct. Mr. Sicard has participated in substantial programming, including a number of vocational courses. Currently, Mr. Sicard works in the camp vehicular factory and previously worked in UNICOR earning outstanding work reports, and he also volunteers in the inmate puppy program. Importantly, Mr. Sicard takes full responsibility for his criminal actions. Mr. Sicard is a former Marine and father of two girls.
Javier Gonzales – President Trump commuted the sentence of Javier Gonzales. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Gonzales was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and distribution of methamphetamine in 2005. He has served over 14 years in prison, which is 4 years longer than the 10-year sentence he would likely receive today. He has a demonstrated record of rehabilitation during his incarceration, including steady employment, with substantial UNCIOR experience, and participation in vocational programming and training to facilitate his successful reintegration into the workforce upon release. He also has no history of violent conduct. Mr. Gonzales has actively addressed his admitted substance abuse issues with nonresidential drug treatment and participation in the residential program.
In 2016, over 60 per cent of Bermudans rejected both same sex marriages and same sex civil unions in a plebiscite held on the same day as Britain's Brexit referendum. The votes were not binding as they did not pass the 50 per cent turnout threshold. Nevertheless the government sought to compromise on the matter, protecting LGBT rights and attempting to respect the will of the people vis a vis marriage as an institution.
A court in India ruled on Monday that the term Hindu bride must also include transgender women, thus directing authorities to register a marriage solemnized between a man and a transgender woman.

What kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.
Renowned mastermind (click it) David Lammy MP somehow managed to invoke slavery into his pro-imperialist arguments:
The Vatican has announced in a statement this week that Pope Paul VI will be canonized in Rome next October with Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was killed in 1980 while celebrating Mass.
A report at ABC affiliate rtv6 stated Fitzgerald posted to her Facebook account:
From the day I joined GE to the day I was named CEO, 20 years later, my bosses cautioned me about my candor, Welch wrote in 'Straight from the Gut.' I was labeled abrasive and consistently warned my candor would soon get in the way of my career … and I'm telling you that it was candor that helped make it work.
The only one approved on a straight 11-10 party-line vote was Howard Nielson, nominated for the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. Nielson is a well-respected former law clerk to a top appellate judge and then worked at the elite Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) at the U.S. Department of Justice.
Kane and her husband are now estranged and share custody of their teenage boys.
Both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.
On Tuesday, Arizona Central reported the text of the draft resolution to censure and dissolve any connections between the Republican Party and McCain:
According to the study, which tracks the development of children to adulthood, 51 percent of those raised by same-sex couples had experienced depression, compared to only 19.7 percent of those raised in normal married households.
Such education keeps all people who are subjected to it in the dark about critical aspects of their health, and treats a normal part of life — sexuality, and women's sexuality in particular — as aberrant and shameful, they say.

Witnesses to the Commons Home Affairs Committee, as part of the broader inquiry into Sharia councils, have warned that the number of polygynous marriages is on the rise.
For the New York Times editors, however, teaching young people to delay sex until they are older and might have better judgment about relationships is anti-science and more.
Robert William Cawthon – President Trump granted a full pardon to Robert William Cawthon. His pardon is supported by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Cawthon was convicted in 1992 for making a false statement on a bank loan application and was sentenced to 3 years' probation, conditioned upon 180 days' home confinement. Mr. Cawthon has accepted responsibility for his offense, served his sentence without incident, and fulfilled his restitution obligation. His atonement has been exceptional, and since his conviction he has led an unblemished life while engaging in extensive, praiseworthy community service.
Aviem Sella – President Trump granted a full pardon to Aviem Sella. Mr. Sella is an Israeli citizen who was indicted in 1986 for espionage in relation to the Jonathan Pollard case. Mr. Sella's request for clemency is supported by the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer, the United States Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, and Miriam Adelson. The State of Israel has issued a full and unequivocal apology, and has requested the pardon in order to close this unfortunate chapter in U.S.-Israel relations.
These are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.
And so the idea that this of all things is what people are attacking each other over and excluding each other over, when God is love, we are taught, he went on. Of all the things to beat people up over on theological grounds, it just seems to me that loving shouldn't be one of them. So it's a painful thing to watch.
The migrant she was forced to marry twice failed to get a visa and an immigration judge said that her ability to understand and sponsor him was very much in doubt. However, she was then forced to live with him and was raped and impregnated.
In his writing and speaking, Welch shared the wisdom he gained in a GE career that began right after he left grad school. He quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and CEO in 1981, at age 45. Welch quickly shook up GE, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname Neutron Jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. Welch also divested GE of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be No. 1 or 2 in their markets. The early moves dismantled GE's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.
[The] Global Peace Building Act… would authorize a one-time transfer of $5 billion dollars from the Pentagon's Overseas Contingency Operation budget to the State Department to create a new multi-lateral peacebuilding fund, she said.

Mr. Broidy was convicted on one count of conspiracy to serve as an unregistered agent of a foreign principal. Mr. Broidy is well known for his numerous philanthropic efforts, including on behalf of law enforcement, the military and veterans programs, and the Jewish community.
7. The 2016 Democratic National Convention's Security Walls
Much of this hysteria is based on the Trump administration fighting congress over document requests and all those subpoenas being issued so that sore loser Democrats can come up with a Russia Collusion Hoax do-over — you know, because Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his gang of partisan Democrats spending three years and $35 million to locate a dry collusion/obstruction hole means nothing.
If you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then I think it takes you to a pretty specific place, he added. I've learned that it's an expression of love, at least it can be. And I guess I believe it ought to be.
Millennial women are individually better off than their mothers — but the women's husbands are the millennial men.
Also, eventually, the blight moves outside the cities and into surrounding areas. Let me put it this way… If you do move to the suburbs, be prepared to move again the moment you see graffiti. Graffiti is always the beginning of the end.
So, you've got an STD, the video's narrator nods casually. Guess what? So do lots of other people. Half of all people will get an STD at some point in their life. Seriously. Not kidding – half. It's OK.

This turn of events is fueled primarily by the dramatic drop in the share of young Americans who are choosing to settle down romantically before age 35, Pew's analysis reads.
Pacquiao had responded to an inquiry from the TV5 network in which they asked celebrities about same-sex marriage, which he opposes. He asserted, It's just common sense. Have you seen any animal having male-to-male or female-to-female relations? Adding that even animals understand gender differences, he opined, if you have male-to-male or female-to-female [relationships], then people are worse than animals.
The worry and fears children face in this situation can also lead them to self-harm, to run away from home putting them at risk of further abuse, or even to contemplate taking their own lives, the spokesman added.

The president also commuted the sentence of former Mayor of Detroit Kwame Malik Kilpatrick, a Democrat, citing strong support by members of the Detroit Community as well as Alveda King, Alice Johnson, and Diamond and Silk. Kilpatrick served seven years of a 28-year sentence for his role in a major corruption scandal, convicted of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud, and other charges.

Mr. Kleinman has had an exemplary prison history and has worked to remain close to his children and his father. Upon release, he looks forward to living with his father, working for the family business, and caring for his children.
Unfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.
Sydney Navarro – President Trump commuted the sentence of Sydney Navarro. Ms. Navarro has served nearly 8 years of a 27-year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. She has an exemplary prison record. In addition, Ms. Navarro obtained her GED, participated in extensive program work, and earned excellent work evaluations. Notably, Ms. Navarro was chosen to speak to at-risk youth in the community through the SHARE program. Upon her release, Ms. Navarro wishes to reunite with her daughter and seek employment.

Caroline Yeats – President Trump commuted the sentence of Caroline Yeats. Ms. Yeats was a first-time, non-violent drug offender who has served nearly 7 years of a 20-year sentence.

Mr. Floyd's dedication to service includes helping extinguish fires set during the recent unrest and repairing widows and disabled veterans' cars free of charge. President Trump thanks Mr. Floyd for his past military service and for his commitment to his community.
There was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.
Carl Andrews Boggs – President Trump granted a full pardon to Carl Andrews Boggs. This pardon is supported by the Honorable David Lee and South Carolina Department of Transportation Chairman Tony Cox. In 2013, Mr. Boggs pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy. Since his release, Mr. Boggs has rebuilt his company, has employed hundreds of people, and has dedicated countless hours and financial resources to his community.
Welch's results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping GE turn a financial corner, although some of the success came at the expense of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in Welch's relentless efforts to cut costs and rid GE of unprofitable businesses.

Kane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was handcuffed in court and led out a side door. She will remain in custody until she posts $75,000 cash bail, higher than she had previously posted.
The pope's most controversial move during his tumultuous, 15-year pontificate was the publication of the 1968 encyclical letter titled Humanae Vitae (On Human Life), which confirmed the church's longstanding teaching regarding the immorality of the use of contraceptives to avoid pregnancy. Many inside and outside the church had expected Paul to overturn traditional teaching on contraception, along with the majority of the members of a special commission Paul had set up to study the question.

Jawad A. Musa – President Trump commuted the sentence of Jawad A. Musa. In 1991, Mr. Musa was sentence to life imprisonment for a non-violent, drug-related offense. Mr. Musa's sentencing judge and the prosecutor on the case have both requested clemency on his behalf. He is currently 56-years old. During his time in prison, Mr. Musa has strengthened his faith and taken dozens of educational courses. Mr. Musa is blessed with a strong supportive network in Baltimore, Maryland and has numerous offers of employment.

Following Jordan, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) argued that language in the text of the bill also attempts to create a statutory right to abortion by prohibiting discrimination regarding a related medical condition connected to pregnancy.
And so the idea that this of all things is what people are attacking each other over and excluding each other over, when God is love, we are taught, he went on. Of all the things to beat people up over on theological grounds, it just seems to me that loving shouldn't be one of them. So it's a painful thing to watch.

Science, however, is not pro-sex or pro-abortion. And encouraging young teens to respect themselves and their bodies – and to view their sexuality as a special part of who they are – does not equate to teaching sex is abnormal, aberrant, or shameful.
Pacquiao plans to retire from boxing after his rubber match with Timothy Bradley on April 9.
A month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. It was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.
The fascist mob is going to declare certain toys, books, movies, and television shows problematic, and these corporations, that are either cowardly or infested with social justice warriors, are going to disappear these things.

From the beginning of the Trump administration, Democrats have continually criticized current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos for not having worked as a regular public school teacher. Most Democrat 2020 candidates have represented the views of the teachers' unions whose leadership has condemned the administration's support for school choice, viewing it as a threat to public schools.
So when America's leftists began to complain about classic films and television shows that are problematic, I knew it was only a matter of time… Well, the time has come.

Luis Fernando Sicard – President Trump commuted the sentence of Luis Fernando Sicard. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Sicard was sentenced in 2000 for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of a firearm during and in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. He has served 20 years with clear conduct. Mr. Sicard has participated in substantial programming, including a number of vocational courses. Currently, Mr. Sicard works in the camp vehicular factory and previously worked in UNICOR earning outstanding work reports, and he also volunteers in the inmate puppy program. Importantly, Mr. Sicard takes full responsibility for his criminal actions. Mr. Sicard is a former Marine and father of two girls.

Romney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.

I am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended, the blog page's profile states.

This is not hyperbole. This is history repeating itself. The gangs and cartels are about to take over your city. Welcome back to the urban blight of the 1970s.
A massive 439 of the marriages in 2017 either took place or were due to take place in Pakistan, followed by Bangladesh with 129 reports, and 91 in Somalia. The list continues with India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Romania, and Saudi Arabia.
Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.

When a supporter told Warren public schools need to teach more about LGBTQ history and sex education, the Massachusetts senator replied her education secretary would have to be interviewed by a transgender child.
She said she was offered three to five years if she entered into a plea deal and had no idea that a life sentence was even on the table.
Traie Tavares Kelly – President Trump commuted the sentence of Traie Tavares Kelly. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Kelly was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and 5 kilograms or more of cocaine. He has served over 14 years in prison, but if he were sentenced today, he would likely be subject only to 10-year mandatory minimum. Moreover, Mr. Kelly has substantial work history while incarcerated and his notable accomplishments in education and programming demonstrate that he has used his time to maximize his chance at being a productive citizen upon release.
The administration's approach defies all common sense, the editors write, claiming there is no evidence that teaching young people to make healthy decisions about sex will reduce teen pregnancies or STDs.
CNN's association with, encouragement of, and affection for political violence has been well documented over the years, and as we get closer to the 2020 presidential election, it is only going to get worse… Much worse.
In March of last year, documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney released an HBO exposé on the controversial religion called Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. The film — which won three Emmy Awards — detailed the controversial behind-the-scenes working of the church and made several explosive allegations regarding its most devoted celebrity adherents, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta.
In another portion of the pair's discussion, Buttigieg spoke about why he believes same-sex marriage is a contentious issue in religious circles.
James Romans – President Trump commuted the sentence of James Romans. Mr. Romans is a father and a grandfather who received a life sentence without parole for his involvement in a conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Mr. Romans has had an exemplary disciplinary record for the more than 10 years he has served, and has completed a long list of courses. He has already secured job opportunities that will help him successfully re-enter society.
Chick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, Martini said. I think it's imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.
It was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion, he said. Like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now? Making it easier to harm people in its name?
Gary Evan Hendler – President Trump granted a full pardon to Gary Evan Hendler. This pardon is supported by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. In 1984, Mr. Hendler was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and dispense controlled substances and served 3 years' probation for his crime. He is remorseful and has taken full responsibility for his criminal actions. In the 40 years since his conviction, Mr. Hendler has lived a law-abiding life and has positively contributed to his community. He is financially stable and owns a successful real estate business. Most notably, he has helped others recover from addiction. Since 1982, he has organized and led weekly AA meetings. He also has mentored many individuals on their journey to sobriety with his radio broadcasts. His former probation officer noted that Mr. Hendler had become integral in the lives of many members of the community who were dealing with substance abuse issues. Further, his efforts in addiction and recovery have been recognized by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who recently appointed him to a state advisory council on drug and alcohol abuse.
Bloomberg said in a statement on his campaign website:
Benedict Olberding – President Trump granted a full pardon to Benedict Olberding. Mr. Olberding was convicted on one count of bank fraud. Mr. Olberding is an upstanding member of the community who has paid his debt to society. After completing his sentence, he purchased two aquarium stores, as well as a consulting business to train prospective mortgage brokers.

Adriana Shayota – President Trump commuted the sentence of Adriana Shayota. Ms. Shayota has served more than half of her 24 month sentence. The Deputy Mayor of Chula Vista, California, John McCann, supports this commutation, among other community leaders. Ms. Shayota is a mother and a deeply religious woman who had no prior convictions. She was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods, commit copyright infringement, and introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. During her time in prison, Ms. Shayota mentored those who wanted to improve their lives and demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to rehabilitation.
Omar also called on the United States to join the International Criminal Court, a global entity that President Donald Trump blocked from launching an investigation into alleged atrocities committing during the war between 2003 and 2004, including by U.S. troops, Afghan forces, and the Taliban.
They point out that whilst polygamy is illegal, there is no requirement for a civil, legal, ceremony to precede a Sharia marriage. This means that imams are under no obligation to refuse to perform a marriage because the man is already married.
As Breitbart News reported, Bloomberg and the left are embracing the transgender ideology despite scientific facts:
David and his twin brother, Jason, gained fame as successful businessmen who were offered a show on the Home and Garden TV channel but were abruptly fired after their Christian worldview was revealed, including their support for traditional marriage between a man and a woman and respecting life from conception to natural death.
A senior HHS official, however, recently told Breitbart News that this narrative is not supported by research data from the federal government itself.
For that to happen anyone in the world would be shameful. For it to happen in a British territory, for the legislation signed by a British governor and permitted by a British foreign secretary makes us complicit in something which this House has repeatedly voted against, she argued.
They're a bunch of babies. College is supposed to prepare you for the real world, not shield you from opposing opinions, and safe spaces do exactly that. Who doesn't want as an undergrad Chick-fil-A on their campus? I would have killed for a c on my campus when I was at Duquesne, he said.
He's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, Noel Tichy, the author of a 1993 book on Welch and a former leader of GE's vaunted training programs, said in 2001. He'll make snap judgments. He's a human being that has temper tantrums.

Ten years ago, in a conference commemorating Humanae Vitae's 40th anniversary, Pope Benedict XVI referred to the encyclical as crucial for humanity's future, declaring that it constituted on the part of Paul VI a significant show of courage in reasserting the continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition.

Casey Urlacher – President Trump granted a full pardon to Casey Urlacher. This pardon is supported by his friends and family, and countless members of his community. Mr. Urlacher has been charged with conspiracy to engage in illegal gambling. Throughout his life, Mr. Urlacher has been committed to public service and has consistently given back to his community. Currently, Mr. Urlacher serves as the unpaid Mayor of Mettawa, Illinois. He is a devoted husband to his wife and a loving father to his 17-month old daughter.
He rose through the ranks, and built GE's plastics business into one of the company's fastest growing business units. He became a senior vice president in 1977, and vice chairman in 1979. In 1995, Welch suffered chest pains and underwent heart bypass surgery.
Efforts to blot out sexual differences based on anatomy are symptomatic of a sick society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he added.
Trump also commuted the sentence of wealthy Democrat donor Dr. Salomon Melgen, who was convicted on 67 felony counts of Medicaid fraud in April 2017. The White House cited support for the pardon by Sen. Bob Menendez and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. Melgen was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2018.
9. The Gates of Chateau de Versailles
Men are more likely to earn less. In 1975, only a quarter of 25 to 34-year-old men made less than $30K per year, but that number rose to 41% in 2016. Going deeper: As a measure of upward mobility, 92% of 30-year-olds in 1970 earned more than their parents at that age, according to a 2016 study led by Raj Chetty, a Stanford economist (h/t Roger Lowenstein). But of those who were 30 in 2014, just half earned more. [Economist Raj] Chetty attributed most of this erosion to slower GDP growth and a change in the distribution of GDP favoring higher earners: GDP would have to rise by 6% a year to get the same impact, he said, and wealth would have to be distributed much more evenly.

My message is: toughen up. there are no safe spaces in the real world, he said. If you're going to be successful in this life after you leave college you've got to learn to embrace adversity and open yourself up to a litany of different opinions.

Ogebe said that the Nigerian government is not transparent about its dealings with Boko Haram or about the girls who were released in October. All remain in the custody of the government and have not been reunited with their families.
Justice G R Swaminathan of the Madras high court, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, issued a ruling on Monday that the term bride as defined by the Hindu Marriage Act must also include transgender women, who are biologically male.

For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.
Warren has been reaching out to LGBT voters by condemning Christian schools that hold and teach a biblical worldview of human sexuality and marriage.
For example: Yesterday, I paid 98 cents for a dozen eggs. My 401(k) is kicking butt. No one I know is struggling to find work, which was definitely not the case a few years ago. American servicemen are not coming home in body bags. There are no race riots, which also wasn't the case a few years ago. There seems to be fewer domestic terror attacks. For the last two years global temperatures have dropped and this year, so far, has certainly been a cool one.
Michael Harris – President Trump commuted the sentence of Michael Harris. Mr. Harris is a 59 year old who has served 30 years of a 25 year to life sentence for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Mr. Harris has had an exemplary prison record for three decades. He is a former entrepreneur and has mentored and taught fellow prisoners how to start and run businesses. He has completed courses towards business and journalism degrees. Upon his release, Mr. Harris will have a meaningful place of employment and housing with the support of his family.
That's what's really going on here.
She added: The mystery surrounding the functioning of the moderation teams of social networks prevents any serious progress in reducing racist and anti-Semitic messages. Since the major platforms do not respect French law, not even their own conditions, they will have to face justice.
The letter was signed by New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, chairman of the Committee for Religious Liberty; Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S.

In 2013, Mr. Renzi was convicted of extortion, bribery, insurance fraud, money laundering, and racketeering. He was sentenced to 2 years in Federal prison, 2 years of supervised release, and paid a $25,000 fine. Before his conviction, Mr. Renzi served three terms in the House of Representatives. His constituents considered him a strong advocate for better housing, quality education, and improved healthcare—especially for the underprivileged and Native Americans. He is the father of 12 children and a loving and devoted husband.
In April 2008, Immelt became the target of Welch's blunt talk when GE missed a quarterly earnings target, a month after Immelt had promised investors the company would meet its goals. The disappointment sent GE shares down nearly 13% in a single day, prompting Welch to say that he would get a gun out and shoot Immelt if he allowed GE to miss earnings targets again.

As it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. In November 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. As you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.
Page said his client was barred from the campus and her school email account.
For the New York Times editors, however, teaching young people to delay sex until they are older and might have better judgment about relationships is anti-science and more.
She added, This means that he's looking for a nominee who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women. That's what's at stake in this one. And then from there, so much more. This is about health care cases that are percolating up through the courts, including the one we know about right now about pre-existing conditions. This is about the swing vote in our environmental protections, whether or not giant corporations are going to have the right to poison the water and foul the air. This is about workers' rights and whether or not the Supreme Court is going to stay on the path of trying to bust unions. This is about voting rights, whether or not democracy fundamentally works in this country. This is one of those moments where Justice Kennedy has been the swing vote. Look, I'll be blunt, he swung a lot of times in a direction I don't like, but he's been a swing vote. He was the one who helped stand up for equal marriage. All of that is now at risk—whether he, Donald Trump, gets to replace the swing vote with somebody off a pre-approved extremist list.

Already, and even though he is innocent of the allegation, Woody Allen — one of our greatest living filmmakers — had his latest film blacklisted, along with his career. The Walt Disney Company has blacklisted its own Song of the South. The creator of The Simpsons has blacklisted an episode of his own show. The Library Journal published an article calling for a ban on books guilty of whiteness, whatever the hell that is. The Little House books are being burned.

Randall Duke Cunningham – President Trump granted a conditional pardon to Randall Duke Cunningham who was released from prison in 2013. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich strongly supports this pardon. Mr. Cunningham, a former California Congressman, was sentenced to over 8 years' imprisonment for accepting bribes while he held public office. During his time in prison, Mr. Cunningham tutored other inmates to help them achieve their GED. Mr. Cunningham is a combat veteran, an ace fighter pilot, and a member of the Military Order of Purple Hearts.

Dr. Nahas is a talented surgeon with a practice in New Jersey. In the 1990s, Dr. Nahas became aware of a Federal investigation into his billing practices. Although the 6-year investigation uncovered no underlying billing fraud, Dr. Nahas did not fully cooperate and ultimately pled guilty to one count of obstructing justice in a health care investigation. Dr. Nahas spent 1 month in prison in 2003 and has spent the subsequent 18 years working tirelessly to regain the trust and admiration of his patients, colleagues, and community.

David Tamman – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Tamman. Mr. Tamman's pardon is supported by the Aleph Institute, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh, and former United States Attorney Kendall Coffey. Mr. Tamman was a partner at a major American law firm when he doctored financial documents that were the subject of a Federal investigation. These actions were done at the behest of a client who was perpetrating a Ponzi scheme upon unsuspecting investors. Mr. Tamman was convicted of his crimes following a bench trial and completed his seven-year sentence in 2019. Mr. Tamman accepts full responsibility for his actions and numerous friends and colleagues have attested that he is a decent man who experienced a terrible lapse in judgment for which he has already paid a significant price.

Mark Anthony Conditt died on Wednesday morning when he exploded a device in his car as police attempted to take him into custody. Less than 12 hours later, information about who the Austin Serial Bomber is beginning to emerge.
Much of this hysteria is based on the Trump administration fighting congress over document requests and all those subpoenas being issued so that sore loser Democrats can come up with a Russia Collusion Hoax do-over — you know, because Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his gang of partisan Democrats spending three years and $35 million to locate a dry collusion/obstruction hole means nothing.
A group supportive of Russian president Vladimir Putin have announced their intention to hold a Gays for Putin rally ahead of March's presidential election, despite the country's stringent laws on homosexuality.
Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.
We cannot be in a constitutional crisis when the executive branch is 1) complying with court orders and 2) using constitutional means to tell congress to shove it.

At the urging of gay bloggers, in 2012, Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin was investigated by his university and attempts were made to bring him up on charges and get him fired for reaching much the same conclusions as Sullins has reached.

Raymond Hersman – President Trump commuted the sentence of Raymond Hersman. Mr. Hersman is a 55 year-old father of two who has served more than 9 years of a 20 year sentence.

Upon release, he looks forward to transitioning back into the community and leading a productive life with strong family support.
Jon Harder – President Trump commuted the sentence of Jon Harder, former President and CEO of Sunwest Management Inc., who has served nearly 5 years of a 15-year prison sentence. Notable figures, including the Honorable Michael Hogan who served as the Federal judge overseeing Sunwest's bankruptcy and receivership, Ford Elsaesser who served as counsel to Sunwest's creditors in receivership, and multiple other individuals involved in the litigation support Mr. Harder's commutation. Mr. Harder was serving as president and CEO of Sunwest Management Inc., a large management company overseeing residential senior care facilities, when he misused investment funds during the real estate crisis. Mr. Harder fully accepted responsibility, pled guilty, and cooperated with the government's civil and criminal actions against him at great personal cost. According to former Chief Judge Hogan, Mr. Harder's full cooperation against his substantial financial and penal interests helped secure the sale of the company's assets, ensuring that Sunwest's investors recovered more of their investment, seniors could continue living in their facilities, and employees could retain their livelihoods. Mr. Elsaesser stated that of all the financial wrongdoers that [the court and the Government] dealt with during the real estate crash of 2008, Mr. Harder acted more responsibly than any of his 'peers.' President Trump commends Mr. Harder for choosing to put his employees, investors, and the senior citizens residing in Sunwest's homes above himself.
The charity also said the practice was a form of abuse and explained the true scale of the problem was hard to grasp because of a culture of secrecy, shame, and threats.
ThinkProgress has tried to smear Sullins for his religious faith and his priesthood. The author, Zack Ford, a columnist and not an expert in sociological research, called the study hugely flawed and ran a picture of Sullins in his priestly garb. He also complained that the study was carried out on children raised by gays prior to the legalization of gay marriage, proposing that marriage will make all the difference in outcomes for kids.
Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?

Things are about to change. Don't worry: it won't last forever. These things never do. It's a phase, and if you fly over it at 30,000 feet, what you will see is that all this social justice-systemic racism-defund the police nonsense comes down to one thing… The Democrat Party is returning to its soft-on-crime roots, and in the end, this will not end well for Democrats.

This isn't an easy one to accomplish. I know because I've done it twice already. But you have to get out. The Democrats that run these cities did not only stand by as their cities were burned and looted, as predominantly black neighborhoods were burned and looted by predominantly white, left-wing terrorist groups like Antifa — these Democrats encouraged and continue to encourage burning and looting.

Apparently imperialism is fine, but only in the pursuit of leftist goals like those of the LGBTQII++ lobby, in a mostly Christian nation.
The Anglican church claims some 85 million members worldwide and is divided into 38 provinces. Only eight of these are favorable to changing doctrine on marriage to allow for same-sex unions, namely, the U.S., Canada, Scotland, Wales, New Zealand, South India, South Africa and Brazil.
The social credit system is an all-encompassing control method in which the government assigned a numerical value to the credit of a person to society. The number is based on both loyalty to the Party and general courtesy in public – both political dissidence and general misbehavior, such as littering or jaywalking, could hurt a person's score. The consequences of a low score make it harder for a person to participate in society by limiting access to flights, trains, and public transportation or depriving people of access to government services.
Paul Erickson – President Trump has issued a full pardon to Paul Erikson. This pardon is supported by Kellyanne Conway. Mr. Erickson's conviction was based off the Russian collusion hoax. After finding no grounds to charge him with any crimes with respect to connections with Russia, he was charged with a minor financial crime. Although the Department of Justice sought a lesser sentence, Mr. Erickson was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment—nearly double the Department of Justice's recommended maximum sentence. This pardon helps right the wrongs of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American History.

Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.

Dr. Robert S. Corkern – President Trump granted a full pardon to Robert S. Corkern. This pardon is supported by Senators Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, Governor Phil Bryant, and Dr. Michael Mansour. Dr. Corkern was convicted of Federal program bribery.

A couple of years ago, I decided to move my movie collection to digital. But after The Simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, I've gotten smarter. Even if I already have a digital copy, I went back and purchased hard copies of movies and TV shows that are wonderfully problematic.

Blue slips are a courtesy that Senate Democrats have abused during the Trump presidency, which formerly allowed a home-state senator to insist on consultations but which were never intended as a one-senator veto on a nominee with majority support. Democrats' misuse of blue slips to derail nominees led to Grassley's discarding of the process, and last month, Sen.

If you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then I think it takes you to a pretty specific place, he added. I've learned that it's an expression of love, at least it can be. And I guess I believe it ought to be.

Not a very convincing performance. Is there any other Amendment to the Constitution the president would downplay in this way? Saying, It's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th Amendment.
P.S. Eighty-nine million who do not watch CNN are subsidizing this hate. Are you one of them?

Sharp, Mr. Young's sentencing judge, former law enforcement officials and Federal prosecutors, and multitudes of criminal justice reform advocates, including Alice Johnson, Kevin Ring, Jessica Jackson Sloan, Topeka Sam, Amy Povah, the Aleph Institute, Mark Holden, Doug Deason, and David Safavian, among others. Mr. Young, who is 32 years old, has served over 10 years of a 14 year sentence for his role in a drug conspiracy. Although initially sentenced to a mandatory life sentence that Judge Sharp called not appropriate in any way, shape, or form, Mr. Young has made productive use of his time in prison by taking courses and learning coding skills. He also has maintained a spotless disciplinary record. Mr. Young's many supporters describe him as an intelligent, positive person who takes full responsibility for his actions and who lacked a meaningful first chance in life due to what another Federal judge called an undeniably tragic childhood. With this commutation, President Trump provides Mr. Young with a second chance.

This massive 25 percent inflation of the labor supply is widely ignored by economists who struggle to understand why young men earn so much less than their parents. The new-labor inflation is made worse by the government's policy of importing temporary workers for good jobs in the expanding professional sectors. Roughly 1.5 million foreign guest-workers now hold jobs in healthcare, technology, academia and other sectors, even as young American college graduates struggle to pay off debts.

Sorry, decent people do not split hairs to excuse, champion, and encourage evil. Decent people remember that every one of history's monsters, from Hitler to Lenin to Castro to Pol Pot, believed they were fighting a good cause — some even believed they were fighting against bigotry and for social justice. So let's use this opportunity to examine Cuomo's definition of social justice.

Warren said, Let's talk about what we know for sure is at stake and some of the questions that the nominee is going to face. Donald Trump has already said that he's going to pick somebody who has been prescreened off a list that that was put together by a group whose number one job—an extremist group—is to make sure that Roe versus Wade gets overturned.
Unfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.

When you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule.
Shame doesn't say you did something bad, shame says you are bad, he said. And when you think and believe that you are bad, there's no way out. You say: 'You know what, forget it, I might as well use drugs, I might as well overeat, I might as well use porn.' Because if you believe that are bad, then you act accordingly. What you have to change is that paradigm in your life, you have to believe that you are good.

There was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.

A couple of years ago, I decided to move my movie collection to digital. But after The Simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, I've gotten smarter. Even if I already have a digital copy, I went back and purchased hard copies of movies and TV shows that are wonderfully problematic.

Mike will make hate and bias crimes a top federal priority, directing the FBI to take the lead on bias crime investigations, training local authorities to identify hate and pressing states to report all hate crimes to the federal government, and improving data collection on violent deaths of LGBTQ+ people.
What will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.
Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lives peacefully in her upstate Chappaqua, New York home, which is walled off from the general public by a giant white privacy wall.

Parents must be encouraged to feel that the birth of an inter-sex child is not a matter of embarrassment or shame, the court ruled. Any intersex child is entitled to stay within the folds of the family, he observed. The running away to the margins and beyond is a fatal journey that must be arrested. Time has come when they are brought back from the margins to the mainstream.

What kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.

Many parents throughout the United States say they have had enough, in fact, of the pornographic and gender-bending sex education curricula taught by organizations like Planned Parenthood – which profits from abortion and also boasts that it educates students about how to have LGBT-inclusive sex:
Dr. Frederick Nahas – President Trump granted a full pardon to Frederick Nahas. This pardon is supported by Representative Jeff Van Drew. Dr. Nahas is a talented surgeon with a practice in New Jersey. In the 1990s, Dr. Nahas became aware of a Federal investigation into his billing practices. Although the 6-year investigation uncovered no underlying billing fraud, Dr. Nahas did not fully cooperate and ultimately pled guilty to one count of obstructing justice in a health care investigation.

For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.
Corporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.

Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.

Gregory Jorgensen, Deborah Jorgensen, Martin Jorgensen – President Trump granted full pardons to Gregory and Deborah Jorgensen, and a posthumous pardon to Martin Jorgensen. Governor Kristi Noem and Senator Mike Rounds support clemency for this family, which has an exemplary record of service to their community. In the 1980's, Gregory and his father, Martin, gathered a group of South Dakota cattle producers to market and sold processed beef. The Jorgensen's marketed their beef under the Dakota Lean brand and sold the premium product as heart-healthy and antibiotic- and hormone-free. When demand outstripped supply, Gregory, Deborah, and Martin mixed in inferior, commercial beef trim and knowingly sold misbranded beef. Since their convictions in 1996, the Jorgensen's have served their community devotedly. Gregory was elected twice to the Tripp County Board of Commissioners and spearheaded infrastructure projects to improve access for Native American communities. Deborah is a lifelong member of a non-profit dedicated to promoting educational opportunities for women. And Martin was named National Beef Cattleman's Association Businessman of the Year. The Jorgensens have shown remorse for their previous action, and in light of decades of exemplary public service, they are well deserving of these pardons.
The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with foreign labor. That process spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. The policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.

But with a Republican in office, most especially a Republican named Donald Trump, the media are desperate to distract us from this inconvenient good news, and so they are manufacturing a fabricated reality where Mississippi is still burning, white supremacism is on the march, the Chinese are about to Red Dawn our economy, everyone's going to be shot at school, democracy itself teeters on the brink, and women are about to be forced back into the kitchen.
This massive 25 percent inflation of the labor supply is widely ignored by economists who struggle to understand why young men earn so much less than their parents. The new-labor inflation is made worse by the government's policy of importing temporary workers for good jobs in the expanding professional sectors. Roughly 1.5 million foreign guest-workers now hold jobs in healthcare, technology, academia and other sectors, even as young American college graduates struggle to pay off debts.
Even liberal advocates admit that children do best when raised by their own mom and dad. Secular sociologist Sara McLanahan of Princeton University and other secular experts have reported for decades that children do best within normal families.

At the time of her arrest, Ms. Butler was caring for five children and held two minimum-wage jobs. Upon her release, Ms. Butler wishes to reunite with her family and seek employment.
That was 2014, and laws were being passed that were shaving women's right to make their own choices with their bodies. We hadn't had to worry about that kind of thing since Bill Clinton was elected—we thought that war was over.

Planned Parenthood has been attacked more in the last 2 years than in the last 20.

Axelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.
Todd Boulanger – President Trump granted a full pardon to Todd Boulanger. Mr. Boulanger's pardon is supported by numerous friends, as well as by past and present business associates. In 2008, Mr. Boulanger pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. He has taken full responsibility for his conduct. Mr. Boulanger is a veteran of the United States Army Reserves and was honorably discharged. He has also received an award from the City of the District of Columbia for heroism for stopping and apprehending an individual who assaulted an elderly woman with a deadly weapon on Capitol Hill. Mr. Boulanger is known as a model member of his community. In addition, he is remorseful for his actions and would like to leave his mistakes behind him.

The concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. An individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. And as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. But the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania. Physicians who have embraced transgender ideology are enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. Transgender treatment for those with gender dysphoria has grown into an elaborate industry. The cost of top surgery, for example, is over $10,000.

Robert Sherrill – President Trump granted a full pardon to Robert Sherrill. Mr. Sherrill was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Mr. Sherrill has taken full responsibility for his criminal past and received treatment for his drug addiction. He started a commercial cleaning business as well as a non-profit organization that mentors at-risk youth.
Both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.

In his writing and speaking, Welch shared the wisdom he gained in a GE career that began right after he left grad school. He quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and CEO in 1981, at age 45. Welch quickly shook up GE, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname Neutron Jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. Welch also divested GE of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be No. 1 or 2 in their markets. The early moves dismantled GE's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.

Though Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in October announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue.

Thank God states like Alabama are aggressively looking to put an end to the holocaust of abortion.

Todd Farha, Thaddeus Bereday, William Kale, Paul Behrens, Peter Clay – President Trump granted full pardons to Todd Farha, Thaddeus Bereday, William Kale, Paul Behrens, and Peter Clay, former executives of a healthcare maintenance organization. Widely cited as a case study in overcriminalization, these men have attracted a broad range of support, including from the CATO Institute, the Reason Foundation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and various scholars and law professors. In 2008, Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay were criminally prosecuted for a state regulatory matter involving the reporting of expenditures to a state health agency. The expenditures reported were based on actual monies spent, and the reporting methodology was reviewed and endorsed by those with expertise in the state regulatory scheme. Notably, there was no evidence that any of the individuals were motivated by greed. And in fact, the sentencing judge called the likelihood that there was any personal financial motivation infinitesimal. The judge imposed a range of sentences from probation to 3 years' imprisonment, reflecting the conduct as an aberration from these individuals' otherwise law-abiding lives. Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay are described as devoted to their family and their communities, and have weathered their convictions without complaint.

In fact, he has committed to supporting a variety of charitable efforts, such as providing educational resources to students and families of fallen law enforcement officers and the underprivileged. In addition to these efforts, he has paid for the notebooks of school children, provided funding and supplies to daycare centers, provided food for the hungry, and annually provides for underprivileged children during Christmas. Most recently while still incarcerated, Kodak Black donated $50,000 to David Portnoy's Barstool Fund, which provides funds to small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kodak Black's only request was that his donation go toward restaurants in his hometown.

Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.
Among the leaders Welch groomed was his GE successor, Jeffrey Immelt. Welch has written that picking his successor leading up to the 2001 leadership transition was the most important and agonizing decision he ever made.

James Brian Cruz – President Trump commuted the remaining sentence of James Brian Cruz. Mr. Cruz's many supporters include Alice Johnson, Dr. Robert Jeffress, Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, Kelly Shackelford of the First Liberty Institute, several former inmates who Mr. Cruz mentored or ministered, Mr. Cruz's work supervisor, and several business owners and managers. Mr. Cruz, who has served approximately half of a 40-year sentence for a drug crime, has truly reformed and has worked to better his life and the lives of other inmates while in prison. Several former inmates credit Mr. Cruz, whom they met while incarcerated, as someone who helped changed their life, as a great source of comfort for many, and one who helps others without looking for anything in return. Mr. Cruz's work supervisor describes him as a dependable and hard-working employee, who has gained the respect of many staff workers and inmates alike and who helps arguing inmates make peace. Mr. Cruz writes that he recognizes the effect drugs have on people, families, and the community, and desires a second chance to live life as one who upholds the law, and lives to help others.

Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Chick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, Martini said. I think it's imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.

South Bend Mayor and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg suggested Tuesday that Vice President Mike Pence is not as sincere in his Christian faith as he claims to be, judging based on his political alliance with President Donald Trump.
When the right of the transgender persons to marry has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the very nature of things, they cannot be kept out of the purview of the Hindu Marriage Act, he added. One can have a civil marriage. One can also have a sacramental marriage. The petitioners' marriage was solemnized in a temple. Therefore, their fundamental right under Article 25 has also been infringed in this case.
His former employers described him as a quiet and introverted man who would prioritize things in his own way, KVUE reported.
Forget all that, though, and ask yourself on what planet does a decent person even attempt to defend a gang of thugs who dress all in black, wear masks, and brandish weapons?

He added: I watched the wedding video and [the victim] was slumped in a chair almost comatose.
The major limitation of of the study is that the database contained information on kids raised by only twenty same-sex couples. But there are very few children raised by gays at all, let alone over a long period. Even so, as sociologist Mark Regnerus says of this study, This makes the same-sex household estimates displayed in the graph imprecise, but it does nothing to undermine the significance of the differences between groups.
The goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.
Attorney and writer Jane Robbins observed at the Witherspoon Institute's Public Discourse:
Again, NBC could not confirm is the same Mark A. Conditt authored the posts on this blogsite.

The video is reportedly a production of China Youth Credit Action, a campaign to promote the social credit system supervised by the Communist Youth League. The Youth League is responsible for recruiting young communists, ensuring that young people do not deviate away from communist values, and controlling nearly every aspect of the lives of its members. The group has worked to promote banning participation in Western festivities such as Christmas, and launched a dating service in 2017 to promote marriage and reproduction among communists (and, presumably, to keep communists from falling in love with unauthorized persons who may hold alternative points of view).
Kane didn't testify at her trial. She was convicted in August of two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges, and she resigned the next day.
In addition to states passing more laws banning abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy, requiring higher levels of safety in abortion clinics, and eliminating taxpayer funding from the abortion group, Planned Parenthood is still reeling from a series of videos exposing its apparent practices of selling the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and altering the positions of babies during abortion in order to be able to harvest the most intact organs.
As Artsy reports, Minter – now in her 60s – has been known for her depictions of women in the throes of sexual pleasure or adorned with dirt and diamonds since the 1970s.

Why Gay Marriage Should be Illegal
It's more than just a social justice issue, it's a humanitarian issue, she said.
In an ocean of leftist news outlets Fox News is a lonely buoy that offers some right-of-center opinion. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) (aka Indian Princess Lies-Like-a-Rug) is only the latest example of the hate poured all over Fox, but according to CNN and other media outlets, Fox is a disease helping to spread all six of the phony crises listed above.
The German cardinal tied his remarks to claims by the late Jesuit cardinal Carlo Maria Martini that the Church was 200 years behind the times and needed to modernize in order to catch up.

And yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.
Closing the detention center was one of Obama's main campaign promises, but in spite of his promises and the Executive Order he immediately issued upon entering the White House, Obama never did shutter the facility. Instead, he began a campaign of transferring prisoners from the facility to nations that volunteered to take them.

Her report said that there were approximately 100,000 Sharia marriages, many of which are not recognised by UK law and therefore do not offer the same legal protections to women in cases of divorce. A sizeable proportion of these 'marriages' are thought to be polygynous (specifically where a man has multiple wives).
Cable news is poison. Hollywood's idea of entertainment today is either pushing sex on your children or straight-up propaganda. Why are you paying to pump this garbage into your home? What, you like paying $125 a month to have CNNLOL deliberately misinform you and then call you racist, to have MTV glorify degeneracy?

Now… If you're a Democrat, you need to stay put. We don't need you voting to Californicate the rest of the country.
The media cannot defeat Trump in 2020 based on the mostly positive results of his policies; they cannot argue against the first era of peace and prosperity we've enjoyed in almost two decades, so they're trying to stress us out with these absurd hoaxes even though the planet is cooling, eggs are 98 cents a dozen, and our guys are not dying in futile overseas wars.
Wilson did admit that refraining from sex wasn't an easy decision, especially with such a beautiful woman as Ciara. I ain't gonna lie to y'all now, I need y'all to pray for us. I know y'all seen her on the screen, he said.
Overturning Roe v. Wade means the states get to decide on the legality of abortion, which means it will always be legal somewhere. With all the government money they receive, I'm sure Planned Parenthood will be able to offer a free bus pass with every child murder.
Secondly, if white supremacism was a real problem in America, CNN and the rest of the media would not be forced to manufacture one hate crime after another: Remember Hands Up, Don't Shoot; George Zimmerman the White Hispanic; the KKKids from KKKovington High School; Jussie Smollett? All hoaxes.
The phenomena also varies among racial and ethnic groups. Black (36 percent) and Hispanic (36 percent) young adults are more likely to live at home than are white (30 percent) young adults.

But-but-but they fight bigotry, Cuomo argues — which is like arguing we need to remember Mussolini kept the trains running on time, Hitler built the autobahn, Mao fought for equality, and Stalin threw good dinner parties…
Dating back to 1880, the most common living arrangement among young adults has been living with a romantic partner, whether a spouse or a significant other, it continues. This type of arrangement peaked around 1960, when 62% of the nation's 18- to 34-year-olds were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, and only one-in-five were living with their parents.
I'm not surprised by the continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward . . . She's shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections — her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins, McCain said in a statement released to the Arizona Republic late Tuesday.
Wetlaufer resigned the Harvard editing post in 2002 because of a furor caused by her relationship with Welch. In a January 2012 interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, when asked how he persuaded Wetlaufer to marry him, Welch replied, My charm and probably my wallet.

The British government called Bermuda's decision disappointing but resisted getting involved despite the island's status as a British Overseas Territory. It's almost as if the Brits retain some knowledge about holding together an empire. If Bermuda were in the European Union, there'd have probably been some kind of sanctions, or perhaps a gay-migrant quota by now.

Dr. Faustino Bernadett – President Trump granted a full pardon to Dr. Faustino Bernadett. In approximately early 2008, Dr. Bernadett failed to report a hospital kickback scheme of which he became aware. Notably, he was not part of the underlying scheme itself, and unaffiliated himself with the hospital shortly thereafter. This conviction is the only major blemish on Dr. Bernadett's record. Although now retired, Dr. Bernadett has spent the past year devoted to helping protect his community from COVID-19, including by: procuring PPE and medical supplies for nurses; advising hospitals on expanding patient capacity and continuing prenatal services; identifying care facilities for first responders and the homeless; providing meals and books to underprivileged students; funding online educational resources for a distressed Catholic elementary school in Dr. Bernadett's neighborhood; and helping to ensure that senior citizens maintain social connections by training volunteer callers to speak with nursing home residents.

With today's pardon, Ms. Steib-Martin is relieved of the crushing restitution she incurred at such a young age.
Hard to be more clear than that. Obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. And then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. Finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. But had he really? According to chief strategist David Axelrod, Obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:

Mr. Gibson accepts responsibility for his actions.
Marriage and cohabitation have been on the decline since 1990, according to Pew, which projects that one-in-four millennials will never marry.

As it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts.

This commutation is supported by former Acting United States Attorney Sam Sheldon, who prosecuted his case and wrote that he … strongly does not believe that [Mr. Scott] deserves a mandatory life sentence. Ms. Alice Johnson, the CAN-DO Foundation, and numerous others also support clemency for Mr. Scott.

Parents must be encouraged to feel that the birth of an inter-sex child is not a matter of embarrassment or shame, the court ruled.

The concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. An individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. And as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. But the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania. Physicians who have embraced transgender ideology are enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. Transgender treatment for those with gender dysphoria has grown into an elaborate industry. The cost of top surgery, for example, is over $10,000.

After a nosey member of the community found out Shelly Fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. Not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. For 15 years, Shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School (RHS), a Catholic High School in Indiana. And when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. They gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. Shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. And she plans to hire a lawyer. But should she have to? The school says they have every right to force Shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the Catholic Church both in and out of school. That includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.

WATCH: My friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic.

Why We Might Want to Consider Doing Away with Sex Offender Registration
The college blog posts allegedly written by Conditt paint a picture of a politically conservative person.
This case is about ego – the ego of a politician consumed with her image from Day One, Demchick-Alloy said. This case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant … felt had embarrassed her in the press.
He will be deeply missed by me and the entire GE team. And we'll continue to honor his legacy by doing exactly what Jack would want us to do: win. We extend our thoughts and sympathies to Suzy and his family during this time.
The outlet further reports that Jolie was unhappy with the way Pitt, 52, was raising their children. The couple — who married in 2014 but have been together since 2004 — are parents to six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivenne, both 8.
So we go to this bakery a week ago to sign up for tasting and choose our wedding cake. The owner met with us today to set up the process, Del Rio wrote. Well this rude ass person says I will make your order but I don't condone same sex marriages and will have no part in this process. Oh but you want to take my order and give it another bakery so that bakery can do it.
A ceremony, when you're getting married is in the eyes of the Lord, okay, and that's a celebration of a union that God has brought together and that's a whole lot different than coming in and wanting a cookie, Miller explained.
She's been famous since she was 11 and she's a great artist, so she doesn't care about making money—she wants to give back, she continued. She founded the Happy Hippie Foundation, which supports LGBTQ youth. She flies commercial because she's conscious of her carbon footprint. Now she's going to help us with Planned Parenthood.
The teaching of the Encyclical Humanae Vitae ought to be taken up anew, Francis wrote, in order to counter a mentality that is often hostile to life.
Lesbian singer Aiza Seguerra ripped Pacquiao on Instagram: You might've done our country proud but with your statement, you just showed the whole country why we shouldn't vote for you. And yes, I think you are an ignorant, bigoted hypocrite.
Riddle me this: How much white supremacism can there be in America when the long-dead Kate Smith has to be disinterred for a Two Minute Hate? Good grief, there is so little racism in America, we are forced to dig up corpses just so we can have something to virtual signal at. And even then, the racism charge is still a hoax. Kate Smith was no racist.
As Artnet reports, Minter earned Planned Parenthood's Woman of Valor award.
The president did not pardon Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, two whistleblowers who illegally shared America's intelligence and national security secrets.

Mr. Ford's pardon is supported by members of the coal mining community, including those with extensive experience in mining operations, safety, and engineering, who describe Mr. Ford as a model manager who conducts himself with the utmost professionalism and integrity. Twenty years ago, Mr. Ford made a material misstatement to Federal mining officials. Mr. Ford pled guilty and served a sentence of 30 years' probation. In the decades since, Mr. Ford has been an upstanding member of his community and has used this experience and his decades of expertise to keep miners safe, including promoting truthfulness and integrity with Federal mining officials, for whom Mr. Ford states that he has the utmost respect.

Marriage is up by 43 percent since 2010, while divorce has dropped by 22.5 percent in the same period. This demographic turnaround has not been an accident, but the fruit of deliberate programs to promote marriage and the family while defending Hungary's cultural identity and Christian roots.
David and his twin brother, Jason, gained fame as successful businessmen who were offered a show on the Home and Garden TV channel but were abruptly fired after their Christian worldview was revealed, including their support for traditional marriage between a man and a woman and respecting life from conception to natural death.

Some Catholics want the Church to modernize, abandoning its doctrines for the sake of building a new religion of world unity, Müller warned thousands of Catholics gathered in Phoenix for the 2020 Student Leadership Summit hosted by the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS).
You need to keep a close eye on what your school is teaching because the left only wants to teach your kids to engage in loveless sex, the sanctity of abortion, why America is evil, that men are women and women are men, and that Global Warming is real. (It's not.)
Her report said that there were approximately 100,000 Sharia marriages, many of which are not recognised by UK law and therefore do not offer the same legal protections to women in cases of divorce. A sizeable proportion of these 'marriages' are thought to be polygynous (specifically where a man has multiple wives).
I have been honored to stand with the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for equality and justice, from New York, where we won marriage equality in 2011, to states across the country. That fight – true to our nation's highest ideals – has achieved historic progress, but we still have a long way to go. As president, I will work to protect every member of the LGBTQ+ community from hatred, violence, and discrimination. We will close disparities in health care access and quality, stop violence against transgender people, and advocate for equal rights across the world. We cannot settle for anything less – and I won't.
Swaminathan chose to discard the ruling by referring to cases such as the recent decriminalization of homosexuality while observing that equal rights are afforded to transgenders under the Indian Constitution.
Romney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.
Announcing the move, the administration thanked the small Eastern European nation for taking the accused terrorist off America's hands
Dr. Mahmoud Reza Banki – President Trump granted a full pardon to Dr. Mahmoud Reza Banki. This pardon is supported by many elected officials of stature, including the late Representative John Lewis, Senator Diane Feinstein, and other Members of Congress. Dr. Banki is an Iranian American citizen who came to the United States when he was 18 years old. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, before obtaining a PhD from Princeton University and an MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2010 Dr. Banki was charged with monetary violations of Iranian sanctions and making false statements. The charges related to sanctions violations were subsequently overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. However, the felony charges for making false statements have prevented Dr. Banki from resuming a full life. In the years since his conviction, Dr. Banki has dedicated himself to his community and maintained a sincere love and respect for the United States.

It saddens me because when I think about the blessings of marriage, first of all it's one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional, the 37-year-old said. It is morally one of the best things in my life. Being married to Chasten makes me a better person. I would even say it moves me closer to God.

My disgust with this arrest and the subsequent articles is bottomless… This investigation only began because Mr. Kurson was nominated to a role within the Trump Administration. He has been a community leader in New York and New Jersey for decades. In addition, Mr. Kurson is a certified foster parent, a successful business owner, and is passionate about various charitable causes.

Men are more likely to earn less. In 1975, only a quarter of 25 to 34-year-old men made less than $30K per year, but that number rose to 41% in 2016. Going deeper: As a measure of upward mobility, 92% of 30-year-olds in 1970 earned more than their parents at that age, according to a 2016 study led by Raj Chetty, a Stanford economist (h/t Roger Lowenstein). But of those who were 30 in 2014, just half earned more. [Economist Raj] Chetty attributed most of this erosion to slower GDP growth and a change in the distribution of GDP favoring higher earners: GDP would have to rise by 6% a year to get the same impact, he said, and wealth would have to be distributed much more evenly.

Another possibility is that they will be mutilated by censors. Problematic scenes, moments, characters, and words will be removed.
Drew Brownstein – President Trump granted a full pardon to Drew Brownstein, who, other than this conviction, was described by his sentencing judge as someone who goes out of his way to help people that are less fortunate.

That was 2014, and laws were being passed that were shaving women's right to make their own choices with their bodies. We hadn't had to worry about that kind of thing since Bill Clinton was elected—we thought that war was over. Laurie, Cindy, and I—and so many others—worked so hard for abortion rights in the '70s and '80s, and all of a sudden that work started to unravel. Planned Parenthood has been attacked more in the last 2 years than in the last 20.

Mr. Carter has exhibited this generosity through commitment to a variety of charities, including donations to research hospitals and a host of foodbanks. Deion Sanders, who also wrote in support of this pardon, calls Mr. Wayne a provider for his family, a friend to many, a man of faith, a natural giver to the less fortunate, a waymaker, [and] a game changer.
Human Rights Watch's Andrea Prasow praised Omar as a leader on the subject:  With an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that Congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.
One of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.

Seriously, y'all, it's all a hoax, it's all fake news, and summer is on the horizon. So unless you live in a city like Baltimore, Chicago, or San Francisco — a city exclusively run by Democrats for the last 50 or so years that is now filled with poverty, the homeless, and poop; take a vacation from the media, take a breath, take a step outside, and take a long look around… Life is good in Trump's America, about as good as it gets… And all of this hysterical BS, this crises propaganda, these lies, are all being manufactured to take our eye off that fact.

The pope's most controversial move during his tumultuous, 15-year pontificate was the publication of the 1968 encyclical letter titled Humanae Vitae (On Human Life), which confirmed the church's longstanding teaching regarding the immorality of the use of contraceptives to avoid pregnancy. Many inside and outside the church had expected Paul to overturn traditional teaching on contraception, along with the majority of the members of a special commission Paul had set up to study the question.
Roncalli is a private school but they also receive state funding through Indiana's School Choice Voucher program. An annual report from the Indiana Department of Education shows that the school received more than $1.5 million in taxpayer dollars last year.
Omar describes the legislative package, titled Pathway to PEACE (Progressive, Equitable, and Constructive Engagement), as a bold progressive vision to rethink the country's approach to foreign policy by centering human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America's engagement in the world, and making military action a last resort in a press release. I believe in a world where there are no young girls living through war, and no nations that are being destroyed, she declared in the statement.
Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.

Upon release, Mr. Francis, a father of 3, will live with his sister in Houston, Texas.
Axelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.
Because of its abolition of real sexual differences in favor of subjective gender identities, the proposed legislation would force girls and women to compete against boys and men for limited opportunities in school sports, and to share locker rooms and shower spaces with biological males who claim to identify as women, the bishops contend.
Let me tell you right now, if you don't own hard copies of Manhattan (and probably all of Woody Allen's movies), Married with Children, Gone with the Wind, and pretty much every one of Normal Lear's 1970's sitcoms (All in the Family, Sanford & Son, etc.), you will eventually lose them.

When I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, 'So how exactly are you running the company?' Jack was still in it – committed to GE's success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling, said GE's current CEO, Larry Culp.
Internalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.

In the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as Iran and Venezuela.

People often say that activists are cut off from the people. In Russia, there are millions of homosexuals, and almost none of them participate in [anti-Putin] demonstrations. Therefore, homosexuals support President Putin's towards LGBT people. Putin signs laws that serve the strengthen the moral and spiritual foundations of Russian society. Notable homosexuals are awarded with orders and medals. Many gay people in our country say, Putin is our President. Gays are for Putin!

Pope John Paul II spent the first five years of his 27-year papacy explaining the theology underlying Humanae Vitae in a series of weekly addresses in what he described as a theology of the body. As Michael Waldstein has written, One of the main goals of the theology of the body is the defense of Paul VI's prophetic encyclical Humanae Vitae.
I have two qualifications that I have talked about over and over for my secretary of education, Warren said. The first, it has to be someone who has taught in a public school.

Mr. Conway is active in his community and in various philanthropic efforts.

Welch became one of the nation's most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as GE's chairman and chief executive, from 1981 to 2001.

In order to be admitted to this meta-religion, the only price the Church would have to pay is giving up her truth claim, the cardinal told the students.

Los Angeles just slashed police funding. New York is gearing up to slash police funding. I'm telling you, it's over…
Rather than affirm human dignity in ways that meaningfully exceed existing practical protections, the Equality Act would discriminate against people of faith, they insist.

It became a thing where I didn't tell anybody, Crews says in the first video. It was my secret, nobody knew, and that allowed it to grow, and it got bad. If day turns into night and you are still watching, you probably got a problem, and that was me. I didn't tell my wife, didn't tell my friends, nobody knew.

Martini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus.
John Nystrom – President Trump granted a full pardon to John Nystrom, who, other than this conviction, was described by his sentencing judge as a model citizen. His clemency is supported by Governor Kristi Noem and Senator Michael Rounds. Over 10 years ago, while working as a contractor on a school reconstruction project, Mr. Nystrom failed to alert the proper authorities when he learned that a subcontractor was receiving double payments for work performed.

One of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

Throughout his life, Mr. Johnson has made numerous contributions for the conservation of wildlife.
If we know that more teens are waiting to have sex today than 25 years ago, then shouldn't we be reinforcing those healthy decisions and building upon that? HHS asked. Similarly, we know that teen pregnancy rates have decreased and yet sexually transmitted diseases and infection have increased to record levels. There's something going on there, and we need to learn what it is and to make sure we make some amendments to the messages we're communicating, because we can't be satisfied with those numbers.

Internalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.

Seriously, y'all, it's all a hoax, it's all fake news, and summer is on the horizon. So unless you live in a city like Baltimore, Chicago, or San Francisco — a city exclusively run by Democrats for the last 50 or so years that is now filled with poverty, the homeless, and poop; take a vacation from the media, take a breath, take a step outside, and take a long look around… Life is good in Trump's America, about as good as it gets… And all of this hysterical BS, this crises propaganda, these lies, are all being manufactured to take our eye off that fact.

The Library Journal published an article calling for a ban on books guilty of whiteness, whatever the hell that is. The Little House books are being burned.

When you have a sense of entitlement, it's extremely dangerous, Crews said. What entitlement does is it gives you self-pity. And self-pity — it feels good. It feels good.

Gregory Jorgensen, Deborah Jorgensen, Martin Jorgensen – President Trump granted full pardons to Gregory and Deborah Jorgensen, and a posthumous pardon to Martin Jorgensen. Governor Kristi Noem and Senator Mike Rounds support clemency for this family, which has an exemplary record of service to their community. In the 1980's, Gregory and his father, Martin, gathered a group of South Dakota cattle producers to market and sold processed beef. The Jorgensen's marketed their beef under the Dakota Lean brand and sold the premium product as heart-healthy and antibiotic- and hormone-free. When demand outstripped supply, Gregory, Deborah, and Martin mixed in inferior, commercial beef trim and knowingly sold misbranded beef. Since their convictions in 1996, the Jorgensen's have served their community devotedly. Gregory was elected twice to the Tripp County Board of Commissioners and spearheaded infrastructure projects to improve access for Native American communities. Deborah is a lifelong member of a non-profit dedicated to promoting educational opportunities for women. And Martin was named National Beef Cattleman's Association Businessman of the Year. The Jorgensens have shown remorse for their previous action, and in light of decades of exemplary public service, they are well deserving of these pardons.

Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.

His administration proposed only funding CSE programs, which assume all middle school children need to know where to get the morning-after pill and how to use a condom.
Honestly, any rational person who lives in the real world — and I like to count myself among that group — must be baffled by the news media's ongoing meltdown; the screech of one crisis after another, which reflects nothing close to reality.

And by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are.
