Younger adults— those under age 35—have reduced their spending compared with previous generations possibly because of weakened job prospects, delayed marriage, and educational debt. Policy makers have recognized that lower spending limits economic growth. As a result, a number of policies to boost younger adults spending such as forgiving student debt have entered the political arena, according to Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey. Student loans make up the majority of the $1,005,000,000,000 owed by this cohort, followed by mortgage debt.

I woke up and discovered, to my horror, that Trump had won. She didn't hide her horror from those close to her. After Trump was elected, a friend in Kennebunkport gave her a Trump countdown clock as a joke. The red, white, and blue digital clock displayed how many days, hours, minutes and seconds remained in Trump's term. She parked it on the side table in her bedroom, next to the chair she would sit in to needlepoint or watch television. She liked the countdown clock so much that when the Bushes returned to Houston that October, she brought it with her. It sat on her bedside table, where she could see it every day. It was there to the day she died.

Biden says he has said that it took much too long to get it right. He says nobody will be deported at all in the first 100 days of his administration. Biden says after that only felons will get deported and everyone else will get to stay.

For example, she said, according to Sharia law, when a husband dies, the husband's family takes everything, but if there is religious plurality in a society, there is recourse for a woman.
Phillips's article even describes a conversation with Amra, a female Sharia court judge, detailing advice for the aspirant bigamist, which calls into question the on-going legal standing of such tribunals. At no point during their cosy chat does anyone mention that they are discussing the facilitation of a criminal offence made illegal in Britain in 1861.
The existential threat held over Bradley is an abortionist, is the horror of having his unborn baby girl, a child he already adores, cut into small pieces and mailed to him. In Cell Block 99, the unborn are not a fetus or a clump of cells, they are a blessed event and in its own pulpy way, we are forced to come to terms with the fact that abortion truly is murder.

Or fire her. That's what the sex-scandal-plagued news network must do to maintain even the slightest shred of journalistic integrity. She can't report on the most powerful family in the country while dating one of them.

Like the rest of academia, Marquette is less and less a real university, concluded McAdams.
At the heart of Lovell's complaint about McAdams is his charge that McAdams should be responsible for the negative emails the teaching assistant received. McAdams writes to Lovell, After posting some vitriolic emails sent by others to Ms. Abbate, you went on to tell the university that 'a professor inflicting this type of personal attack on a student' is unacceptable as if I either had a hand in these emails or launched a comparable attack on Ms. Abbate. Both implications are outrageous and you know it.
Columnist Salma Al-Qusheiri agrees with her counterpart, but in harsher tones, calling Mirza's proposal for a polygamy academy as oppressive and misogynistic.

HR 5 is a sweeping assault on the religious liberty rights of people of faith while simultaneously enacting powerful special legal rights for the LGBT community, he explained.

Comey had still other chances to inform Trump about the highly questionable origins of the dossier.
The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people, it floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.

The Constitution says that a president can be impeached only for high crimes and misdemeanors. And each senator takes an oath at an impeachment trial that the senator will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.
As a Christian charity, The Salvation Army has been controversialised by the political left in recent years, with Labour politicians and activists in Reading getting Britain's first Chick-fil-A shut down in 2019 over its donations to the Sally and two other Christian charities — because they had opposed same-sex marriage.
I've worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all, Allen continued. I've always had a wonderful record with them.
As a fan of the gangster genre, and an even bigger fan of David Chase (Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The Rockford Files), like a few million others, I caught the Sopranos premiere on HBO and … was disappointed. It was nothing like I expected, it was not Goodfellas in Jersey. Who cares about Tony's home life? But I hung in there and realized that throughout the week I was thinking about The Sopranos, talking about it, something I had not done since Twin Peaks, another show that took some time to fall in love with.
Obviously the movie opposes the death penalty — you know, even as it proves the system works. Hey, if the system works in racist Alabama, it must work everywhere.

Last May, Trump even marked Pride celebrations by thanking praising the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to America's history while calling on people to stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation.
Donohue then continued with many examples of left-wing inflammatory rhetoric, including:

It is further noted that the provision of such extensive welfare payments creates a poverty trap that prevents the remaining impoverished citizens of McDowell County from moving away, as so many others have already done. In other words, every form of ambition has been destroyed, leaving behind an atmosphere of sustained despair, and government money will ensure it grinds on forever.
Then, on February 7, Bezos posted his account of the Enquirer story, including the sensational allegation that the tabloid had tried to blackmail him over lewd personal photos that it had obtained.
Tourism would not suffer, he adds. Obviously, there would be no need to require tourist visas for EU citizens any more than we do for Americans now. Nor would there be any need for restrictions on students, or genuine marriage. Even freedom to live elsewhere could be protected: EU citizens could still come to live in the UK provided they had the means to support themselves.

The multi-racial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based opposition to cheap labor migration co-exists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950's Nation of Immigrants claim.

The Italian thing, the mother thing, the tradition thing, the need-to-control thing, the status thing, the alpha-male thing… Tony's existence is all about rationalizing as duty his endless pursuit of worldly pleasures — of those distractions until you die. The result is that Tony lives in a prison of his own making, a prison built on bullshit. And now he is barren and miserable and paying the price for abandoning his one true duty, that purpose which is truly fulfilling — being a decent and loving family man, being his own man.
Le Pen stressed the Front National are also determined to honour other pledges outlined within proposal No. 87, such as the promise to reserve PMA (medically assisted procreation) as a tool to treat fertility problems, which would restrict the treatment to heterosexual couples.

[Alain] Malcolm was tall and handsome. The oldest son of Jamaican immigrants, he wholly subscribed to the idea of the American dream. In high school, Malcolm was vice president of the Future Business Leaders of America club, assistant captain of the tennis and swim teams and a member of the student council and Model United Nations. He started a social marketing business at 15. After graduating in 2016, Malcolm filled his Instagram and Facebook feeds with photos of New York high-rises, bathroom selfies in three-piece suits and links to news articles in which he was featured. He went to community college while working as a junior buyer for a local circuit-board manufacturer and was the subject of a Connecticut Public Television series that profiled recent high school graduates. Earlier this year, he was named one of Litchfield County's 40 Leaders Under 40. Malcolm was also gay, which was difficult growing up in a religious family in Torrington, a sleepy former mill town in the northwest part of the state, friends said. It's not easy to be black, Jamaican, a Jehovah's Witness and gay in Torrington, Connecticut, said Allie Morrissey, a friend of Malcolm's. Starting in high school, Malcolm used apps like Tinder and Grindr to meet men from around the state, friends said. On that October night, he had come to Bristol to meet someone younger, purportedly a 14-year-old boy going on 15, according to a video posted by the digital vigilante group known as POPSquad.
8:09 PM: Biden, when asked about a national quarantine, says he would call a meeting in the Situation Room of all the experts and ask them what the country has to do. Biden says there is a single-payer system in Italy and it doesn't work there. But Biden says the government should ensure that nobody should have to pay for treatment. Biden says instead of doing this in the United States, he would bring together the leading experts in the world like the Obama administration did with the Ebola crisis. He says governors are making sound decisions in the absence of such leadership.

First, these are not immigrant children. They are children of illegal alien parents. Second, no innocent children are being physically harmed in any way, certainly not killed in their mother's womb. The Border Patrol is not Planned Parenthood. If illegal alien parents don't want to be separated from their children, how about not crossing the border illegally with them? This comparison is obscene and slanderous. Abortion and Planned Parenthood separate more kids from their families and mothers than the Border Patrol which, by the way, doesn't kill them in the womb. Liberals such as Camosy, whom I assume supports sanctuary cities, offer no sanctuary for the unborn who also seek to avoid violence and murder in what should be the safest safe space in the world — their mother's womb.
I used to be a feminist, but I gave it up so I could speak out for women's rights. Even before the intersectional, how many genders are there? lunacy took over, feminism was filled to bursting with types who think men are misogynists who all secretly want to rape us (this despite the fact that men are among the greatest supporters of women's rights) and a happily married mother is some kind of traitor.
Heard says that Depp allegedly offered her money to keep quiet about the violence, but she instead filed for divorce soon thereafter.

It is outrageous and inappropriate for Members of Congress to convert campaign donations to personal funds in this way, Tiffany said. It feeds public perceptions of corruption, undermines public trust in Congress, and must come to an end.
Gingrich said, I think we ought to take him head-on. This is the guy who told us at Saddleback Church that he believed in marriage between a man and woman because it came straight from the Bible and he believed it. This is the guy who told us, you get to keep your doctor, you get to keep your health insurance. This is the guy who said there was a red line in Syria, and exactly one year later, said he'd never said there was a red line in Syria. Barack Obama is a left-winger who has spent his entire career denying reality. One simple example, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs under Obama. We've already gained over 400,000 over — under Trump. I like that choice. I think you want to go back to Obama, higher unemployment, fewer jobs, more food stamps, let's have that debate. But let's — we need to have the courage to take head-on the real Obama, not the New York Times fantasy version.
The crackdown on danmei is part of a broader initiative by President Xi Jinping to suppress any organic expressions of Chinese culture that the government cannot control and replace it with socialist family values. In December 2016, Xi delivered a speech calling for a new trend toward socialist family values, followed by a crackdown on dating television shows, online video that did not conform to correct political and aesthetic standards, and any media promoting Western lifestyles.
Kimmel, however, is more than willing to disparage those who identify as LGBT — and is doing so on network television by using their identity as an insult.
Child marriage has also been a leading topic in Sweden following the migrant crisis with the Swedish parliament recently voting to ban all recognition of child marriages whether they took place in Sweden or abroad.
The singer-actress tweeted hysterically back in June about the impending end of the world.
It therefore seems unlikely that a newly established quango, such as extremism commission, will solve such problems. It is not wise to foster a society where volatile public opinion can be used to determine what might be extreme or acceptable views, he said.
Needless to say, the Post has always been in the bag for its owner—typical headline: Jeff Bezos stands his ground. (And all the others are just as puffy.) Yet other media outlets, too, are giving Bezos the hero treatment. Here's CNN's Brian Stelter:

There will be further tests, further questions placed in the test as it currently operates, and there will be the opportunity for people to comment on some of these changes over the course of the next, over the course of the period between now and 1 June. So we will consult around the questions around the values issues and we can provide further detail. There is also change to be made to the pledge and, again, we'll consult on that particular issue as well. So I'll leave it there. For example, domestic violence, a perpetrator of domestic violence. My view is that that person shouldn't become an Australian citizen. And we can ask that question but we can also undertake our own checks in relation to police checks or whatever the case might be. So that's how you can adopt, apply the test.

The pope was visiting the Catholic Shrine of Loreto, a pilgrimage site believed by many to contain the walls of the house of the Virgin Mary from Nazareth.

Today's young Indians plan no such mass exit, because there are now opportunities for them at home. Now I go back to India and see Indian families who used to endure the sweltering summer heat and go to the sea to wash their clothes now enjoy the full benefits of modern technology, including air conditioning and washing machines. India is doing measurably better, and now there is a large and newly-prosperous middle class. Even the country's global reputation has changed. Today Americans tell their children, Study hard because there are millions of Indians waiting to take your jobs.

Another favorite pop culture reference is when the movie-obsessed Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli) assumes the role of Joe Pesci's character in Goodfellas by shooting a mouthy smartass in the foot.

We better shut up about it if you know what's good for you because according to the United States Army, the quote, denial of white privilege is a classic sign of yes, white supremacy, so no complaining.

Instead of basing favored treatment under the law on a history of brutal and widespread injustice in America, liberals thought it should also be based on other forms of suffering, such as: being a woman, being a Muslim, wanting an abortion, having been born in Mexico, being a smelly homeless person stinking up the public library and — according to Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week — being a gay couple who wants to force a Christian to bake a cake for your wedding.
These so-called 'flexible tariffs' are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth – protectionism and uncertainty. Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster. I will immediately draft and introduce legislation to nullify these tariffs, and I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.

New research suggests that one of the main reasons the damage has been so deep and lasting is that the jobs lost from Chinese imports were not just from companies downsizing or becoming more efficient but from closing manufacturing plants altogether.

For obvious reason, the cardinal concluded, gender theory, which detaches gender from biological sex, radically contradicts the Church's teaching that the place of a sexual relationship can only be between a man and woman, within matrimony, and must always be open to procreation.
In reading this editorial, one gets the sense that the true villain of the 'McCarrick Report' is not the predatory ex-cardinal, but rather Pope John Paul II, Donohue said, adding:

Grow our economy. This bill clears employment-based visa backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and eliminates per-country visa caps. The bill makes it easier for graduates of U.S. universities with advanced STEM degrees to stay in the United States; improves access to green cards for workers in lower-wage sectors; and eliminates other unnecessary hurdles for employment-based green cards. The bill provides dependents of H-1B visa holders work authorization, and children are prevented from aging out of the system. The bill also creates a pilot program to stimulate regional economic development, gives DHS the authority to adjust green cards based on macroeconomic conditions.

In a public statement, Messick's family blamed the suicide on Weinstein, the media, Internet mobs, and McGowan's inaccurate accusations and insinuations:
Thinks about some of the things Christianity brought to western civilization he continued. In the twelfth century, marriage came to be counted as a sacrament by the Catholic Church. As a sacrament, it does not require a priest, only the agreement of the man and woman, which is the greatest protection ever given to women in a system of marriage: by the Church's argument, women cannot be married against their will, they and their bridegrooms must both say, I do.

And then there's all the monologues. Man alive. There are no characters here. Just symbols. Stevenson has no emotional inner-life. He's just a savior. His sponsor, Eva Ansley (Brie Larson), has no emotional inner-life. She's just a good, liberal white lady. Jamie Foxx does what he can, and is by far the best thing here. But like everyone else, he speaks in monologues, in Oscar-bait speeches. After a while, you're watching a self-parody.

This is a cultural horror, and as a new Lancet study reported by Business Insider noted, it's affecting American Indians and Alaska natives as well:
I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith, but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God. I just don't understand how you can be as worshipful of your own self as he is and be prepared to humble yourself before God. I've never seen him humble himself before anyone.
The Global Times described the proposed egg freezing program as a particular help for women who have undergone treatment for cancer, which often leads to infertility.

Yet now the Bezos brouhaha is back, courtesy of The Washington Post, the newspaper owned by Bezos, and also thanks to The New York Times, which takes a slightly less kindly view of Bezos.
Not to be snarky, but Melania can probably use a week's rest from Blabbermouth Don, wrote Stephen King in a tweet sent to his 4.8 million followers. Sounds heavenly to me.
The justices did not rule on broader First Amendment claims of free speech or the free exercise of religion, leaving those questions for another day. But the Court's 7-2 decision – while a narrow opinion – was still a major victory for the faith-based community, because the political left's argument was that no First Amendment religious-liberty rights follow a person in the marketplace when he or she opens a business to the public.
The New York Post's Page Six reported Tuesday that the final straw in Pitt and Jolie's marriage came when the actress and UN special envoy hired a private investigator to tail Pitt on the set of Allied because she suspected him of cheating with Cotillard. The report alleges Pitt was, in fact, cheating with the French actress, although multiple reports and sources have since said the claim is untrue.
Many Twitter users have been calling out the bigotry behind the hashtag – which self-proclaimed exvangelical writer Chris Stroop takes credit for creating:
To be sure, Khashoggi's death was a shocking crime. And in response, the Post had, understandably, taken a hard reportorial and editorial line against the Saudi government. So the implication of Bezos's article was that perhaps the Saudis had something to do with the original leak from Bezos's phone because they wanted to hit back at him for his newspaper's pursuit of the Khashoggi story.
Another piece of research at the time found the British people were extremely relaxed about the whole thing — 79 per cent said they were fine with a Royal marrying a foreigner, 78 per cent were cool with a divorcee, 69 per cent had no objection to different ethnicity.

8:39 PM: Biden says Sanders' revolution will disrupt a lot of things and he again goes after the cost for Medicare for all. He says people want results now and not a revolution. Sanders asks why America is the only major country that doesn't guarantee health care and doesn't provide paid sick leave. He says it all comes down to the power structure. He says donors who control the legislative agenda have the power. He says you need to take on Wall Street, the drug companies, and the insurance companies, and the fossil fuel industries. He says you don't take campaign contributions from them.

The biggest socialist experiment was the Soviet bloc, an orbit of countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and East Germany.

In Asia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and China experimented with socialism. In South America, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Venezuela tried it. Most of Africa went socialist in the aftermath of colonialism: Angola, Ghana, Tanzania, Benin, Mali, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

That should not be surprising. It demonstrates that the supply of college graduates has outpaced demand, which is exactly what you would expect would happen when ample subsidies and societal pressure are applied to increase college attendance. When, as Ms. Trump put it, all the money pushes you into a four-year college system.
Kardashian's first marriage at age 19 in 2000 to music producer Damon Thomas lasted until 2004, and in 2011, she married Humphries in a heavily hyped wedding that was televised in a two-part special on Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

The source also said Taliban officials are requesting money to pay for separate houses for each of their wives and substantial upkeep costs for them. High-ranking officials have developed a taste for holding elaborate weddings, which is not only a drain on the Taliban treasury but also brings bad publicity to an organization that presents itself to the public as a union of austere, heavily-armed religious scholars.
Pence made the trip to the security conference on behalf of President Trump. A senior White House policy adviser previewed the trip last week, promising an overarching message of reassurance.

Worse, this abundance has removed our sense of purpose. No longer are we needed to hunt and gather (as Melfi explains), or to protect our families, or to keep the wolf from the door. Desperate for a purpose, we now have the luxury to look inward, to work on ourselves. Melfi believes this is healthy. Through her eventual awakening and the jaw-dropping awfulness of the other therapists portrayed on the show, The Sopranos is here to tell us the opposite is true.

In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including honor killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Proving once again that he has no core, no solid set of established beliefs or principles that would enable him to communicate a consistency of thought, Bush made a public fool of himself with his glaring hypocrisy, and yet another example of the hopelessly muddled thinking that made him a non-starter as a 2016 presidential candidate.
So we have worked very hard to be a welcoming city because the current immigration policies are just wrong. People who are really important parts of our community are being torn apart from their families. And this is not making us safer. It is not making us stronger. Now, when it comes to ICE, I don't care what the agency in charge of our immigration and border enforcement is called. I care what it does. And as long as you have an agency, even if you get rid of ICE and called it something else, being ordered to tear families apart from one another or being ordered to make it harder to get on a path to citizenship, you're going to continue to have heartbreaking stories that are not helping anybody. Whether we're talking about the undocumented immigrants concerned or whether you're talking about the communities that they're a part of.
The president's likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired.

ROME — Pope Francis has singled out neo-liberal capitalism and deregulation of markets as causes of human trafficking despite data that suggest the opposite is true.
Robertson linked the 160,000 murders in America over the last 13 years to the Supreme Court's decisions — and the left assumed he is blaming those murders on gays. Here is how a writer at Salon put it:
The prosecution offered the program as an alternative restorative justice resolution designed to educate and promote community healing instead of a punishment. Cooper's therapist said the five sessions were a moving experience and her client learned a lot, Illuzzi-Orbon said.
Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby has kept mostly mum about expansion plans but has said there is an open mindedness about the idea. However, hinting that there is at least some contentiousness about it all, the Commish also noted, If it was a clear path, it wouldn't have taken so long.
These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies, he stated, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.
LGBT groups have viciously suggested that as a Christian organization, Samaritan's Purse volunteers will turn away gays and lesbians infected with the virus, leaving them on their own to find care elsewhere.
The ensuing materialistic vision of the human person sees the body as something secondary, not essential for the human person, he said. The 'mind,' as the autonomous human person, determines the purpose and significance of the body, hence also gender identity, without needing to take account of the biological sex of the body.
Last August, a former papal nuncio to the United States came to a similar conclusion, alleging that an extensive homosexual network among bishops and priests was the root cause of the sex abuse crisis as well as cover-ups by bishops.
In April, Glazov was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of abuse he received on the platform. In an article on his website, he posted screenshots of an exchange he had with another Facebook user named Muhammad Irfan Ayoub. Glazov claims that Ayoub began rebuking him for daring to bring attention to the persecution of women and girls under Sharia and telling Jamie to convert to Islam. In one exchange, Ayoub reportedly told the writer that Allah will defeat you, Glazov replied; Allah will defeat us? I thought Islam was a religion of peace? Ayoub replied; Peace for those who obey Allah and His Prophet. but those who oppose them their [there] is no peace for them.

In 2014, Grenell said on Fox that Congress should push for Ukraine to join NATO, a move that would infuriate Russia. He later praised Trump for threatening to walk away from NATO, calling it a smart negotiating tactic. I think this is about NATO reform, I don't think this is about getting rid of a NATO alliance, Grenell said on Fox last year. I think this is businessman Donald Trump showing that he knows how to reform.

In other words, in the Bezos/de Becker telling, the whole messy saga was more than just what it seemed to be at first—that is, a sorry tale of infidelity, indiscretion, and perhaps intra-family treachery. Instead, maybe it was more of a spy-thriller epic: an international conspiracy, reaching from the Saudi capital of Riyadh, to the Enquirer's offices in Manhattan, to the president in the White House.

Marion has also railed against feminists in the French National Assembly over abortion and the shutting down of pro-life websites. She then slammed left wing feminists for supporting the hijab calling it an Islamic submission tool.
We have gotten a nasty preview of it during the Coronavirus epidemic. We've experienced empty shelves, food shortages, limits on what you can buy, and also the attack on civil liberties, on freedom of assembly, on religious liberty, on privacy. So we've endured on a temporary basis what, under socialism, we are likely to endure on a permanent basis.
Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field, said ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb in a statement. Forcing them to compete against boys isn't fair, shatters their dreams, and destroys their athletic opportunities.
If the Equality Act were to become federal law and public school curricula become further entwined with sexual orientation and gender identity ideology, Planned Parenthood is well-positioned to further its presence in public schools and take advantage of an additional avenue to promote both sexual orientation and gender identity ideology as well as the organization's hormone treatment services. In other words, additional sexual orientation and gender identity curricula could become yet another marketing tool for America's abortion giant.
One week out from the Obama administration's end, a deep sense of nostalgia set in at the White House as longtime staffers pack up their offices, send out their last emails and bid farewell to the president they've served. On Tuesday, Obama returned home to Chicago to deliver his valedictory address, and next week he'll depart Washington as ex-president just after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in.

In September of 1997, the world lost two of its most famous women – Diana, the former Princess of Wales, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta.
This depraved attack reveals the low worth of Christian girls in the mindset that has evolved amongst most Muslim men in Pakistan. Through a biased national curriculum and rogue Imams preaching a special place in heaven for those who rape and convert Christian girls, most of them deem minority women as war-booty. Seeing young Asma in such pain is heart-wrenching for all of us in the West, but the authorities of Pakistan just seem to accept this as the culture of Pakistan. It is this warped belief that has to be reconstructed before we can start to fashion a new more egalitarian nation, however the desire will have to be one driven by the country's Government—sadly I have never experienced a more selfish bunch of politicians.
I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in Sage [the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]. I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The Government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.
Glazov commented to Breitbart News, saying: First I was banned for reporting a member of the Religion of Peace threatening me. Now I am banned, on 9/11 mind you, for daring to give suggestions on how we can stop another 9/11. It is against Facebook's 'community standards' to try to stop Jihadist attacks on Americans. This is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.
Our endorsement is not animated by hostility to either Donald Trump or Governor Kasich, both of whom are running well ahead of Mr. Cruz in the polls in New York. All three are better on key issues than either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders. We like Mr. Trump's willingness to re-think the United Nations. We're not against better trade deals. We are against a retreat from NATO, and Mr. Trump has been too xenophobic in his use of language in respect of religion and the immigration issue. Mr. Cruz, a former solicitor general of the border state of Texas, has been more sage.

However, with Australia in the middle of a vigorous two-month debate over the legalisation of same-sex marriage, opponents want Same Love censored or dropped altogether.
How are you signaling in your classroom that you are not upholding white supremacy when you are teaching the subject loved by white supremacists? Kim wrote. Neutrality may have worked in a distant past when white supremacists/KKK/white nationalists/Nazis were some imagined fringe group, but that is not going to work now.

Saturday, as President Tusk said, I was pleased to address the Munich Security Council to speak about the importance of the strategic alliance [inaudible] … entered the bond so many years ago in the North American Treaty Organization. But the president did ask me to come here, to Brussels, to the home of the European Union, and deliver an additional message, so today it is my privilege on behalf of President Trump to express the strong commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union. Whatever our differences, our two continents share the same marriage, the same values, and above all, the same purpose — to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. And to those objectives, we will remain committed. This has been European Union's goal since before its formal founding in 1993. What began as a modest Western European trade agreement in 1951, freedom of movement, has grown into a commitment to the four freedoms — the freedom of movement, goods, capital, services and people, the common currency, and common approach to foreign and security policy.

Promises to deport offenders and, after removing their British citizenship, dual national offenders, have gone unfulfilled, with some victims finding they are now running into their abusers in public again.
The relevant hadith is this: The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death) (Bukhari 7.62.88)
I applaud Congressman David Cicilline [D-RI] and the entire Congressional Equality Caucus for introducing the Equality Act in the House of Representatives yesterday, and I urge Congress to swiftly pass this historic legislation. Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, and this bill represents a critical step toward ensuring that America lives up to our foundational values of equality and freedom for all. Full equality has been denied to LGBTQ+ Americans and their families for far too long. Despite the extraordinary progress the LGBTQ+ community has made to secure their basic civil rights, discrimination is still rampant in many areas of our society. The Equality Act provides long overdue federal civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, locking in critical safeguards in our housing, education, public services, and lending systems — and codifying the courage and resilience of the LGBTQ+ movement into enduring law.
Senior Biden aide on tonight's debate: Joe Biden will make it clear to Senator Sanders' supporters that there's space for them…we welcome your support, but we're also going to welcome their ideas, their passion and their commitment to the issues they care so deeply about. https://t.co/T65LylQtMe — Johnny Verhovek (@JTHVerhovek) March 15, 2020
LREM MP Marlène Schiappa, who serves as Secretary of Equality, made her comments earlier this week, comparing the Manif Pour Tous movement, which protested against same-sex marriage, to Islamic radicals.
But certainly we've faced far more dire economic circumstances in the past, without such an increase in mortality. The White Death isn't about people starving. On the contrary, according to the researchers quoted by NPR, rampant obesity is a significant factor.
Born to a music teacher and a housewife, she had dreamed of a dance career, but at age 12, she suffered a crippling accident: a car she was in was hit by a train and her leg was badly broken. Listening to the radio while recuperating, she began singing along with Ella Fitzgerald, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words.
However, the Muslim women Professor Aslan surveyed appeared no less prone to extremism than their male counterparts, with 62 per cent saying they attached great importance to wearing the Islamic headscarf in public, and 44.3 per cent saying they would refuse to shake hands with a man.
According to the Hill, she had originally been charged with filing a false police report, but — get this — the charge was dismissed after she finished an educational program that focused on racial biases.
As Junior, Dominic Chianese is a wonder to behold. How many actors could wring fear, anger, bitterness, and overall pathos out of Your sister's cunt.
The Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid star wrote in an op-ed article for Time magazine that impeaching President Trump and admitting refugees won't matter due to climate change.
[Relationships and Sex Education] must be balanced, objective and critical, not pushing particular controversial views such as transgender ideology, he added.
Ma.Victoria (Mavic) Cabrera Balleza, Chief Executive Officer, Global Network of Women Peacebuilders, said the session should not be cancelled because of the outbreak of coronavirus disease — but its methodology should be modified.
Ma now seems to be picking up the work the Communist Party began three years ago to maintain a stable national population. China imposed a two-child policy in 2016, expecting a massive population boom from parents longing to expand their families. Instead, the annual birth rate fell from 17.9 million children in 2016 to 17.2 million in 2017. Some estimates project that the birth rate could drop to as few as 16 million by next year. Communist Party central planners expected the birth rate to rise to 20 million by 2017.
Al-Sheikh is no stranger to controversy. In December 2014, he announced there is nothing wrong with girls under the age of 15 getting married. Human rights activists hoped the country would set the minimum marriage age at 15.
The piece also stoops to an ad hominem attack on Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple last year, citing her religious beliefs that compelled her not to cooperate in sanctioning such a relationship.
So far there are no laws against so-called hate speech in Ireland, despite rising pressure from NGOs including the Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties) — another Soros-backed outfit — which recently celebrated Irish plans to ditch its blasphemy laws as a victory for free speech but also demanded the country urgently bring in laws against hate speech.

Polygamy is not a random crime. It's a problem of ego and ignorance, men who have been stripped of their land needing women to treat as property, she said.
I don't trust Franklin Graham to help those in need in the LGBTQ community. I've seen far too many anti-LGBTQ activists like Graham ignore the suffering of LGBTQ people. In this instance, Graham is capitalizing upon a crisis to inflict more pain and suffering on an already marginalized population. He has stated, loudly and proudly, too many times that the LGBTQ community is a threat for me to want to place my life, or the lives of people l love and care about, in his hands.
Gender theory, which has its origin in radical feminism, also promotes the legality of procured abortion – employing the euphemistic terms of sexual and reproductive rights – to prevent a woman who has become unintentionally pregnant from being compelled to assume the role of a mother, viewed as a role imposed on women in the past in Western society and still today in many countries in the world, he said.
But experts on medical ethics, commenting on the proposal, said procedures to modify girls' genitals could not be compared to male circumcision because they are designed to control women and curb their sexual desire.

Because of Puerto Rico's ambiguous political status vis-à-vis the United States, a federal judge in Puerto Rico ruled Tuesday that the Supreme Court's decision to impose gay marriage doesn't apply on the island, which is a commonwealth with a unique constitutional status.
• Finally, Cruz praised Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, saying he was almost embarrassed it took so long.
Trump's supposedly loyal kids give him worse advice than the ex-president whom Trump tormented during his presidency.
The gay lobby wants Graham's money but they do not want the Christian worldview that inspires people to give money to his organization or to volunteer their time to serve others. Accountable for Equality and other LGBT advocacy groups have expressed their revulsion at the idea that a Christian charitable organization should openly appeal for Christian volunteers as Franklin Graham does.
Cortez Masto, 52, won the Democratic primary by a landslide 81 percent of the vote in May.

On the other hand, the piece establishes the Islamic credentials of the coverings, with one woman robotically reciting: I am wearing it for God… it's an act of worship. I love doing it.
There is simply no credible case to be made that Megan Markle's departure from Britain has anything to do with 'racism.' On the contrary, both the Royal Family and the British public have been at pains to make this brash newcomer welcome, despite her weapons-grade sense of entitlement and her apparent unwillingness to do more than the barest minimum to fit in either with Royal protocol or the duties that come with the privilege of her newly acquired wealth and her rank by marriage.
Two Indonesian Christians were publicly caned last week after violating the country's increasing adoption of Sharia Law.
Lord Green says the main thing that needs to be controlled is work permits. If EU migrants were subjected to the same requirements as non-EU citizens it could sharply reduce immigration without damaging the economy.
Xinhua did not discuss the ongoing coronavirus crisis in the nation's northeast. In March, Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the origin city of the Chinese coronavirus, and declared that the outbreak has basically been curbed in China. On Monday, speaking at the World Health Assembly, Xi told the world, in China, after making painstaking efforts and enormous sacrifice, we have turned the tide on the virus and protected the life and health of our people.
• In fact, Cruz noted the role Gorsuch played in the recent 7-2 decision in favor of a baker who had been punished for his refusal to violate his religious beliefs by baking a wedding cake that celebrated same-sex marriage.

She then became pregnant sometime later that year and travelled back to Sweden where she gave birth to twins in Gothenburg. In 2009, Alicia travelled back to Iraq where she asked for a divorce, which was supported by her father if she gave up her rights to her children under Iraqi law.
I am so proud of @elliotpage. Trans, queer and non-binary people are a gift to this world, she posted on social media.

For many years, Thabet worked with the United Nations and other non-government international agencies to help boys as young as nine years old regain their lives and rejoin their family and larger community. She also helped young girls who married terrorists in a country with high poverty and no laws banning child marriage.
In fact, Camosy decided in February 2016 that Catholics could, in good conscience, vote for pro-abortion and pro-same-sex marriage Bernie Sanders, since attending to the needs of the poor – which, he argued, Sanders achieved better than the GOP candidates at the time – is, ultimately, the central teaching of the Church and trumps the protection of life in the womb.
Four different cities in India alternate hosting duties for Kumbh Mela. This year, beginning Thursday [January 14], Haridwar is the host, and several million people were expected to throng the holy city in Uttarakhand over the coming seven weeks, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported Wednesday.

Harkness continued, a lot of these injustices are actually occurring in Muslim countries and they don't want to being attention to it. One of the founders of the women's march is Muslim. Why aren't we hearing from her on International Women's day about this issue?
In an AxiosOnHBO interview with Jonathan Swan, Perez rebuked Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who commented on Perez's stance: It saddens me and weakens the democracy millions of Americans cherish when the party that once embraced Catholics now slams the door on us.
The ST cited reports that the couple has visited a fertility clinic in Germany because Sultan Muhammad's first marriage was childless and he is desperate to start a family. Muhammad seemed quite healthy and vigorous otherwise, with a penchant for extreme sports such as off-road driving, horse riding, football, and endurance challenges.
After years of denial, it is now widely known that the opening of the U.S. market to Chinese imports was devastating, inflicting deep and lasting damage to many areas in the U.S. Regions most exposed to competition from China not only lost manufacturing jobs, they saw overall employment decline and never recovered. Areas with higher exposure have also been shown to have more people relying on food stamps and disability payments, more people addicted to opioids, lower rates of marriage, higher rates of political polarization, and higher rates of incarceration.

Fellow commuters in their panic prised open the train doors and climbed down onto the track to escape the man, forcing the rail operator to turn off power to the area to prevent anyone being electrocuted. The power isolation ultimately delayed hundreds of thousands of commuters, according to reports.
The door has really opened now for all kinds of individuals to start their own family. Same-sex adoptions are at a record high, and it may be that the legalisation of gay marriage in 2013 has been a catalyst for more same sex couples to adopt, declared Wilsons associate lawyer Sarah Wood-Heath, who added that medical breakthroughs could be the reason for a decline in adoption applications from heterosexuals.
In the Monday press conference, President Tusk emphasized a particular portion of his meeting with Vice President Pence, saying, I asked the vice president directly if he shared my opinions on three key matters: the international order, security, and the attitude of the new American administration towards the European Union.

After such a positive declaration, both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach.

In a November op-ed at the Washington Examiner, Vernon Robinson III and Bruce Eberle recalled that, in 1936, the new Gallup Poll found Democrat President Franklin D. Roosevelt received 76 percent of the black vote – just four years after he received only 21 percent from black Americans in Chicago.
During this era, India was widely known as the begging bowl of the world. Americans told their children, Eat your food because there are millions of starving people in India. Gandhi spoke wistfully about wiping a tear of every Indian face. A whole generation of young Indians in the 1960s and 1970s saw no future for themselves and fled to sea, like my brother, or to Dubai to do manual labor, like some of my cousins, or to Australia, Canada and America, like me.

Tony Soprano: You said you wanted to be a lawyer for black people. Meadow Soprano: Oh, that's all I said? Really? What I said was The state can crush the individual. Tony Soprano: New Jersey? Meadow Soprano: The government. Specifically, the federal government. Tony Soprano: And what about little babies? They face, uh, meningitis. Meadow Soprano: You know what really turned me? Seeing the way Italians are treated. It's like Mom says. And if we can have our rights trampled like that, imagine what it's like for recent arrivals. Tony Soprano: Well… Meadow Soprano: If I hadn't seen you dragged away all those times by the FBI, then I'd probably be a boring suburban doctor.
But many Bedouins say they have yet to see benefits, and claim promises of development only provide cover for efforts to uproot communities from their ancestral lands. For years, Israel has tried to resettle the Bedouins into recognized villages or custom-built cities.
Egyptian men also supplied 90 percent agreement with the statement that a man should have the final word about decisions in the home, and 58.5 percent of Egyptian women agreed. Only 31 percent of Egyptian men thought married women have the same rights to work outside their homes as men. 93 percent of men thought a husband should know where his wife is at all times. 96 percent thought a wife should agree to sex whenever her husband desires it.
He said today America's economic debate is based on a valueless financial self-interest and a view of Americans as simply consumers. He warned there are immense consequences to this view.
What people forget is that he did grow up under very difficult circumstances. He went to Eureka College [in Illinois], played football, and almost instantly became a big radio star in the Midwest. He worked for WHO, the big radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, and he recreated the Chicago Cubs baseball games. He got a great interest in horseback riding. So he was a glamorous figure by those standards. And then he went to the West Coast to cover the Cubs in spring training, and somebody said to him, 'You ought to take a crack at Hollywood.' And he became a contract player for Universal Pictures. This was all before he was 30. So he had a rocket ride to some considerable success at that time. That would have been in those moments that would have been the American dream fulfilled.
The disturbing footage opens with a man crouched over a woman lying in the street.
We're all surrounded by fake news. And a lot of people are persuaded, in good faith, that what they're being told is true, when in fact it's totally false. Because they read it on the internet, he told the town hall meeting.
One clip, the longest running music video on official Palestinian Authority television, encouraged Palestinian men to seek death as martyrs in violent actions against Israel.

On the other hand, they don't care to defend themselves directly with reason and fact, often they can't do that. So instead, they denounce you, your critics, their critics, as white supremacists. And then they just ignore what you say. Fine. We've dealt with this for years, we're used to it. It no longer hurts our feelings, we understand what's going on.
For certain refugees anti-Semitism is a matter of course, which has given the refugee movement a new dimension, Professor Aslan observed.
This was the most important moment in the series. From here, there was no going back. Until now, we could rationalize our sympathy for Tony. Through four episodes, he had not yet killed or even ordered a killing. In fact, he was the one calling for calm, for order, a charismatic knockaround guy guilty of nothing more than giving consenting adults access to vices criminalized by the government.
The likely reason why Republicans have declined in popularity among the non-religious is GOP's long habit of identifying itself as a Christian party, he states. The later attempt to add in a Judeo- prefix has done little to stop the bleeding.
Team Israel head coach Eric Holtz, himself an American Jew who plans to apply for citizenship, said he is aiming to double the number of local players in Israel within two years of the Olympics. He said his primary mission was to instill our love and passion to the five and six-year-old kids throughout this country and show them what a great game this is.

DURBIN: I guess the reason I'm raising this is this is a man who apparently had an impact on your life, certainly your academic life. And I'm trying to figure out where we can parse his views from your views; what impact he had on you as a student; what impact he has on you today with his views. GORSUCH: Well, then I guess, Senator, I think the best evidence is what I've written. I've written over — gosh, written or joined over 6 million words as a federal appellate judge. I've written a couple of books. I've been a lawyer and a judge for 25 or 30 years. That's my record. And I guess I'd ask you respectfully to look at my credentials and my record. And some of the examples I've given you from my record about the capital habeas work, about access to justice. I've spoken about over-criminalization publicly.
In Dubai, huge crowds came to admire the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Authorities hosted a record-breaking LED light show rather than fireworks. The show broke a Guinness World Record for the largest ever laser light and sound show on a single structure.

The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and granted a temporary injunction blocking the City's actions.

Despite the arguments thrown at her, Hostin stuck to her guns, insisting that Christians shouldn't enter marriage thinking there is an escape hatch.
We should pray for presidents, critique them when they're wrong, praise them when they're right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can't ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness. In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency.

Trump ordered tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and ten percent on aluminum imports as a measure to save U.S. production of the metals. Trump made the move under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 after extensive Department of Commerce research into the issue. The tariffs are being imposed on the basis of economic and national security.
For two seasons we've been laughing at Little Carmine, his weakness, his vanity, his hilarious malapropisms. And then, in this wonderfully surprising and touching scene (starts at 1:35), we discover the dimwit is the wisest character of them all, Tony's Happy Wanderer, the one who figured out that the bullshit is bullshit and the only thing that matters in life, the only thing that fulfills, is family, is in the honoring of those seemingly humdrum rituals shared with the woman you love.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported on the developing story, which included one judge who claimed his decision had nothing to do with partisan politics. Reporter Bob Egelko wrote:
Jones and Batchelder have served as the deeply admired twin conservative matriarchs on the federal bench for more than a quarter century. Several other judges have worn the mantle of unflinching originalists, like Diarmuid O'Scannlain on the Ninth Circuit and David Sentelle on the D.C. Circuit, but with their elegant and maternal demeanors, Jones and Batchelder have stood out as doyennes of the federal bench in a dignified manner reminiscent of the United Kingdom's Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher.
In his 27-page dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts lamented the Court's usurpation of democratic process by legislating its own view of marriage. Under the Constitution, he noted, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. The majority decision, he declared, is indefensible as a matter of constitutional law.
Fox cited other critics of the site and its biased handling of left-wing ideologies. Sanger previously published a blog post criticizing Wikipedia for its left-wing bias, declaring the site's neutrality policy dead due to bias.

Mr. Camosy claims to share SBA List's view that abortion is the taking of an innocent human life, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group's president, said in a statement. Yet, not only does he criticize those who are singularly focused upon restoring the first right, the right to live, he fails to pursue strategies in his party to correct the injustice of abortion. Then he exploits the abortion issue, the intentional taking of a human life by using it as a sub-argument in support of all other issues he believes to impugn human dignity.

Throughout the April 19 Australian press conference, the journalists and politicians tacitly recognized the problems created by the immigration of Islamic adherents who bring their peculiar institutions and values which endorse domestic violence against women, child marriage, 'Female Genital Mutilation,' and reject the authority of what Australians describe as secular law. For example, one reporter cited several of Islam's peculiar practices before asking Prime Minister, I'm not clear why practices such as female genital mutilation, forcing children to marry and what have you, how they're being or could be included in values questions when they're already illegal under Australian law. What's the need for a values question when it's illegal under Australians law, Australian law? that these values [in the test] aren't really enforceable outside of the law. If someone passes a test and says, Tick, yes I don't beat my wife. Tick, I know who [cricket player]
Experts argue that the most efficient way to reduce the wage gap would be to encourage employers to put less emphasis on asking their employees to work long hours and to allow them to work remotely. Progressive economists, like Kerr, also argue that government-subsidized childcare could lift women out of the self-reinforcing cycle of the wage gap.

Africans largely regard homosexuality as a deviation from their cultural, traditional and religious inclinations, Pulse noted.
When Congress wrote only through the enactment of a state law can unlawfully present aliens receive benefits, that is precisely what it meant. This means the exercise of state legislative power. … The Regents argue this is not what Congress really meant, but rather it meant any exercise of state lawmaking power, be it legislative, executive, judicial, or by independent board. Those arguments are unavailing. Congress' unique word choices and other evidence of Congressional intent behind [the federal law] prove that the statute is limited to representative or democratic state legislative acts only. UC Regents officials think they can rewrite the law according to their personal whims and provide illegal aliens in-state tuition benefits contrary to law. Public officials on the UC Board of Regents need to put aside politics and obey both federal law and the California Constitution. They have no right to play politics at taxpayers' expense.

My own view is that the only Democrat who will beat Trump next year will campaign for control of immigration, legal and undocumented, in a sane and humane way. The issue will be dominant again — because of a huge wave of migrants, many of them rural Guatemalans, who are overwhelming the border, trying to enter the U.S. at a current pace of 100,000 a month. Their ability to claim asylum under current law permits them to show up at the border, get admitted and processed by the Border Patrol, and then released into the interior, to reside here until a court date, which could come up years later. The backlog in the underfunded immigration courts is vast, with more than a million still in line for a hearing. Many of the migrants won't show up for the court date; those who do can still resist deportation indefinitely. What this means is that the U.S. now has an effectively open border with Mexico, and, according to the American Bar Association, the immigration system is irredeemably dysfunctional and on the brink of collapse. Repeating the Democratic mantra that there is no border crisis will not work for much longer. This year will see more undocumented immigrants than in any year under Obama. And the high rate of success among those trying to enter to the country now encourages more migrants to make the journey, especially given the forces of disorder and climate change that are forcing people to flee.

It is our unanimous desire to walk together. However given the seriousness of these matters we formally acknowledge this distance by requiring that for a period of three years The Episcopal Church no longer represent us on ecumenical and interfaith bodies, should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and that while participating in the internal bodies of the Anglican Communion, they will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or polity.

Shupe took estrogen when he identified as a transgender female, but stopped short of having sex-change surgeries.
So we have worked very hard to be a welcoming city because the current immigration policies are just wrong. People who are really important parts of our community are being torn apart from their families. And this is not making us safer. It is not making us stronger. Now, when it comes to ICE, I don't care what the agency in charge of our immigration and border enforcement is called. I care what it does. And as long as you have an agency, even if you get rid of ICE and called it something else, being ordered to tear families apart from one another or being ordered to make it harder to get on a path to citizenship, you're going to continue to have heartbreaking stories that are not helping anybody. Whether we're talking about the undocumented immigrants concerned or whether you're talking about the communities that they're a part of.

[The Medicaid card] pays for medicine—whatever pills a doctor deems that the insured patient needs. Among those who receive Medicaid cards are people on state welfare or on a federal disability program known as SSI. . . . If you could get a prescription from a willing doctor—and Portsmouth had plenty of them—Medicaid health-insurance cards paid for that prescription every month. For a three-dollar Medicaid co-pay, therefore, addicts got pills priced at thousands of dollars, with the difference paid for by U.S. and state taxpayers. A user could turn around and sell those pills, obtained for that three-dollar co-pay, for as much as ten thousand dollars on the street.
The 28-year-old woman, Swetha Haridas, filed a report with police on Monday recounting torture and abuse at the hands of Yoga and Charitable Trust in Kochi, a center run by the woman's brother-in-law Manoj Guruji, where she said she was held against her will until she managed to escape in late August.

While Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran's tactics may be novel, Indonesian Muslim groups' war on Valentine's Day has become an annual tradition. In 2013, for example, Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim group, urged a limit on teenagers exchanging gifts on Valentine's Day, arguing that doing so results in teens joining special Valentine's Day sex parties, which they alleged are a common occurrence in Western countries.

The ideology's claim that the state must enforce a new right to gender identity also means that the state must ignore and often dismantle many civic rules that evolved to help the two distinct sexes — men and boys, women and girls — meet their legally equal, but different and complementary, needs. For example, the transgender ideological demand means that single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms must opened up to people of the opposite sex, regardless of age, and without any verification of created gender identity.
I'm a practicing Catholic, Biden states in his vision for Catholic Americans, and adds, I believe faith is a gift. And the first obligation we all have is, 'Love your God,' the second one is, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' … 'Treat people with dignity.'

The left has tried for years to silence Robertson. They hate the idea that one of their own network — A&E — has given him a platform. They were able to silence the Benham Brothers, who to this day refuse to back down on their beliefs about homosexuality and marriage. But the left has not been able to silence Robertson and his popular show Duck Dynasty. Even though Duck Dynasty is down in viewers, from a high of more than 11 million a few years ago to roughly 3 million now, the show is still the tenth highest rated on cable.

Breitbart died in 2012 and Steve Bannon, later a top adviser to Donald Trump, took over Breitbart's eponymous website, for which Bean had penned occasional columns.
This idea of fluid gender is in contrast to science-backed view that men and women are born into unchangeably male or female bodies, and that society should help boys and girls, men and women, get the best from their bodies by allowing them sexual privacy and sex-specific facilities and sport leagues. This view also argues that people should create civic rules to help cooperation between the two complementary but different, equal and unchangeable sexes. The most important cooperation, for example, is civic support for marriage and childrearing.

Prince Harry is — was — really popular with the British people. And little wonder. He was the handsome attack-helicopter pilot who served on the front line with the infantry in Afghanistan prone to occasional silly decisions (extremely questionable fancy dress choices and turning up naked at a pool party, for instance). He was the man who tragically lost his mother at a young age in the public eye and has devoted much of his adult life to charity work.

Chinese authorities removed Korean entertainers from most available programming in the country in 2016, including with unsophisticated measures like blurring the Korean nationals out of Chinese programs. The move failed to end the popularity of the genre and the currently most successful band in the industry, BTS, remains extremely beloved by Chinese youth. The Communist Party, through outlets like the Global Times, have attempted to smear BTS, largely on the back of statements by a band member thanking the United States military for its support during the Korean War, but the campaign has failed.

Men like Archbishop McCarrick and Weinstein think they are entitled to sex. And they both have (or used to have) enough power to take whatever they wanted. The fact that Archbishop McCarrick's preferred sex partners are male and Weinstein's are female should not distract us from this most basic point. Both men live by the Sexual Revolutionary Creed: Sex is a private recreational activity with no moral or social consequences. Everyone is entitled to the sex lives they want, with a minimum of inconvenience. Any sexual activity is morally acceptable, as long as the participants consent. Believing all this is called being sex positive.
Some netizens supported the celebrities' choice, saying that raising children should not be automatically tied to marriage, the Times noted, referring to online users of Chinese social media.

[Alain] Malcolm was tall and handsome. The oldest son of Jamaican immigrants, he wholly subscribed to the idea of the American dream. In high school, Malcolm was vice president of the Future Business Leaders of America club, assistant captain of the tennis and swim teams and a member of the student council and Model United Nations. He started a social marketing business at 15. After graduating in 2016, Malcolm filled his Instagram and Facebook feeds with photos of New York high-rises, bathroom selfies in three-piece suits and links to news articles in which he was featured. He went to community college while working as a junior buyer for a local circuit-board manufacturer and was the subject of a Connecticut Public Television series that profiled recent high school graduates. Earlier this year, he was named one of Litchfield County's 40 Leaders Under 40. Malcolm was also gay, which was difficult growing up in a religious family in Torrington, a sleepy former mill town in the northwest part of the state, friends said. It's not easy to be black, Jamaican, a Jehovah's Witness and gay in Torrington, Connecticut, said Allie Morrissey, a friend of Malcolm's. Starting in high school, Malcolm used apps like Tinder and Grindr to meet men from around the state, friends said. On that October night, he had come to Bristol to meet someone younger, purportedly a 14-year-old boy going on 15, according to a video posted by the digital vigilante group known as POPSquad.

Concluding his piece, Baltz states his efforts only marginally improved the coverage of women on political science topics and increased citations of women even less. He argues more effort is necessary and calls for organized action to expand coverage of women on political topics as well as increase citations of women, noting feminist activist campaigns to increase coverage of women on other topics. While many progressive critics of Wikipedia push for more efforts favoring women citing an alleged gender gap on the site, a study released last year found these campaigns have over-corrected in some areas and tilted content disproportionately towards women.
But the point is, what [the current written test] doesn't go to or doesn't go to sufficiently are those questions of values and at the heart, at the very heart of our success is mutual respect; respect for each other, respect for people of different faiths and different cultures and respect of women and children. That is, you know as I've, you've often heard me say this. You know, not all disrespecting women, disrespecting women ends up in violence against women but that's where all violence against women begins. So this is a very important, very important Australian values; respect, mutual respect, respect for women and children and that is going to be, that is a key Australian value, who would argue with that? Is it reflected in our current process? No it's not, it should be.
This development is explained by the fact that more and more women are migrating alone, to study or to work. In 2015, they accounted for 50 per cent of foreigners residing in France said Jean-Luc Richard, sociology and demography lecturer at the University of Rennes.

In general, the transgender ideology says a person's sex is determined by their gender identity, not their biology. The ideology also insists that men and women are more or less identical, and it objects to the public's view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal. The transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing transgender rights laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that women and girls are different — and have different priorities — than men and boys.

What's more, Trump did not base his presidential campaign on championing his libertine past, on bragging about his adultery, on reveling in his sin. And from his glass house, Trump has never judged anyone else's Christianity, never sought to normalize his sinful behavior as Christian behavior, never blamed God for his sin.

Policy ideas such as instituting a government-run, single-payer health-care system were once promoted only by the most liberal voters. They are now widely supported within the party – with the professional class emerging as the most enthusiastic … The professional class is also the most comfortable with same-sex marriage, changing gender roles and other recent social changes.

Durbin's diversity claim is a form of Marxism, of fascist corporatism, of imperial rule — this is how the Ottomans ran their empire, Fonte said. This 'divide and conquer' is how the British Empire worked – you put different tribes [identities] against each other.
Although your parents are the closest of people to you, you do not want to jeopardise your hijrah by telling them where you are going, he explains.

Those who dedicate their lives to challenging the justice system — who tirelessly fight to ensure that the State is not imprisoning or executing the innocent — are heroes in my book. While I'm in favor of capital punishment, I'm also in favor of an appeals system that makes damn sure there are no mistakes. You don't hear me running around wondering why we're not executing people faster. No, sir. I have zero faith in our government, especially the majority of mercenary losers who populate it. And if we're going to give the government the power to take away someone's rights, all of their personal freedom and sometimes their lives, that system needs to be relentlessly challenged.

In March 2015, the Superior Court ruled that the UC Board of Regents policies themselves (and not the state statutes) are the state laws that affirmatively provide the benefits to UC students in satisfaction of federal law and dismissed the lawsuit. In November 2015, Judicial Watch filed its opening appellate brief with the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, arguing that the trial court wrongly read extra words into Congress' statute. Specifically, the brief argues that the federal statute in question does not say 'state law or administrative rule, regulation or policy.' It says 'State law.' This means an enactment of the state legislature.
Students of poverty often point to the general increase in our material standard of living, coupled with generous welfare assistance, to note that poverty in the 21st Century is often objectively better than middle-class life 75 or 100 years ago. And yet, we have a generation killing itself—often actively killing itself, given the rise in suicide rates. That didn't happen in far more hardscrabble times, although it would be fair to note that lower average life expectancies and more primitive data-gathering methods would have made a mortality spike more difficult to detect, if one did occur.
Deal said his decision was about the character of our state and the character of our people. Georgia is a welcoming state. It is full of loving, kind and generous people.

First, if either spouse is a member of the Armed Forces at any time during the tax year, only one of them is required to have a valid Social Security number, the IRS says. Second, taxpayers who are citizens and file separately from their immigrant spouses who lack a Social Security number will receive half of the payment for married couples, or $1,200, according to the IRS. That second exception could give some couples a chance to file their taxes separately, given that the 2019 filing deadline has been pushed back to July 15. However, many taxpayers have already filed their returns for 2019.

The change came in the late 1970s, when the Chinese, under Deng Xiaopping, abandoned the socialism of Mao for its own brand of capitalism. In doing so the Chinese inaugurated a new experiment in social organization. Call it totalitarian capitalism. The Chinese did not relinquish their Communist dictatorship; rather, they married dictatorial political control to free market liberalization. Some say it was an awkward marriage, yet in economic terms, it worked.

In the case of socialism, however, we have two perfect test cases: North and South Korea, and East and West Germany. The perfection of these examples comes from the fact that we are dealing with the same people, same background, same culture, merely two rival economic systems. North Korea is socialist; South Korea capitalist. East Germany was socialist; West Germany capitalist.

Clarke said while speaking on a panel titled Breaking Bad: What it Takes to Rise Above Circumstances, at the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) on Friday:
So why did Jussie Smollett think he could get away with what appears to be a shameless hate crime hoax? Maybe because thanks in part to the SPLC seeing hate under every rock, there is a huge upside to being seen as the victim in 2019 America. When the alleged attackers check the right boxes—in this case white, male Trump supporters—there is no shortage of media talking heads willing to believe it. Only because Smollett's apparent hoax was so implausible did it cause even those wishing it to be true to balk.
Lisa, a Jewish mother, organized a march in Syracuse for her daughters' protection.
After decades of imposing a brutal one-child policy where the communist regime routinely forced women to kill illegal fetuses and still blacklists children born without the blessing of the state, Beijing has found a lack of appetite among Chinese couples for becoming parents.

If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.
In 2005, at age 79, she appeared in a new comedy, Leading Ladies, at Ford's Theater in Washington.
Obama said there had been no turf wars between our staffs, a departure from other recent administrations.

The oddest thing about that tweet was the graphic she used, which just said 'MLK Day.' Timely…and factual, Stephen Colbert continued. And I'm being told we have a preview of the first lady's tweet for tomorrow: Together we honor — Tuesday, January 21.' Again, so truthful.

Like the Ridgemans, I'm a white person who was once forced by economic circumstance to live, work, and go to school for more than two years in a mostly black ghetto. I promise you there is no shortage of black people who will warn a white person against such a thing. You see, it simply doesn't matter that 99.99 percent of your neighbors are good people. All it takes is one bully to single you out for your skin color.
For Christians, who've lived under the anti-faith cloud of Obama, it's encouraging to see Secretary Perdue move so quickly to communicate that the USDA is under new management, FRC explains, noting the case of Don Vander Boon, a Christian and private owner of the West Michigan Beef Company, who was threatened two years ago with a shut-down of his business by USDA inspectors because his break room contained an article promoting traditional marriage mixed in with others about the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage decision (see video below).

This is what voters will be thinking about when assessing candidates from both parties.
Over the last century in the Church there has been a great blossoming of studies that seek to understand exactly what Jesus meant to say… That is not relativism, but attests that the word is relative, the Gospel is written by human beings, it is accepted by the Church which is made up of human persons… So it is true that no one can change the word of Jesus, but one must know what it was!
One thing I'm not is humble anymore. I'm sick of being humble. I really am, Zeta-Jones said in an interview with British the newspaper The Daily Mirror. So sorry I'm rich, so sorry I'm married to a movie star, so sorry I'm not so bad looking.

Carlos Lucero, a 1995 Clinton appointee to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, and author of a ruling striking down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage in 2014, a year before the Supreme Court issued a similar ruling nationwide, is also on the list.

In his scathing rebuke of the ruling, Scalia said that the majority had reached an opinion lacking even a thin veneer of law.
If the Equality Act were to become federal law and public school curricula become further entwined with sexual orientation and gender identity ideology, Planned Parenthood is well-positioned to further its presence in public schools and take advantage of an additional avenue to promote both sexual orientation and gender identity ideology as well as the organization's hormone treatment services. In other words, additional sexual orientation and gender identity curricula could become yet another marketing tool for America's abortion giant.
Then Politico reaches all the way back to 2008 to find another disgruntled landlord, who is offered 12 paragraphs to share his harrowing story about how Reade ruined his floors before he was forced to evict her.

Is Jeff Bezos just an unfaithful horndog? Or is he also an international provocateur? The answers to these questions are important, because Bezos is not only the richest man in the world; he's also one of the world's most powerful corporate and media chieftains. Through his many holdings—including Amazon, Amazon Web Services (which works in cloud-computing, including for the CIA), Alexa, his Ring home-surveillance system, and the Washington Post—he has reach into just about every corporate suite, every national capital, and billions of homes. And if one adds his Blue Origin space exploration company, his ambitions stretch far beyond this globe.

Nothing about The Sopranos has aged, and again, like a great novel, the most important aspect of it never will — its themes.

Among his 40-odd films, he played a sheriff who jailed Rambo in First Blood, a serial killer in To Catch a Killer, and a corrupt sheriff gunned down by Kevin Kline in Silverado.

Bean's quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on To Tell the Truth.

Rubio spoke at the conference of seven decades ago, as the United States was coming out of WWII an optimistic nation. He continually looked to the podium throughout his speech.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was attacked by a large number of users, including Soledad O'Brien, after he decided to eat at Chick-fil-A during Pride Month. He apologized, explaining that he completely forgot about their background.
It is ironic as it is perverse, that the Reporter, which is quick to judge others for the clergy sexual abuse scandal, denies its own role in contributing to it. To be specific, its relentless attacks on the Church's teaching on sexuality enabled sick men to justify their homosexual assaults.
In the provincial and increasingly simple-minded world of Hollywood, casual racism is usually the telliest tell of all, its own kind of tired spoiler that predictably informs us that Gil is either a villain or will suffer a comeuppance — because that's what today's Production Code of Political Correctness requires. In the end, though, Gil steps up, and within the context of the situation, is revealed to be both heroic and loyal.
In the months before Saturday's wedding, there had been speculation over whether Markle would continue the tiara tradition and if so, whether she would choose one that belonged to Harry's late mother, Princess Diana.
Of course, the majority of Americans don't think that protecting the First Amendment is even close to outrageous — but the fact that liberals do proves why this order is necessary! explains FRC. We couldn't be happier that Secretary Perdue took the president's words to heart and set to work righting the wrongs done to businesses like the Vander Boon's.
Our stories do not matter to this President or this administration. But they matter to millions of us and to our families.
The cardinal tied the conversation back to the pope's celebrated remark in 2013 Who am I to judge? in reference to gay individuals in the Church trying to live chaste lives.

My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God. Speaking only for myself, I can tell you that if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: If you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.

The fact is the UK Independence Party has been pusillanimous on this issue for years.

Carmela is a monster, a monstrous mother, a Renfeld to Tony's Vampire, an audacious hypocrite who knows exactly what she is doing, what it is doing to her kids, but who will never give up the furs and jewels.

Listen, my beliefs don't perfectly align with Graham's. But when he says something like God put Trump in the Oval Office, I'm content to let it go, whereas Super Evangelical David French sees only a mercenary opportunity, an opening that allows him to abuse his faith as a transaction that might get him on TV or win a retweet from Chris Cuomo, a transaction that puffs him up with a sense of moral superiority.

Stone pleaded, I'm broke. I'm looking at $2 million in legal bills to try to not spend the rest of my life in prison on some kind of trumped up phony political charges because I supported Donald Trump for president, and because I helped bring down the most evil, corrupt, foul-mouthed, self-centered, short-tempered kleptocrat in American history: Hillary Rotten Clinton.

To begin with, his bitter attack on Graham makes no sense. It's a word salad of imperious gibberish designed only to appeal to the mindless mob that drives his sour tribe and Jake Tapper's TV bookers.
When the results came in, they were decisive. At reunification the per capita gross domestic product in socialist East Germany was just about one third of the capitalist West German level, with other measures of economic performance displaying a similar chasm. Even the poorest part of West Germany, Schleswig-Holstein, was two and a half times as wealthy as the richest East German region, Saxony. To this day, the eastern part of Germany gets nearly 15 percent of its gross domestic product in net transfers from the western part of Germany.

I don't believe that that God will protect me from COVID-19 more than a secular guy, Prager stated. I do not believe that, so I just want to make that clear, however, that doesn't mean you don't call on God. 'God is my shepherd. I shall not want.' It doesn't mean God is going to save me and not my secular neighbor. I don't believe that.
And so, Jeberoni, the Jebster, Jeb!, Yeb!, Mr. Sensitive Conscience, is not only a pathetic weakling and more confused in his thinking than any national political candidate in memory, he is not even talented in his passive-aggressive attacks on Trump, because he looks like a braying jackass.
Had a Swedish girl been sent abroad to marry a paedophile, then every social worker and politician had rolled up their sleeves straight away. Every minister and the prime minister would have called it a huge scandal for Sweden, she added.

Biden says instead of doing this in the United States, he would bring together the leading experts in the world like the Obama administration did with the Ebola crisis. He says governors are making sound decisions in the absence of such leadership.

In Arlene's Flowers, an Evangelical Christian grandmother named Baronelle Stutzman likewise declined to participate in a same-sex wedding by doing the floral arrangements for the ceremony. Like Phillips, she had previously served gay customers – including the man who filed this complaint against her – but declined to be part of his same-sex wedding because of her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. (Stutzman is a Southern Baptist.)

It is opportune to reaffirm that personal choices in life, whether regarding the protection of the unborn, the sanctity of marriage and the family, or the acceptance of a person's God-created biology, should be made not solely for a penultimate reality on this earth but in anticipation of the ultimate reality of sharing in the very life of God in heaven, he said.
McGuire said all society talks about is toxic masculinity, while forgoing the critical role that men play as husbands and fathers. Or society says that women who decide they want to put their careers on the back burner to focus on child-rearing have wasted their education. I think we need to reclaim, as positive goods, the differences between men and women and the essential roles of mothers and fathers.

The Middle East Eye reported on Friday that al-Qaeda's presence is growing in Yemen, including in the city of Taiz, but the makeup of those involved in the conflict is complicated.
Most importantly, the worst Trump is guilty of here (and he's not) is a campaign finance violation. Democrats and Dirty Cops in the Justice Department want us to believe the payoff should have been listed on Trump's campaign finance reports as a campaign expense.

For the first time on television we are rooting for the villain, and this makes us as complicit, and that complicity is thrilling … at least for a while. The Tony we first meet, the man struggling with depression, panic attacks, conscience, the man capable of empathy, will slowly devolve into a rank bastard. And like Melfi, we come to realize we have been conned by a sociopath. And yes, there is also something thrilling about that, about being so expertly hustled for so long by Chase and his team of genius writers.
CONWAY: I can't even say I've seen it. But, to my point: they've all failed. They've never succeeded the way I did as campaign manager, and they never got their candidate where my candidate got. He's president of the United States.

After the New York Times' exoneration of Biden was debunked by a ton of corroborating evidence that was proved the Times had in fact not completed an exhaustive investigation; after the Associated Press's lies smearing Reade were debunked, and even after PBS made a chauvinist fool of itself trying to portray the fact it uncovered even more Biden victims as exoneration, the media are still at it. But now the media are so desperate to excuse Biden's accusers, they're interviewing Democrats to exonerate the Democrat Biden, and they're trashing Reade for — this is not a joke: not returning books and a few unpaid bills, for struggling with her rent and asking to borrow money.

Street Group, a political strategy firm of which the lawmaker's alleged married lover, Tim Mynett, is a partner of. On Tuesday, Mynett's wife, Dr. Beth Jordan Mynett, filed for divorce in a D.C.-area court, alleging her spouse confessed to having an affair with Omar in April, the same month FEC documents show that the lawmaker's campaign began issuing payments to E.

As per FEC guidelines, lawmakers are forbidden from using campaign money for personal travel expenses unless the candidate pays the money back using their personal funds.

What joy and purpose await the dissolute 20- and 30-year-old substance-abusing absentee parents of Bailey's story when they roll into late middle age? What do they have to look forward to, beyond more of the damaging lifestyle their bodies can no longer sustain? They don't even have the meager spiritual nourishment of waging a successful struggle to stay alive. When benevolent social programs ensure that survival is no struggle at all, there is nothing left to accomplish, and oblivion is easy to accept.
But not the kind of journalism, clearly, that pays much regard to facts.
These included seeing Islam as barbaric, irrational or sexist (Class 3). Considering Islam to be violent, aggressive, threatening or supportive of terrorism, were also guilty signs (Class 4).

Chapman University's president says he cannot and will not fire a professor and former law school dean amid growing campus calls for action against the faculty member's participation in a pro-Trump rally during which he made claims about election fraud on the day a violent mob stormed the Capitol. … John Eastman, an endowed professor and constitutional law scholar at Chapman, spoke alongside Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani at the Save America rally Jan. 6, citing secret folders in ballot machines that were used to skew vote totals. … A Jan. 8 letter signed by more than 160 Chapman faculty members called for the university's faculty senate, provost, president and law school dean to take action against Eastman, including stripping him of his endowed professorship and removing him from teaching students. Free speech is sacred, and tenured academics like Eastman have the privilege of speaking their mind without fear of repercussion.

First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year, Bryant stated in his 2004 public apology. Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did.

The BBC noted China's birth rate hit a 70-year low in 2019, three years after the end of the one-child policy. This is commonly attributed to a lack of government financial support for young couples to have the families their government suddenly desires, after years of threatening to destroy their lives if they dared to have a second child, but as the Global Times story suggested, there is growing concern that the male-female imbalance may have created a demographic log jam that cannot be cleared with government subsidies.

We've been waiting for 70 years, and the longer the government does nothing, the harder polygamy becomes to change, she said. If I want the situation of Bedouin women to improve, I need to work with them.

Curry says when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well, like we are actual family.
Gingrich said, I think we ought to take him head-on. This is the guy who told us at Saddleback Church that he believed in marriage between a man and woman because it came straight from the Bible and he believed it. This is the guy who told us, you get to keep your doctor, you get to keep your health insurance. This is the guy who said there was a red line in Syria, and exactly one year later, said he'd never said there was a red line in Syria. Barack Obama is a left-winger who has spent his entire career denying reality. One simple example, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs under Obama. We've already gained over 400,000 over — under Trump. I like that choice. I think you want to go back to Obama, higher unemployment, fewer jobs, more food stamps, let's have that debate. But let's — we need to have the courage to take head-on the real Obama, not the New York Times fantasy version.

Somewhat ironically, though, Biden has attempted to improve his standing in Iowa by playing to the state's long history of backing populist causes and candidates.

Still, Comey saw fit, according to the Republican and Democrat memos, to utilize the dossier in the FISA documents. He seemingly failed to tell Trump about the origins of the dossier on multiple occasions, as his new book spotlights.
Trying to fully explain or grasp what this show is about is like trying to empty a bathtub with a butter knife. Wrapping your arms around something this enormous, this deep, this nuanced, and loaded with theme, is an impossible task. Each episode is deserving of its own chapter, each season a doctoral dissertation.
Here's the problem. Let's say you don't buy those definitions. Let's say you're, for example, white foot poor, and you have trouble accepting the idea that you're benefiting from some kind of structural advantage. We better shut up about it if you know what's good for you because according to the United States Army, the quote, denial of white privilege is a classic sign of yes, white supremacy, so no complaining.

The United States has lost six aluminum smelters since 2013, leaving just five, according to one senior administration official. Of those five, only two are operating at full capacity, and just one produces military grade high purity aluminum. That official stated that if the one military grade producing smelter were to shut down, the U.S. would be forced to buy this material from China or the Middle East. The official called it a significant vulnerability for the U.S. The steel industry has lost an estimated 50,000 jobs since 2000, according to the official.

In the case of socialism, however, we have two perfect test cases: North and South Korea, and East and West Germany. The perfection of these examples comes from the fact that we are dealing with the same people, same background, same culture, merely two rival economic systems. North Korea is socialist; South Korea capitalist. East Germany was socialist; West Germany capitalist.

Deceptively edited video of the Catholic students – attending the March for Life in Washington – portrayed them as disrespecting Native American activist Nathan Phillips and the religious sect known as the Black Hebrew Israelites. However, other video of the entire encounter shows the students were not only verbally accosted and insulted by the black activists – who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at them – but that Philips himself initiated the encounter with the young students, yet failed to provoke them.
Indeed, wrote Scalia, to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.

Judge White, however, said his decision is about family, not politics.
Anthony Bourdain was the father of an 11-year-old girl, separated from his second wife, and not only dating Asia Argento, he was her public champion and defender.

A lower California state court upheld their action, and we've now completed the briefing for the appeal of the lower court ruling with the filing of a reply brief last week. We brought this litigation on behalf of Earl De Vries, a legal resident and taxpayer of California (Earl De Vries v Regents of the University of California (BC555614)). Under California law, taxpayers have the right to sue government officials to prevent unlawful expenditures of taxpayer funds and taxpayer-financed resources.

Jennifer Blatus, a political strategist who interned with Diaz Jr., said in the Newsweek report:
Remember that under Islamic law, a woman's word is worth half of a man's, so if her husband accuses her, her denial is worthless and she will be found guilty on his word alone. This is brilliantly illustrated in the hard-to-watch movie 'The Stoning of Soraya M', a true story about the stoning of a young mother in Iran on the word of her husband only; he simply wanted rid of her. Her father and sons joined in with the stoning.
One activist on Instagram even claimed that Ensing is a supporter of the dangerous MAGA group.

Sullivan is a gay liberal who led the push for single-sex marriage. But he is not an anti-America progressive. He has supported the border wall and recognizes the political extremism of the Democrats' see-no-problem policies towards immigration:
Except for the racist white people, everyone is so gosh-darned earnest and virtuous, including everyone on death row. No joke: according to Just Mercy, everyone on death row is noble and decent, and either completely innocent or noble and decent enough to admit their guilt. There's not a single death row inmate who acts like a real person, much less a criminal or murderer. They're all Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption: Clean prison cells. Pure minds.

In fact, Camosy decided in February 2016 that Catholics could, in good conscience, vote for pro-abortion and pro-same-sex marriage Bernie Sanders, since attending to the needs of the poor – which, he argued, Sanders achieved better than the GOP candidates at the time – is, ultimately, the central teaching of the Church and trumps the protection of life in the womb.

Over the past few years, China's diplomatic offensives, military coercion, interference and infiltration have continued unabated.

Under the rotational system, the Sultan of Pahang state, Ahmad Shah, is next in line although the sultan is ailing according to local media, a rumour the palace has strenuously denied. Johor's Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar and Sultan Nazrin Shah of Perak, who is currently the deputy king and is carrying out the functions of the king until a new one is elected, are the next two names in the rotational system. Although the functions of the king are largely ceremonial, he also serves to safeguard Islam in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and must assent to the appointment of individuals for various senior government roles including that of prime minister. Under the constitution, there are only three instances in which the ruler who is next on the list can be denied the position: if the royal is a minor, if the Conference of Rulers by secret ballot resolves that he is unsuitable by reason of infirmity of mind or body or any other cause to exercise the functions of king, or if he declines to take the position. The ballot would then move to the next ruler on the list. In 2016, the Sultan of Johor claimed he had been offered the role of king, bypassing both Kelantan – Muhammad V's home state – and Pahang, saying he had rejected the offer out of respect for the rotational system.

But over time, she became more than a name above the title: Right down to her cheerful, alliterative stage name, she stood for a time of innocence and G-rated love, a parallel world to her contemporary Marilyn Monroe.

Local officials in Wuhan have warned earlier that they should prevent relapses of infection cases due to lifting the city lockdown, especially after the country has made visible progress in containing the virus. Mi Feng, spokesperson of the National Health Commission, said on Tuesday that the country has reported no new confirmed cases, no new suspected cases and no new deaths on Monday, and domestic critically ill cases have dropped below 200 for the first time since the outbreak. However, there have been sporadic infection cases in the country for several days. While the epidemic situation is worsening in Europe and the US, imported cases surpassed domestic ones [in China], bringing pressure for treatment, prevention and control work, testings as well as quarantine measures, he said.

Thinks about some of the things Christianity brought to western civilization he continued. In the twelfth century, marriage came to be counted as a sacrament by the Catholic Church. As a sacrament, it does not require a priest, only the agreement of the man and woman, which is the greatest protection ever given to women in a system of marriage: by the Church's argument, women cannot be married against their will, they and their bridegrooms must both say, I do.

Secretary Perdue can act now to correct this injustice for the Vander Boons and Americans like them who work with the USDA, and we hope that he will.

Honestly I cannot explain it. So much virulence leaves me truly perplexed, Salvini said, adding that on the other hand he is flooded with mail from Catholics — even priests and bishops — who encourage him to keep going the way he is.
Dan Polster has been a federal judge in Ohio since 1998, when his nomination by President Bill Clinton was confirmed by the Senate. He is presiding over more than 2,700 lawsuits by local governments and Indian tribes who accuse pharmaceutical companies of contributing to drug abuse in their distribution of opioid painkillers. He has drawn praise from both of Ohio's senators, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown. Now Polster, 69, is one of more than two dozen federal judges who are taking senior status, allowing them to reduce their caseloads while creating vacancies for President Biden to fill. Those who have spoken publicly have denied any partisan motives — understandably, since they remain on the bench — but Polster alluded to the need for the judiciary to show strength in a time of turmoil.
…the share of interracial and interethnic marriages in America has increased fivefold, from 3% of all weddings in 1967 to 17% in 2015, notes the Guardian, the left-wing UK paper Turner-Smith should be familiar with. And multi-ethnic births accounted for 1 in 7 newborns in the U.S. in 2015, Pew data shows. And Americans today are far more satisfied with race relations under President Donald Trump than they were under President Obama, according to Gallup.

The worst forms of socialism proved not only totalitarian, but also murderous to an unprecedented degree. In the Soviet Union alone, socialist regimes killed some 20 million of their own citizens and enslaved tens of millions of others. The Chinese socialists, in the period known as Mao's Cultural Revolution, killed another 20-25 million. The Nazis murdered in comparable numbers, including Jews and gypsies and other occupied peoples, Poles, Russians, Eastern Europeans and others. Orwell's description from 1984 seems appropriate here: A boot stamping on a human face.
Still, Comey saw fit, according to the Republican and Democrat memos, to utilize the dossier in the FISA documents. He seemingly failed to tell Trump about the origins of the dossier on multiple occasions, as his new book spotlights.

The next turning point was the financial crisis of 2007-8. Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had already moved to the left after losing reform referendums in 2005.

Embracing or rejecting faith in God is not the result of a political calculus whose ultimate goal is mirroring societal trends and thus achieving popularity and victory.

So now, turning to a recent Bezos-inspired news story, let's ask ourselves:
In his remarkably prescient 2015 dissent in the case of Obergefell v.

In most every interview he sits down for, Zahler is pretty much berated over his politics, his non-conformity, his refusal to adhere to the Production Code of Political Correctness. In other words, he's called on the carpet and told to explain himself — Are you now or have you ever been a Republican! But Zahler — God bless him — refuses to answer. Other then confessing to being an atheist Jew, Zahler will only say his films do not express a point of view, that his only goal is to create something compelling.
Federal campaign finance records show that Omar's campaign has paid nearly $230,000 since 2018 to the E. Street Group, a political strategy firm of which the lawmaker's alleged married lover, Tim Mynett, is a partner of. On Tuesday, Mynett's wife, Dr. Beth Jordan Mynett, filed for divorce in a D.C.-area court, alleging her spouse confessed to having an affair with Omar in April, the same month FEC documents show that the lawmaker's campaign began issuing payments to E. Street Group for travel expenses. According to FEC filings, the Minnesota Democrat's campaign made eight payments totaling $21,547 to E. Street Group for travel costs between April and June. The divorce filings, first reported by the New York Post, also states Tim Mynett made a shocking declaration of love for the Minnesota Democrat to his wife and left her soon after. The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), the right-leaning non-profit group behind the complaint against Omar, alleges the timelines of the affair and travel payments overlap. As per FEC guidelines, lawmakers are forbidden from using campaign money for personal travel expenses unless the candidate pays the money back using their personal funds.

How coherent is this idea of real socialism? If an economic idea fails once or twice or even three times, one can still insist it was a fine idea that was merely implemented poorly. But if an idea fails 25 times, all over the world, everywhere it has been tried, without even one counterexample of a socialist regime that works well, it strains credulity to insist that there is still some undiscovered form of socialism, heretofore unattempted, that will finally prove its viability. Yet another go at socialism now feels like Elizabeth Taylor's eighth marriage, a triumph of hope over experience.
If Trump has been making these payoffs going back more than a decade, if there is a pattern of Trump incurring these expenses to protect his reputation, marriage, and private life, then there is no way this is a campaign expense.
Dr. Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, submitted a statement in which she warned of other health risks associated with the measure:
Following thorough maintenance checks and reviews, in total 230 bullet trains are being made ready for departure, according to local media reports. Local authorities also announced on Tuesday that starting from 00:00 on April 8, Wuhan will lift 75 checkpoints designated to control outbound flows and resume normal function of 15 major traffic security checkpoints, while random inspection work would be carried out in line with epidemic prevention and control work. The city's transport authority also warned on Tuesday that lifting the outbound travel ban does not mean relaxation of epidemic measures. Those who do not need to leave Wuhan to resume work should avoid going out, otherwise, those who need to go out and resume work need to make plans regarding travel routes in order to avoid massive gatherings and traffic jams. About 55,000 people are estimated to leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday, most of whom are heading to the Pearl River Delta, home to many of China's warehouses. The first train will go to Nanning, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at 7:06 am, according to the local railway authority.

On two occasions he had someone come to the house and, using a sharp implement, she thought a razor blade, had her cut repeatedly in a series of deliberate actions causing serious injury to her small body.
Blue-Collar Democrats, who lack bachelor's degrees, feel the most economically vulnerable. The Professional Class, which has college degrees, feels the most secure. As the aging Old Guard fades, the Blue-Collar Democrats' skepticism of trade, U.S. leadership abroad and other matters may clash with the Professional Class's support of engagement with the world. … Blue-Collar Democrats as a group have often been least likely to see globalization as a benefit to the U.S. economy. This helps explain why some Democratic lawmakers agree with President Trump that trade deals have hurt workers.
I think Jesus would encourage any love affair if it was honest and sincere and was not damaging to anyone else and I don't see that gay marriage damages anyone else.

At the same time, though, he doesn't let them off the hook. While Ridgeman undoubtedly would have treated a white dealer the same way and is about to be unfairly crucified as a racist by the Roman circus the news media has become, he still went too far and needs to box the compass of his humanity.

But as that first great champion of free markets Adam Smith recognized in his Wealth of Nations – published 1776, so this knowledge has been out there for as long as the U.S. has existed – for capitalism to function properly there must be a degree of regulation: not because government intervention is necessarily ideal but because without it the market cannot function effectively.

America is a country created by settlers mostly from the British Isles, said Fonte. Later immigrants assimilated to the settlers' culture, while influencing it to some degree. The Nation of Immigrants claim is utter nonsense, as historical fact, he said.
The public's preference for civic solidarity is decent and rational. Migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.

[Omar] told supporters after the election that she would cut ties with E Street Group, headed by her husband Tim Mynett, to avoid any perceived issue, but the sponsors of the legislation said that the problem is bigger than any single candidate. The Oversight for Members and Relatives Act would prohibit candidates for federal office from compensating spouses who work on campaigns and require disclosure of any direct or indirect payments made to spouses or immediate family members, including children, parents, siblings and in-laws. At least two top Democrats could be predisposed to support the measure: A similar measure sponsored by Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat, was approved by the House in 2007 with the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Oh, and 64 percent say the Republican Party is headed in the wrong direction.
However, Brzezinski rejected the idea of having her marriage hosted by the President. The White House that I grew up in was an amazing place. If it weren't Trump, it might be something to think about, Brzezinski said. The mental picture is just fascinating, but the reality is just … no. No, no, no, no, no.
He said he appealed to the Supreme Court to protect the best interests and welfare of the children.

If there's no distinguishing factor between the Democrats and us, how do I win? asked Illinois State Rep. Terri Bryant during a rowdy debate, reports WBEZ. How do the downstate Republicans win? We have to have a distinction. I implore you, I implore you, so we can pick up the extra seats we need in the House.
Could this verse be any clearer? Women must obey and if they don't, you may use violence against them. This can, and in practice does, justify all kinds of horrors against women. It is very clear that if the men in her family don't approve of her conduct, they can beat her for it.
UPDATE: The candidate, Colonel Bob Starr, finally responded to questions about his advocacy for LGBT rights. He spoke with a local Abilene affiliate and stated that he felt the term activist was a misrepresentation of his views. He stated, I believe and strongly support traditional marriage, but as commander of Dyess Air Force Base, my job was to enforce the law and not discriminate against anyone who made different lifestyle choices than the ones that I agreed with, Col. Starr says. All I had to do was make sure that homosexual airmen were not discriminated against. That's what changed in the law in 2011.
Omar announced the news in an Instagram post with the caption: Got married! From partners in politics to life partners, so blessed. Alhamdulillah
If anything, Pence has tried to appease the gay community. In 2015, when Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to protect Christian business owners from being compelled to endorse gay marriage, Pence immediately backed down in the face of criticism and signed a fix to the law.
Hungary's parliament has passed a declaration against signing the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women because it smuggles in provisions declaring gender a social construct and allowing gender-based asylum claims.
Kelsey Harkness, senior news producer and reporter at the Daily Signal spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Wednesday regarding the hijacking of International Women's Day by America's radical feminists, as detailed in her recent article, Why It's 'Devastatingly Selfish' For Strikers To Hijack International Women's Day.
As a fan of the gangster genre, and an even bigger fan of David Chase (Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The Rockford Files), like a few million others, I caught the Sopranos premiere on HBO and … was disappointed. It was nothing like I expected, it was not Goodfellas in Jersey. Who cares about Tony's home life? But I hung in there and realized that throughout the week I was thinking about The Sopranos, talking about it, something I had not done since Twin Peaks, another show that took some time to fall in love with.

In another case involving cars, in Byrd v. United States the Court will determine whether Fourth Amendment search and seizure protections apply to a rental car driver if that driver is not listed on the rental agreement as having a legal right to drive the car.
Dan Schnur, a veteran political analyst who teaches at USC sees a strategy behind this. Neither one of them is in a position to motivate their party's base, so they both turned to something else to do it for them, Schnur told the Los Angeles Times. There is nothing for California Democrats as motivating as Donald Trump, and there's nothing as motivating for California Republicans as the repeal of the gas tax. Both candidates have figured out it's a lot easier to surf a wave than it is to create a new one.
Berk told GQ the HFPA did not retaliate against Fraser and that his career declined through no fault of ours. The HFPA, which primarily oversees the Golden Globes, didn't provide comment.
The implications of this analogy will be exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent, he wrote.

Enforcement questions have prompted concern about the Foundation becoming more involved in the affairs of site communities. On Wikipedia in 2019, editors revolted when the Foundation imposed a year-long Wikipedia-specific ban on a veteran administrator in a major escalation of the Foundation's role, which has traditionally acted only on serious legal matters or issues affecting multiple Foundation-owned sites. Pressure from the community forced the Foundation to back down and the ban was eventually overturned with editors believing the Foundation had committed to avoiding such intrusion into the self-governing nature of site communities in the future.

Known as the world's largest human gathering, Kumbh Mela translates loosely to festival of the sacred pitcher.
.@SymoneDSanders just said on @CNN with @ChrisCuomo that the CDC said it's safe to vote on Tuesday. That's wrong. The only guidance we have so far is that we should not gather in groups of 50 people or more.

The son of a bookmaker, Finney was born May 9, 1936, and grew up in northern England on the outskirts of Manchester.

Prince Philip has only rarely been seen in public since his retirement, and especially rarely since the arrival of coronavirus when he and the Queen isolated in Windsor Castle. The Duke did release a statement in support of medical workers and others in April, when he said: I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic…
Nothing George W. Bush did to win re-election, nothing Trump did, bothered me in the least. There is also an honesty in the ugliness that I appreciate.
For those who will not work towards delegitimizing the entire system (aka the State of Israel) that facilitates daily 'brutality' against Palestinians, he intoned a curse, 'The blood of the people of Palestine will be upon them,' the essay states.
Biden spoke to reporters in Washington, DC, after addressing the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers:
So, I just want to ask you to confirm, did you ask your students in class that day to raise their hands if they knew of a woman who had taken maternity benefits from a company and then left the company after having a baby?
The remaining nine cases of broad interest are yet to be argued. They are:
The court ruling was passed by two judges who argued that is was not uncommon for women to falsely claim they have been assaulted, and said that the Muslim woman reporting the abuse was less credible in her case because she reported the violence to the police rather than attempt to solve it within the Muslim community, Aftonbladet reports.

A 2013 analysis by USA Today found that 32 members of Congress had doled out more than $2 million to relatives who staffed their campaigns in the 2012 election. One of the biggest recipients was the wife of Rep. Bobby Rush, Illinois Democrat, who received $147,549 in the 2012 cycle, an order of magnitude less than the $2.8 million Mr. Mynett's company was paid for its work on the Omar campaign, as reported Nov. 10 by Fox News.
Iconic Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie may have a closer relationship than most people realized after all, as the two star in a new ad for an STD detection service that sees the longtime best buds analyzing the result of what appears to be their own test.
Today, Shupe told Breitbart News he attends 12-Step meetings.
It is apparent to anyone watching this race closely that they do not represent the values and interests of most Americans. Whether Biden or Sanders, conservatives need to be wary that unfettered, permanent big government control over life and liberty would be certain.
Uttarakhand police said Wednesday that the Indian National Security Guard (NSG) would deploy a special anti-terror squad to Haridwar during Kumbh Mela to protect participants from anti-national elements — possibly referring to entities that might target the Hindu festival due to its association with the religion of India's ruling, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP promotes the interests of India's Hindu majority and has recently passed legislation across several states criminalizing forced religious conversion through the guise of marriage, termed Love Jihad.

Bayless, appearing on the Seth Davis Podcast, said, No one who read that book thought Troy Aikman was gay. No one. Trust me. Because even Troy's supporters who read the book loved the way I wrote it. Bayless pointed out to Davis that suspicion that Aikman was gay was a big locker room issue that year and a big issue among the Switzer supporters.
The first lady's communications director Stephanie Grisham rebuked hosts of The View television show for using internet conspiracy theories to ridicule the President and First Lady's appearance during the couple's trip to visit tornado victims.

There is nothing heroic about Anthony Soprano, anti or otherwise.
Set during the George W. Bush era, Chase speaks of our lost purpose by reminding us we don't even fight our own wars anymore. Someone else's kids go out and do that for us, while we go to the mall (just as the president ordered), to the movies, lose ourselves in online porn, in chemicals and loveless sex, embrace shallow acts of trendy activism, practice our religion when it suits us, or simply treat it like a superstition, a form of witchcraft that wards off assuming responsibility.
She had a very subtle touch behind the scenes, Brokaw told host Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News, on Monday morning's edition of Breitbart News Daily, heard daily on Sirius-XM's Patriot Channel 125.
I want to divorce myself [from the same-sex marriage issue] — not because I disagree with their stance — but this was nothing to do with that. That's just my personal hatred.
However, the potential problem with a Kaepernick-Miami marriage, might be the Cuban community in South Florida.
It's a great honor, he said of the unexpected invite. The atmosphere is great. The royals are great supporters of everything and the young element is really coming through. I think they're going to take things forward.
It is liberals such as Buttigieg who treat the public expression of religion as if it were some sort of communicable disease, Donohue adds, whereas conservatives want a robust public expression of religion.
Yet here we have socialism in America attempting a comeback, and on precisely those terms: This time we're gonna get it right. Serious people advocate it; there is a sustained cultural push to apotheosize it; a major political party is pushing aggressively toward it. How is this possible? Apparently socialism means never having to say you're sorry.
In October, Breitbart London reported that as many as 6,000 women and girls have had their genitals mutilated in Ireland, with another 3,000 currently at risk of having the gruesome procedure inflicted upon them.
All three rejected the argument that we could 'just get married'. All three emphasised that the Government cannot maintain the status quo for much longer – they are on borrowed time.
We're putting Australians first … Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs, he said.
In a second tweet Graham added, Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.
The Obama administration began lifting restrictions on women serving in the combat arms, and services have been slowly implementing those policies.
Much like it appears with Smollett, the SPLC has been crying wolf to excess with its nonstop accusations of hate. The fact is that most Americans just want to live their lives in peace alongside their neighbors, regardless of their color, faith or orientation. It is only when seen through the politically agenda-driven lens of the SPLC and the mainstream media that America looks like a hopeless cauldron of hate and division. Instead of being treated as a watchdog for extremism, the SPLC should be shunned as the irresponsible, hyper-partisan and financially-motivated extremist group it is.
In January, four wealthy men kidnapped and gang-raped a seven-year-old boy. Officials said the men, while drunk, kidnapped the young boy and took him back to their settlement. They killed him with a rope after they raped him.

I felt it had lifted me up from the status of second-class American, Alito said.
What joy and purpose await the dissolute 20- and 30-year-old substance-abusing absentee parents of Bailey's story when they roll into late middle age? What do they have to look forward to, beyond more of the damaging lifestyle their bodies can no longer sustain? They don't even have the meager spiritual nourishment of waging a successful struggle to stay alive. When benevolent social programs ensure that survival is no struggle at all, there is nothing left to accomplish, and oblivion is easy to accept.
It's become sort of politically incorrect to even talk about the differences between men and women, the different things that they bring to a marriage and to a family. It's ironic because we know now more than ever before how badly children need mothers and fathers and need them to be married to each other in order to thrive. And yet, we are in complete denial, and even talking about those realities, is politically incorrect.
BERLIN, Germany: Ambassador Richard Grenell expressed nothing but praise for President Trump, Mike Pence, and John Bolton, during an interview with Breitbart London, describing what it is like to be the most prominent openly gay diplomat in the history of the United States.
There is now no excuse when the question comes up for marriage, Cuomo said during a briefing on Saturday. No excuse. You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no.
While the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans, argue the professionals. This would mean we can't ask why; we can't explore underlying mental health issues; we can't consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can't look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.
Cardi B to NYPD: 'Fuck You' 'Suck a Fart and Suffocate On It'
Chase also didn't shy away from how gangster movies affect gangsters, affect his own characters — the way they talk, dress, see the world and themselves.
Last fall, Klemm explained in an interview with a Romanian news agency why he publicly pushes for gay marriage.
In Durbin's Nation of Immigrants — including legal and illegal — politics is all about enforced Diversity, Fonte said. The central elite treats people as members of competing identity groups and then balances each diverse group against the others to achieve politicians' goals, such as a desired percentage of women serving as fighter pilots in the U.S. Navy, Fonte said.
A number of those who crossed paths with Biden's accuser say they remember two things: She spoke favorably about her time working for Biden, and she left them feeling duped. The Politico sub-hed reads.
On April 17, Turnbull announced his party would reform the 457 visa program, which allowed Australian companies to bring in foreign workers for skilled and unskilled jobs throughout Australia. The 457 visa will be replaced by a narrower visa program that will only be used to bring in workers who cannot be found in Australia and who can integrate Australian society, he said.
Simply put, a Biden presidency would be a major setback and defeat for Americans who want to protect the unborn, defend religious liberty, maintain a robust economy, recognize the right to bear arms, and promote American peace through strength at home and abroad.

Urging Catholics not to make the same mistake, she says living by the true teachings of the Catholic faith in terms of sexuality and marriage – even when bishops and priests do not – is what is needed for lay people to effectively eradicate the poisonous consequences of the Sexual Revolution within our culture.

If Ms. Hummer was on her way to Reade's house, one can assume it was to loan Reade the money, but nowhere does Politico report whether Reade paid Hummer back or not, so I think it's safe to assume Reade did pay the loan back and Politico decided not to report that.
I can tell you that I know we're looking forward to having him on board, Nauert said. He will be involved with our Religious Freedom Report and that, we anticipate, will be coming out sometime soon.
Like a gay-baiting schoolboy, Kimmel taunted Jack Phillips — the Colorado cake artist who just won a Supreme Court case protecting his religious freedom and freedom from compelled speech — as a closeted gay man.

The state Senate elected Democratic Majority Leader Harriette Chandler to take over as the acting president.
Several changes were made to the code of conduct in response to public criticism, but mostly to clarify the provisions or correct wording rather than significantly changing their effect. One change on a provision for disclosure of personal data added a vague prohibition on sharing information concerning the Wikimedia activity of users outside the projects. When the code of conduct was approved by the Foundation board, another major change was made to a provision barring use of symbols, images, categories, tags or other kinds of content that are intimidating or harmful to remove the need for showing an intent to be intimidating or harmful.

Trump expressed similar disdain for fake news hits on the first lady in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News this week. If our first lady, if I were a Democrat instead of a Republican, she'd be Jackie O times twenty. Instead, they go after her, Trump said making reference to the often lauded former first lady and wife of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, whose subsequent marriage made her Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Jackie O.
That's the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator. It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife.
In 2005, Neil Ferguson told the Guardian that up to 200 million people could die from bird flu. Around 40 million people died in 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, he explained. There are six times more people on the planet now so you could scale it up to around 200 million people probably. The final death toll from avian flu strain A/H5N1 was 440. (That's 440 people, not 440 million.)

The Democrats' voter base will likely fail to recognize the dissonance between their candidates' stances on Iran and their performative support for women.

NANCY PELOSI: I don't think it's disqualifying because I think disqualifying is what your intention is. I do think this about communication, in general, beyond this.

But, I think that it's important for the vice president and others to understand is it isn't what you intended, it's how it was received. That's generally about communication, in general. If people don't think they're being communicated with even in your marriage, if your spouse doesn't think you're communicating, you ain't communicating. Even if you think but I did this and I did that. So, it's how it is received. So to say I'm sorry that you were offended is not an apology. I'm sorry I invaded your space, but not I'm sorry you were offended, because what's that? That's not accepting the fact that people think differently about communication, whether it's a handshake or a hug.

When I read his column, the first question that popped into my mind was this: how can indefensible and un-presidential bad character lead to such admirable presidential decisions? I am not aware of any attempt by Bret Stephens or Jonah Goldberg or similar Never Trumpers to provide an answer.
Newsom is competing against Republican John Cox, who was endorsed by President Donald Trump before the June primary where he finished in second place behind Newsom.
All 12 also served several months in prison before the public punishment.
When Tulsi Gabbard first ran for office she touted her work to pass a measure allowing the Hawaii to ban same-sex marriage as the reason she should be elected. The organization she worked for supported gay conversion therapy and ex-gay ministries. https://t.co/VxKBt1mQkH — andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) January 14, 2019
I wore a dress on my wedding day because I felt like it, I straightened my hair because I felt like it, she said. But that doesn't make me become some instantly 'polite hetero lady,' she added.
There are chilling things happening in the West, he said. I think that a parliament that authorizes the death of an innocent, defenseless child commits a serious act of violence against the human person.
[Diaz is] a flamboyant, cowboy hat-wearing New York City councilman who immediately distinguished his views when he announced his run in 2019, saying I am the opposite of AOC in the South Bronx. And that has national Democrats, opponents and progressives like Planned Parenthood and LGBT groups in a panic because the 77-year-old minister has a history of making inflammatory statements about homosexuals and strongly opposes abortion because of his religious beliefs. He would instantly become Donald Trump's favorite New York congressman, strategist Eric Koch of anti-Diaz super PAC Bronx United told Newsweek, adding that Diaz Sr. would be an unreliable Democratic vote in the House caucus.
Grodell was himself a heroin addict, whose gateway drug was prescription pain pills to manage the pain from powerlifting competitions. Many studies of the rise in mortality rates point to the easy availability of prescription pain medication as the first step toward serious addiction; it has been theorized that working-class whites were hit so hard because they're more likely to visit a doctor, complain about chronic pain, and be given painkillers.
These college-educated liberals, many of them young and most of them white, make up a growing, Democratic Professional Class. Their interests differ in many ways from those of two other groups … The college-educated, professional class of Democrats is doing the most to push the party to the left. Policy ideas such as instituting a government-run, single-payer health-care system were once promoted only by the most liberal voters. They are now widely supported within the party – with the professional class emerging as the most enthusiastic … The professional class is also the most comfortable with same-sex marriage, changing gender roles and other recent social changes.
The Swedish parliament has voted to stop recognising child marriages despite parties from the governing coalition, including the Social Democrats, seeking some exemptions.
Janet Jackson, the sister of the idol Michael, spreads the news of her marriage and pregnancy, he wrote. It's curious that all the sites refer to her husband as 'the Qatari.' I wonder why they focus on his nationality.
Late last summer, Mynett denied making that statement in his legal response, and Omar denied the alleged affair in a television interview.
Chinese experts believe that the nation's population will begin to decline in 2028.
Fiorentini claims he was worried because he could not contact his girlfriend, and so went to her apartment Saturday afternoon and was let in by the landlord. The young woman was lying in the bedroom, naked. According to the first autopsy, Olsen may have died several hours before the discovery of the body, and her body bears no signs of sexual assault.
The Sopranos is not the first show to ignore the 22 to 24 episode season. For decades, the television miniseries, notably Roots (1977), The Winds of War (1980), Holocaust (1978), and most especially Rich Man, Poor Man (1976), had been gripping the nation over a handful of nights as novels for television.
Examples such as these are good P.R., but they're also good for an organisation's bottom line, Zappulla argues.
The death toll was smaller than the much-publicized 675,000 dead from AIDS from the 1980s, Princeton economics professors Deaton and Case write in their new book, Deaths of Despair. The toll, they write, is the equivalent of three full 737 MAXs falling out of the sky every day [for three years], with no survivors.

Given the foregoing instructions, we do not consider it possible to enter on the baptismal record two mothers or two fathers or a 'transgendered father' whose real nature is a woman or a 'transgendered mother' whose true nature is a man, the cardinal concluded.
I hope for her sake that this investigation will be clearer, said Georgette Jupe, a friend of Ashley's and author of the blog Girl in Florence.
One particular part of the speech stuck out especially. Now, we didn't support Joe Biden for President, you probably guessed that. But if we're being totally honest here, and we want to be honest, we have to say it was very hard to disagree with this specific part of the address. Watch.

But Democrats, never wild about freedom in the first place, saw civil rights as a great gig. Instead of civil rights being used to remedy historic injuries done to a specific group of people, they'd use civil rights as a false flag for all their pet projects.
Vander Boon said USDA inspectors – who worked daily in his meat-packing facility – removed the article about traditional marriage and confronted him with it in his office, threatening to pull out of his facility, a situation that would immediately cause his business to shut down.

[T]here is not a specific law with respect to the entry of same sex couples or 'transgendered persons' as parents on the baptismal record, the cardinal reportedly explained. The term 'parents' used by the Church's Canon 877 clearly refers to the father and mother, the man and the woman created by God who are united in the sacrament of marriage.
France launched a national consultation online in December, following calls for more direct democracy. But when the results were published earlier this month to reveal the most popular proposal was for the repeal of same-sex marriage, the initiative was dismissed by the French establishment and mainstream media as having been hijacked by conservatives.

Ambassador Whittlesey remained active in American conservative politics, often advocating positions that were unpopular on the Right at the time, but have, in the age of Trump, found a much wider audience. Perhaps most notably, she was one of the small group of prominent conservatives to oppose the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As the American Conservative wrote in 2015:
Rights group Equality Now said the medicalization of FGM remained one of the biggest threats to its elimination.
Clearly, Trump's attention to black voters, his signing of the First Step prison reform bill, and his policies creating the lowest unemployment rate for black Americans in history have had an impact, they asserted.
The other bills signed into law permanently revoke the medical licenses of any medical practitioner who is convicted of carrying out such a practice and increase the statute of limitations to 10 years, so victims have more time to seek damages in civil lawsuits.
The PAC made its first large scale expenditure on December 6 when it paid Old Town Media LLC, a Virginia-based public relations firm, $623,922 for media placements. The payment was earmarked specifically for Iowa's media markets. On the same day that buy was made, the PAC also paid more than $31,000 to Putnam Partners, LLC., a Washington, D.C.-based political messaging company, for ad production. In total, the PAC spent more than $655,000 in one day, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).
Stephen Tennes, the owner of Country Mill Farms, has sold his fruit and vegetables at the East Lansing Farmer's Market for the past seven years.

Though supporters of the legislation claim it will decrease the risk of suicide for LGBT youth, MFI points to the case of Walt Heyer, who underwent gender reassignment surgery in the late 1980s.
In order to make a case for Guilfoyle's termination, Stasi repeatedly misleads her readers (and this includes the headline) with the false claim Guilfoyle is a reporter. By spreading this falsehood, Stasi is able to manufacture a conflict of interest out of whole cloth over the fact that Guilfoyle is in a relationship with someone she is reporting on. This is the foundation of Stasi's piece, and none of it is true.

The crackdown on danmei is part of a broader initiative by President Xi Jinping to suppress any organic expressions of Chinese culture that the government cannot control and replace it with socialist family values. In December 2016, Xi delivered a speech calling for a new trend toward socialist family values, followed by a crackdown on dating television shows, online video that did not conform to correct political and aesthetic standards, and any media promoting Western lifestyles.

The following day, December 17, the group paid Putnam Partners a further $31,900.02 for ad production—bringing the PAC's spending total to more than $531,000 for the two days.

Like Barack Obama, George W. Bush proved to be a much better campaigner than president, and that glorious 2004 campaign was only about one thing — turning Kerry into an elite, French-loving, wind-surfer who hates America, lied about his war record, and is kept by his wife — a foreigney condiment heiress.
[The school] has devolved into a cesspool of toxic, exploitive, biased and self-serving senior officers who are bolstered by submissive, sycophantic, and just-as-culpable enlisted leaders, the email said.

Catholics must and do speak out on many issues affecting the equal dignity of us all, but if life at its most vulnerable beginnings is not protected, then none of us is safe, Cordileone said. Affirming this equal human dignity at every stage and in every condition is the path to healing and unity.
The woman already lost her job over the uproar, but she still should have been charged with filing a false police report, because that was her crime.
Summing up, the Pope declared that such a state would be living a true secularity. It's not right to disparage or discount the opinions of religious people in society, he said, just because they are grounded in Christian thought.
But a writer for Sporting News, Tom Gatto, gushed that the proposal was not your typical arena proposal, at all.
West Midlands Police insist they are reviewing that first enquiry to see if we can identify more suspects and are in the process of trying to retrieve footage that was recorded in the original interviews and that they always strive to put victims at the heart of all our investigations in Public Protection and will be led by what the victim want — completely contrary to Hannah's account of how she has been treated.
The Globe said it interviewed 20 people who know Hefner or his accusers. The report noted an alleged incident in 2015 when Hefner – who at the time was engaged to Rosenberg – appeared at the doorway of a lobbyist's office as he was about to leave for the evening, and grabbed his genitals.
When [McGowan and I] met up the following day, she hesitantly told me of her own accord that during the meeting that night before she had gotten into a hot tub with Mr. Weinstein. She was very clear about the fact that getting into that hot tub was something that she did consensually and that in hindsight it was also something that she regretted having done.
The Equality Act would be used to mandate school curricula that affirm and promote sexual orientation and gender identity views.

Capitalism is working for the educated elite, and it's just not working for anyone else, and the [civic] danger is that the educated elite is going to get smaller and smaller, and eliter and eliter, Deaton told the EPI. He continued:
He then pointed to new geopolitical challenger China for systematically executing on what the Soviet Union never could, supplanting the United States to become the world's premier technological, economic, geopolitical, and military power.
In what local news sources are calling a murder mystery, a 35-year-old Florida woman named Ashley Ann Olsen was found naked in her rented apartment in Florence Saturday, after having been strangled.
Whether aversion to social change is rational or good is a largely subjective question, which falls outside the scope of our research.
We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need, Freeman stated.
French author Frédéric Martel alleges in a new book that Pope Francis had been informed that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had been having sexual relations with seminarians and priests but considered this fact insufficient to condemn him.
He said: She's got an excellent reputation with the workers and the crew, and not everyone does. It's not talked about every day on the streets, but I think the majority of African-Americans are quite proud of her. And happy.

The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have competing goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, troubled teenage girls trying to flee womanhood, and people trying to de-transition back to their sex. It also includes men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women's rights, parents eager to support transgender claims, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, revenue-seeking drug companies, and medical service providers.
Rubio moved from talking about individualism that transcends the left into other areas of business and politics, to talking about those who equate wealth with being good. He said this is why we have a financial elite that outsources American jobs to countries that do not share our values and views the traditional beliefs of regular Americans as backwards.
Forced marriage is linked to a slew of abuses including kidnapping, domestic violence, serial rape and even murder, conference experts said.
Just this week the Catholic Church in Belgium released a new report on clerical sex abuse that showed that 76 percent of priests' victims were males, mirroring patterns of chiefly homosexual abuse in other countries.
But that is not what Raskin said. He did not say that you cannot claim constitutional protection for criminal speech. Everyone knows that, and in fact former President Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury when he lied under oath.
It's impossible to know where all these allegations and investigations will lead—other than, of course, to some great spy thrillers to come, with or without James Bond.
Alyssa Milano at L.A. Impeachment Rally: 'I'm Premenopausal and I Am Angry … Vote Them All Out'
Goldberg was adamant that God had no opinion whatsoever on divorce, saying that He had handed down ten, and not twelve, Commandments, and none of them outlawed divorce.
I got sick of contemplating my navel and staring up at the sky and telling myself how wonderful it was not to be doing anything, he explained in a 1983 interview with The New York Times.
Stone considered Tapper's comment as innuendo-laden. He said, Look, I'm a libertarian. I think people know that. I'm a long-time supporter of same-sex marriage, of the legalization of marijuana. I'm a libertarian conservative. I'm not a social conservative. People know that. My private life is my private life. I'm married and I have two children, five grandchildren, and our business is our business.
There are many nuances to this crime type, which even third-sector charitable organisations, do not claim to share a nexus with your rationale of concerns for the lack of successful prosecutions [sic], he claimed.
Omar filed for divorce in October from her husband, Ahmed Hirsi, after reports of the affair surfaced. Her filing, the Washington Post reported, did not mention an affair. But divorce filings from Mynett's wife did allege an affair, though both Omar and Mynett denied the allegations, the Post reported.
The choice of citizenship is the middle-ground position, said Fonte, between the extremes of Durbin's elitist combination of Marxism and fascism, and of the libertarians' vision of America as a consumer mall that is governed by contracts between buyers and sellers.
I think that people will realize that there's been a certain foolishness in thinking that a godless and religionless life is is rich, said Prager. It isn't, and it's crises that make that clear.

Summing up, Istat notes that the average number of children per woman has dropped to 1.35 in 2015 from 1.46 in 2010. Italian women have on average 1.27 children whereas foreign women residing in Italy give birth to an average of 1.94 children per woman.
Fact: All single-sex spaces will be open to both sexes under the Equality Act. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity rules to Title III of the Civil Rights Act on public facilities as well as to public accommodations (Title II) and federal funding (Title VI). This would create a nationwide transgender policy in single-sex facilities …

Depp has hit and kicked Heard on numerous occasions, has thrown objects at her, at one point nearly suffocated her to the point where she feared for her life, Heard's new lawsuit claims.
To begin with, as someone who has lived in a small town in the south since 1993, and who is also in an interracial marriage, I found the depiction of the south ludicrous. If it wasn't for the wider ties and lack of crew-cuts, you would think you were watching Mississippi Burning 2. Just a few years prior to O.J. Simpson's acquittal, we're supposed to believe black people are kept out of a courtroom so only the white people are allowed to sit? That white boys in pick-up trucks phone in bomb threats and drive by in slow-motion to glare at the noble black folk? That the sheriff and his men embrace the Rebel Flag and use the N-word in the presence of Harvard-trained defense attorneys?
Because they are children, it is really emotional and moving, Thabet said. So they will forgive very quickly.
Judge White, however, said his decision is about family, not politics.
That is a diplomatic way of saying that illegals will be allowed to stay in the United States once they get past the border. That is also the Democrats' usual We're-not-for-deportations disguised endorsement of open borders.
While the UK has so far been largely shielded from the crisis in southern Europe, this potential flow can only add to the impact of migration which is already seriously affecting communities across the country, Lord Green said.
In the West, pregnancy outside of marriage is acceptable, and abortion on demand is considered a woman's right. But in the West African nation of Senegal, it is taboo to be pregnant while unmarried, and abortion is not legal.
There was no question how the Chinese did it. The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. Under Mao, factories were nationalized and the land of the peasants was expropriated. Mao targeted traders and businessmen — the bourgeoisie — attempting in his own words to destroy the property owning class by killing at least one landlord in every village via public execution. Mao's Great Leap Forward, announced in 1958, accelerated the collectivization of farms; in fact, all private farming was banned. The result was the greatest man-made famine in history.
Cyrus was romantically linked to model Stella Maxwell in 2015 and not long after, Cyrus proclaimed herself pansexual.
But with Jared's sound counsel, Trump did it. He took Sessions out of the Senate, then delivered the seat to a Democrat. Trump is like a guy who breaks up a marriage — and then dumps the wife.
The other two confirmations were for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. With them, President Trump has appointed six of the 16 seats on that court, the single largest impact on any federal court to date measured either by absolute numbers or by percentages.
In Monday's orders, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari that the Browns' attorney, Prof. Jonathan Turley, had filed in Brown v. Buhman, asking the justices to take the case, ending the legal challenge and leaving the Browns in a five-person marriage with their 18 children.
Jared and Ivanka were also the brain trust behind hiring Anthony Scaramucci.
In our case, it all started when we began criticizing the people in charge. Other channels fill their air with attacks on so-called Proud Boys, whoever they are, or the QAnon enthusiasts or gun owners in Central Pennsylvania who fix air conditionings for a living and tend to vote the wrong way. They go after those people, and you can see why. Attacking those people isn't hard. None of them have real power. They don't — let's be honest, they don't.
Women become victims of war in other ways, by stigmatizing and isolating them from society, Arriaga went on to say.
The two lay judges in the case were appointed by the Centre Party whose leader Annie Lööf was quick to condemn the acquittal. One of the judges, Ebtisam Aldebe, who advocated for special laws for Muslims in 2014, has been pressured to resign.
In June, Breitbart London reported the Muslim cleric Ibrahim Omerdic has been convicted for marrying a 14-year-old child to a man 20 years her senior in Melbourne, Australia.
Earlier this year, the Anglican Communion, the world's third largest denomination, narrowly avoided schism after it suspended the American Episcopalian Church for adopting a pro-gay marriage stance.
There is nothing honourable in the brutal torture and murder of predominantly women for cultural reasons.
In addition, of course, there's the more familiar stuff about Amazon as a not-so-good corporate citizen; you know, nasty revelations about not paying taxes, overworking employees, denying them bathroom breaks–and firing them over too many, even for the medically needy-dipping into their tips, and generally contributing to the trend of the rich getting richer–and ever more arrogant.
A new book on the extensive homosexual presence in the Vatican is due for release on February 21, the first day of the Vatican meeting on clerical sex abuse.
Men and boys who identify as female could compete on women's and girls' athletic teams, easily snatching away choice championship awards and scholarships.
Titled An Act Relative to Abusive Practices to Change Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Minors, the bill states:
Noting that neither article covers the most repressive and murderous acts of openly socialist or communist governments, Fox does note that an article exists on the topic of Mass killings under communist regimes. The mass killings article is notorious on Wikipedia as having at one point been under an unprecedented years-long indefinite page lock, which barred anyone without special administrative privileges from editing the page. Imposed back in 2011 to enforce a restriction requiring that all substantive edits receive consensus support, the page was eventually unlocked in 2018 with new looser restrictions imposed.
The dismissal comes just days after the Glory Days crooner's podcast with former President Barack Obama, Renegades: Born in the U.S.A., debuted on Spotify. The podcast features the two discussing hot button issues such as race, fatherhood, marriage, and the state of America.

Set during the George W. Bush era, Chase speaks of our lost purpose by reminding us we don't even fight our own wars anymore. Someone else's kids go out and do that for us, while we go to the mall (just as the president ordered), to the movies, lose ourselves in online porn, in chemicals and loveless sex, embrace shallow acts of trendy activism, practice our religion when it suits us, or simply treat it like a superstition, a form of witchcraft that wards off assuming responsibility.
In a press release, GLAAD referred to FRC and Focus on the Family as anti-LGBT hate groups.
On the other hand, what did you expect? You've watched the lying for years now. You know what it is. You figured out how it works.
The argument suggests that the progressive do not listen to the public's opposition to the predictable social and economic harms of their favored policies — such as girls who slice off their breasts, foreigners who die in the Hunger Games migration, and discarded Americans pushed toward opioid deaths.
She was pleading for the soldiers to kill her rather than face the prospect of going back to her family in Dubai, McFarlane said.

The news comes shortly after Aldi — another low-cost German retailer — courted controversy by putting up a sign in a store in Northampton, England, advising customers that they could not purchase alcohol at a till manned by a cashier thought to be Muslim.
The number of people given French citizenship this year is likely to soar 45 per cent from 2015's figure, with the vast majority of new French from North Africa. The spike follows a concerted push by the ruling Socialist Party to naturalise 100,000 people a year.
On October 7, the prefect of the Vatican's Congregation of Bishops confirmed allegations that Pope Benedict XVI had indeed curbed McCarrick's activities due to concerns about his behavior.

According to TMZ, the 30-year-old Rum Diary star appeared with her lawyer Samantha Spector to file for the restraining order on Friday, while claiming that Depp struck her in the face during an altercation last Saturday night.
It is worth noting that similar complaints were lodged against Cardinal Dolan by conservatives in 2012 when he invited then-President Barack Obama to the Al Smith dinner in New York, with some asking with disdain: Why would you invite our enemy to a night of merriment? NCR, of course, had no problem with this at all and defended the cardinal's decision as this right thing to do.
Focus of the Family's The Daily Citizen reported that the organization is getting support from allies:

By this time, Jeb(!) had already dropped out of his hapless low-energy bid for the 2016 Republican nomination, so why would a 90-year-old woman who had already been through four decades of the political wringer allow a presidential primary, allow a Donald Trump, allow anything other than a family crisis to discombobulate her to where she had a fake heart attack?
Kitzhaber's team used back-channel and private emails to avoid public disclosure, the committee staff detailed in the 204-page report, Cover Oregon: How mismanagement and political interference squandered $305 million federal taxpayers dollars. Also, the Oregon officials repeatedly sent false reports to Health and Human Services and doctored up a phony website that they represented as a functioning Cover Oregon website.
And then, Buttigieg closed his campaign with the ludicrous and ridiculous phoniness of becoming the White Obama. You have to see this to believe it.
In the decades that followed, 'Islamophobia' rapidly turned into a way of dismissing all legitimate concerns over the real-world social or criminal consequences of Islamic doctrine – or uncontrolled mass Muslim immigration – as rooted in prejudice.

According to official Catholic teaching, as summed up in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, IVF techniques are morally unacceptable because they dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act.
It is apparent to anyone watching this race closely that they do not represent the values and interests of most Americans. Whether Biden or Sanders, conservatives need to be wary that unfettered, permanent big government control over life and liberty would be certain.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) announced over the weekend that he will allow citizens of the state to receive marriage licenses remotely from their own homes during the Chinese virus pandemic — and even be married by video conference.

While Ms. Chauvin has no children from her current marriage, she respectfully requests that her children, her elder parents, and her extended family be given safety and privacy during this difficult time, added the statement.
We already knew from other sources (such as BLS time use surveys) that the overwhelming majority of the prime-age men in this un-working army generally don't do civil society (charitable work, religious activities, volunteering), or for that matter much in the way of child care or help for others in the home either, despite the abundance of time on their hands. Their routine, instead, typically centers on watching—watching TV, DVDs, Internet, hand-held devices, etc.—and indeed watching for an average of 2,000 hours a year, as if it were a full-time job.
The Kuwaiti state's Islamic scholars have taken pains to clarify the marriage rules amid the lockdown.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Nov. 17 (UPI) — A British woman who told police in Dubai she was gang-raped by two men was arrested, had her passport taken away and is stuck in the country until her trial, which may not happen for months.

I don't know how much I can say, because I don't want my wife to be mad at me, Middleditch told the magazine. Only after I got married was I like, 'Mollie, I'm sorry, but we have to get nontraditional here.' To her credit, instead of saying 'Fuck you, I'm out,' she was like, 'Let's figure this out.'
Unlike on Brexit and the election, this is an area where the generations are increasingly united.
The change came in the late 1970s, when the Chinese, under Deng Xiaopping, abandoned the socialism of Mao for its own brand of capitalism. In doing so the Chinese inaugurated a new experiment in social organization. Call it totalitarian capitalism. The Chinese did not relinquish their Communist dictatorship; rather, they married dictatorial political control to free market liberalization. Some say it was an awkward marriage, yet in economic terms, it worked.
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue is committing his agency to religious freedom following President Donald Trump's executive order last week to vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.

Dennehy was born July 9, 1938, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the first of three sons. His venture into acting began when he was 14 in New York City and a student at a Brooklyn high school. He acted the title role in Macbeth. He played football on a scholarship at Columbia University, and he served five years in the U.S. Marines.
Pell also noted the irony among those trumpeting the primacy of conscience, since they only seem to apply it to sexual morality. How many people are advised to follow their conscience on issues of racism or when resisting to help the poor and vulnerable? the cardinal asked.
Anderson underscored the tremendous impact the legislation will have on the privacy of women and girls, as well as the punitive consequences to which faith-based institutions and organizations will be exposed at its hands:

The Daily Caller reports that Google banned a video which stated that the church welcomes homosexuals but encourages them to follow Christian teachings on same-sex marriage. Internal communications show that the video was banned from Google's advertising platform on YouTube after a Google VP agreed that the video constituted a microaggression and shouldn't be allowed.

The paper describes the 11 myths pushed by its progressive supporters — and then details the reality behind the progressive myths.
Ashley McGuire of The Catholic Association said, There's a real attack right now on the religious liberty of adoption agencies and parents and parental rights when it comes to public school.

Le Pen opposes gay marriage, although she would allow civil unions, and would restrict medically assisted procreation to only couples unable to have children naturally.
On Sunday evening, Carlson shared a statement to Twitter refusing to apologize and instead invited his detractors to debate him on his popular program. Media Matters caught me saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago, said Carlson. Rather than express the usual ritual contrition, how about this: I'm on television every weeknight live for an hour, Carlson continued. If you want to know what I think, you can watch. Anyone who disagrees with my views is welcome to come on and explain why.
Zahler's most brilliant choice, though — a choice that again forces us to see the difference between shit talk and true racism — is the woman Lurasetti wants to marry: a beautiful, accomplished black woman whose skin color is never mentioned, not even by Ridgeman.
When the Pope failed to reply to the Cardinals' September letter, they proceeded to publish it online on November 14, hoping to elicit a response.

Kensington Palace says that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen Cleave & Company to make their rings.
10:40 PM: On CNN, Sanders doesn't quite answer the question when asked if there should be primaries on Tuesday. But he says it doesn't make a lot of sense to have elderly poll workers checking registrations, etc. He points out New York postponed a primary shortly after 9/11 and two states (GA, LA) have already postponed their primaries.

But a group of Never Trumpers like Jonah adopted a less radical stance and conceded that many or even most of Trump's policy actions were actually conservative, and ones they agreed with. What made them Never Trumpers was his horrible, defective character. Most prominent among this group was Bret Stephens, whom I have also admired and promoted in the past. At the end of Trump's first year, Bret wrote an op-ed for the New York Times – the position being an obvious reward for his defection – called Why I'm Still A Never Trumper. In it he praised Trump's major policy actions since entering the White House. But then he attacked Trump's character as un-presidential and indefensible. And he averred: I still wish Hillary Clinton were president.

So will Michael Sanchez be able to tell his side of the story? He has his own explanations and theories, which seem to focus on, for example, the supposedly nefarious role of de Becker, Bezos' security adviser.
At first, the show's surprises were thrilling. But as we came to expect them, the anticipation of those surprises made viewing an even richer pleasure.
As Breitbart News reported, Omar's marriage history is a subject of intense security:
LGTB activists have set up the false conceit of Pence as an enemy, when he has treated them with nothing but tolerance.
For a while, it seemed that the Jeff Bezos vs. David Pecker story was dying down. You remember all hullabaloo that from January: the messy stuff about divorces, and hacks, and you-know-what pics. But then the MSM developed a bad case of Michael Cohen on the brain, and the story faded.
Good Christians sin. Good Christians fall short. Good Christians give in to temptation. Good Christians sometimes do terrible things. But good Christians also feel shame, regret, guilt, and an overwhelming desire to repent and ask for another chance.
The left-wing group said they would support Biden if he becomes the nominee but insisted that a centrist like Biden will only divide Democrats. Presumably referencing policies like the Green New Deal that establishment Democrats oppose while using one former President Barack Obama's trademark lines on the stump, Justice Democrats said Biden will turn Democrats into the party of No, we can't.

It was the first marriage for the West, 43, and the third for Kardashian, 40. While the union wasn't long, it outlasted the predictions of many cynics who thought doom was inevitable given the two oversized personalities, West's well-known volatility and the fact that Kardashian's previous marriage, to former NBA player Kris Humphries, was fleetingly brief.
Asserting he believed the woman's father's motives were more difficult to discern, the judge said in a written ruling: I conclude that he acted partly to assist [the husband] in his immigration application but also because he thought it would be right for [his daughter], and the family as a whole, for her to be married.
Jesus himself told his followers that they must be like the salt of the earth, not just blending in but conferring a distinct flavor to the world around them.
A confidential NATO report reviewed by Radio Free Europe (RFE) in September estimated the Taliban raked in $1.6 billion last year, an impressive sum when measured against the legitimate Afghan government's budget of $5.5 billion. The cost of multiple wives must be skyrocketing to put significant stress on such a huge income stream.
Narssarssuaq months later posted a notice about leaving Wikipedia claiming my conscience does not allow me to contribute to this project, not even with attempts to provide balance to biased articles and that the era of Wikipedia, if there ever was one, is over. Among other complaints, the editor stated: Unfortunately, it now seems that Wikipedia cannot be trusted to convey objective information – the information you get could easily be partisan. Later returning, Narssarssuaq would leave again after coming into conflict with editors over their suppression of Biden family corruption elections in the weeks before the 2020 Presidential election, one of many instances where editors supported Biden's campaign.

The royal newlyweds are taking a short trip through Windsor in a horse-drawn carriage, to the delight of thousands of well-wishers.
For obvious reason, the cardinal concluded, gender theory, which detaches gender from biological sex, radically contradicts the Church's teaching that the place of a sexual relationship can only be between a man and woman, within matrimony, and must always be open to procreation.
But the study also produced a remarkable chart showing the attitude of Democratic political insiders towards the pro-American views of normal voters.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a little-noticed report last week that confirms what Obamacare critics said from Day One: the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates for the cost and impact of the Affordable Care Act were off by enormous margins. American voters should carefully consider this object lesson when evaluating all socialist promises.
Bush seemed then, and did again Thursday morning, like a craven and shallow politician who believes the only way to win elections is through appeasing the establishment media.
Best known for hits such as I Believe I Can Fly, Kelly was charged a week after Michael Avenatti, the attorney whose clients have included porn star Stormy Daniels, said he gave prosecutors new video evidence of the singer with an underage girl.
Biden has not only won the majority of delegates but he has secured the majority of endorsements from former democratic challengers. The most important statement from his Super Tuesday speech came when Biden called for unity with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in order to defeat Donald Trump.

I believe women should be allowed to make the decision, but I also think the church is right to say it's a sin. Because sin is actions that harm us. Lying harms us, Irons told The Guardian in 2016.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded to a question about abortion Wednesday by reminding the country that President Joe Biden was a devout Catholic.
Joe Biden stands in near complete opposition to where the center of energy is in the Democratic Party today. Democrats are increasingly uniting around progressive populist policies like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, free college, rejecting corporate money and ending mass incarceration and deportation, Alexandra Rojas, the group's executive director, said in a statement. We don't need someone who voted for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and for the Bankruptcy Reform Act while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.
The explosive admission came as the Iowa Republican and her now ex-husband, Gail, are lobbing serious accusations at each other in recently released court filings. The divorce documents detail what was an increasingly dysfunctional marriage, which included allegations of extramarital affairs and physical abuse.
This, of course, is the same explanation sitcom star Roseanne Barr presented in her defense late last month after being fired from her ABC show, Roseanne. In a tweet, Barr compared former-Obama White House advisor Valerie Jarrett to an ape. Barr, however, said she had no idea Jarrett is black. Barr was still disgraced and fired.
First of all, the (human) hero of the film is a small-town police officer, Tom Wachowski, played by James Marsden.

The new season of Saturday Night Live wasted no time getting topical — or mocking Donald Trump — with an opening sketch that featured Alec Baldwin skewering the president for his response to the hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico, threatening Attorney General Jeff Sessions' job and mentioning his stand-off with the NFL.
He earned more Best Actor Oscar nominations for his roles in the searing marital drama Shoot the Moon in 1982, co-starring with Diane Keaton, and The Dresser in 1983. He was nominated again in 1984 for his role as a self-destructive alcoholic in director John Huston's Under the Volcano.
Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden, Morey told the Florence Morning News. Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.
Only about 1,000 kids play baseball in Israel and there is just one regulation baseball field in the country. In 2007, a group of American supporters launched the Israel Baseball League, a semi-professional league comprised almost entirely of foreign players that generated little interest and folded after just one season.
Buttigieg tied in the news of the magazine cover with a feeling of hope he had for America's future.

The Ministry is studying a draft law to regulate the marriage of teenage girls… the marriage of under-age girls in the country is not a phenomenon yet as some claim… those who say this are wrong. he said. We are considering regulations in line with the Islamic Shariah to govern this kind of marriage.
Why shouldn't she feel free to express this and expect support from her party, unless what she is saying is fundamentally untrue (Spoiler: it's not).
The University of Kansas is hosting an art contest dedicated to criticism of the popular fast-food brand Chick-fil-A. The chain found itself at the center of a controversy when it opened a Chick-fil-A location on campus, resulting in the But the Chicken's Good…? contest to allow students to express what the presence of Chick-fil-A on campus signifies to them.
Dennehy had a long connection with Chicago's Goodman Theater, which had a reputation for heavy drama. He appeared in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo in 1986 and later Chekhov's Cherry Orchard at far lower salaries than he earned in Hollywood. In 1990 he played the role of Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, a play he reprised at the Goodman with Nathan Lane in 2012 and in Brooklyn in 2013.
In the Islamic Republic of Iran's marginalized society, where women are relegated to second-class status and often treated like children, a growing brand of martial arts – known as ninjutsu – is providing women with a sense of empowerment and self-worth.
In his explosive 576-page exposé, titled In the Closet of the Vatican: Power, Homosexuality, Hypocrisy, French journalist Frédéric Martel — who is openly gay and an LGBT activist — accuses the Catholic Church of hypocrisy for opposing gay marriage and adoption when so many of its own clerics are active homosexuals.

McDowell County has the lowest average life expectancy for males in the United States, a problem attributed to poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and murder. The poverty is largely due to the ongoing collapse of the coal industry, and the mechanization of the work that remains. The place has so few jobs that WalMart closed its store at the county seat.
Just as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women's inequality should shame us all in the 21st. Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid, Guterres said in a speech to the New School in New York.
Wareholik said she would like to see more religious communities involved in helping to eradicate the opioid crisis. You can somehow act as a messenger or a mediator to get your church involved in the direct service and get your politicians involved in your church, and that's a really good thing.
He's the reason I am an actor, Finney said in 2012.
Of course, the focus on Michael doesn't mean that the Bezosians aren't still going after Pecker, Trump, and whoever else. After all, it would certainly elevate Bezos if he could turn his peccadillo into a major case against the Vast Trump Conspiracy. That is, liberals everywhere would love it, and soon enough if the Bezos People play it right, over time, it might seem as if the whole mess was Trump's doing, thus easing the stain on Bezos.
During an appearance on Live with Kelly and Ryan on Wednesday, the actress, renowned for her dabbles in new age curealls, divulged the tidbit that she invited former hubby and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin on her honeymoon in December.

Palmor dismissed accusations that her plan is politically motivated, pointing to support she has garnered from some Bedouins, most notably the human rights attorney Insaf Abu-Shareb.
The Conservative government has been weak on so-called grooming gangs since the mainstream media finally began reporting on the scandal of large-scale child sexual exploitation of mostly white working-class by groups of mostly Muslim men of South Asian heritage.
I notice that he was not the first black president when Democrats were singing Fleetwood Mac at his inauguration, nor when he was appointing the first woman attorney general or passing welfare reform. Only after Clinton was caught in the most humiliating sex scandal in U.S. history did he suddenly become the first black president. (Which is not true, according to Monica Lewinsky's description of Clinton's private parts.)
Daily News columnist Linda Stasi is using the Roseanne Barr Excuse in her defense after publicly attacking Fox News star Kimberly Guilfoyle with a racial slur. But because Stasi is a Trump-hating leftist, and the establishment media have no ethical or professional standards, Stasi still has a job.

I have never met Professor Kim; perhaps she does not attend the meetings of the Medieval Academy. But what I know from what she has written about me is this: Professor Kim wants you to be afraid. I don't. I want – like Mary – for you to know that you are loved and that God so loved the world that he gave his Son in sacrifice that the world might be remade. How should you signal that you are not a white supremacist if you teach the medieval western European Christian past? Learn some f*cking medieval western European Christian history, including the history of our field.**
So Republicans, with very little Democratic help, passed a slew of laws saying: No, even though you own that restaurant, you cannot discriminate against black customers.

Kuwait City (AFP) — Abu Othman, like thousands of Kuwaiti men, has struggled to split his time between two wives living in separate homes amid the Gulf state's strict lockdown to combat the coronavirus.
The AFP documents included: references to an email from a girl who wrote she was being held against her will and being forced to marry; a situation report with allegations of a forced marriage at the end of the school year; and a human trafficking referral of a girl who was forced to travel outside of Australia and then exploited.

How did the change come about? It came about through economic liberalization, otherwise known as free market capitalism. And how did India decide to move in that direction? It was not inspired by the Indians reading Adam Smith. Rather, Indians looked across the Chinese border and saw that millions of once-impoverished peasants now lived in clean homes and nice apartments. The Chinese now shopped in well-stocked grocery stores. They drove new cars.
By the mid-1980s, Greenpeace had drifted from the original concept of green and peace — meaning environment and people, [to] save civilization from nuclear war — so we cared about people and had a humanitarian orientation as well as an environmental one. That was the marriage of green and peace, but by the time the eighties came along, the peace had kinda got lost and all it was was save-the-whales and save-the-earth, and now humans were being characterized as the enemies of nature, as if there's too many of us and there shouldn't be so many and people shouldn't have children — and all this stuff that's still coming up with AOC, now, telling people that maybe they shouldn't have children because the world's coming to an end.

Alcohol, prostitutes, homosexuality, sex outside marriage and revealing clothing are all ever present, making these practices seem legal or at least, common and acceptable, claimed Radha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, an advocacy group. In reality, they are serious offenses that can lead to lengthy imprisonment, fines, and deportation.
I put an emphasis on having sex only with your spouse, but having the full range of sexual experiences with that spouse, Muladhat told the Guardian. Islamically, there's an emphasis on enjoying physical relationships within the context of marriage, not just for procreation. It is the wife's right that her husband satisfy her sexually.
Trump, of course, has long sniped at Bezos and the newspaper he bought in 2013, the Washington Post. Trump believes the Post is biased against him and his presidency and, furthermore, that Amazon has been getting a sweetheart deal on shipping rates from the U.S. Postal Service. Meanwhile, Trump is known to be close to David Pecker, the chief of American Media Inc. (AMI), publisher of the Enquirer.
First, no specific relief is offered to families like the Vander Boons in Michigan, who were threatened with the effective closure of their family-run business for simply expressing a religious point of view on marriage that differed from that of the federal government, ADF senior counsel Gregory Baylor originally noted in a statement reported by Christian News.
When a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples 'the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage' … we reverse the state court's judgment.
He has praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel over her generous policy to asylum seekers that has seen more than a million new arrivals since 2015.

Fox Should Fire Reporter Kimberly Guilfoyle, Who Can't Possibly Stay Neutral While Dating a Trump Kid Now that Kimberly Guilfoyle is reportedly having sleepovers with Donald Trump Jr., the Fredo Corleone of the Trump boys, while she's reporting on him, his father, his father's sex scandals, and the Mueller investigation, what Fox News — that fair and balanced network — should do is bust her down to courtroom reporter. Or fire her. That's what the sex-scandal-plagued news network must do to maintain even the slightest shred of journalistic integrity. She can't report on the most powerful family in the country while dating one of them.

And there are plenty of those children, even though subsidized birth control is readily available. Teens and twentysomethings simply aren't bothering to use it, because they know their families and the government will take care of accidental children, and besides, a semi-accidental pregnancy might provide them with some emotional purpose in life.
Dan Polster has been a federal judge in Ohio since 1998, when his nomination by President Bill Clinton was confirmed by the Senate. He is presiding over more than 2,700 lawsuits by local governments and Indian tribes who accuse pharmaceutical companies of contributing to drug abuse in their distribution of opioid painkillers. He has drawn praise from both of Ohio's senators, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown. Now Polster, 69, is one of more than two dozen federal judges who are taking senior status, allowing them to reduce their caseloads while creating vacancies for President Biden to fill. Those who have spoken publicly have denied any partisan motives — understandably, since they remain on the bench — but Polster alluded to the need for the judiciary to show strength in a time of turmoil.
The ruling, which was signed by 50 Pakistani clerics, declares that normal men and women can also marry such transgender people as have clear indications on their body.

According to CalMatters, he endorsed Eleni Kounalakis for lieutenant governor (the post Newsom currently holds) over fellow Democrat and California state senator Ed Hernandez. And in his only endorsement of a California state legislative race, he also endorsed Buffy Wicks in an East Bay assembly district over fellow Democrat and Richmond City Council member, Jovanka Beckles.
Simply put, a Biden presidency would be a major setback and defeat for Americans who want to protect the unborn, defend religious liberty, maintain a robust economy, recognize the right to bear arms, and promote American peace through strength at home and abroad.
With all of this evidence in front of them, my challenge to British feminists is this: will you admit the truth in what I have written, and do you want this religion to have more or less influence in countries where women have fought and died for their freedom?
Using homosexuality as a pejorative, which is the very definition of homophobia, Kimmel not only accused Phillips of being gay, but mocked him for looking like a woman.
CONWAY: I can't even say I've seen it. But, to my point: they've all failed. They've never succeeded the way I did as campaign manager, and they never got their candidate where my candidate got. He's president of the United States.
The California State Legislature passed statutes granting such tuition benefits to California State University students and California Community College students, but it was forbidden to do so for University of California students. Under the California Constitution, the UC Board of Regents is entirely independent of the state legislature in policy matters, so there is no lawful way for the California legislature to allow or require the University of California to provide public benefits to illegal aliens.
KERNEN: But, Mr. Vice President, since the year 2000, have you — the country has evolved, to some extent, I think, on marriage equality, on gay rights. Have you — would you say your views have evolved at all since then?

Socialists today disavow this historical record, insisting that these were authoritarian forms of socialism that they have no intention of copying. While socialism may have been the economic program of Communism and early Fascism, modern socialists seek to dispense with the tyranny and merely keep the economic program. Yet it's worth stressing that socialism wasn't merely a political failure; it was also an economic failure.
Jay-Z received the GLAAD Special Recognition Award last year for his song and video for Smile, which featured his mother Gloria Carter, who is a lesbian. GLAAD said the rap icon is being honored because of his inclusion of LGBTQ artists in his work, from Janet Mock to James Baldwin, and for his support of marriage equality.
Warren said she looked around in the middle of that fight and realized all the money was on one side and all the hurting was on the other.
The Chinese Communist Party has for years expressed particular concern with Asia's most popular cultural export, Korean pop music, or K-pop. K-pop boy groups often feature men wearing make-up and elaborately styling their hair. Their music is rarely aggressive and their public images are carefully protected, meaning few have visible romantic relationships. K-pop artists are, however, required to serve in the Korean military, resulting in paparazzi photos of them without their typically manicured outfits and engaging in combat training. Korean is technically at war with North Korea and its ally China, making these images unfavorable to Beijing for political reasons.

Obergefell v. Hodges, which wiped out all existing state laws regarding the identity of marriage as consisting in the union of one man and one woman, was perhaps the most contested Supreme Court decision in U.S. history and one of the most egregious cases of radical judicial activism.

Many people in this country do not travel to other states for pleasure but are forced to travel there because of their job requirements. Should not someone be held responsible for the safety of these citizens? Who? Certainly not their company as their company is not responsible for their safety in their home state. Law enforcement? We see daily how well that works. No matter how good or how hard law enforcement works, they simply cannot be everywhere. No, it is the law-abiding citizen who is responsible for him/herself in their home state as these people are their own first-responder.

I believe that gender identity is a fraud perpetrated by psychiatry, the likes of something the United States and other nations hasn't experienced since the lobotomy era. As a result, I have returned to my male birth sex. On January 25, 2019, in the State of Florida, the Marion County Department of Motor Vehicles in Ocala, Florida issued me a male driver's license. Ocala, Florida has been my home since July 2018. In the days ahead, I will be taking further steps to restore my birth sex to male more formally. In my thirty plus year marriage, I am the husband. To my daughter, I am her Father. I no longer identify as a transgender or non-binary person and renounce all ties to transgenderism. I will not be a party to advancing harmful gender ideologies that are ruining lives, causing deaths and contributing to the sterilization and mutilation of gender-confused children. My history-making and landmark sex change to non-binary was a fraud based on the pseudoscience of gender identity. I am and have always been male. There should be no social or legal penalty for others to state that. In addition to supporting the President's ban on gender dysphoria in the military, I also support President Trump's policy of recognizing and enforcing that there are only two biological sexes, male and female.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.
In his Facebook post, Schwarzenegger appealed to his social media followers to continue the fight: Gerrymandering has completely broken our political system and I believe my best platform to help repair it is from the outside, by campaigning for independent redistricting commissions.

Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology's claim that people's legal sex is determined by their feeling of gender identity, not by biology.

Sanger also told Fox the deck is too stacked on Wikipedia for it to ever be salvaged and he has instead focused on helping facilitate the spread of alternative online encyclopedias through his Encyclosphere project. Those efforts are complicated by Big Tech's reliance on Wikipedia in their campaign against fake news online in keeping with messaging suggested to Wikipedia's owners by a public relations firm run by the Clinton Foundation's Head of Communications.

Maybe people in America think being a 'Sir' is a big deal, he said. But I think we should all be misters together. I think the 'Sir' thing slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery. And it also helps keep us 'quaint,' which I'm not a great fan of.

I think, if you look at President Trump, he has divided the country worst than it's ever been divided in its history — or at least certainly for — in the last 100 years. You know, my history, both as a mayor, and as a governor, as a businessperson was to bring people together and find solutions to vexing problems, he said. To — you know, we brought environmentalists together with the oil and gas industry for methane regulations, the equivalent of taking 320,000 cars off the road. We got expanded Medicaid.

Noting that neither article covers the most repressive and murderous acts of openly socialist or communist governments, Fox does note that an article exists on the topic of Mass killings under communist regimes. The mass killings article is notorious on Wikipedia as having at one point been under an unprecedented years-long indefinite page lock, which barred anyone without special administrative privileges from editing the page. Imposed back in 2011 to enforce a restriction requiring that all substantive edits receive consensus support, the page was eventually unlocked in 2018 with new looser restrictions imposed.

At reunification the per capita gross domestic product in socialist East Germany was just about one third of the capitalist West German level, with other measures of economic performance displaying a similar chasm. Even the poorest part of West Germany, Schleswig-Holstein, was two and a half times as wealthy as the richest East German region, Saxony. To this day, the eastern part of Germany gets nearly 15 percent of its gross domestic product in net transfers from the western part of Germany.

HARRIS FAULKNER: The president has been in a pretty public battle this week with a group of Never Trump Republicans after they released an attack ad on his COVID-19 response. Now the co-founder of that group, your husband George Conway, warning in an op-ed: Trump's narcissism deadens any ability he might otherwise have to carry out the duties of a president in a manner that the constitution requires. He's so self-obsessed, he can only act for himself and not for the nation. It's why he was impeached and why he should have been removed from office. And it's why he reacts with such rage. He fears the truth. He fears being revealed for what he truly is. Before I get your reaction on this, this is not about your husband, this not about your marriage. This is about that group. It just so happens that George Conway wrote that op-ed today. What is the response to this? Because this group now is getting a lot of light and lifting from the president tweeting about them.

Twitter has bowed to Islamic blasphemy laws and is now going after truth-tellers about Jihad and Sharia oppression. That is why Tommy Robinson and Shazia Hobbs are banned permanently from Twitter, it why Twitter suspends the accounts of people like ex-FBI agent John Guandolo and illustrator Bosch Fawstin. These are people who are simply trying to defend freedom as well as to protect Muslim and non-Muslim people from Jihad and Sharia. I have been suspended in this case because they are saying I violated their rules against hateful conduct. I have engaged in no hateful conduct whatsoever. I am a human rights activist fighting on behalf of Muslim women and girls who suffer under Sharia oppression. All that my two tweets in question did is refer to the verses in the Hadith and Qur'an that record Mohammed's marriage to Aisha when she was 6 years old and that sanction sex slavery. This is not me saying it. I am simply referring to Islamic texts that say it. For them to allege that Islamic texts are hateful is a grave insult to Muslims across the world. But this is the key: If a Muslim had referred to these same texts in support of child marriage and sex slavery, he would not be suspended. It is referring to these texts if you are against child marriage and sex slavery that constitutes the problem on Twitter. It is a sad day for free speech and for the effort to protect Muslim women and girls from oppression.

In general, the transgender ideology says the state should require every American to validate every person's choice of created gender identity, even though a man who wants to be a woman is still a man by every known scientific measure of evolutionary life.

They were always prepared to help deliver that, not just on a substantive point of view, but also in a kind of metaphorical way. So when they went out in public, they had a patina, more than a patina, of glamour about them, and she kept that up after we lost the President. At the [Reagan] Library, for example, she would be always introduced as the former First Lady of the United States. They had ruffles and flourishes played. The whole setting at the library, I think, is a real tribute to their personal tastes, but also to the place of the Presidency in our lives, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or a Tea Party member or whatever. You go in there and you have a sense of the majesty of the office, if you will, and I mean that in a pragmatic sense, not in the royal sense.

The reality of Iran's regime is that it brutally subjugates the will of its women, liberally imposing the death penalty on those who defy strict Islamic laws that have little cultural basis in pre-revolutionary Iran.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title. The Equality Act also states actions based on the belief in traditional marriage between a man and woman is discrimination against a married same-sex couple and relegates such faith beliefs to the status of a sex stereotype that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples. This language suggests faith-based adoption agencies that restrict adoptions to homes with a father and mother could be considered as discriminating against same-sex couples. A lawsuit alleging such discrimination would then have the weight of federal law behind it. Catholic League President Bill Donohue warned the Equality Act would promote the most comprehensive assault on Christianity ever written into law. Similarly, the U.S. Catholic Bishops' Conference asserted the legislation would discriminate against people of faith and punish faith-based organizations, such as charities and schools who serve everyone in their communities, simply because of their beliefs.

The vice president spoke at the Munich Security Conference in the days before his visit to Brussels as part of his first trip abroad since taking office. Last week, the conference chairman, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, called on Pence to affirm during his visit that the U.S. supports the EU and was not aiming to break up the organization, according to Reuters.
He added: But I also fail to see how any of it will matter without a planet to live on. We are approaching an irreversible tipping point. The science of climate change is backed by examples of the damage mankind has caused all around us, every day and everywhere. None of us are immune anymore; no matter where we live, no matter our political party.
As part of that agenda Chief Operating Officer of the Thomson Reuters Foundation Antonio Zappulla has suggested private and public sector leaders be encouraged to be more inclusive of LGBT staff.

Danmei, the gay fiction genre in question in the Times article, consists of more than consensual adult gay activity, however. Many of the stories, the New York Times reported in a 2014 story on the genre, involve abuse of men and father-son incest; though a high percentage of danmei authors are women, few of the characters created are. Some fantasies in question, the New York Times cites a scholar explaining, are meant to subconsciously subvert the state. The same year this profile surfaced, the Chinese government arrested over twenty women for participating in writing gay fiction online.
Bemoaning the failures of assimilation in Blackburn, for example, whose 30 per cent Muslim population is barely mixed with white Britons, Phillips turns to Anjum Anwar for advice.
If Trump has been making these payoffs going back more than a decade, if there is a pattern of Trump incurring these expenses to protect his reputation, marriage, and private life, then there is no way this is a campaign expense.
Argento fought to have the photographs pulled. Bourdain was mysteriously no longer following his girlfriend on Instagram. Argento then posted an Instagram story of herself in a Sid Vicious shirt that said Fuck Everyone, and captioned the image: You know who you are. Three hours later he killed himself. And she deleted the image off of her instagram story.
Singling out organisations who have been leading on that agenda for praise, Zappulla cited the British intelligence agency, MI5, as an example of the progress made over the last decade.
Studies and analyses have previously identified a left-wing bias on Wikipedia, including a Harvard study cited in Fox's report. However, corporate media have generally praised Wikipedia for its reliability in recent years and many have relied on it as a source to the point of copying from it extensively, while conservative media such as Fox News and Breitbart itself have been increasingly purged from the site. Wikipedia has also been found to shape scientific literature and business decisions.
Elliot Page came out as transgender in December but made no mention of the separation. I am trans, my pronouns are he/they and my name is Elliot, Page wrote on Instagram. I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life.
Rarely in history is there is a chance to actually compare social systems to see which one works better. One might compare the Plantagenet kings of England with the Tang Dynasty in China, but even if we line up the dates we are talking about two completely different societies: different people, different culture. Consequently, England's superiority and China's inferiority — or the other way round — can hardly be attributed to their rival systems of government, since so many other factors could be involved.
Catholic League President Bill Donohue, however, saw it differently and asked Friday who is actually guilty of inciting riots?

God assigns an identical moral value to every individual. God cares about all of us equally. So we are judged by what we do, not by how we were born. We really believe that. Most Americans really believe that.
Let's be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 25, 2020
It's not a secret that I prefer soccer, but you can't ignore your exciting achievement, he told them at his Jerusalem residence.
Throwing up on themselves is what town drunks do. If you keep watching them as they do it, maybe after a while, you are part of the problem. Maybe so. In any case, we flipped off CNN and decided to check out Joe Biden's speech for ourselves. And it was interesting, actually, both for what it said and for what it didn't say.
Cyrus went on to claim that her marriage is kind of New Age and that gender is meaningless because people don't fall in love with gender.
These rational splits over economic and self-government also helped Donald Trump grab a small but critical share of the Democrats' blue-collar votes in the 2016 election, including votes from African-Americans who oppose cheap-labor immigration. Similarly, a significant number of voters rejected the pro-transgender push by former President Barack Obama policies matched the preferences of the post-graduate class.
If someone is going to call you a racist, well, rather that than allow someone to be murdered, she said.
Following the 12-year-old's death, a public prosecutor ordered that her parents and the doctor be arrested, according to the Associated Press (AP).
However, the boycott had the opposite effect of the one intended, as fans flocked to buy tickets as a statement of solidarity with Prager and with the principle of free expression generally.
Anti-LGBTQ organizations have no place in government business and school-based discrimination against LGBTQ students must never be ignored or silenced, said GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis. Our children deserve to learn in a place that's inclusive and open to their needs, and that's at risk should an unqualified person run the Department of Education.
But perhaps the sex scandal will finally achieve what remorseless logic, hard evidence and falsified computer projections have failed to do.
For critics of 'Islamophobia,' it is often felt to be a word created by fascists, and used by cowards, to manipulate morons. A quotation often misattributed to the late, great Christopher Hitchens.
Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova from the Czech republic, the 10th seed, gets the tournament under way on the main Chatrier court at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Sunday against Danka Kovinic of Montenegro.

Beckwith added the legislation places mental health professionals in precarious ethical dilemmas because they would be forced to choose between violating the law and violating their ethical obligations for client treatment.
Doctrine is a word that I don't like very much, it brings with it the image of the hardness of stone, Abascal said. Instead the human reality is much more nuanced, it is never black or white, it is in continual development.
To be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a State must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether §20–18–401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go. The statute in ques- tion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Oberge- fell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders. In an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state supreme court agreed. And it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the Constitution. To the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this Court's prec- edents suggest just the opposite conclusion.
Durbin's Nation of Immigrants claim came during an NPR interview, where he talked about the Democrats' February 15 refusal to accept President Donald Trump's popular amnesty-and-reform offer — and the importance of the 2018 elections in deciding the immigration issue.
We lost a member of the Breitbart family last night, legendary actor-comedian Orson Bean — father-in-law of the late Andrew Breitbart. In his last interview with the celebrated actor, Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow said that the news company that Andrew built would not have been possible without Orson Bean. Below is an Associated Press wire on Bean's life and his iconic career.
Chinese authorities removed Korean entertainers from most available programming in the country in 2016, including with unsophisticated measures like blurring the Korean nationals out of Chinese programs. The move failed to end the popularity of the genre and the currently most successful band in the industry, BTS, remains extremely beloved by Chinese youth. The Communist Party, through outlets like the Global Times, have attempted to smear BTS, largely on the back of statements by a band member thanking the United States military for its support during the Korean War, but the campaign has failed.

Adopting the Istanbul Convention with its social gender definition would void the Hungarian constitutional position that there are only two biological genders, male and female, he explained.
Stone concluded, This isn't about me. It's about the president. They're coming for him. Anybody who doesn't see that is naive, and they want me out of the way because I will speak out against it. They want to silence me because I see the big picture.
In January 2019, Shupe released a public announcement in which he declared he had resumed his biological male sex designation.
Yet on Saturday evening, CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz reported that Chicago Police now believe that Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault, adding that the the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which owns and operates BYU, teaches that sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife. But that wasn't the end of the matter as a 2014 letter sent to church leaders from the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles noted, Just as those who promote same-sex marriage are entitled to civility, the same is true for those who oppose it. The Church insists on its leaders' and members' right to express and advocate religious convictions on marriage, family, and morality free from retaliation or retribution.
During Wednesday's episode of FNC's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson argued President Joe Biden's pleas for unity during his inauguration speech should be viewed with a degree of skepticism because the new president was not referring to every American.

We hope our citizens can come out to vote to exercise their rights and make Taiwan's democracy stronger, she told reporters after voting in the capital Taipei.
Examples such as these are good P.R., but they're also good for an organisation's bottom line, Zappulla argues.
He added, I think there was nothing loving about that situation. I think he was brutal mayor who basically had a reign of terror of black people in this country — in this city. To me, taking advice from Rudy Giuliani is like Kim Kardashian giving me marriage advice. It is ridiculous. It is ridiculous when you have a person who has set up some of the most heinous things that have happened to black people in this country, and to say something like that every time somebody says something about injustice, they are the terrorists. MLK would be considered a terrorist, Gandhi was a terrorist, Mandela was a terrorist. And all they were trying to do was fight for justice. And to me, when old white men tell black men how to act, that's the most ridiculous thing in the world. To tell black people to speak a certain way and to act a certain way is no different from telling a woman how to dress so she doesn't get raped.
Over the past few years, China's diplomatic offensives, military coercion, interference and infiltration have continued unabated. China's objective is clear: To force Taiwan to compromise our sovereignty. Democracy and authoritarianism cannot coexist within the same country. Hong Kong's people have shown us that 'One Country, Two Systems' is absolutely not viable, Tsai said in her New Year's Day address to the nation, neatly bottling up her campaign theme.
Leftists have long decried dark money in politics, but after the election of Trump, they have embraced watchdog groups as means to attack his administration.

In 1975, she left Harrisburg and entered local politics, running on a reform ticket for the Delaware County Council. This key county in eastern Pennsylvania then had a population of about 600,000. She won in an upset and subsequently served alternately as chairman and vice chairman until 1979. In 1978, she ran in the Republican primary for Lieutenant Governor and lost to the son of a popular former Pennsylvania governor.
Besides criminalizing homosexual meetings in public, gay clubs, and associations and organizations linked to the same-sex community with penalties up to 14 years in prison, the law also makes it illegal for gays to display any public show of affection, Nigeria's Pulse revealed.
The video was flagged in June 2018 in an internal listserv, Yes at Google, which is run by Google's human resources department, according to those communications and other internal documents, which a source shared with TheDCNF on the condition of anonymity. The listserv has more than 30,000 members and is devoted to policing microaggressions and micro-corrections within the company, according to its official internal description. The internal backlash to the video grew large enough to merit a response from a Google vice president, who said the video would no longer be eligible to run as an advertisement, the human resources team announced to the listserv.
In 2017, Vatican police raided the apartment of a 50-year-old priest, breaking up what Italian media described as a gay orgy fueled by drugs and alcohol. Police arrested Msgr. Luigi Capozzi, assistant to Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, and sent him to a Roman clinic for drug detox.
Staats, who is identified as a left-wing activist, was said to be in an open marriage, The Telegraph claimed.

FGM, a practice most popular among certain parts of the Muslim world, had not been well-known before recently in the United States. The practice involves cutting a pre-pubescent girl's genitals in a ritual designed to make her clean before her eventual marriage. There are differing forms of mutilation, some more extreme than others, but all involve the removal of varying amounts of a young girl's clitoris, labia majoria, and labia minora. The most extreme form of FGM is called infibulation, in which virtually all external genitalia is removed and the wound is sewn together, leaving only a single tiny hole from which to urinate and menstruate until the girl is married.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll of 6,426 people found that 16 percent had stopped talking to a family member or friend because of the election, while 30 percent said they ended a relationship entirely.

BBC Panorama's investigation [into Robinson] will continue, they declared.
The non-denominational Christian charity claimed that it had forced Warwickshire County Council in England to withdraw an 'All About Me' sex and relationships education programme, rolled out in some 200 primary schools, in March, because it encouraged masturbation and included 'gratuitously graphic' sexual images yet made no reference to marriage.
Oh, and we're also allowing ourselves to be locked down and shoved in masks without much complaint or any real proof it makes any real difference.
There is no such thing as binary sexuality, when you're male or female. I don't believe that at all.
The revelation comes at the same time a leader of the terrorist group Hezbollah has denounced the West for opposing child marriage and urged Muslims to spread it to the West.
Any sober assessment of the facts would indicate that too many Americans are going to college. As a result, college costs—and debt—have skyrocketed while the rewards for college have plunged.
In one of his final roles, as the gruff Scotsman Kincade in Skyfall, he shared significant screen time with Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M, turning the film's final scenes into a master class of character acting.

Countless American believers in the Bible, myself included, were inspired tremendously on Monday when President Trump stood in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, and held up the Word of God for all to see.
Allowing men to compete against women in sports. … is demoralizing because it makes [women's] talent irrelevant. … Never before in American history has a political party tried so dramatically to rewrite the federal civil rights laws to include an undefined, self-referential ideological term called gender identity in the U.S. code, applicable to literally any entity that receives federal assistance, including elementary schools, colleges, and healthcare centers.
Similar to the Global Times' attempts to defend the Chinese concentration camps, the Foreign Ministry insisted Thursday that the Communist Party — responsible for the deaths of 45 million people during the Great Leap Forward alone — had a long history of respecting human rights. Spokesman Wang Wenbin urged reporters to watch a Chinese propaganda showcase called Xinjiang Is a Wonderful Land that allegedly discredited the BBC report.
Moreover, the authors insist, while the WCC was busy doubling down on Israel, there was little or no criticisms of the truly brutal regimes in Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, China, and Iran.

When China announced that it was abandoning its draconian one-child policy in 2015, the claim was met with skepticism among critics, who contended that the move substantially changed nothing, since the communist government still asserts absolute control over families and will continue to enforce its will with coercion.

I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world, including some of the folks who aren't friendly to us. And it was working, former Vice President Joe Biden claimed, falsely. It was working. It was being held tightly.

Comey also describes numerous other conversations with Trump in which the president complained about the dossier allegations.
But the data raises questions about whether the immigration system may be enabling forced marriage and about how U.S. laws may be compounding the problem despite efforts to limit child and forced marriage. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the United States, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.
Last year, Bishop Thomas John Paprocki of Springfield barred Senator Dick Durbin from receiving Holy Communion in his home diocese because of his overt support for abortion legislation.
In mid-March this year, when the UK government – and also, to an extent, the Trump administration – were jolted into lockdown by Neil Ferguson's shock report, they did at least have the excuse that Ferguson's projections might be plausible.

Mr. Khanna: The criminal charge against you then states that executive one forwarded your invoice to someone referred to as executive two, presumably Donald Trump Jr., who's signing this check as executive two, correct?

Some provincial-level Chinese population planning rules continue to explicitly instruct officials to carry out abortions, often referred to as 'remedial measures' for 'out-of-plan' [illegal] pregnancies, with some provinces urging functionaries to use all means necessary in enforcing the regulations.

The ABA is a leftwing organization that Democrats hail as the gold standard for evaluating judicial nominees.

Johnny's team has forced Amber to give a statement to the LAPD to set the record straight as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media, Heard's attorney added. Amber has suffered through years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Johnny. In domestic violence cases, it is not unusual for the perpetrator's playbook to include miscasting the victim as the villain.
When a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples 'the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage' … we reverse the state court's judgment.

Hollywood's modern-day Production Code would never allow Chase to explore the poison of this mindless tribalism through a protected class (blacks, gays, etc.), so he gives us a wealthy Italian family (and Family) as the ultimate example of the self-destructive madness found in those who use something as hollow as race and creed to have it both ways — to wallow in the false sense of superiority that comes with seeing yourself as persecuted.

For years, the SPLC — once a widely-respected civil rights organization — has smeared conservative organizations that it falsely designated as hate groups merely for holding mainstream views that differ with those of the radical left. In 2012, a crazed leftist used the SPLC's hate map in an attempted mass shooting at the Family Research Council (FRC) in Washington, DC; the FRC was on the list merely because it supports traditional marriage.

Today, unless you live in a particular state that has signed reciprocity agreements with other states, your right to defend yourself and/or your family may end at the state line. Let that sink in. When you cross a state line, you may lose your right to self-protection. States such as California, Delaware, and New York offer no reciprocity with any other state, leaving all nonresidents defenseless as soon as they cross over that imaginary state line. No other right is treated with such disdain.

By the end of that first season I was hooked … and still am. Just last month, and for the fourth time since 2007, I binged the entire series, all 86 episodes in a few fevered weeks. What a pleasure it is to get lost again in that world, what a joy to revisit those magnificent characters and pick up on a million things I missed in previous viewings. Like a great novel, The Sopranos improves with each viewing, becomes richer, a wondrous buried treasure you never stop uncovering…

Anti-LGBTQ organizations have no place in government business and school-based discrimination against LGBTQ students must never be ignored or silenced, said GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis. Our children deserve to learn in a place that's inclusive and open to their needs, and that's at risk should an unqualified person run the Department of Education.
The threats come soon after authorities arrested four members of the organization, including his girlfriend, Karina. Officials seized two explosive devices from Karina and her associate.

You know, Matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. And Matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, I fed you. When you were naked, I provided you with clothing. When you were an immigrant, I welcomed you. I think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from Donald Trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.
The W.H.O. pushed China's misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable, and there was no need for travel bans, Trump said.
Some news from the senior judges did seem connected to Biden winning the election:
Stone went on, Matthew Whitaker seems to me to be a good man. He's got authority to act, right now. He has an out of control federal prosecutor who he could limit to Russian collusion based on previous legal decisions, but he doesn't seem to do so.
Pop singer Miley Cyrus claims she is a new age queer who is redefining relationships and making gender irrelevant with her hetero marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth.
Murphy's confirmation marks the passing of a baton, as he takes the seat being vacated by Judge Batchelder, who has been one of the originalist champions on the federal bench for 27 years. President Ronald Reagan appointed Batchelder to the federal district bench in Ohio in 1985, and Bush 41 elevated her to the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit in 1991.
The urgency is so severe. But instead, we have a media that's barely talking about it, the Juno star ranted. We have a media that says it's a debate that whether or not what happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It's absurd. It's not a fucking debate.

For two seasons we've been laughing at Little Carmine, his weakness, his vanity, his hilarious malapropisms. And then, in this wonderfully surprising and touching scene (starts at 1:35), we discover the dimwit is the wisest character of them all, Tony's Happy Wanderer, the one who figured out that the bullshit is bullshit and the only thing that matters in life, the only thing that fulfills, is family, is in the honoring of those seemingly humdrum rituals shared with the woman you love.
In public school they are now teaching that Boys can be girls and girls can be boys. They teach about oral and anal sex , they indoctrinate children with the agendas they choose.

Indeed, in the annals of raunchy tabloid items, the Enquirer stories of the Amazon tycoon and his love life—adultery! texts! pictures! divorce! billions!—seemed to have everything that a scandal-lover could hope for. Even Donald Trump, no stranger to tab news, jumped in, zinging Bezos, owner of the Washington Post—which is not, of course, the president's favorite newspaper.

This idea of fluid gender is in contrast to science-backed view that men and women are born into unchangeably male or female bodies, and that society should help boys and girls, men and women, get the best from their bodies by allowing them sexual privacy and sex-specific facilities and sport leagues. This view also argues that people should create civic rules to help cooperation between the two complementary but different, equal and unchangeable sexes. The most important cooperation, for example, is civic support for marriage and childrearing.
New York Post author Salena Zito postulated that Donald Trump's presidential campaign was one of the first times our political elite deigned to notice the devastation in post-industrial America and promise to do something about it. Those communities are usually dismissed in a way the inner cities are not. Their residents have been told to suck it up and accept their diminished prospects as the price of prosperity for diverse others. They're told to think of themselves as privileged simply because of their skin color, and that means they aren't permitted to complain about government policies or cultural trends that put them at a disadvantage.
Thanks … Chasten, my love…I'm pretty fond of him too, for giving me the strength to do this and the grounding to be myself as we go, he said.

After all, it would certainly elevate Bezos if he could turn his peccadillo into a major case against the Vast Trump Conspiracy. That is, liberals everywhere would love it, and soon enough if the Bezos People play it right, over time, it might seem as if the whole mess was Trump's doing, thus easing the stain on Bezos.

As a practicing Catholic, this is something I see way too often: a morally crippled institution more concerned with keeping the customers happy than reminding them hell exists.
What's happening to these children and the President's antipathy toward immigrants speak to me personally. I came to this country when I was 7 years old with my mom and older brother. Mom was escaping an abusive marriage to start a new life for us. Mom worked at low paying jobs for long hours. My 9-year-old brother and I were latchkey kids. We waited at the bus stop every night for mom to come home from work.
Islam kills women not only physically – although of course it does – but it kills the spirit of far greater numbers. From birth, girls are degraded and humiliated, most often by their own mothers.

The Special Warfare Center and School has a responsibility to ensure each soldier attending training is prepared to meet the needs of the nation now, and in the future. This includes ensuring professional instruction, consistently strenuous mental and physical standards, inclusive training, and upholding the expectation that cadre and candidates demonstrate the Army Special Operations attributes at all times.
The two agents said they would share the information with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the US Department of Education, but did not commit to opening an investigation into the firebrand lawmaker, the source said.

Congresswoman Omar's office did not respond to request for comment but she has repeatedly denied the allegations — calling them disgusting lies.
Yet Virgil is sure we'll be hearing a lot more about this case; one way or another, Team Bezos will make sure of that.

Chinese state media have been advocating for the Communist Party to implement programs that not just repeal limitations on having children, but actively incentivize couples to do so given the dire state of the country's birth rate. The latest available data show that 14.65 million babies were born in China in 2019, a record-low in this century and a number last documented in China in 1961, at the height of Mao-era persecution and poverty. A scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Yi Fuxian, called that number seriously overestimated and claimed the true number of births that year was closer to 10 million.
Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin-Abdullah al-Sheikh, Saudi Arabia's top Islamic cleric, defended the kingdom's ban on female drivers by alleging that women will be exposed to new evils behind the wheel.

As it happens I am well aware of the vulnerabilities of what I tweeted. I should never have written it and fallen into the Twitter trap.

As a result, Bishop de Metz-Noblat said he had worked with two other commissions to produce a new baptismal registry formula that will require names and first names of parents or other holders of parental authority, which he wrote would make the simple acknowledgment of one's family situation, without bearing moral judgment on it.

It's true. Lots of what happens in UKIP could not have occurred without many of the behind the scenes forces, the local councillors, the activists, and back office staff.

Make no mistake, if the Equality Act becomes law, children in every public school in America will be sold on a cult concept of the human person—that who we are is self-defined by feelings, regardless of biological sex. Female students will be forced into silence—or required to celebrate—when yesterday's male classmate announces he identifies as a girl and demands to shower in the girls' locker room, compete against her in sports, and claim for himself the hard-won rights of women.

Asked whether the words of Jesus, then, have an absolute value, Abascal replied:
Discrimination based on sexual orientation includes discrimination based on an individual's actual or perceived romantic, emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to other persons, or lack thereof, on the basis of gender. LGBTQ people, including gender nonbinary people, also commonly experience discrimination because of sex-based stereotypes. Many people are subjected to discrimination because of others' perceptions or beliefs regarding their sexual orientation. Even if these perceptions are incorrect, the identity imputed by others forms the basis of discrimination.

In March 2015, the Superior Court ruled that the UC Board of Regents policies themselves (and not the state statutes) are the state laws that affirmatively provide the benefits to UC students in satisfaction of federal law and dismissed the lawsuit. In November 2015, Judicial Watch filed its opening appellate brief with the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, arguing that the trial court wrongly read extra words into Congress' statute. Specifically, the brief argues that the federal statute in question does not say 'state law or administrative rule, regulation or policy.' It says 'State law.' This means an enactment of the state legislature.
You need to go back all the way to the 1970s. We don't think necessarily the [decline in] material welfare is the direct cause [of the deaths], but [it is the] lack of a stable job, a good job. It brings a loss of community, of marriage. of meaning and status in life, and we think it is those effects that … help us to better understand why these [economic changes] might lead to long term deaths from these causes.

Enrique Marquez, a convert to Islam and friend of the terrorist, has been indicted, not only as the straw purchaser of two weapons used in the Dec. 2 terror attacks, and for conspiring to commit maximum-casualty terror attacks just a couple years earlier, but also for a sham marriage to the sister of Syed Raheel Farook's wife. Both brides immigrated to the U.S. from Russia.

In measuring Sessions' performance in office to date, it is important to remember two things: 1) the political climate he faced within the Department of Justice upon accepting President Trump's offer to serve, and 2) that Sessions is currently constrained by the fact that he is compelled to wait for the inspector general to complete his ongoing internal review.
Common sense Americans see these allegations for how fantastically stupid they are.
Scioli, the former governor of Buenos Aires province, had been expected to win by 10 or more points in last month's six-candidate, first round of voting. His failure to do so set up Sunday's runoff vote with Macri.
Hefner's case has been referred to the Senate Ethics Committee. The probe will focus on Rosenberg's knowledge of Hefner's behavior and if Hefner actually had influence on key decisions in the Senate because of his marriage to Rosenberg.
The recent experience I had with Sephora and what they did to me is not OK, she said. I am beyond disappointed and I will no longer be supporting Sephora. She said she has never committed acts of violence or condoned them, and that she is neither a white supremacist or homophobic.
Although she is handing off her seat to Murphy, Batchelder will continue hearing cases on a part-time time basis instead of retiring, continuing with Jones to set the pace for dozens of new Trump-appointed constitutional conservatives.
8:15 PM: Biden says this is not about co-pays and Sanders says there are various loopholes that will still make Americans pay for treatments. Sanders says we need a simple system that exists in countries like Canada–if you are an American, you get the health care that you need. Sanders wonders if we have the guts to take on the health care/pharmaceutical industries that are funding Biden's campaign.
Harkness continued, a lot of these injustices are actually occurring in Muslim countries and they don't want to being attention to it. One of the founders of the women's march is Muslim. Why aren't we hearing from her on International Women's day about this issue?

The March for Marriage was first held in 2013 as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA. This year's March on June 25 is timed with the Supreme Court's decision in the Obergefell matter last year.
Pastor Paul Song, who has 20 years' experience rehabilitating inmates, told the Sunday Express: If someone is secular and in prison and they want to lead a peaceful life in prison they need to become Muslim. That way they are protected.
Socialism has proved to be a living hell pretty much everywhere it has been tried. It has been tried pretty much all over the world. Let's not forget that within about a century since Marx wrote, and less than half a century since the Bolshevik Revolution, some 60 percent of the world's people were living under governments that embraced some form of socialism. At once time, Josh Muravchik writes, it was the most popular political idea ever invented, arguably the most popular idea of any kind about how life should be lived or society organized.
In April, a man was sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia, which borders the United Arab Emirates, on charges of atheism and blasphemy, and in June, Turkey banned an LGBT pride parade in Istanbul.

The California State Legislature passed statutes granting such tuition benefits to California State University students and California Community College students, but it was forbidden to do so for University of California students. Under the California Constitution, the UC Board of Regents is entirely independent of the state legislature in policy matters, so there is no lawful way for the California legislature to allow or require the University of California to provide public benefits to illegal aliens.
In 2005, Neil Ferguson told the Guardian that up to 200 million people could die from bird flu. Around 40 million people died in 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, he explained. There are six times more people on the planet now so you could scale it up to around 200 million people probably. The final death toll from avian flu strain A/H5N1 was 440. (That's 440 people, not 440 million.)
This changed radically under Pope Francis, the article declared.

Too often, politicians at every level will ignore the clear language of a law if it does not let them do as they wish. This was evident on two fronts last week: in California and here in the District of Columbia.
Isis [has] executed 19 women in the city of Mosul during the past two days, declared Mamuzini. The penalty decision came on the background of the refusal to participate in the practice of sexual jihad.
My kids love the footy and I want to take my boys to watch the footy and I don't want the betting ads jammed down their throat, he told Sydney radio 2GB.
Metal detectors and sniffer dogs will patrol the gates while there will be pat-downs and bag searches.
Did President Trump have the right to hold a Bible aloft in front of a church? You bet he did.
The decision to convene such a large-scale political event in the nation's capital is a sign of confidence and a signal that China is ready to take a step toward a return to normal, the People's Daily declared.
Yet it was within the corridors of the European Union (EU) where a fixation with spurious 'Islamophobia' eventually reached its most absurd crescendo, even as every news cycle became dominated by terrorism caused by a hatred for non-Muslims instead.
Myth 5: The Equality Act Is Good for Women and Upholds Title IX of the Education Amendments Act, Which Prohibits Sex Discrimination Against Girls and Women
Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby has kept mostly mum about expansion plans but has said there is an open mindedness about the idea. However, hinting that there is at least some contentiousness about it all, the Commish also noted, If it was a clear path, it wouldn't have taken so long.
McAdams says that Lovell's attack on one of his own tenured professors is a strong statement that you are the one who lacks commitment to the University values you accuse me of violating.
How could such a reversal happen in so short a time span? For nearly 70 years, the Republican Party had enjoyed near-monopoly support from black voters. After all, the first Republican President was Abraham Lincoln, who was responsible for freeing the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But, much like the Democrats today, the Republican Party of that era took the black vote for granted. The Republicans thought, How could a black American not vote for the candidate of the Party of Abraham Lincoln? Or, as a Democrat might say it today, How could an African American not vote for the party whose president signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965?
There are however, several voices of dissent within the country, particularly from more liberal women. Writing in the Al-Jazirah daily, Saudi journalist Samar Al-Muqrin said polygamy as a solution to the proliferation of singlehood reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the institution of marriage.

The recorded footage appears to show Sweeney making what Robinson describes as racist remarks about Asian drivers and using the slur honky — which Sweeney says were taken out of context.
In the Fox piece by Maxim Lott, Wikipedia is noted as having received less scrutiny than the other Big Tech firms. However, the piece further notes these tech firms, such as Google, also rely heavily on the site and Wikipedia itself is one of the most popular sites globally. The report follows this by reporting: critics – including Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger – tell Fox News that many Wikipedia pages have become merely left-wing advocacy essays.
We see the connection between socialism and slavery in all the important works on socialism. Friedrich Hayek's critique of socialism is appropriately titled The Road to Serfdom. George Orwell depicted the tyrannical dimension of socialism in his two immortal novels Animal Farm and 1984. Using both the techniques of fiction and nonfiction, Alexander Solzhenitsyn in a series of works — The Gulag Archipelago, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich — depicted Soviet socialism as a vast network of slave camps stretching from Europe to the farthest reaches of Asia.

He made the remarks during his tenure at MSNBC (2005-2008) and his tenure at Fox (2009-present).
GORSUCH: Senator, I need to — it sounds like you're asking me about a case for a controversy. And I — with all respect, when we come to cases in controversies, a good judge will listen.
Meghan Markle's departure from the UK has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with her insistence on acting like a spoilt, unaccountable Hollywood princess in a country that takes a dim view of spoilt, unaccountable Hollywood princesses.
O'Rourke, who in January launched a five-state road trip across the Southwest, found himself eating dirt told to possess regenerative powers during one stop in New Mexico, according to the Washington Post.

This was not Prime Minister Orbán's first salvo against gender ideology, with the Hungarian government having already taken steps to defund gender studies and related courses at universities.
Black Britons know why Meghan Markle wants out, is the headline.
This is very different to male circumcision. With male circumcision there is no intention to attenuate sexual desire, control sexuality or enforce chastity.
The tweets that resulted in Glazov's temporary suspension related to Sahih Bukhari's texts discussing Mohammed's marriage to Aisha when she was six years old and a quote posted by Glazov from the Quranic Suras that mandates the Hijab for women and sanctions sexual slavery. These direct quotes from Islamic religious texts were apparently enough to result in Glazov's account being locked until he deleted the offending tweets.
Last year the Wikimedia Foundation announced that it was imposing the code of conduct on Wikipedia and other Foundation-owned sites because it wanted them to be welcoming, inclusive, harassment-free spaces in which people can contribute productively and debate constructively. Months later, a committee responsible for writing the code of conduct that was staffed with radical leftists submitted their draft for public comment from members of Foundation-owned sites. In the draft, several provisions advanced left-wing identity politics stances, including required use of preferred pronouns and other provisions criticized as threatening free speech.
My legal team has asked @Sephora for more information as to why they are ceasing the relationship. I am disappointed that a brand that claims to be inclusive seems to be excluding conservative voices, she tweeted.
We are hopeful that this commitment will translate into immediate relief for our clients, Donald and Ellen Vander Boon, who are facing ongoing censorship of their religious speech at the hands of USDA officials. It is a grave injustice when the government forces Americans like the Vander Boons to choose between running a business and expressing their religious beliefs. Secretary Perdue can act now to correct this injustice for the Vander Boons and Americans like them who work with the USDA, and we hope that he will.

The Pope's words Wednesday seemed to echo the thought of Saint Paul, who wrote in his letter to Christians in Rome: Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God—what is good and acceptable and perfect.
According to a report by The College Fix, an act of viewpoint discrimination by Georgia Tech's student government has posed a substantial barrier to an attempt by a group of pro-life students to host Dr. Alveda King on campus.
Research suggests that women are also likely to earn less due to women being more likely to either move or stay in a certain area due to the greater importance the couple places on the husband's job. Sari Kerr, an economist at Wellesley College, argues that because the spouse who earns is likely to do more of the household work, the gender pay gap is self-reinforcing.

Part of the change was to involve a move to North America, according to their announcent. This was initially interpreted as a reference to Canada, where Elizabeth II is still Queen and Harry still a senior royal, as Meghan has already travelled there with the couple's son.
I applaud Congressman David Cicilline [D-RI] and the entire Congressional Equality Caucus for introducing the Equality Act in the House of Representatives yesterday, and I urge Congress to swiftly pass this historic legislation. Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, and this bill represents a critical step toward ensuring that America lives up to our foundational values of equality and freedom for all. Full equality has been denied to LGBTQ+ Americans and their families for far too long. Despite the extraordinary progress the LGBTQ+ community has made to secure their basic civil rights, discrimination is still rampant in many areas of our society. The Equality Act provides long overdue federal civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, locking in critical safeguards in our housing, education, public services, and lending systems — and codifying the courage and resilience of the LGBTQ+ movement into enduring law.
Needless to say, the Post has always been in the bag for its owner—typical headline: Jeff Bezos stands his ground. (And all the others are just as puffy.) Yet other media outlets, too, are giving Bezos the hero treatment. Here's CNN's Brian Stelter:

These women are victims of the most atrocious abuse of power that you can imagine, she said. In Eastern Congo, she said more than 200,000 women and children were raped during periods of conflict.
Now, you might say, there's no way Democrats will abolish the police; this will only make life infinitely worse for the people who live in Democrat-run cities, which is where a bulk of the black population live.
Children in foster care could likely be affected by the Equality Act as well.
And yet Buttigieg cannot help himself. Like many other Democrats, he disdains religion in the public sphere until he can use it to bludgeon his opponents, adopting the self-righteous posture towards other Christians that he accuses them of taking toward the LGBT community.

The proposal follows years of panic at the highest levels of the Communist Party over China's declining birth rate, which has continued to plummet despite dictator Xi Jinping easing the repressive one-child policy that governed Chinese families in 2015. The Mao-era one-child policy made it illegal for a woman to have more than one child, resulting in mass forced abortions, sterilizations, and infanticides.

Before the nation became engulfed in violence sparked in part by the death of George Floyd and in large measure by unrelated agendas of violent agitators, the president had planned to sign an executive order on international religious freedom at the John Paul II Center.
Bezos was channeling The Godfather, in which an offer you can't refuse means you wake up with a butchered horse head in your bed. That Bezos mocked this and trumped it, even while acknowledging that others might be forced to knuckle under, was a raw demonstration of the rarefied leverage and power Amazon enjoys at the tippy top of our society.

Couples seem to be struggling with quarantine life in other parts of the world as well. In China and Russia, divorce rates have reportedly increased during coronavirus lockdowns, according to Japan Times. Still, the use of the term corona divorce in Japan seems particularly Japanese given some historical context. The phrase Narita divorce was coined in the 1980s in Japan to describe newlywed couples returning to Tokyo's Narita Airport after their honeymoon, where they would often decide to separate after realizing they had nothing in common, according to SCMP.
Small said of Markle joining the Royal Family: Will this bridge the gap? We don't know. But one thing we know is these two boys are real. Harry and William. They are real. They go to the West Indies.

UPDATE: The candidate, Colonel Bob Starr, finally responded to questions about his advocacy for LGBT rights. He spoke with a local Abilene affiliate and stated that he felt the term activist was a misrepresentation of his views.

Experts argue that the most efficient way to reduce the wage gap would be to encourage employers to put less emphasis on asking their employees to work long hours and to allow them to work remotely.

Similarly, two years ago, it declared that women caught not wearing hijab in public would not go directly to prison, but be matriculated into Islamic values classes to be guilted about showing their hair. The policy applied only to first-time offenders, of course; women who repeatedly rejected the Islamic headscarf could face criminal prosecution.
However, the authorities have yet to bring a single successful prosecution for the practice since it was criminalised more than 30 years ago, with the police making a number of dubious statements with respect to the crime being nuanced and arrests unlikely to benefit [the] child — generating significant public backlash, but no observable changes.

First came President Obama warning us that we'd be banished like naughty boys to the back of something called the queue; then came all the other bigwigs from the IMF's Christine Lagarde and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, all variously confirming with the expertise and authority of their office that no actually it would be worse than that: markets would crash, property prices would plummet, businesses would hurry to relocate, the pound would become as worthless as the Zimbabwean dollar, men would say openly that Christ and his saints slept etc. Oh, and also, of course, World War III would break out.

Slavery in its classic form has been abolished worldwide, although enslavement in other forms — sex trafficking for instance—continues as a gruesome relic of this barbaric practice. Even so, no serious person today could advocate the return of slavery! How ridiculous it would be to hear someone say, The failures of slavery were all failures of implementation. This time we're really gonna make it work!
Today Americans live under two constitutions: the political constitution and the corporate constitution. The political constitution is functioning reasonably well. The corporate constitution, by comparison, is a lawless realm of out-of-control tyranny. … Of graver concern in a democratic republic should be arbitrary powers exercised by [giant] companies in the real economy against dissident individuals or unpopular businesses or organizations. If businesses are banned from advertising their goods and services on electronic platforms and other forms of media; if authors of controversial books can be banned from online and physical book distributors; if political groups are banned from making electronic transactions, or having bank accounts; if individuals who hold the wrong opinions can be denied health insurance; if lenders deny credit cards to people who voted the wrong way in the last election or said something inflammatory on social media, then the United States is now a tyranny, even if the courts are open and elections are free. … The remedies for arbitrary corporate power in the new infrastructure industries, then, are simple and straightforward. Define online opinion and video platforms as regular publishers, subject to traditional publishing regulations that seek to deter dissemination of libels, profanity, obscenity, intellectual property theft, and so on. And define all the other big tech firms either as common carriers or public accommodations that are clothed in a public interest.

Once again he is cynically attacking a straw man, pretending to defend himself in a fight he started, but that is the least of it. Read his quote again because what we have here is a man strutting around playing the Perfect Christian as he publicly blames God for his sin… Forget about the insufferable self-regard, the self-righteous moralizing — which is beyond creepy and off-putting (and likely explains his stall in the polls) — Buttigieg is living his life in defiance of God and blaming God for that defiance.

The Trump angle seemed possibly pertinent, because he and the Post had long been at odds over the Post's caustic coverage of him. And the Saudi angle seemed relevant because the year before, in 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi-born columnist for Bezos's Post—or, as wiseguys call it, the Bezos Post—was apparently murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.

But where was Principled and Outspoken Jeb when this hit the airwaves…?
My own view is that the only Democrat who will beat Trump next year will campaign for control of immigration, legal and undocumented, in a sane and humane way. The issue will be dominant again — because of a huge wave of migrants, many of them rural Guatemalans, who are overwhelming the border, trying to enter the U.S. at a current pace of 100,000 a month. Their ability to claim asylum under current law permits them to show up at the border, get admitted and processed by the Border Patrol, and then released into the interior, to reside here until a court date, which could come up years later. The backlog in the underfunded immigration courts is vast, with more than a million still in line for a hearing. Many of the migrants won't show up for the court date; those who do can still resist deportation indefinitely. What this means is that the U.S. now has an effectively open border with Mexico, and, according to the American Bar Association, the immigration system is irredeemably dysfunctional and on the brink of collapse. Repeating the Democratic mantra that there is no border crisis will not work for much longer. This year will see more undocumented immigrants than in any year under Obama. And the high rate of success among those trying to enter to the country now encourages more migrants to make the journey, especially given the forces of disorder and climate change that are forcing people to flee.
Perhaps the major reason that the White Death has been so baffling for the experts is that they can't believe that their benevolent government programs are playing a central role in this national catastrophe.

Perhaps ringing the bell on these potential lines of attack, Warren told Anderson Cooper at a town hall event this week that she became a Democrat in the 1990s when she realized that while all of the Republicans were for the big banks, only half of the Democrats were for big corporations and bankers. Warren said she had been working over and over and over on what's happening to America's working families, to America's middle class, how it is that people who work hard, who play by the rules are just finding the path steeper and rockier year by year, and for people of color even steeper and even rockier.

Naqshbandi said that parents who denied inheritance to their transgender sons or daughters were inviting the wrath of God.
In general, the transgender ideology says a person's sex is determined by their gender identity, not their biology. The ideology also insists that men and women are more or less identical, and it objects to the public's view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal. The transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing transgender rights laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that women and girls are different — and have different priorities — than men and boys.
Yet in the real world, the political collapse of socialism was brought about by its economic failure. This was certainly true in the Soviet Union, where Gorbachev's rescue efforts — glasnost and perestroika — failed spectacularly, first bringing down the Soviet empire, then the Communist ruling party, and finally the socialist system itself. China, too, abandoned socialism for its economic shortcomings. And look how poorly socialism is faring in Zimbabwe, Cuba and Venezuela today. So how can one adopt socialist ideas once again without considering the economic track record of socialist regimes?

They had more than their share of globe-trotting, scene-making and controversy-stirring moments however, from a trip to Jerusalem for North's baptism, to fashion weeks around the world including one in Paris where Kardashian was bound and robbed, to West's years-long feud with Taylor Swift, which Kardashian got sucked into.

In addition to citing similar whitewashing on Wikipedia's communism article, Fox interviewed co-founder Sanger about political bias on the site. He told Fox News, The days of Wikipedia's robust commitment to neutrality are long gone. Sanger further stated: Wikipedia's ideological and religious bias is real and troubling, particularly in a resource that continues to be treated by many as an unbiased reference work. Last year, Sanger published a blog post on Wikipedia's left-wing bias where he analyzed other political articles, such as the pages on Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. In the post, he declared the site's neutrality policy dead on the basis of its left-wing political bias.
And then the woman he took this career-killing risk for was photographed screwing around in public with a guy half Bourdain's age. And even if there was an open relationship, these things are done discretely to save the woman from humiliation and the man from emasculation.
Here we go again – an irrelevant late-night talk show host mocking the First Lady, when her main focus is serving the American people, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a comment to the Daily Caller. His comments were disgraceful, and certainly not original, but that doesn't seem to matter when you're hurting for ratings.
The Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran campaign against the holiday is unique in that the group advocates against any romantic dating all year round. Instead, the group's leaders urge young people to remain single and immediately marry someone if they are interested in a relationship, with no period of dating prior to marriage in which the two would get to know each other. A profile published by PRI last year described the group as a movement to eliminate premarital dating, derided as a sinful, Western ritual that will ruin your life. These young Muslims instead want to push their island nation, long branded as religiously moderate, toward practices that more closely resemble norms in, say, Saudi Arabia.

The media are not at all interested in the fact Biden is engaging in a cover up of his Senate papers, the very papers where an eighth piece of corroboration might be found — the sexual harassment complaint Reade says she filed against Biden, the complaint that she says got her fired from his Senate office.
These crimes are indeed the most horrific, but the crises in the United States and Chile that have largely precipitated the upcoming summit have to do with abuses committed against young adults, including seminarians, not only against minors, Viganò said. Almost nothing has been said about sexual misconduct with adults, which is itself a grave abuse of pastoral authority, whether or not the relationship was 'consensual.'
Too often, politicians at every level will ignore the clear language of a law if it does not let them do as they wish. This was evident on two fronts last week: in California and here in the District of Columbia.
Am I still frightened? Absolutely, Fraser said. Do I feel like I need to say something? Absolutely. Have I wanted to many, many times? Absolutely. Have I stopped myself? Absolutely. And maybe I am over-reacting in terms of what the instance was. I just know what my truth is. And it's what I just spoke to you.
Also in 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the formation of a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in the HHS Office for Civil Rights. President Trump created the office to protect the conscience rights of health-care workers whose religious beliefs do not allow them to take part in abortion or assisted suicide.
But the data raises questions about whether the immigration system may be enabling forced marriage and about how U.S. laws may be compounding the problem despite efforts to limit child and forced marriage. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the United States, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.
In one exchange, Ayoub reportedly told Glazov that Allah will defeat you, Glazov replied; Allah will defeat us? I thought Islam was a religion of peace?

I cannot see how this can be allowed when the specific idea of LGBT videos is to allow the creators to feel free to share their content and be comfortable that anti-LGBT advertisers would not be attached to their content, the employee wrote. This seems very counter to our mission, specifically around PRIDE 2018 timeframe. Google's vice president for product management and ads, Vishal Sharma, agreed that the video was too offensive to air as an advertisement. Thank you for raising this very important issue. It means a lot to me personally and those of us working on this across the Ads and YouTube teams. YouTube is an open platform and we support the free expression of creators with a wide range of views, Sharma wrote in his response, which was included in the listserv. But we don't allow advertising that disparages people based on who they are – including their sexual orientation – and we remove ads that violate this basic principle, Sharma continued. After careful and multiple reviews over the course of a few days, our teams decided to remove the ad in question here as it violates our policy. We've communicated this to the advertiser and have been in touch with creators who have been actively engaged on this issue, Sharma added, again expressing his gratitude for the internal feedback.

In my column last week about books women should read, I mention the book Spin Sisters by Myrna Blyth. Spin Sisters gives readers an insider's view (similar to Bernie Goldberg, author of the liberal media exposé Bias) of the members of the female media elite, a Girls' Club of editors, producers, print and television journalists with similar attitudes and opinions who influence the way millions of American women think and feel about their lives, their world, and themselves. Blyth doesn't mince words and places blame squarely on the women at the top.
Iran's state-run Press TV ran a segment on these women warriors several years ago:
The measure would ensure that gender ideology – i.e., transgender bathrooms, forced preferred pronoun use, and biological men playing women's sports, etc. – is cemented into federal law.

The mayor also boycotted the St. Patrick's Day Parade for years and recently lashed out at Rev. Franklin Graham because the minister thinks marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Those who dedicate their lives to challenging the justice system — who tirelessly fight to ensure that the State is not imprisoning or executing the innocent — are heroes in my book. While I'm in favor of capital punishment, I'm also in favor of an appeals system that makes damn sure there are no mistakes. You don't hear me running around wondering why we're not executing people faster. No, sir. I have zero faith in our government, especially the majority of mercenary losers who populate it. And if we're going to give the government the power to take away someone's rights, all of their personal freedom and sometimes their lives, that system needs to be relentlessly challenged.

But a group of Never Trumpers like Jonah adopted a less radical stance and conceded that many or even most of Trump's policy actions were actually conservative, and ones they agreed with. What made them Never Trumpers was his horrible, defective character. Most prominent among this group was Bret Stephens, whom I have also admired and promoted in the past. At the end of Trump's first year, Bret wrote an op-ed for the New York Times – the position being an obvious reward for his defection – called Why I'm Still A Never Trumper. In it he praised Trump's major policy actions since entering the White House. But then he attacked Trump's character as un-presidential and indefensible. And he averred: I still wish Hillary Clinton were president.

The state has experienced two political turning points. First was the presidential election of 1992, when California voted for Bill Clinton. It has chosen the Democrat ever since, thanks in part — ironically — to immigration reform signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. That law, also known as Simpson-Mazzoli, granted amnesty to illegal aliens –including many in California — but failed to secure the border, creating incentives for future illegal immigration.

China was the second-worst offender because of its widespread use of human trafficking for state-sponsored forced labor as well as extensive sex trafficking to provide Chinese men with wives. Years of sex-selective abortions have resulted in an estimated 33 to 37 million more males living in China than females, an imbalance that is fueling sex trafficking from multiple nations into China for forced marriage or commercial sexual exploitation.

They may also end the filibuster for ordinary legislation, ensuring that destructive regulation would prevail without any bipartisan consensus.

The proposal follows years of panic at the highest levels of the Communist Party over China's declining birth rate, which has continued to plummet despite dictator Xi Jinping easing the repressive one-child policy that governed Chinese families in 2015.

The University's fundamental commitment is the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissented in a decision that reverses what until now was a space on one's birth certificate reserved for the opposite-sex spouse.

We are committed to protecting the vulnerable and bringing those responsible for exploiting others to justice. I hope this investigation continues to raise the public's awareness of this shocking crime and sends a clear message to those involved that we will take robust action, said Detective Superintendent Tara McGovern, of the Modern Slavery Investigation Team.
The Daily Caller notes that there was almost an immediate issue with the video raised by Google staff:
The Chinese Communist Party has for years expressed particular concern with Asia's most popular cultural export, Korean pop music, or K-pop. K-pop boy groups often feature men wearing make-up and elaborately styling their hair. Their music is rarely aggressive and their public images are carefully protected, meaning few have visible romantic relationships. K-pop artists are, however, required to serve in the Korean military, resulting in paparazzi photos of them without their typically manicured outfits and engaging in combat training. Korean is technically at war with North Korea and its ally China, making these images unfavorable to Beijing for political reasons.
Comey relates in his book that Trump brought up the topic of the dossier: He may want me to investigate it to prove that it didn't happen. And then he says something that distracted me because he said, you know, 'If there's even a 1 percent chance my wife thinks that's true, that's terrible.'
He went on to star in director Tim Burton's Big Fish and portrayed Britain's wartime leader, Winston Churchill, in The Gathering Storm.

Noting longer term trends in France, the national statistics office stated that while the number of weddings has almost continuously declined since the 1970s, mixed marriages have been on the rise since the 1950s.
The Pope's words Wednesday seemed to echo the thought of Saint Paul, who wrote in his letter to Christians in Rome: Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God—what is good and acceptable and perfect.
The famously plainspoken Biden has long said he only agreed to the job after Obama agreed he would be the last person in the room before major decisions were made. Over two terms, they developed a bond that both men said transcended the office, with their wives, children and Biden's grandchildren becoming close friends.
What this had to do with Clinton perjuring himself about molesting a chubby Jewish White House intern was anyone's guess.

Any form of FGM is a violation of a child's rights, said Adwoa Kwateng-Kluvitse, head of global advocacy at the charity FORWARD which campaigns against FGM in Africa and Europe.
Overnight the age of marriage for girls was reduced from eighteen to nine; it took ten years of effort by women activists to raise it again, but only to thirteen. Women lost the right to seek a divorce and the right to child custody. Family protection courts were dissolved, eventually replaced by civil courts, and women no longer could become judges. Polygamy once again was permissible under the law. … The streets became a sea of black, brown, and navy manteaus (ankle-long coats) and head covers; bright colors were banned. Smiling was frowned upon. Only loose women, it was assumed, would smile at strangers or laugh out loud in public.
Normally, I don't read reviews until mine is complete. Only the film should inform my perspective. Unsure I'd have access to Dragged (thankfully it was also released on VOD), I took a peek at what others are saying and came away with one overall impression: while most critics gave it a passing grade, many of these so-called progressives who condemned the film as racist exposed their own latent racism with all their talk about Dragged's two stars.
Banda Aceh (Indonesia) (AFP) Six couples were publicly whipped in Indonesia's conservative Aceh province Monday for relations outside marriage, with at least two women unable to walk after the painful punishment.
The Bush family matriarch's iconic life spanned nearly a century and afforded her a front row seat to the seminal moments of American political history over multiple administrations, from Nixon to Trump.
Starr did not address the question which came at the very end of the forum, Corley told Breitbart Texas in an interview. He asked it because he is concerned about the military being used for social engineering. He said he also asked about the possibility of women being required to register for the draft and why taxpayers should be required to fund gender selection surgeries for transgender people serving on active duty.
And similarly, we will also oppose the legalisation of surrogate mothers, and the circumventions of the [laws against surrogacy] that take place, Le Pen added.
At the dinner, Comey pushed back against Trump's suggestion of probing the claim inside the dossier that he had Russian prostitutes perform a golden shower romp in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013. This while Comey was aware – but still kept to himself – that the document was funded by Trump's main political opponents.
An analysis in the Critic last year examined the question of administrative bias and found Wikipedia editors favoring right-wing views were six times more likely to be sanctioned by administrators than left-leaning editors. That analysis cited administrator Guy Chapman as another example of left-wing bias, including him joining a Black Lives Matter group on Wikipedia by stating: You can be one of three things: ally, enemy, or collaborator. Chapman is among many editors who supported Black Lives Matter and the far-left Antifa group on Wikipedia articles. Late last year he resigned as an administrator after banning an Antifa opponent from the group's page, though he denied his resignation was related.

Family Research Council (FRC) president Tony Perkins and his staff say Perdue is doing his part to ensure a new day for religious freedom.
Mr. Salvini said he is firmly opposed both to the womb rental entailed in surrogate motherhood and to gender-fluid parenting. To give an example: last week I was told that on the website of the Ministry of the Interior, on the forms for the electronic identity card there were 'parent 1' and 'parent 2,' Salvini said. I immediately changed the site by restoring the words 'mother' and 'father.' It's a small thing, a small signal, but I assure you that I will do everything in my power as Minister of the Interior.
According to the Hill, she had originally been charged with filing a false police report, but — get this — the charge was dismissed after she finished an educational program that focused on racial biases.
Those who commit these horrendous crimes should be held accountable for their actions, and these bills stiffen the penalties for offenders while providing additional support to victims, Snyder said.

This is a man from very humble origins who became rich when he was very young, said Quentin Falk, author of an unauthorized biography of Finney. It brought him a lot of side benefits. He's a man who likes to live as well as to act. He enjoys his fine wine and cigars. He's his own man. I find that rather admirable.
Religiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values, with 70% voting for Democrats in 2018, 80% supporting same-sex marriage, and 61% saying immigrants make American society stronger, the DNC stated, further defending secularists by asserting they have often been subjected to unfair bias and exclusion in American society, particularly in the areas of politics and policymaking where assumptions of religiosity have long predominated.
One abiding Sopranos theme is how Chase subtly uses the fall of Rome as a metaphor for the fall of America and the Italian Mafia.
Kern County Superior Court Judge David Lampe ruled Monday that it would have been impermissible for baker Cathy Miller, who operates the Tastries Bakery in Bakersfield, to refuse to sell a cake that was already made to a same-sex couple.

Through an entirely separate Royal scandal in the past year we now know, supposedly, that well known Royal princesses occasionally go out for dinner with their Duke fathers at local branches of entirely ordinary eatery Pizza Express. A far cry from Meghan and Harry banning their neighbours from petting their pet dogs and ordering tennis fans to put their cameras away at Wimbledon because the Princess was present — despite sitting very prominently in the Royal box for all to see.
I am one of the millions of oppressed women in Iran who have been playing with me for years. They took me wherever they wanted. Whatever they said I wore. Every sentence they ordered I repeated. Whenever they saw fit, they exploited me, she said in a statement. They put my medals on the obligatory veil and attributed it to their management and tact. My troubled spirit does not fit into your dirty economic channels and tight political lobbies. I have no other wish except for Taekwondo, security and a happy and healthy life.

I don't want to get preachy but God is a loving God, a forgiving God, she said, but when you talk about marriage, the Church believes that God is the author of marriage and establishes it as a permanent union forming an unbreakable bond.
Another journalist scoffed at the test, saying these values [in the test] aren't really enforceable outside of the law. If someone passes a test and says, Tick, yes I don't beat my wife. Tick, I know who [cricket player] Don Bradman is. I'm an Australian citizen And then they don't express Australian values, what happens?

Hillary recounts that she was devastated by the admission and, at first, refused to believe it was true.
Black leaders were irate when Obama compared the civil rights movement to the same-sex marriage platform on the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march, when black American citizens were beaten for demanding voting rights they were being denied.
But let's not pretend that Neil Ferguson is an innocent in all this. Few men in recent British history, I would argue, have done more long-term damage to their country. It's about time this was recognised by two important groups: by the politicians who, up till now, have been taking him seriously as their guru; and by the general populace, a significant portion of which has been terrified by his doom-laden prognostications into a hysteria out of all proportion to the nature of the actual threat posed by coronavirus.
Among many positions, Bolsonaro has proposed reversing the country's ruling on same-sex marriage, banning abortion, reintroducing the death penalty, loosening gun laws, and chemically castrating those convicted of rape. Bolsonaro has also proposed an increased military presence on Brazil's streets in response to soaring crime, although this has also created fear of nostalgia towards the country's former military dictatorship.
Prince Harry and best man Prince William have arrived at St. George's Chapel for his Royal wedding in Windsor to American actress Meghan Markle.
There was a sort of sexual freedom. To have all that dragged up for something relatively innocuous — that's tough. They seem to be in a mood to pillory anybody, he told the newspaper.
Macri frequently repelled Scioli's attempts to paint him as a 1990s neoliberal, saying he would lead with 21st century development as opposed to 21st century socialism.

Rubio went on to describe four pillars of America's strength that are required to deal with any challenge that it faces.
Jared brought in Goldman Sachs' Gary Cohn to be Trump's National Economic Council director — which would be like Malia Obama demanding that Obama hire me as his White House economic adviser.
Such attitudes by police to victims have been cited as a major contributing factor to grooming gangs going uninvestigated for so long, with disadvantaged victims on the edge of society seen as unreliable witnesses or even complicit in their own abuse.
Dragged is not, as its reactionary critics suggest, about white men who fear losing their place in a changing world. A few off-color remarks, a couple of politically incorrect punchlines, and confronting the reality — yes, the reality — of what life is like for a white person in a deteriorating neighborhood with a predominantly black population, is not what Dragged is about. I'll get to all of that in a bit, but let's start with what Dragged really is about … and that's duty to family.
Every single day I speak to all five of my grandkids, Biden told CNN's Anderson Cooper when discussing how he, himself, was dealing the national quarantine. Either on the phone or I text with them.
In Oil States Energy Services v. Greene's Energy Group, the Court will determine whether the process by the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) can declare a patent invalid, and thus takes away the property rights the patent holder enjoyed, without a jury trial violates the Constitution's Seventh Amendment.
Unfortunately, they have succumbed to the court of public opinion, who've convicted him, he said.
For the first time, I haven't seen some of my children, Abu Abdulaziz told AFP, adding that his first wife was understanding.
You find it fun to tell someone that an innocent comment is sexualised — do you know what that would do to my family? Do you know what that would do to my children? Do you know what you are doing to my family? You've no idea what you're doing to my family, he told Sweeney.
The 69-year-old Scott had come in from Lincolnshire the night before for the big event.

The fatwa goes on to say that hermaphrodites, or persons carrying visible signs of both genders, may not marry anyone.
Pence also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting terrorism, mentioned the Islamic terror bombings on Brussels that killed more than 30 people, then called on the European community to intensify efforts to fight radical Islamic terrorism alongside the United States. This will require greater coordination and intelligence-sharing among EU member states and between the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he said.
Fact: H.R. 5 endangers unborn children. The Equality Act opens the door to taxpayer funding for elective abortions, which the vast majority of Americans oppose, regardless of political affiliation. The bill does not contain any conscience protections for those with moral or religious objections to paying for or performing abortions. It also takes away judicial relief by blocking claims based on the RFRA …
In several statements, the Pope denounced gender ideology, which he called a global war against the family. He also decried the evils of indoctrinating children with the idea that gender is a fluid concept, disconnected from biological sexual differences, saying that gender theory is against the nature of things.
Dean of Windsor David Conner has welcomed the congregation at the start of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
Our immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.
Today is a historic day, Macri crowed while his supporters celebrated. It's the changing of an era.
Gender theory, which has its origin in radical feminism, also promotes the legality of procured abortion – employing the euphemistic terms of sexual and reproductive rights – to prevent a woman who has become unintentionally pregnant from being compelled to assume the role of a mother, viewed as a role imposed on women in the past in Western society and still today in many countries in the world, he said.
And so, Glass was green-lit, which completes the promised Unbreakable trilogy, and what a terrible disappointment it is.

The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, the Catechism continues, but one that entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person.
Fact: By expanding the definition of public accommodations under Title II of the Civil Rights Act to include any establishment that provides a good, service, or program, including a store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services, many more individuals and establishments would, in fact, become liable for discrimination claims, including doctors who do not want to perform abortions …
8:25 PM: Sanders says the crisis (keeps saying Ebola but means corona) exposes the cruelty of America's economy. He says multimillionaires will get through this but half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. He says the lesson to be learned is we have to move aggressively to address the fragility of economy and how unjust it is that so few have so much.

Displaying the versatility of a virtuoso, Finney portrayed Winston Churchill, Pope John Paul II, a southern American lawyer, an Irish gangster and an 18th-century rogue, among dozens of other roles over the years. There was no Albert Finney-type character that he returned to again and again.

So I can't even go search for a job, look for a job, they're holding us, and they're just going to kick us out, no money, no paycheck, on the streets, my kids with no food, no health care, nothing, Squires added. They don't care what happens to us.
The Rum Diary star filed for divorce from Depp on Monday.
Robinson also clashed with the reporter over comments in which Sweeney appeared to compare meeting a working-class person to sitting down with a cannibal from Amazonia, branding the journalist a classist elitist and telling him: the way you view working-class people is a disgrace.
In a news release on the code of conduct's approval, the Foundation cited a Council on Foreign Relations report blaming online speech for rising violence . . . against marginalized groups and ethnic communities to justify the new measure. Foundation CEO Katherine Maher and Board Chair Maria Sefidari both reiterated the code of conduct's intended role in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for site users. The release further claimed the code of conduct signals the Foundation's commitment to creating spaces that foster diversity of thought, religion, sexual orientation, age, culture, and language to name a few.
Tiffany said the OMAR Act was indeed based on Schiff's Campaign Expenditure Transparency Act.
Baltz, himself a political scientist, stated Wikipedia is widely praised for its success in spreading reliable information about political events. He further claimed misinformation is largely suppressed on breaking news events. While praising the site's impressive record of political and ideological neutrality in his piece, Baltz also claimed, it has serious biases in its coverage of political topics. Those biases, Baltz claimed, include focusing too much on wealthy countries and too little on women. Such a narrative is consistent with other corporate media, who praise Wikipedia as a tool against fake news yet routinely criticize its diversity issues.
Durbin's pitch also includes elements of Italian-style left-wing corporate fascism, which also wanted to classify and organize politics around fixed groups of people, such as business leaders, industrial workers or farmers, Fonte said. Under the rule of government-imposed diversity, people are just clients of the administrative state, not citizens of their country, he said.
There is currently no intention to discuss the issue, he said.
In point of fact, the city introduced a modification to the city's farmers market vendor agreement just this year requiring sellers to comply with East Lansing's Human Relations Ordinance.

In his Facebook post, Graham wrote that, in response to the pandemic in New York, Samaritan's Purse erected a 14-tent, 68-bed emergency field hospital in Central Park, staffed by a team of more than 70 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel and relief specialists.
Apparently, even actress and left-wing activist Alyssa Milano had more sway with Biden than the Church. The Atlantic reported in June 2019:
The New York Times, of course, is falling over itself to promote Mr. Buttigieg, painting him as a deeply religious man despite certain life choices that clash with biblical morality — like support for gay marriage and abortion up to birth.
Janice Literally Sucking the Marrow Out of Something
Her treatment has proved what many of us have always known: No matter how beautiful you are, whom you marry, what palaces you occupy, charities you support, how faithful you are, how much money you accumulate or what good deeds you perform, in this society racism will still follow you.

In fact, given what we know of Bezos's behavior, and misbehavior, Virgil thinks it's a fair question to ask: whether or not any entity connected to Bezos should be entrusted with state secrets. That question would, in fact, be a good one for Congress to take up in oversight hearings. In particular, perhaps we should examine why Amazon Web Services, Bezos's cloud-computing company, is allowed to be a major player in the cloud-computing space, including for American national security agencies.
Asked whether he is questioning Jesus's words, Abascal said he agrees with Pope Francis – also a Jesuit. One does not bring into doubt, one brings into discernment… the superior said.

To put it mildly, all this dot-connecting—true or not, provable or not—is expensive. But then, as De Becker wrote:
In fact, Robertson did not blame homosexuals for 160,000 murders in the U.S. Robertson was making the rather unremarkable point that chaos follows when the elite embraces the cultural and moral relativism that also justifies changing marriage rules to allow single-sex marriage. Rather than blaming gays, he is blaming a corrupt and unrooted legal and political culture.

We have some recruiting challenges, and I think the trajectory is not good over the next few years, Mark Mitchell, principal deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, said February at the 2018 Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict Symposium, according to Military.com.
I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith, but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God. I just don't understand how you can be as worshipful of your own self as he is and be prepared to humble yourself before God. I've never seen him humble himself before anyone.
Nonetheless, it is not a crime, and should not be a crime, to be a racist. As ugly and evil as racism is, what you personally believe, what personal opinions you hold, are up to you. You have the right to be a racist asshole in this country, and the government should not be in the business of threatening people unless they agree to be trained to think a certain way.
Tracey's husband never told her about his plans to give her flowers every year, but he did tell the children, Bethany said.
Jesus himself told his followers that they must be like the salt of the earth, not just blending in but conferring a distinct flavor to the world around them.
I'll never beat that record, he added lightly.
We are likely to see pitched battles in courts and Congress, state legislatures and town halls, Alito said. But the most important fight is for the hearts and minds of our fellow Americans. It is up to all of us to evangelize our fellow Americans about the issue of religious freedom.

While outside groups bristle at Diaz Sr.'s place in the modern Democratic Party, they don't get a vote in the community where he has devoted his time and resources for decades. Diaz, who said he was a victim of anti-black discrimination while in the Army, was addicted to drugs and pleaded guilty to heroin and marijuana possession in 1965 before finding salvation in Jesus Christ, ministering to people who also needed to turn their lives around, and opening senior centers in the Bronx in the 1970s and 1980s.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents' rights in childrearing, children's safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women's ideals of beauty, culture and civil society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men's sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children's sexual privacy.
Understandably, but perhaps not helpfully, former KMT leader James Soong — now running under the People First Party (PFP) in a nominal alliance with KMT — told supporters not to count him out of the race and throw their votes to Han, even though he is running in a very distant third place and Han has little chance of winning if he does not absorb the PFP's votes.
We don't know exactly how it's done, but we do know that they won't stop any time soon, she explained.
To be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a State must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether §20–18–401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go. The statute in ques- tion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Oberge- fell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders. In an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state supreme court agreed. And it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the Constitution. To the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this Court's prec- edents suggest just the opposite conclusion.
While some in the media argue that a Biden administration would be a return to normal, it would pose a substantial threat to the values of the majority of Americans. If the Democrats were to control a Senate majority, with only 50 or 51 seats, they could approve judges at will. They may also end the filibuster for ordinary legislation, ensuring that destructive regulation would prevail without any bipartisan consensus.

The showdown comes amid a wider debate on equal rights in the United States, where a flurry of initiatives have targeted the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) communities since a historic Supreme Court decision last year legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.
Chapman President Daniele Struppa issued a statement late Wednesday saying the school and Eastman negotiated an exit, and that their agreement closes this challenging chapter for Chapman. … Late Wednesday, Eastman sent a two-page statement about his departure from Chapman. In it, he repeated claims of voter fraud that he made to the U.S. Supreme Court as Trump's lawyer, in a case the court refused to take up. He also praised Struppa for defending his academic freedom, but slammed most of the rest of Chapman's faculty, who he says have made defamatory statements about him and signed a petition calling for his removal from the school. These 169 have created such a hostile environment for me that I no longer wish to be a member of the Chapman faculty, and am therefore retiring from my position, effective immediately.
Alito said Supreme Court decisions such as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that found in favor of closely held for-profit corporations seeking exemption from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, mandate requiring employers to provide abortion-inducing drugs to their employers in violation of their religious convictions, should inspire activism for religious liberty.

If I did get a chance to go back, it wouldn't be out of a desire to live in the past. No, if I went into the past, it would be just twenty years back, so I could find a teenage boy in the basement of his parents' brick house, thinking long thoughts as he played the same guitar lick over and over again, wondering how he could belong in this world. Wondering if his intellectual curiosity means he'll never fit in. Wondering if his last name will be a stumbling block for the rest of his life. Wondering what it means when he sometimes feels a certain way about young men he sees in the hall at school—if it means he'll never wear the uniform, never be accepted, never know love.

CARLSON: A declaration of war against white supremacy. Now, you may not have noticed that because then on one level, it's not very remarkable. Not many Americans support white supremacy. Most people in this country find it disgusting, of course, and they should.
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attempted to address the issue this month, proposing legislation, the Recovery Rebates Improvement Act, that would extend the cash relief payments to mixed status families.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which owns and operates BYU, teaches that sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife. But that wasn't the end of the matter as a 2014 letter sent to church leaders from the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles noted, Just as those who promote same-sex marriage are entitled to civility, the same is true for those who oppose it. The Church insists on its leaders' and members' right to express and advocate religious convictions on marriage, family, and morality free from retaliation or retribution.

The events of January 6 were terrible, and those who broke the law must be held accountable. But to claim that truth as a justification for saying that even the First Amendment cannot stand in the way of Democrats' vengeance against a former Republican president is a dangerous claim, and provides yet another reason for the Senate to acquit.
In substance, the complaint states, the city is penalizing Catholic Social Services, in violation of its contract and state and federal law, because the agency has Catholic beliefs about same-sex marriage.

Our true identity, as male and female persons, is given by God. It is not only foolish, but hopeless, to try to make ourselves what God did not create us to be, the text reads.
We see the connection between socialism and slavery in all the important works on socialism. Friedrich Hayek's critique of socialism is appropriately titled The Road to Serfdom. George Orwell depicted the tyrannical dimension of socialism in his two immortal novels Animal Farm and 1984. Using both the techniques of fiction and nonfiction, Alexander Solzhenitsyn in a series of works — The Gulag Archipelago, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich — depicted Soviet socialism as a vast network of slave camps stretching from Europe to the farthest reaches of Asia.
In clips of the recording shown by Robinson, which have been edited, Sweeney is portrayed as appearing to brag that the boozy tête-à-tête will be covered by expenses, seeming to say Fuck it, no expense spared at one point.
He also wants to suspend unemployment benefits for qualified workers who refuse two decent job offers.
While the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans, argue the professionals. This would mean we can't ask why; we can't explore underlying mental health issues; we can't consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can't look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.
The measure is fair, popular, good for families and children, and long overdue. They have everything to gain.

In the end, what Donohue objects to is not Buttigieg's belief that gay rights should always trump religious freedom. What he objects to is the hypocrisy of trying to pass off that agenda as somehow consistent with Christianity.
Rev. Graham, the president of Samaritan's Purse relief fund and son of America's pastor Billy Graham, said that Democrat politicians and the liberal media want to see this lockdown drag out & further weaken the economy — not to save lives — but to try to use this to defeat Donald Trump in the election.

David Chase presents to us a cast of characters who, like us, have everything, who are blessed to live in America at the turn of the 20th century, which means we are the most prosperous generation in the history of the world. Food is so cheap and plentiful that obesity (a lack of self-control) is a disease, and so is this god of consumerism we mindlessly worship.
Certain people feel strongly against it, in both communities, she said. I felt it from the black community. It is so complicated. I don't want to give it too much energy. The horrific things that people were saying, it makes you … I'm learning there are certain things I have to really keep for myself.
Finally, on Sunday's edition of NBC News' Meet the Press, Buttigieg accused evangelical Christians of unbelievable hypocrisy for voting for Trump: It's something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that's not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church were it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you're supposed to conduct yourself.
Biden says anyone who shows up to get tested for coronavirus would be held harmless. Biden says it's even the xenophobe's interest for illegal immigrants to come forward to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
That is so telling of how white America views people who are not like them, like we don't exist. And when we do exist, we exist as a threat. And that's exhausting, she said.
I would start negotiations [with Iran] again, she promised. And I won't take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting — Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.

The Nation of Immigrants claim is also a political slogan which is intended to transform individualist American politics into a battle between identity groups under the supervision of an elite, he said.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Charlotte Rae, who played a wise and patient housemother to a brood of teenage girls on the long-running sitcom The Facts of Life during a career that encompassed many other TV roles as well as stage and film appearances, has died. She was 92.
Well it was, in the truest sense of the word, a deeply emotional relationship, but also very pragmatic. I was just saying on the air a few moments ago that I thought their thespian training, their Hollywood background, helped them in politics, because they were conscious of the fact the country wanted something grand in the Presidency, Brokaw said.

I'm certainly proud of it. I kind of think it shouldn't be a big issue but I get the enormity of it because I do have in my wake, positions that didn't work out because I was gay, Grenell said and thanked both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for refusing to listen to the haters.

The South China Morning Post noted Fudan University used to be known as a relatively free-thinking institution, but its attitude was adjusted by the Chinese Communist Party last month, so now its charter includes Marxist twaddle and professions of loyalty to the party. The inference was that Fudan was ordered to take down its Taiwanese election predictions because they might depress turnout for the pro-China candidates.

He was also a foreign policy spokesman for the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, resigning his position due to what he called a hyperpartisan discussion of personal issues, which have been described as including his sexuality, his position in favor of gay marriage, and some allegedly off-color Tweets.

While the film prominently features the Cubs — and even has a cameo by famed Cubs player Ryne Sandberg — the movie isn't specifically about baseball. The flick features Aaron's character as he finds younger, more tech-savvy competitors beating him out of new opportunities at his place of employment. The film then follows the character's subsequent decision to divorce himself from cell phones, technology, and the Internet. And as Aaron navigates through his decision to dump technology he deals with the fallout from friends, family and his gay husband.
The practice involves the cutting or removal of female sexual organs and is used as a misguided preventative measure to keep women from having sex before marriage, according to Breitbart News. While many of the cases occur among Muslim families, FGM is not exclusive to Islam and much more common in Africa than in any other part of the world. Often, the procedure occurs in areas with limited hygiene and a lack of medical supplies, and is done by senior tribal members or other non-medical professionals.

This battle — what hangs in the balance is every issue every one of your listeners care about, she said, naming concerns from preserving the Second Amendment to traditional marriage. The New York Times placed [Merrick Garland]… to the left of [Justice Elena] Kagan. So this is a very liberal nominee. Of course. This is such a liberal president who thinks the Constitution is a living, breathing document.
The TEA's fiscal year ends on August 31 after which they will release their annual figures on teacher improprieties. During the 2014-2015 school year, the state's educator sexual misconduct cases increased for the seventh consecutive year.

The vast differences between the lives of the two women are obvious. Yet, they died within several days of each other and the fact that Diana was buried following her tragic death with a rosary in her folded hands given to her by Mother Teresa, has led some in the media to reflect on both the contrast and the connection between the two.
As a result, it is now an offense in Washington State to ask a man in a woman's bathroom if he thinks he is male or female. Similarly, Obama and gay advocacy groups have slammed a popular North Carolina law, dubbed HB2, because it requires people to undergo medical procedures before they can use a bathroom reserved for the opposite sex.

Saudi Arabia and Bezos have not been on good terms since at least last October, when Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. And as De Becker mentions, Amazon has a large presence in Saudi Arabia, through a subsidiary, Souq.com. So who knows all the possible angles here—after all, not everyone loves Amazon.
We will soon see whether this proves to be true. I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools, he wrote.
The Church of God in Christ, a seven-million-member black denomination, unanimously passed a historic resolution affirming the value and dignity of every human life and opposing the practice of elective abortion in America. A key excerpt from the Resolution on the Sanctity of Human Life reads: COGIC is one of the largest historically black Protestant denominations, which also include the National Baptist Convention, the National Baptist Convention of America, the Progressive National Convention, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. Like these other groups, COGIC does not have a history of institutional involvement with causes typically associated with the Republican Party. Yet given the direction that abortion policy is moving in this country, its leaders felt compelled to act.
By its very nature, he said, this alliance requires the ability to recognize sexual differences as a richness and a promise, not as a reason of subjection and abuse.

Fact: H.R. 5 endangers unborn children. The Equality Act opens the door to taxpayer funding for elective abortions, which the vast majority of Americans oppose, regardless of political affiliation. The bill does not contain any conscience protections for those with moral or religious objections to paying for or performing abortions. It also takes away judicial relief by blocking claims based on the RFRA …

If I did get a chance to go back, it wouldn't be out of a desire to live in the past. No, if I went into the past, it would be just twenty years back, so I could find a teenage boy in the basement of his parents' brick house, thinking long thoughts as he played the same guitar lick over and over again, wondering how he could belong in this world. Wondering if his intellectual curiosity means he'll never fit in. Wondering if his last name will be a stumbling block for the rest of his life. Wondering what it means when he sometimes feels a certain way about young men he sees in the hall at school—if it means he'll never wear the uniform, never be accepted, never know love.

HR 38—which the U.S. House of Representatives passed on December 6—would rectify this abominable situation by requiring all 50 states to give reciprocity to all citizens with a valid firearm license issued by any other state. It would, of course, like current reciprocal agreements between various states, require the license holder to abide by the laws of the state in which he or she is carrying a firearm. This bill would treat the firearms license in the same manner states now treat driver's licenses and marriage licenses. (Marriage licenses are issued by each state and all are recognized by all 50 states along with the privileges that are afforded by them.)

Not even two children are sufficient to rise above the 2.1 births per woman threshold of stable population growth; many families with three or more children are needed, and this is difficult to achieve if young people delay marriage and family in favor of professional and financial success. Reversing a plunge as steep as China's, with such a huge excess of males in the population, probably cannot be achieved by simply offering larger subsidies to defray the cost of raising children.
Johnny Depp's latest film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, tanked at the domestic box office over the Memorial Day holiday weekend as calls to boycott the actor over his alleged physical abuse of wife Amber Heard continued to grow louder on social media.

[B] 30-year-old man on suspicion of modern slavery and proceeds of crime offences.
There is nothing sinful about being a homosexual. There are plenty of gay men and women who strive to live a Christian life. May God bless all of them. And homosexuals are not uniquely burdened because we are all tempted by sin in our own way. The question is do we give in to it?
The Times of Israel reports: A group of ultra-Orthodox rabbis is calling for the summary dismissal of a Haredi lawmaker who boasted he had attended his nephew's gay wedding.

CNN reported on Monday that at least six members of the Conference of Rulers have already met to discuss who will succeed Muhammad V, and in fact might have prodded him to abdicate, either because they were unhappy with his choice of fiancee or because they thought he was not well-suited to handle an era of fundamental change in Malaysia.
It goes on and on, Daly wrote. And we're only at the beginning of a coordinated effort to silence those of us with socially conservative convictions.
The big reason that having children, and even marrying in the first place, hurts women's pay relative to men's is that the division of labor at home is still unequal, even when both spouses work full time. That's especially true for college-educated women in high-earning occupations: Children are particularly damaging to their careers.
In May, after the general election that saw former governing coalition Barisan Nasional toppled for the first time in its 61-year rule, there was widespread speculation that the palace had delayed Mahathir's swearing in as prime minister. In June, the government and the Agong reached an impasse regarding the appointment of ethnic Indian lawyer Tommy Thomas as attorney general, a position normally reserved for a member of the Malay-Muslim majority race – although the constitution does not specify a specific race, gender or religious requirement for the role. The Agong consented to the appointment after two weeks of the stand-off. Muhammad V was also the ruler who handed democracy icon and prime minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim a royal pardon in May, wiping clean his record of multiple charges of sodomy and corruption and releasing him from prison.
For decades Democrats have had sole providence over almost every major city in America. We've literally poured trillions of tax dollars into the War on Poverty and public schools… In other words, Democrats have had sole control over these areas, have instituted every policy they believe in without opposition, and have received swimming pools full of federal dollars… And look at the result… Total failure.

Yet then came the next turn of the news cycle, as the quality of FTI's technical forensics came under challenge. On January 24, the Wall Street Journal published an article headlined, Bezos Hack Report Puzzles Cyber Experts. In the Journal's careful—and no doubt well-lawyered—language, the FTI tech report relied heavily on circumstantial evidence to make the case that a WhatsApp account associated with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was probably used to hack into the iPhone of Mr. Bezos. The story quoted experts who relayed, The audit left several major technical questions about the incident unexplained and in need of more examination.
The full credits of the film, for some reason, seem to also have been scrubbed from the internet. We obtained a copy by using the Wayback machine and made a startling discovery: the movie's chief investors included none other than the social deputy of the State Welfare Organization (SWO) of Iran (SWO-معاونت اجتماعی سازمان بهزیستی کشور) as well as the Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran. (سازمان فرهنگی و هنری شهرداری تهران) These two investors in the film might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations—but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran states: This organization was founded in 1996 and [does] its activities under the supervision of a board of trustees composed of various cultural institutions such as IRIB and Islamic propaganda organization.

How did the change come about? It came about through economic liberalization, otherwise known as free market capitalism. And how did India decide to move in that direction? It was not inspired by the Indians reading Adam Smith. Rather, Indians looked across the Chinese border and saw that millions of once-impoverished peasants now lived in clean homes and nice apartments. The Chinese now shopped in well-stocked grocery stores. They drove new cars.
Yes, it appears that Team Bezos—a team that includes the Post—have decided that Michael Sanchez is the leaker; in other words, Bezos and his people blame Michael, not Lauren, for the original leaks. Actually, many reports hold that Lauren was involved, too, if only through carelessness; it's been reported that she showed some embarrassing material to her friends, and as they say, loose lips sink, well, you know.
However, he acknowledges that furthering LGBT interests, especially in countries with cultures opposed to the promotion of gay lifestyles, will be a challenge.

Also: Brian Flores, the Dolphins' new head coach, is black. Not that every black person or every black coach supports Kaepernick and his cause. But Flores grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, so he might be more sensitive to racial injustice than the average coach, and less likely to be a protest hater.
No, I'd have to object to that. I think the situations are very different, Apter said, without further explanation.
The outlet quoted Qin as stating that the United States considers freezing women's eggs a standard medical service and that China has much to gain from following that example. Among the hurdles the program would face is the fact that the Communist Party in Shanghai strictly regulates who has access to egg-freezing, limiting the list to couples with a history of infertility and cancer patients who expect to preserve their fertility before undergoing surgery or chemotherapy. Most preservation of eggs is not freezing in China, however, which means most expire after five years, the newspaper noted.
In February 2019, Bishop Joseph de Metz-Noblat of Langres, president of the French bishops' conference Council for Canonical Questions, wrote to the bishops that changes in baptismal documents should be made in order to avoid charges of discrimination, reported Catholic News Agency (CNA).
Is this real life? First, Cuba does not have the highest literacy rate. Second, don't be surprised if the same people who report Cuba's admittedly high literacy rate are related to those who report its election results — the ones in which the Castros get 100 percent of the votes. Third, could it be Cuba doesn't have to invest a lot in its prison system because, you know, dungeons and firing squads (El Paredon) are not too expensive to maintain?

Biden says we have to take care of those who have been exposed and are likely to be exposed with test kits. Second, he wants to make sure every state has at least 10 drive-thru testing centers. He talks about the need for additional hospital beds. Says Department of Defense and FEMA can set them up. Biden says we have to deal with the economic fallout. He again says that he sees his time is up in what is becoming a very awkward crutch.

Outside of sexual crime concerns, the call for an open and systematic sex education system in China comes as Beijing struggles to combat the nation's plummeting birth rate, which continued reaching near-record lows in the past five years despite the end of the communist one-child policy, which mandated all women who become pregnant a second time must kill their children, either through abortion or infanticide. China currently imposes a two-child policy on its majority Han ethnic group, but few families have taken the opportunity to increase their size.

Just a week prior to Baltz's Washington Post article criticizing bias against women on political articles, Fox News released a report noting significant ideological bias on Wikipedia, something Baltz claims is less of an issue. One of the articles Baltz criticized for not citing enough women, the article on socialism, was found by Fox to be whitewashed of atrocities committed by self-proclaimed socialist governments. This included the socialism article praising the technological achievements of the Soviet Union, while referencing the excesses of Stalin's regime without elaborating. A section about Asia left repressive actions in China under Mao unmentioned but did mention Indonesia's anti-communist mass-killings.
It was after Hickenlooper was laid off from his geologist position during the energy bust of the 1980s that he inadvertently started on his road to politics.

It also led to him making a successful run for Denver mayor in 1993.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title. The Equality Act also states actions based on the belief in traditional marriage between a man and woman is discrimination against a married same-sex couple and relegates such faith beliefs to the status of a sex stereotype that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples. This language suggests faith-based adoption agencies that restrict adoptions to homes with a father and mother could be considered as discriminating against same-sex couples. A lawsuit alleging such discrimination would then have the weight of federal law behind it. Catholic League President Bill Donohue warned the Equality Act would promote the most comprehensive assault on Christianity ever written into law. Similarly, the U.S. Catholic Bishops' Conference asserted the legislation would discriminate against people of faith and punish faith-based organizations, such as charities and schools who serve everyone in their communities, simply because of their beliefs.
By this possible reckoning, Bezos raised serious allegations about the Saudi government, that Israeli company NSO, the National Enquirer, and the Trump administration. And maybe possibly, in so raising those allegations, Bezos legally defamed someone.

The Queen's late mother believed the unexpected burden of taking up the crown at a time of great national upheaval — George VI reigned through much of the Great Depression and throughout the Second World War — precipitated his early death, and the Queen's own equally unexpected elevation to the throne at the age of 25.
The True Lies actor made lewd and sexist remarks directed at Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media personalities, who had called for him and Barbra Streisand to be put under investigation by authorities.
Writing at the Washington Examiner, Timothy Head, executive director of the Faith & Freedom Coalition and Rev. Dean Nelson, executive director of Human Coalition Action, noted this remarkable resolution that went largely unnoticed by the establishment media:
The Supreme Court's Evenwel majority decision undermines the principle of one man, one vote. The decision will encourage politicians to fill their legislative districts with more non-citizens and fewer voting Americans. This abuse could lead to unequal voting power for voters in districts with large numbers of alien residents.
Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco, on the contrary, praised the Bishops' statement, expressing his gratitude toward Archbishop José Gomez, the president of the Bishops' Conference, for the clarity of the message.

UK: Prosecutors Nail Migrant 'Slavery' Ring with Over 400 Victims https://t.co/ARrQhMSioa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 5, 2019
Other than Artie Bucco's wife Charmaine (Kathrine Narducci), who regularly pleads with both the audience and her none-too-bright husband not to get too close to the mafia flame, this is the first and only time a truly moral voice is heard in the series, someone who not only condemns our heroes, but pours undiluted truth over so many modern hypocrisies.
The vote came despite members of the ruling government coalition expressing some opposition and wanting to exclude the ban on certain child marriages.
For, certainly, no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth, fit to take rank as one of the co-ordinate states of the Union, than that which seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement.

11 years ago, when I came out, I didn't think there was a place for me in this world.
Another woman said they live in ancient times, while yet another lamented the fact that they lack electricity and drinking water.
In 2018, when he was publicly taunted by gay competitors at the Olympic Winter Games, Pence reached out — to no avail.
As Breitbart News reported, however, a recent study conducted by the Karolinska Institute and Linkoping University in Sweden found biological males — claiming to be transgender women — who were administered a full year of hormone therapy, still maintained muscle mass and strength advantages over biological women.
He won't even release the original code used for the Imperial College modelling that predicted 500,000 deaths from coronavirus – and which frightened Boris Johnson into his U-turn on lockdown.
The progressive push to bend Americans' attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of gender identity has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
Ferguson's modelling then (and since) has been heavily criticised by experts as not fit for purpose.
The parties physically separated on or about April 7, 2019, when Defendant told Plaintiff that he was romantically involved with and in love with another woman, Ilhan Omar, the court documents read.
The South China Morning Post saw a game of thrones getting underway in Malaysia as the Conference of Rulers, a body comprised of the nine eligible candidates for the crown plus a few non-voting provincial governors, meets to decide who the next king will be. The Conference of Rulers is scheduled to vote on January 24 and swear in a new king on January 31, although there is no legal deadline for installing a new king.
During the election campaign, Macri vowed he would listen more and talk less than Fernandez.
But let's not pretend that Neil Ferguson is an innocent in all this. Few men in recent British history, I would argue, have done more long-term damage to their country. It's about time this was recognised by two important groups: by the politicians who, up till now, have been taking him seriously as their guru; and by the general populace, a significant portion of which has been terrified by his doom-laden prognostications into a hysteria out of all proportion to the nature of the actual threat posed by coronavirus.
Before his attempt at making the first joke, Bloomberg refuted Warren's claims and said he fought against redlining and pointed to his record as New York City mayor as evidence.
Faith-based schools could thus face federal sanction for upholding the teachings of mainstream biology and the Bible, modern ­genetics and Genesis, when it comes to sex and marriage, Anderson noted.
The survey of 923 women, which was carried out by female Muslim researchers, also revealed there to be a significant number of women living in polygamous situations — 37 per cent of whom admitted being forced into the arrangement against their will.
But when their son Chris and his friend, Peter Tzannos, saw how much Nick missed his wife, they came up with a plan to get them back together and asked Ryan Donnellan's Tree Service company for help.
Mean Little Mayor Pete might be a Christian but he's truly terrible at it and needs our prayers, even though he probably doesn't believe he needs them.
Which brings me to the show's relentless and righteous condemnation of identity politics.
In July, Biden finally revealed his health plan would enshrine Roe v. Wade into the Constitution and force taxpayers to fund abortion.
Nearly a year after her role in reporting Weinstein, Messick went to work for Weinstein until 2003.
I don't trust Franklin Graham to help those in need in the LGBTQ community. I've seen far too many anti-LGBTQ activists like Graham ignore the suffering of LGBTQ people. In this instance, Graham is capitalizing upon a crisis to inflict more pain and suffering on an already marginalized population. He has stated, loudly and proudly, too many times that the LGBTQ community is a threat for me to want to place my life, or the lives of people l love and care about, in his hands.
I am a survivor, she told attendees. What I want people to understand is that I am the same person as I was last week. You just know more about what's inside of me now.
Membership in the multiracial, post-ethnic national overclass depends chiefly on graduation with a diploma—preferably a graduate or professional degree—from an Ivy League school or a selective state university, which makes the Ivy League the new social register. But a diploma from the Ivy League or a top-ranked state university by itself is not sufficient for admission to the new national overclass. Like all ruling classes, the new American overclass uses cues like dialect, religion, and values to distinguish insiders from outsiders. Dialect. You may have been at the top of your class in Harvard business school, but if you pronounce thirty-third toidy-toid or have a Southern drawl, you might consider speech therapy. Religion. You may have edited the Yale Law Review, but if you tell interviewers that you recently accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior, or fondle a rosary during the interview, don't expect a job at a prestige firm. Values. This is the trickiest test, because the ruling class is constantly changing its shibboleths—in order to distinguish true members of the inner circle from vulgar impostors who are trying to break into the elite. A decade ago, as a member of the American overclass you could get away with saying, along with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I strongly support civil unions for gay men and lesbians. In 2020 you are expected to say, I strongly support trans rights.
Batchelder's latest act of service in her long career occurred when she sent her letter to President Trump informing him that she was ready to take senior status, which is a semi-retired status where judges still hear cases part-time but give up their seat to be filled by a new judge. Instead of taking her status immediately, she informed the president that she would continue to hold the seat not only until he nominated her replacement, but also would keep on serving until the Senate confirmed that nominee. That way, she could continue to serve alongside all the regular-service judges to rehear important cases in en banc sittings until the day when a younger constitutionalist judge could fill that seat in her stead.
I was a child. I want to know: Why weren't any red flags raised? Whoever was processing this application, they don't look at it? They don't think? Amin asked.
This also holds true for open borders fanatics in the mainstream media, who falsely and deceptively labeled our organization and opposition to Sharia as anti-Muslim, or even white-supremacist. Right, because a group that stands unwaveringly with Israel and has an Arab woman as its President used an openly gay man to organize a march that included Muslims to advance some white supremacist agenda.
According to Islamic belief, a shahid (martyr) marries 72 virgins when he reaches paradise. Therefore, a shahid's funeral is considered a wedding. Becoming a martyr represents the highest religious achievement that can be attained by a Muslim. Families of martyrs are rewarded by the PA with monthly stipends for life.
Biden's remarks were an effort to establish his ideological credentials — and also a challenge to his rivals, especially Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), all of whom have adopted far-left policies in the early days of the Democratic primary.
She is stranded, is not allowed to leave the country, and is alone scared, and in a dreadful situation, as you can imagine, the woman's father said.
Medicaid is gently carrying tens of thousands of healthy Americans to their early deaths each year, according to analysts who are trying to explain the massive and unprecedented spike in deaths among middle-aged Americans in post-industrial America.
Some truly stupid critics are screaming racism because Dragged's arch-villain actually is a virulent racist, but these critics are forgetting that he's the, uh, arch-villain — you know, the guy Zahler wants us to hiss. But this racist psycho (whose face we never see) is something more, a way for Zahler to distinguish between actual racism and the complicated realities of the human condition.
And we might also add that on January 31, the Guardian–which seems to be Bezos's go-to journalistic outlet–reported that in 2019, the FBI interviewed Bezos about his allegations of a hack, as part of, the newspaper said, a larger investigation of that Israeli company, NSO. So while it's possible that Team Bezos is just blowing more smoke, it's also possible that there's some fire there, somewhere.
Ellen Page, who came out as a lesbian in 2014 and has since married to Canadian dancer Emma Portner, saved her particular disdain for Vice President Pence, pointing out his long-held positions in support of traditional marriage and religious liberty.
Amin, now 29, said she was betrothed to her first cousin Tariq when she was just 8 and he was 21. The petition was eventually terminated after she ran away. She said the ordeal cost her a childhood. She was in and out of foster care and group homes, and it took a while to get her life on track.
The district has been devastated by the virus, but also devastated by poverty for the last 25 years, so the question is where were these people when the Diaz's were here? Shienkopf said. Who is standing up to scream about it? Diaz keeps proving he's the one that can yell the loudest, so that gives him some standing.
How much more clear evidence do we need before Boris Johnson's flailing administration accepts what ought to be blindingly obvious?
WASHINGTON—On Monday, the Supreme Court denied requests to review several prominent federal appeals—called petitions for certiorari—including a Utah case asserting a constitutional right to polygamy and a challenge to Texas's voter-ID law.
He then turned to the current day and the new set of challenges facing America today. He talked about jobs being transformed and eliminated by machines, technology and globalization.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Orson Bean, the witty actor and comedian, was hit and killed by a car in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was 91.
It isn't drafted as a shield to protect vulnerable minorities from unjust discrimination, but as a sword to persecute those who do not embrace new sexual and gender ideologies, he asserted.
Myth 2: The Equality Act Preserves Religious Freedom
The latest legal action coincides with a deadline the Justice Department gave North Carolina's governor last week to remedy the measure, warning him that the law violated federal anti-discrimination statutes.
Last week former NFL player Jack Brewer declared a tremendous awakening is happening in the country as some black Americans are abandoning the Democrat Party and turning to support President Donald Trump.
Foxx warned the legislators, saying: This a classic something of passing something now and figuring out what it means later. if the devil is in the details, we are in for a lot of devilish surprises.
In February last year, Swedish prosecutors dropped a criminal case involving a child marriage in which a Syrian man, who was 26 at the time, married a girl who was only 13 or 14 and raped her. The case was dismissed because the crime occurred in Syria rather than Sweden.
Throughout the letter, McAdams refers to other venues where the issues will be discussed in greater detail, a not-so-subtle threat of legal action. McAdams has acquired legal counsel.
When I read his column, the first question that popped into my mind was this: how can indefensible and un-presidential bad character lead to such admirable presidential decisions? I am not aware of any attempt by Bret Stephens or Jonah Goldberg or similar Never Trumpers to provide an answer.
This week the Church of Scotland's first openly gay minister, Scott Rennie, declared the tradition of 'the father giving the bride away' to be outdated, and called for it to be abandoned.
Trump's unilateral actions are thuggery, a complete violation of every international rule, said Sachs, a supporter of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. This is truly what we are facing. I'm sorry to say it, it's my country and I'm not very happy to say it, but it's an imperial power in decline and it's a dangerous country right now and it will be absolutely dangerous if Trump wins re-election.
Mother Teresa had no less of a shrewd trademark–her homespun, blue-striped, white cotton sari. Reported value: about a dollar. She wore it before the beribboned audience in Stockholm who awarded her the Nobel Peace Prize and refused to change from it before her first meeting with the pope, saying, `These clothes are good enough for God.' The pope knelt to kiss her hand and said he felt humbled.
The famously plainspoken Biden has long said he only agreed to the job after Obama agreed he would be the last person in the room before major decisions were made. Over two terms, they developed a bond that both men said transcended the office, with their wives, children and Biden's grandchildren becoming close friends.
Meanwhile in Rome, which so far has seen relatively few cases of coronavirus, the Catholic Church has suspended all non-sacramental pastoral activities until at least March 15, while asking that people allow for a safe distance of at least a meter from one another. All catechism classes, marriage preparation courses, and pilgrimages have been cancelled for Rome parishes.
But if he does go down this route of semi-privatising his role, earning millions and thinks he can continue to gain our respect, no I wouldn't, Glancy confirmed.
In Pillow Talk, released in 1959 and her first of three films with Rock Hudson, she proudly caught up with what she called the contemporary in me. Her 1976 tell-all book, Doris Day: Her Own Story, chronicled her money troubles and three failed marriages, contrasting with the happy publicity of her Hollywood career.
Not only will I not say that again, but I'll be more thoughtful going forward in the way that I talk about our marriage, and also the way in which I acknowledge the truth of the criticism that I have enjoyed white privilege, he told the podcast Political Party LIVE! in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
However, misinformation on the left has continued unchecked, even by the supposed fact-checkers. Twitter's head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, responsible for its fact-checking platform, has tweeted in the past that members of the Trump administration are actual Nazis, as reported by Breitbart News's Joel Pollak.
Many patients want to be excused for their current predicament because of events that have occurred in their childhood. That's what psychiatry has become in America. Visit any shopping mall or ethnic pride parade to witness the results.
Mohammad Naciri, regional director of Arab States UN Women, looked for optimistic signs in the report. Amidst the stories of men's violence against women, we found stories of men's caregiving in the home. For every story of a man who compelled his daughter to marry against her will, there were stories of men who empowered their daughters, he said.
The Duke of Edinburgh has seen some of the most momentous events in world history first-hand in his 99 years. Born into one of the lesser European Royal families as a prince of Greece, Philip and his family were forced to flee the nation when his father was forced to abdicate his throne in 1922. Aged just 18 months old, the infant Philip was carried onto a Royal Navy warship for evacuation loaded in a cot made from an orange box, the official account of his life relates.
On January 21, the Enquirer struck again, publishing racy text messages between Bezos and Sanchez. By now the rumor mill was going strong: not only about Bezos, his marriage, his company—and his judgment—but also about any possible Enquirer connection to Trump. Moreover, there were rumors that the government of Saudi Arabia might be involved because the Saudis and the Post have been in a feud since a Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul last October. And to complicate things further, the Saudis and the Trump family, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are known to be tight.
Ma did not specify to his company's newlyweds whether he follows the 669 rule or not. Ma married his college sweetheart, Cathy Zhang, and has himself contributed two children to Chinese communist society. Zhang left her job at Alibaba to care for the children. She has publicly referred to her husband as not a handsome man.
This is planned urban genocide, and you can change this, he said.
It is no exaggeration to say that homosexuality has become a plague in the clergy, and it can only be eradicated with spiritual weapons, he said. It is an enormous hypocrisy to condemn the abuse, claim to weep for the victims, and yet refuse to denounce the root cause of so much sexual abuse: homosexuality.
In one case, an 11-year-old girl from London was married on Skype to a 25-year-old man in Bangladesh, Freedom's founder Aneeta Prem said.
Sachs was also the lead architect of the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals and pleaded for countries to include sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in the scheme, after they were initially left out, which eventually led to their inclusion over and against objections from the Holy See and the United States.
Stars from the rugby world included Sir Clive Woodward, who coached England to the world cup in 2003, and Jonny Wilkinson, a member of that title-winning team.
Look, I like gays as much as the next red-blooded heterosexual Dad. Some of my best friends are gay, one of them, unfortunately, being Milo. Plus, I was an enthusiastic instigator of homosexual acts at my prep school – I virtually invented it – so I know what it's all about. I like gay clubs, gay music, gay culture. At Glastonbury just now, I queued up to join the Meat Market gay club where a handsome youth in drag at the entrance patted me down and affectionately squeezed my testicles while my wife looked on. In fact, if I didn't prefer girls I would DEFINITELY be gay myself.
Not only doing that, he's changed it to where the guys who are coming through the Q-course are not even the same quality of guys we had back in the day. Guys who should have been kicked out for several different things … As instructors, they took our power away.
The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the City of Philadelphia for cutting off Catholic Social Services from foster parent placements because of its religious beliefs regarding the nature of marriage.
Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-MO) recalled during a presentation at the Heritage Foundation the story of parents in Ohio who lost custody of their daughter several years ago because they opposed her desire to transition to male. A judge allowed the girl's grandparents to take custody of her because they supported her medical transition.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi was as close as the series ever came to creating a character representing the audience.

Back to David Cameron. He was the man who made this mess – not by instigating the referendum (a good thing!) but by so arranging it that if he lost then the winning side would suffer.
He added: But I also fail to see how any of it will matter without a planet to live on. We are approaching an irreversible tipping point. The science of climate change is backed by examples of the damage mankind has caused all around us, every day and everywhere. None of us are immune anymore; no matter where we live, no matter our political party.
This also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance, the president said.

At least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM in over 30 countries, according to U.N. estimates.
As I've written before, most Britons were not even aware of Megan Markle's mixed-race heritage until she and her supporters and publicists started banging on about it. No one cares because Britain is a country largely comfortable with race and black people are well integrated.
Police also questioned a group of protesters who were praying the rosary outside the church, asking for their identification.

Netflix disappointed investors when the streaming entertainment giant reported domestic subscriber growth that missed forecasts for the third straight quarter, signaling continued weakness at home as the company supports leftist politics and faces increasing competition from Disney, Apple, and other studios.
Heard filed for divorce from the actor last Monday.
That is a direct critique of conservative politics, and of course he's going to be attacked for that, Sanders said.
The poll, carried out by ComRes for the Evangelical Alliance earlier this month, asked over 2000 British adults nationwide whether they considered certain figures to be extreme.
Regardless of the issues presented to Cruz while on the campaign trail, including questions of public policy such as abortion and same-sex marriage, the candidate says his overriding source for decision-making is the Constitution and that the founding document is the means to unify Americans.
The POA has admitted that there is a real problem with inmates being radicalised with prison sources adding that imams with extremist views were being allowed to preach in British prisons because of a shambolic vetting system.
Those are — those are things I've done, Senator.
The statement says the amnesty will allow — but not require — federal agencies to set policies that raise wages for foreign workers to prevent unfair competition with American workers.
Because the alleged victim 10 years ago denied that she was on the video and did not testify, the state's attorney office had little recourse except to charge the lesser offense under Illinois law, child pornography, which required a lower standard of evidence.
Mean Little Mayor Pete, though, is not only sure he's a better Christian than everyone else, he blames God for his sin, a brazen act of blasphemy I have never before seen from a public figure.
Everything Johnny had told us that she'd been threatening had actually come to be, Stanhope wrote of the claims that Heard later made in court. It blew up in the news, raced through the Internet like a plague and blew up on Twitter like it was the McMartin child abuse scandal. People are swarming with torches on social media.
Despite these overwhelming numbers in support of school choice in its many forms, Michael observed:
China should be offering incentives for couples to have babies, not forcibly aborting 'illegal' pregnancies, Littlejohn added.
These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies, he stated, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.
As Breitbart News reported in December, the unemployment rate for black men is at a record low:
A virtual seder will be available via PragerU on Wednesday beginning at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.
It was there that Broadway producers, who frequented such bistros, discovered her, leading to her first Broadway musical, called Three Wishes for Jamie, in 1952. A few years later, she originated the role of Mammy Yokum in the Broadway musical Li'l Abner.
Prager continued: And if a North Korean conductor shared the podium and conducted one of the pieces, along with the permanent conductor of the New York Philharmonic, you would still play?
The upshot, Donohue writes, is that de Blasio has decided to privilege protesters, many of whom are well-off white folks, all because he thinks that protesting racism justifies jettisoning his shutdown.
Now, before we go any further, I need to be perfectly clear about something… I personally have no problem with bare-knuckle politics, dirty politics, brutal politics. As long as violence, the condoning of violence, or the justifying of violence is not involved, I am pro-brutal politics. The nastier the better. Listen, when you live in a world with a corrupt establishment media that will stop at nothing — like accusing John McCain of having an affair with a lobbyist — to put Democrats in office, when you live in a world where Mitt Romney is accused of killing a woman, when you live in a world where CNN folk heroes a anti-Trump thug, you have to play the game as it is lays.
The right became synonymous with more conservative politics, irrelevant for minorities, he told the BBC. It also became associated with authoritarian, even nostalgic feelings about the dictatorship, like Bolsonaro.
Khan responded by musing to reporters that getting married to her was the biggest mistake of my life.

JAKE SHERMAN: You've known Joe Biden for thirty-something years, right? What is your reaction to these allegations? Now there's two people who have said he made them feel uncomfortable. Is it disqualifying and what is your reaction to that?
8:30 PM: Sanders asked if he would support bailouts for industries being harmed by the corona virus. Sanders says we need to stabilize the economy but we can't do what we did in 2008. He says Biden voted for the Wall Street bailouts and he didn't.
If we resume work, in 2018 there will be an alley to a semi-submerged court which will ease enormously the pressure on the grounds, said Forget.
In most every interview he sits down for, Zahler is pretty much berated over his politics, his non-conformity, his refusal to adhere to the Production Code of Political Correctness. In other words, he's called on the carpet and told to explain himself — Are you now or have you ever been a Republican! But Zahler — God bless him — refuses to answer. Other then confessing to being an atheist Jew, Zahler will only say his films do not express a point of view, that his only goal is to create something compelling.

The report noted Goldberg has advocated for LGBTQ rights in the areas of immigration, employment, and family law, and that, while working at Columbia, she filed briefs in nearly every marriage equality case in the United States.
So the question is, why have they kept denouncing us, as of all things, white supremacists? We thought a lot about that, you should think a lot about it, too now that the Biden administration has declared war on people they claim to have white supremacist ideas.
. @SpeakerPelosi on allegations against Joe Biden: I don't think it's disqualifying…I think that it's important for the vice president and others to understand is it isn't what was intended it's how it was received…To say, 'I'm sorry that you were offended' is not an apology. pic.twitter.com/0TjJVORlXM
Consistent with his June 8, 2017 prepared remarks before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey relates in the book that he briefed Trump on the dossier charges at a pre-inauguration intelligence briefing at Trump tower.
Camosy failed to mention, however, that the Obama administration also separated illegal children from adults at the U.S.-Mexico border – since children are never housed in adult detention centers – using the same barriers, or cages as the Left calls them when the Trump administration is using them.
Robert Redford Says Impeaching Trump Is Pointless If There Will Be No Planet to Live On
Bryant was quick to acknowledge that everyone has made poor choices in their life, including himself. He said that's no justification for people to turn their backs on those who have been reduced to what he called 'white noise,' noted a 2012 Los Angeles Times profile of Bryant's work with the homeless.
Inside the classroom, the Equality Act could allow for the normalization of gender ideology and abortion in school curricula.
When members of the Georgia Tech student government denied the request to fund the event with Dr. King, they admitted that their decision was motivated by their partisan biases. My concern is that if we support this bill, we're supporting a speaker that's said such hateful, dangerous rhetoric, one student government member said, citing concerns about King's opposition to same-sex marriage.
Kim Kardashian West filed for divorce from Kanye West Friday after 6 1/2 years of marriage, court records show. The move brings an impending end to one of the most followed celebrity unions of the 21st century — the marriage of a reality TV superstar and a hip-hop and fashion phenomenon with four kids, a vast fortune to split and even more fame.
Comey quoted Trump ask saying, I may order you to investigate that.
The ruling, which was signed by 50 Pakistani clerics, declares that normal men and women can also marry such transgender people as have clear indications on their body.

The bill to legalise marriage between homosexual couples was originally set to provide taxpayer-funded treatment to extend PMA to women living together as partners, a measure still demanded by LGBT activists and prominent left wing figures in France.
Amid rising violence and welfare use among immigrant Muslims, a September 2016 poll showed that half of all Australians want to block Muslim immigration, which is strongly supported by business groups which profit from the inflow of extra consumers and lower-cost workers.
Cardinal Cupich, a persistent critic of President Trump during his four years in office, issued his own separate statement warmly welcoming President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. In the statement, Cupich refrains from mentioning issues where Biden's platform directly contradicts Church teaching, such as abortion, school choice, gender issues, and religious liberty.
In 2016, the Pontifical Academy invited Bernie Sanders to speak to its members, an invitation Sanders attributed to the close alignment of his political message with that of Pope Francis.
Having separate boys' and girls' sports has always been based on biological differences, not what people believe about their gender, because those differences matter for fair competition. And forcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics. Connecticut's policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.
Daily News columnist Linda Stasi is using the Roseanne Barr Excuse in her defense after publicly attacking Fox News star Kimberly Guilfoyle with a racial slur. But because Stasi is a Trump-hating leftist, and the establishment media have no ethical or professional standards, Stasi still has a job.
Depp's team has vehemently denied that the actor abused Heard, with the actor's high-powered attorney, Laura Wasser, flatly stating last week that the actress invented the abuse claims to gain a financial upper hand in divorce proceedings.
I was shocked to learn of these anonymous and hurtful allegations, said Hefner in a statement reportedly released by his attorney. To my knowledge, no one has complained to me or any political or governmental authority about these allegations which are now surfacing years afterward. As one can imagine, it is incredibly difficult to respond to allegations by unnamed and unidentified individuals that involve an extended period of time, particularly in the current environment.
A Washington Post characterization of Comey's memoir reported:

What people forget is that he did grow up under very difficult circumstances. He went to Eureka College [in Illinois], played football, and almost instantly became a big radio star in the Midwest. He worked for WHO, the big radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, and he recreated the Chicago Cubs baseball games. He got a great interest in horseback riding. So he was a glamorous figure by those standards. And then he went to the West Coast to cover the Cubs in spring training, and somebody said to him, 'You ought to take a crack at Hollywood.' And he became a contract player for Universal Pictures. This was all before he was 30. So he had a rocket ride to some considerable success at that time. That would have been in those moments that would have been the American dream fulfilled.
The former vice president's campaign also says the Catholic vision includes protecting the dignity of unions:
On Monday, an ongoing educator sexual misconduct case concluded when U.S. District Judge Amos L. Mazzant sentenced former north Texas elementary school principal Oscar Figueroa to 10 years in federal prison and ordered him to pay $17,600 in fines and assessments, U.S. Attorney John M. Bales announced. Breitbart Texas first reported on Figueroa, 47, last year after officials charged him with one count of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.
The Obama administration began lifting restrictions on women serving in the combat arms, and services have been slowly implementing those policies.
The leader of the Episcopal Church has quoted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on the redemptive power of love as he blessed the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
[The school] has devolved into a cesspool of toxic, exploitive, biased and self-serving senior officers who are bolstered by submissive, sycophantic, and just-as-culpable enlisted leaders, the email said. They have doggedly succeeded in two things; furthering their careers, and ensuring that Special Forces [are] more prolific but dangerously less capable than ever before.
To begin with, his bitter attack on Graham makes no sense. It's a word salad of imperious gibberish designed only to appeal to the mindless mob that drives his sour tribe and Jake Tapper's TV bookers.
While their marriage was extremely high profile in some ways as two experts in self-promotion became a team, the two did not appear together in public all that frequently. And the inner workings of their marriage were usually a well-guarded secret that took years to spill out into public view. On Keeping Up with the Kardashians, West appeared only occasionally, mostly serving as an oft-discussed off-screen character, and unlike other Kardashian couplings, viewers didn't see even made-for-TV versions of fights or especially tender moments.
But the Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body which gives advice to parliament on the compatibility of laws with Sharia, appeared to slap down the legislation after deeming it un-Islamic and blasphemous, according to Agence France Presse. It had already handed down a similar ruling in 2014. The council has garnered opprobrium in the past. In 2013, reports AFP, it suggested making DNA inadmissible evidence in rape cases, instead calling for the revival of an Islamic law that makes it mandatory for a survivor to provide four witnesses to back their claims.
Stone described the financial burden of combating the Mueller-led operation's charges against him.
Colin Kaepernick who seems to have the unequivocal support of Corporate America calls the Fourth of July an example of white supremacy. So you'd better put away the fireworks and the hotdogs.

Dr. Jill Biden, the former second lady of the United States, misstated the number of grandchildren she has with her husband, Joe, during a virtual town hall over the weekend.
The U.S. State Department's most recent annual report on Human Trafficking (2020) points to mass migration as one of the primary causes of trafficking because of the huge economic interests behind people smuggling and the difficulty involved in properly regulating the influx of large numbers of people, many of whom fall through the cracks and wind up as victims of trafficking.
Critics of the campaign, including Bedouin women opposed to polygamy, mistrust the government's motives and the timing of the campaign. It's simple: polygamy means more Bedouin children, and that means more demographic concerns from a Zionist perspective, says human rights lawyer Rawia Aburabia.
Melanie Israel of the Heritage Foundation explained Monday at the Daily Signal that, under the legislation, parental rights could take a far back seat to mandated school programs:
Springsteen reportedly told the judge he can immediately pay the fine.
Ma, who revealed his membership in the Communist Party last year despite his status as the wealthiest man in China, appeared to be doing his part to help the government promote fertility while officiating a mass wedding of his employees, a tradition that occurs every May 10, Ali Day. Ma has previously promoted a 996 work week – 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week – a brutal schedule his detractors and human rights advocates have called abusive and deadly. He told newlyweds that marriage has its own rigorous 669 schedule: sex six days a week, with duration being the key. He reportedly did not specify what the 9 stood for in his remarks, other than an extended session.
Since then, neither Joe Biden or his wife have commented on or acknowledged Roberts and the child. This was exhibited as most recently as March 27—one day before Hunter's child with Cohen was born—when the former vice president took part in a CNN town hall on the Coronavirus.
It's about the founding ideals that have led to this country haltingly but inexorably in the direction of fairness, inclusion and equality for all Americans.
On Wednesday, May 31, Tennes filed a federal lawsuit against the city of East Lansing seeking his reinstatement at the market. According to the lawsuit, Country Mill is the only business to have been prohibited under the market's anti-discrimination policy.
Shockingly, more and more evidence is coming out about celebrity and mommy bloggers being wrong. Perhaps Breitbart readers don't take them seriously, but millions of women do. Recently, Think Progress (yes, you read that right) questioned Gwyneth Paltrow's scientific prowess. They interviewed Timothy Caulfield, author of Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything? When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash, about the celebrity pseudoscience culture. From the interview:
The Old Vic theater said after Finney's death that his performances in plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov and other iconic playwrights throughout the '60s, '70s and '80s stand apart as some of the greatest in our 200-year history.
Anthony and Asia had a free relationship, McGowan wrote, they loved without borders of traditional relationships, and they established the parameters of their relationship early on.
Why does the word 'homosexuality' never appear in recent official documents of the Holy See? asked Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò in a recent symposium. This is by no means to suggest that most of those with a homosexual inclination are abusers, but the fact remains that the overwhelming majority of abuse has been inflicted on post-pubescent boys by homosexual clerics.
A feared cartel lord issued threats of car bombs targeting civilians in Central Mexico one day after authorities arrested his mistress and some associates.
The ten U.S. mayors attending the event were Bill de Blasio of New York, Charlie Hales of Portland (OR), Marty Walsh of Boston, Ed Murray of Seattle, Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, Betsy Hodges of Minneapolis, Matt Appelbaum of Boulder, William Bell of Birmingham, Sam Liccardo of San José, and Ed Lee of San Francisco.
The explosive admission came as the Iowa Republican and her now ex-husband, Gail, are lobbing serious accusations at each other in recently released court filings. The divorce documents detail what was an increasingly dysfunctional marriage, which included allegations of extramarital affairs and physical abuse.
In Wang vs. Kansas State, the case involved a cancer-stricken professor. You wrote an opinion that noted that EEOC guidance commands deference, quote, only to the extent its reasoning actually proves persuasive.
8:18 PM: Sanders, when asked if he would deploy the military, says he would use all disposable tools. He says the New York did the right thing calling up the National Guard. Sanders goes right back to talking about the economic fallout. He asks what happens to workers who will lose their jobs after restaurants are shut down. He says if Trump can provide $1.5 trillion to the banks, workers should get a check to be made whole.
But across Germany, hostility to asylum seekers has been on the rise since groups of foreigners — mostly young men from northern Africa — robbed and groped dozens of women on New Year's Eve in Cologne. Most of the hostility targets young male asylum-seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, who make up the majority of the migrants reshaping Germany. Last year alone, 890,000 people applied for asylum, with hundreds of thousands more applying this year.
One thing Fidel Castro did do is they have the highest literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here even though we're fully capable of doing that, Kaepernick told Salguero.
Some critics are angry because Laurie Holden's character admits to feeling guilty, feeling like a racist over what's happening to her daughter and what she fears will happen to her daughter.

The proceeds of the evening, according to the program, will help fund the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra's mission of providing all of our regular concerts free to the public and expanding our educational programs.
In the 1991 case Kreimer v. Morristown, a Carter-appointed federal district judge, H. Lee Sarokin, ruled that a public library's discrimination against smelly, frightening homeless people violated the equal protection clause because it had a disparate impact on people who refuse to bathe compared to those who bathe regularly. Three years later, President Clinton promoted him to an appellate judgeship. (The judge, not the homeless person.)
David Sternberg alleged at the Powerline blog last year that Elmi is Omar's brother, and that she was brought to the U.S. as a refugee by another family, using their surname instead of her own.

Breitbart reported on May 10 that students at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, jeered, booed and turned their backs on Education Secretary DeVos during her commencement speech. The heckling continued during her speech, and the university president eventually interrupted the speech saying, If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you!
Immigration polls which ask people to pick a priority, or to decide which options are fair, show that voters in the polling booth put a high priority on helping their families and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech, high-immigration, low-wage economy. Those results are very different from the Nation of Immigrants polls which are funded by CEOs and progressives, and which pressure Americans to say they welcome migrants.

He writes Tyagi's The Song of Sparrows has film credits that read like who's who of prominent Iranian government institutions. For example, there is a thank-you to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force.
And then, as a kind of capper, later in the day, on January 24, came that latest Journal article, the one we saw earlier, the one that reported, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have evidence indicating Jeff Bezos' girlfriend provided text messages to her brother that he then sold to the National Enquirer for its article about the Amazon.com Inc. founder's affair, according to people familiar with the matter.
Stone considered Tapper's comment as innuendo-laden. He said, Look, I'm a libertarian. I think people know that. I'm a long-time supporter of same-sex marriage, of the legalization of marijuana. I'm a libertarian conservative. I'm not a social conservative. People know that. My private life is my private life. I'm married and I have two children, five grandchildren, and our business is our business.
Secret Sisterhood founder Jacquie Love said the protest was held to urge the Australian government to recognize Alqunun's plight, and that of oppressed women everywhere.

Over the course of the last week, President Biden has been stressing the need for unity – but his actions since taking office are all about demanding uniformity, Daly wrote. There appears to be no room for convictional disagreement.You will comply – or be silenced.
Overall, in the week and a half time span between December 6 and December 17, Unite the Country spent more than $1.19 million to boost Biden's position in Iowa. It is unclear exactly how the PAC was able to raise such a large amount of money since launching on October 28. Reports of how much the group raised and spent have yet to be released by the FEC, provided they were filed by the appropriate campaign finance deadline.

Lord Green also argues that Britain should eschew an Australian points-based system if it wants to reduce immigration and instead adopt a tough system of work permits confined to the highly skilled while, as far as possible, preserving free movement in both directions for other purposes.
We have to talk about the N-word and we have to talk about why white men are so privileged in this country.
This same media are describing peaceful protests by Tea Partiers and those ravaged by anti-science lockdowns as dangerous and violent.
Why should a Constitutionally enumerated right be treated differently? It should in no way be treated differently and no law-abiding citizen should ever be forced to be defenseless no matter where or for what reason they travel in this country. HR 38 is a bill that is long overdue, as the time is now to rectify many states' reluctance to allow all law-abiding citizens the right to self-protection no matter where they may travel.

He says we need to move aggressively to make sure everyone with symptoms understands they will get all the health care they need. He talks about moving aggressively to get ventilators and test kits.

The lawsuit notes that Catholic Social Services has partnered with the City for decades to place foster children in stable, loving homes and has a proven track record of compassion, quality, and success. On an average day, Catholic Social Services serves more than 120 children in foster care, and it supervises around 100 different foster homes, it says, for a total service of more than 2,200 at-risk children in Philadelphia last year alone.
According to the report, Father Claude Barthe, editor of Catholic Res Novae, observed that de Metz-Noblat has participated in the process of reworking the baptismal forms since 2013, when same-sex marriage and child adoption were legalized in France.
It is ironic as it is perverse, that the Reporter, which is quick to judge others for the clergy sexual abuse scandal, denies its own role in contributing to it. To be specific, its relentless attacks on the Church's teaching on sexuality enabled sick men to justify their homosexual assaults.
It is hateful conduct to turn our backs on suffering people and on the causes of their suffering.
Allied stars Pitt as Max Vatan, who meets and falls for French resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) in 1942 Casablanca while working undercover to assassinate a German officer.
According to the Harris County Court's probable cause document, the relationship began over Instagram, where Milton purportedly said he was in an unhappy marriage and he was available to date. The alleged victim admitted to authorities she had a crush on her teacher, who also was a photographer. On April 19, 2015, he took her senior pictures at Houston's Cullen Sculpture Garden. A sudden rain storm led them to his car for shelter. There, they kissed and fondled each other. The teen told police after this encounter she would try to spend time with him in the classroom.
Markle waved for the cameras as the car she was traveling in, a vintage Rolls-Royce, drove past Saturday. She appeared to be wearing a white dress and a long veil.
In his remarkably prescient 2015 dissent in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito predicted that after the Court's woeful decision proponents of a traditional understanding of marriage would be pilloried despite the Court's assurances that rights to freedom of conscience would be respected.

King turned out the pro-Sessions op-ed quickly after Jordan and Meadows put out a message in the same pages claiming Sessions has no control of the FBI and that a new attorney general is needed. Much of these House Freedom Caucus members' argument is based on Sessions's decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.
Of course, nobody is accusing Bezos and his global company, Amazon, of doing anything like what Blofeld and his international outfit, SPECTRE, were imagined to be up to.
In a similar vein, a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal argued that the Church's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been underwhelming while adding that the clergy are failing the faithful amid this crisis.

Second is Eric Murphy, who was confirmed 52-46 on March 7. Murphy is the solicitor general of Ohio, and well known as a stalwart conservative. Liberals attacked him for a host of reasons, including defending Ohio's law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. (Defending state laws against legal challenges is a central part of the job of any solicitor general.) He formerly clerked for a prominent judge on the Fourth Circuit and then for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.

These included seeing Islam as barbaric, irrational or sexist (Class 3). Considering Islam to be violent, aggressive, threatening or supportive of terrorism, were also guilty signs (Class 4). Even thinking of Islam as a political ideology (Class 5), or unlikely to be subject to moderation and reform (Class 1), were all part of the newly identified – and named – form of bigotry.

Here we go again – an irrelevant late-night talk show host mocking the First Lady, when her main focus is serving the American people, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a comment to the Daily Caller.

Buttigieg is smart enough to know that voters are tired of the public attacks on Christians and Christianity — hence his recent defense of Chick-fil-A, noting that while he disagrees with its owners' views, he dislikes virtue signaling.
Finally, on Sunday's edition of NBC News' Meet the Press, Buttigieg accused evangelical Christians of unbelievable hypocrisy for voting for Trump: It's something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that's not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church were it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you're supposed to conduct yourself.

Fifteen years ago, gay marriage was inconceivable. Look at what we've accepted since. The Supreme Court, by fiat, made gay marriage the law of the land. You can get blacklisted and become unemployable for opposing same-sex marriage or for refusing to believe a woman can magically transform into a man. And it's deemed appropriate to allow a mentally ill guy in a dress to share a locker room with your daughter.
According to Viganò, the underlying reason why there are so many victims of clerical sex abuse is the corrupting influence of homosexuality in the priesthood and in the hierarchy.
We are really benefiting from the class, Kadib al Ban said. The teacher is telling us how German women think, how to talk to them … and understand their traditions.

Twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also launched a podcast ahead of the 2020 presidential election titled You and Me Both with Hillary Clinton, interviewing a range of personalities, from activist Gloria Steinem to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

Fact: All single-sex spaces will be open to both sexes under the Equality Act. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity rules to Title III of the Civil Rights Act on public facilities as well as to public accommodations (Title II) and federal funding (Title VI). This would create a nationwide transgender policy in single-sex facilities …
All of this nonsense surrounds the perfectly legal hush money President Trump paid to porn star Stormy Daniels. She blackmailed the president during the campaign and threatened to go public with the claim the two of them had a one night stand a dozen years ago.
Obama traced the history of Biden's nearly half-century-long political career, from chairing the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees to the cancer moonshot effort he started recently and plans to continue. Obama praised his vice president for his work on the economic stimulus, middle-class issues and curbing violence against women.
Since Jonah brings up Trump's three marriages let me ask the question: who can see inside another person's marriage? I thought, moreover, that since Reagan, who had two wives, entered the White House and performed as a conservative hero, Republicans would have gotten over their puritanical prejudices. All politicians have flawed characters. It's the nature of the job, which requires compromises, prevarications, dirty deals, and the like.

But my point is, is the definition of progressive now seems to be changing. That is, Are you a socialist? Well, that's a real progressive. Or you believe in, whatever. So I was talking about up until this last time around the traditional judgments of whether or not you were, quote, a liberal, was whether or not — what your positions on race were; on women; what's your position on LGBT community; what's your positions on civil liberties, you know.

Stone went on, Matthew Whitaker seems to me to be a good man. He's got authority to act, right now. He has an out of control federal prosecutor who he could limit to Russian collusion based on previous legal decisions, but he doesn't seem to do so.
Immigration polls which ask people to pick a priority, or to decide which options are fair, show that voters in the polling booth put a high priority on helping their families and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech, high-immigration, low-wage economy.

Over the last century in the Church there has been a great blossoming of studies that seek to understand exactly what Jesus meant to say… That is not relativism, but attests that the word is relative, the Gospel is written by human beings, it is accepted by the Church which is made up of human persons… So it is true that no one can change the word of Jesus, but one must know what it was!
I'm also pleased for what this means about our church and the way we have been able to do this. But obviously any change like this creates pain and hurt in some as well, so as a bishop of the church I feel for them.

The Equality Act could lead to changes in school curricula, such as texts that affirm and promote controversial sexual orientation and gender identity viewpoints.

We are proud that NARAL's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. We know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways.

When Joe Biden fell short of that commitment, supporting the discriminatory Hyde Amendment, we pushed him along with our partners committed to reproductive justice. We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.

Buttigieg said, When I was younger I would have done anything to not be gay. When I began to realize what it meant that I felt the way I did about people I saw in the hallway at school or the dining hall at college, I launched in me something I can only describe as a kind of war. And if that war had been settled on the terms that I wished for when I was 15 or 20 or frankly even 25, I would not be standing here. If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would have swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water. It's a hard thing to think about now. It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life if you showed me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife. The reason it's so awful to think about isn't just the knowledge that so many young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality or gender identity do just that, they harm themselves figuratively or literally. But the real reason it's so hard to think about is if I had had a chance to do that, I wouldn't have found my way to Chasten. The best thing in my life, my marriage, might not have happened at all.

The Equality Act could also be used to override states that have prohibited sexual orientation and gender identity curricula. Where states have conversely mandated sexual orientation and gender identity curricula, parents and schools do not have access to opt-out options.

Yet soon, new elements entered into the picture. In February 2019, the month after the Enquirer stories ran, Bezos escalated the story by telling his version of it; he posted an article under his own name, declaring that the Enquirer had tried to use extortion and blackmail on him. That allegation was hot enough right there, but then Bezos got even hotter. Citing the work of his hired security expert, Gavin de Becker, he intimated that perhaps Trump and the government of Saudi Arabia were in cahoots with the Enquirer, as part of some larger nefarious plot against the Seattle mogul.

Barbara Bush blamed Donald Trump for her heart attack. It wasn't technically a heart attack, though she called it that. It was a crisis in her long battle with congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease that hit her like a sledgehammer one day in June 2016. An ambulance was called to take her to the hospital. The two former presidents who had been at home with her that day, her husband and her oldest son, trailed in a car driven by the Secret Service. The tumultuous presidential campaign in general and Trump's ridicule of son Jeb Bush in particular had riled her. Angst, she told me. Afterward, Jeb, whose presidential campaign was already history, urged her to let it go, to focus on herself and have faith in the country. There's just a lot of angst among those distressed by President Trump's leadership, Jeb Bush told me, using the same word that his mother had used. So I think one of the solutions is don't watch it; don't obsess. Jeb said, 'Mom, don't worry about things you can't do anything about,'  Barbara Bush recalled. He's right. Just do good, make life better for someone else.
There are no nationwide statistics on child marriage, but data from a few states suggests it is far from rare. State laws generally set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, yet every state allows exceptions. Most states let 16- and 17-year-olds marry if they have parental consent, and several states — including New York, Virginia and Maryland — allow children under 16 to marry with court permission.

Under the rotational system, the Sultan of Pahang state, Ahmad Shah, is next in line although the sultan is ailing according to local media, a rumour the palace has strenuously denied. Johor's Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar and Sultan Nazrin Shah of Perak, who is currently the deputy king and is carrying out the functions of the king until a new one is elected, are the next two names in the rotational system. Although the functions of the king are largely ceremonial, he also serves to safeguard Islam in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and must assent to the appointment of individuals for various senior government roles including that of prime minister. Under the constitution, there are only three instances in which the ruler who is next on the list can be denied the position: if the royal is a minor, if the Conference of Rulers by secret ballot resolves that he is unsuitable by reason of infirmity of mind or body or any other cause to exercise the functions of king, or if he declines to take the position. The ballot would then move to the next ruler on the list. In 2016, the Sultan of Johor claimed he had been offered the role of king, bypassing both Kelantan – Muhammad V's home state – and Pahang, saying he had rejected the offer out of respect for the rotational system.

I think that's true. She was, she didn't let this on to him, but she was terrified whenever he went out, because she saw just how vulnerable he was, even with all that protection. He was such an important part of her life from a personal point of view. She was very anxious about it. But they got through it. She didn't show that anxiety to the public, and she was greatly relieved when he was able to leave office on his own two feet, as it were. And then, of course, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and wrote that very, very touching letter to the American people, hand written, and then she went on to live with him in that condition. He had to have her at his side, at night, for example, or he would get agitated, and she was there, and never complained. I had quite a strong personal relationship with her by then, and I would not bring that up, and she would not… there was never a hint of a complaint from her about the life she had been reduced to.

Goldberg worked on two key cases: Lawrence v. Texas, which overturned a Texas law banning sodomy, and Romer v. Evans, in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Colorado voter-approved law that did not provide protective status to the identity of sexual orientation.
Further, a jaw-dropping 57 percent of non-working white males in the same age bracket are now collecting disability benefits. Some of them are receiving benefits from multiple government programs. Almost half of the men who have dropped out of the labor force are taking some form of pain medication on a daily basis, according to a 2016 study cited in the article.
The President of the United States is an unapologetic White Nationalist who is inspiring the wholesale slaughter of American citizens.
One Australian politician has already said the move besmirched the game and it's tantamount to seeping sewage into a debutante ball. North Queensland Member of Parliament Bob Katter then added:
Aretha Louise Franklin was born March 25, 1942, in Memphis, Tennessee. The Rev. C.L. Franklin soon moved his family to Buffalo, New York, then to Detroit, where the Franklins settled after the marriage of Aretha's parents collapsed and her mother (and reputed sound-alike) Barbara returned to Buffalo.
Amin, now 29, said she was betrothed to her first cousin Tariq when she was just 8 and he was 21. The petition was eventually terminated after she ran away. She said the ordeal cost her a childhood. She was in and out of foster care and group homes, and it took a while to get her life on track.
The founder of the Ruth Institute, a pro-family nonprofit that teaches about the poisonous consequences of the Sexual Revolution, says disgraced Hollywood magnate Harvey Weinstein and Archbishop Theodore McCarrick have both lived by the sexual revolutionary creed.
Pope Francis has done more to divide Catholics than any pope in 150 years. He has clouded the Church's teaching on marriage and sexuality. Francis has thrown out the clear, recent teaching of two of his immediate predecessors — which echoed Church practice and preaching for 2000 years. He has politicized the papacy, using its bully pulpit to further crudely crafted left-wing talking points on everything from the economy to immigration to climate science. He has marginalized and punished his critics, to the point that a new book calls him the Dictator Pope. Now he's defending his handpicked lieutenant, Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga. That Honduran leftist (and anti-Semite) is accused of massive corruption that benefited him personally, to the tune of $40,000 per month. Other favorites of Pope Francis include the disgraced Belgian Cardinal Wilfrid Daneels — who was caught on tape trying to silence a sex abuse victim — and LGBT advocate Fr. James Martin, SJ.
Ted Cruz's failure to get the GOP nomination, Matthew Sheffield proclaims in Salon, is a perfect window into trends that will set the pace of American politics for decades to come: Americans are moving away from Christianity, including people most likely to vote Republican.
France launched a national consultation online in December, following calls for more direct democracy.

Democrats walk out in protest when pastor's opening prayer in Virginia House condemns abortion, gay marriage https://t.co/UhuaIgrufg — TheBlaze (@theblaze) February 13, 2020
Some of the most interesting, and horrible, passages of Bailey's account concern the demise of families. Young people in their 20s and 30s are described as strung out and walking around like zombies instead of working and raising their children. Their parents failed to pass along parenting skills, and the moral imperative to use them. Instead, the cycle of drug addiction is the most likely inheritance for kids to get from their families. Evidently, almost half the children in the country are living with someone other than their biological parents—often grandparents or other family members, stepping in to raise the children of broken homes. Seventy-seven percent of these children live in households where no one has a job.
The National Secular Society raised concern over the group's activities to the Langley Academy and highlighted in January that IslamHood had hosted speakers such as Imran Ibn Mansur and Haitham al-Haddad, both widely regarded as advocates of extremist forms of Islam.

Pope Francis stressed the importance of the natural family Monday, insisting it is based on the marriage between one man and one woman.
In case Camosy's tone of moral superiority had not been detected by this point in his column, he added:
Durbin slammed Trump's policies without explaining — or being asked by NPR to explain — what is objectionable about Trump's view of America, where borders are deemed vital.
On issue after issue, Donald Trump creates a crisis, blames others for what's happening, and uses the ensuing chaos to demand a legislative solution that often harms even more people.
We are currently not meeting our production numbers. The restructuring of the 85th [Civil Affairs] Brigade has created an imbalanced CA force structure. And our recruitment is down. If something doesn't change soon, we will short the operational force drastically over the next five years, he said.
Others on social media stated they hoped Bloomberg's writer had already cashed that check.
Comey apparently also did not inform Trump that his own FBI had determined the dossier to be only minimally corroborated, as documented by a four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority.

If trump's base, the most extreme right wingers since the Nazis, would just stop and look at the financial damage inflicted on them by the GOP, I believe they'd join the fight. The GOP is asking their base a question right now…would you rather hate or eat?
The actor maintained a healthy skepticism about the British establishment and even turned down a knighthood when it was offered, declining to become Sir Albert. Finney once said he didn't believe in such honors.

So of course Democrats want to abolish the police and confiscate our guns.
When Congress wrote only through the enactment of a state law can unlawfully present aliens receive benefits, that is precisely what it meant. This means the exercise of state legislative power. … The Regents argue this is not what Congress really meant, but rather it meant any exercise of state lawmaking power, be it legislative, executive, judicial, or by independent board. Those arguments are unavailing. Congress' unique word choices and other evidence of Congressional intent behind [the federal law] prove that the statute is limited to representative or democratic state legislative acts only. UC Regents officials think they can rewrite the law according to their personal whims and provide illegal aliens in-state tuition benefits contrary to law. Public officials on the UC Board of Regents need to put aside politics and obey both federal law and the California Constitution. They have no right to play politics at taxpayers' expense.

Greg Steube.
Leftover women — most of whom reside in Chinese urban centers and are highly educated — should not feel afraid to go and live in rural villages, according to Wu Xiuming, the deputy secretary-general of the Shanxi Think Tank Development Association, a non-governmental organization in central China specializing in social development research. He further suggested that Chinese government officials encourage urban women to migrate to rural areas to find husbands by offering programs that incentivize the move.

In 2009, Carlson called the charges against Jeff bullshit, arguing that arranging a marriage between a 16-year-old and a 27-year-old is not the same as pulling a stranger off the street and raping her.

Before anyone starts accusing me of judging Just Mercy from a partisan political angle, let me point out two things: 1) I never judge movies based on politics, and 2) I happen to agree with the politics of Just Mercy.
Home Secretary Priti Patel, who has styled herself as tough on crime, illegal immigration, and foreign criminals even as crime rises, illegal immigration increases, and deportations fall dramatically, struggled even to get a promised Home Office report on the ethnicity of grooming gangs published — and when it did come out it represented a huge step backwards from previous probes, such as the Alexis Jay report.

The Islamic Defenders Front went a step further, calling the entire celebration immoral, with or without sex parties.
The other two confirmations were for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

Mass incarcerations, especially of black males, is a myth. Look, the Democrats did this. They have screwed this country up. They screwed it up with failed, liberal urban polices. Clarke added his belief that the Democrats did this because while the country is discussing ways to break the cycle of poverty, they call for more programs, more government intervention, and more spending of your tax dollars.
Last week, photographs of Amber Heard's bruised and bloodied face were published by People magazine. The photos were reportedly taken during an alleged violent incident in December 2015.
This also holds true for open borders fanatics in the mainstream media, who falsely and deceptively labeled our organization and opposition to Sharia as anti-Muslim, or even white-supremacist. Right, because a group that stands unwaveringly with Israel and has an Arab woman as its President used an openly gay man to organize a march that included Muslims to advance some white supremacist agenda.

Indeed, Kelly McBride of the Poynter Center, a journalism think tank, said of Bezos, I think he changed the first line of his obituary from Silicon Valley billionaire to First Amendment defender.
This bill harms people in so many ways – destroying safe spaces for women, undermining women-owned business, intimidating the free exercise of conscience. But let me concentrate on only one aspect — the destructive impact it has on women's' sports. Wherever these laws are imposed, biological males have begun to dominate women's competition. Listen to 16-year-old Celina Soul of Connecticut: Eight of us lined up at the starting line, but when six of us were only 3.4 into the race, two girls were already across the finish line. What just happened? Two boys identifying as girls happened. Fair is no longer the norm. The chance to advance, the chance to win has been all over for us. I missed the chance to compete in the NE championship this past season because of this … this policy will take away our medals, record, scholarships, and dreams.

It seems a very important intellectual moment in bringing together these sort of two strands of Conservatism that have emerged in Southern California. On the one hand, this idea from the Claremont Institute — that the United States was founded as sort of an expression of ancient political theory coming from Aristotle and people like that. And that we're in serious trouble with the rise of Progressive Liberal Government in the 20th Century. And on the other hand, sort of Andrew Breitbart's idea that culture is ahead of politics — that you had to create a media vehicle that sort of spoke to people where they are — and bring them along politically after that. And it struck me that was very obviously the formula for Trump…
Statistics in the country regarding the phenomenon vary greatly, even among government ministries. In 2014, the Saudi Planning Ministry reported three million single men and women, double the number from 2010. The Saudi General Authority for Statistics reported in 2016 that the number of single women above the age of 15 was approximately 2.3 million, but noted that unmarried women aged 32 or older only numbered 230,000. Saudi law, which forbids women from driving, permits polygamy – as does Islam.
This year with Democrats controlling the Senate and the Presidency, the bill has at least a non-zero chance at becoming law. Do 10 Senate Republicans defect to get it past the filibuster?

Iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, ranging from issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody, to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators, Human Rights Watch declared a year later, noting that the violation of women's rights extended outside the typical venues — family rights, the right to work, medical rights — into realms like the prohibition on women watching sports in public arenas.
Many patients want to be excused for their current predicament because of events that have occurred in their childhood. That's what psychiatry has become in America. Visit any shopping mall or ethnic pride parade to witness the results.
I had heard the rumor since 1991. An off-duty Dallas police officer who traveled with the Cowboys and worked security at their hotels first told me that 'the word on the street' was that Troy Aikman was gay. Over the next four years, I heard the rumor from two more police officers who worked around the team (and I know they mentioned it to team officials). One officer told me Aikman 'was supposed to be' having a relationship with a male member of a country-western band.

The practice involves the cutting or removal of female sexual organs and is used as a misguided preventative measure to keep women from having sex before marriage, according to Breitbart News. While many of the cases occur among Muslim families, FGM is not exclusive to Islam and much more common in Africa than in any other part of the world. Often, the procedure occurs in areas with limited hygiene and a lack of medical supplies, and is done by senior tribal members or other non-medical professionals.

The argument suggests that the progressive do not listen to the public's opposition to the predictable social and economic harms of their favored policies — such as girls who slice off their breasts, foreigners who die in the Hunger Games migration, and discarded Americans pushed toward opioid deaths.
One is to just change your ideas and make them more conservative. The second is to sort of be sneaky and try to make it seem like your ideas are more conservative than they are. And the third, the approach that I favor, is to stick to your ideas, but explain why conservatives shouldn't be afraid of them.
Argento, who was best known in her native Rome as an actress and director, also became a household name through her #MeToo activism, which culminated in May when she earned rapturous applause at Cannes for a speech blistering the foo-foo film festival as a hunting ground for rapists.

Lurasetti and Ridgeman are caught on video mildly (at least when compared to Rodney King or what we usually see in movies) roughing up a big-time, Hispanic drug dealer. In a terrific scene, their boss (and Ridgeman's former partner — played by the great Don Johnson) explains the sorry ways of a sorry world — a world where the entertainment industry we now call the news media needs a villain, where the handling of every perceived intolerance is done with total intolerance.

On Tuesday, an anonymous friend of Heard's alleged that Depp regularly assaulted his wife in drunken fits of rage.
International observers wishing to claim that China has somehow become capitalist have long upheld Ma as an example of a self-made entrepreneur. Yet Ma, like every Chinese executive, is a lifelong member of the Communist Party, a revelation he made in late 2018. Chinese state media rapidly came to his defense, publishing pieces challenging centuries of Marxist thought by claiming there is no conflict at all between being a Party member and doing business.

Next year will be our 25th season, silver anniversary, and CBS sort of felt, I think, they wanted to optimally utilize the repeats of my program, she continued. Because now they have 25 years of reruns. So what they decided to do was to sell a couple of years worth of reruns. But I'm not tired, so Judy Justice will be coming out a year later.
And now comes that big new Washington Post story, the one painting Michael Sanchez as a schemer and a conniver, and perhaps also a bit crazy. The Post quotes Sanchez, who seemed, bizarrely enough, to be happy to share with the Bezos-owned publication:
One of the threats was sent to top officials via electronic message. Breitbart Texas obtained the statement in its entirety:

Normally, I don't read reviews until mine is complete. Only the film should inform my perspective. Unsure I'd have access to Dragged (thankfully it was also released on VOD), I took a peek at what others are saying and came away with one overall impression: while most critics gave it a passing grade, many of these so-called progressives who condemned the film as racist exposed their own latent racism with all their talk about Dragged's two stars.
Something else we have just learned, something confirmed by both the New York Times and Argento, is that Bourdain knew Argento had settled an underage sexual assault claim against her for $380,000 in November of 2017, just one month after Argento helped launch the #MeToo movement.

The number, though, is inaccurate. The Bidens, in fact, have seven grandchildren in total. Two are from their late-son Beau's marriage to Hallie Olivere, while five are from their son Hunter's various relationships.

The Global Times obliquely referred to the unbalanced sex ratio of Chinese people as another factor in declining birth rates.

The strange antidote is one of several unflattering details to have emerged regarding O'Rourke's past since officially launching his campaign last Thursday. In recent days, the candidate confirmed to Reuters that he was a member of a controversial hacker group the Cult of the Dead Cow while he was a teenager. He also admitted to penning a murder fantasy at 15-years-old in which he imagined mowing down children out jealousy for their happiness. O'Rourke was also forced to apologize on Friday for quipping during a campaign stop that he is only partly involved in raising his children.

The result is a wave of young and middle-aged people whose adult prospects are turned off, who tune out from their local civic society, who have nothing in their lives to inspire or sustain them, so they accept the federal government's invite to drop by the Medicaid clinic for the temporary fix of cheap prescription medication, until they eventually kill themselves with stronger, deadlier heroin.

Yet socialism has somehow entered the mainstream of political debate. Suddenly, almost out of nowhere, we have these strange socialist characters — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Bernie Sanders — and a whole political party that seems magnetically drawn toward the socialist camp. This development by itself is surpassingly strange, because socialism is arguably the most discredited idea since slavery.

One of the main instances of bias Baltz identified is many articles on political topics, such as the Electoral College, citing men more than women to an extent he claims is disproportionate to their representation in the political science field. He stated of the dozen academic citations on the Electoral College's Wikipedia page, only one had a woman as the primary author. Baltz also criticized the article on democracy, stating only 10 percent of the works in the article's further reading section listed a woman as the first author. He cited similarly low percentages for articles on conservatism (11 percent), socialism (3 percent), and dictatorship (0 percent).

Bias from administrators in Wikipedia disputes is one factor frustrating attempts to balance site content. Narssarssuaq's efforts relating to Biden family corruption allegations were ultimately frustrated by an openly biased administrator who called the allegations Russian disinformation and threatened sanctions against Narssarssuaq citing numerous erroneous reasons. One editor interviewed by Fox noted another administrator favorably displays an anti-democratic quote from Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. This is apparently El C who previously used dubious reasoning to keep ICE detention facilities in a concentration camps list, echoing Democrat attacks against President Donald Trump's Administration. El C also recently expressed support for one editor's profile page suggesting Trump be hanged for treason.

The quest for the perfectly organized life is what suckers in millions of readers. Next thing you know they're taking science and political lessons from women who don't know much about either. The solution isn't to dismiss their huge audience, but to engage that audience. Let the left continue to treat women like one-dimensional insta-victims. Conservatives and libertarians need to offer an alternative women's media that encompasses lifestyle, pop culture, AND political news. That's just what I did.
Fraidy Reiss, who campaigns against coerced marriage as head of a group called Unchained at Last, researched data from her home state of New Jersey. She determined that nearly 4,000 minors, mostly girls, were married in the state from 1995 to 2012, including 178 who were under 15.

For a three-dollar Medicaid co-pay, therefore, addicts got pills priced at thousands of dollars, with the difference paid for by U.S. and state taxpayers. A user could turn around and sell those pills, obtained for that three-dollar co-pay, for as much as ten thousand dollars on the street.

While typically reflecting the Chinese government's party line and regurgitating belligerent state propaganda against the United States, the Global Times has printed comments from individuals referring to homosexuality as normal and natural, if only present among a small group of people.

I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in Sage [the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]. I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The Government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.

Either you believe in free markets or you don't.

One particular part of the speech stuck out especially. Now, we didn't support Joe Biden for President, you probably guessed that. But if we're being totally honest here, and we want to be honest, we have to say it was very hard to disagree with this specific part of the address. Watch.
That moment started with the January 9 announcement that he and his wife were getting a divorce.

HARRIS FAULKNER: The president has been in a pretty public battle this week with a group of Never Trump Republicans after they released an attack ad on his COVID-19 response. Now the co-founder of that group, your husband George Conway, warning in an op-ed: Trump's narcissism deadens any ability he might otherwise have to carry out the duties of a president in a manner that the constitution requires. He's so self-obsessed, he can only act for himself and not for the nation. It's why he was impeached and why he should have been removed from office. And it's why he reacts with such rage.

Yet there's also the undeniable magnetism of Bezos' money and power. That was the point of a February 8 column in the Seattle Times headlined, How Amazon gets whatever it wants. In the words of columnist Danny Westneat:
Last week, in an interview with USA Today, Buttigieg called Trump's Christian faith into question: I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God, he said. I just don't understand how you can be as worshipful of your own self as he is and be prepared to humble yourself before God, he added. Buttigieg later defended his remarks on ABC, saying he was attacking Trump's hypocrisy.
This is having a profound effect on American society. People are getting married later, which reduces the number of children they have. Women, in particular, delay marriage when they bear lots of student debt. And a significant number of people who say they do not want children cited student debt as the reason.
At this rate, it's only a matter of time before Jared gets rid of Trump. No wonder the media like him so much.

The American people, through Congress, have entrusted USCIS with the stewardship of our legal immigration programs that allow foreign nationals to visit, work, live, and seek refuge in the United States.

Despite such potential mental health problems associated with gender confusion, children who claim to be the opposite sex are now no longer legally permitted to see a therapist to get stabilizing conversion therapy in some states.

A man was walking in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Brian Wendling initially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene. Police were investigating and didn't identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.
EPPC Fellow Mary Rice Hasson commented on the far-reaching consequences of passage of the Equality Act, warning the measure would extend the federal octopus into almost every aspect of Americans' lives, imposing 'gender identity' requirements that effectively snuff out the sex-based rights of females, endanger parental rights, and silence religious believers in the public square.
This is a disgrace, all those (men) who wear earrings and are happy about it, he said. The security forces should arrest those who raised the flag of the perverts.
The bill's authors made clear that gender identity is to take precedence over and replace sex as a protected category. The bill doesn't mention individuals with clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria, or undertaking surgical or hormonal transition, thus making clear that self-declared gender identity would be sufficient to claim protected legal status.
Women's rights groups also criticized the agency, which is similar to a religious affairs ministry, accusing it of trying to legitimize child abuse and urging Diyanet to get their hands off our children.

I'm sure Maa Ganga will take care of their safety, he said, referring to the Hindu goddess of the Ganges River, considered sacred in the Hindu religion.

Tony's older sister Janice (Aida Turturro) is another wonderful archetype, the malevolent hippie — the parasite and welfare cheat who hides behind her precious causes and disabilities, the phony who is all about peace, love, feminism, so cool and easygoing, when she is really a black hole of need, malice, and hypocrisy.

While this is far from declaring a victory given the persistent risks and challenges ahead, the move on Wednesday marks the biggest step yet for not just Wuhan but the entire world since the outbreak. It is a moment when Wuhan residents can finally shout out to the world: We are back! It is a moment that shows the world that we can beat this common enemy, though we have to pay a huge price. For Wuhan, this means its residents are now allowed to leave the city and others are welcome to visit. It means one of the largest transportation hubs in the nation is open for business again. It means millions of businesses in the city – small and large, service providers and manufacturers – can further pick up the pace to resume their operations. It means Wuhan is finally on the fast track to a full recovery.
The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, the Catechism continues, but one that entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person.
Kitzhaber, a Democrat, was a legendary political figure in Oregon. A former emergency room physician. he was elected to his fourth term in 2014, despite bubbling scandals involving his consort Cylvia Hayes. Hayes functioned as an active member of the governor's staff, as reports surfaced of her pot farm, her sham-marriage and state payments to her private consulting firm.Largely because of the spreading scandals, Kitzhaber resigned in February 2015.
Why should a Constitutionally enumerated right be treated differently? It should in no way be treated differently and no law-abiding citizen should ever be forced to be defenseless no matter where or for what reason they travel in this country. HR 38 is a bill that is long overdue, as the time is now to rectify many states' reluctance to allow all law-abiding citizens the right to self-protection no matter where they may travel.
Tourism would not suffer, he adds. Obviously, there would be no need to require tourist visas for EU citizens any more than we do for Americans now. Nor would there be any need for restrictions on students, or genuine marriage. Even freedom to live elsewhere could be protected: EU citizens could still come to live in the UK provided they had the means to support themselves.
Protesters interrupted Pete Buttigieg in Iowa on Tuesday, as the openly gay mayor of South Bend continued campaigning for president.
But most of the criticism of the first article came not just from Christians, but also from BuzzFeed's own readers and from many of Aurthur's peers in the media. As one BuzzFeed reader wrote in response to the first article: This is a tired, forced witch hunt. You are inciting a wave of negative attention on this couple for something that indirectly links to them. That's not journalism, it's petty bullsh*t.
The judges agreed with the couple that a potential violation of Article 14, taken with Article 8, had been identified, but Lady Justice Arden dissented on the question of whether the Government's current wait and see policy was justified.
The number one overall draft pick in 1989 was none too happy that Fox Sports decided to bring Bayless into the broadcasting fold. To say I'm disappointed in the hiring of Skip Bayless would be an enormous understatement,  Aikman told Sports Illustrated.

The New York Sun announced it is endorsing Ted Cruz in the Republican primary Tuesday.
My guess is that you will not. You will not even respond to my requests, and you certainly won't have the courage to debate me. You will continue to pretend that the truth is bigotry and that the lie is moral, and you will continue to deny the most pertinent truth about the treatment of women in the Middle East, Africa, and increasingly in Europe – this abhorrent treatment of women has everything to do with Islam.

Photos of Bushra Bibi were circulated on social media networks with many describing her as the bringer of joy for Pakistan. However, her burqa stirred controversy as some criticized her for choosing to wear it because it affects the image of Pakistani women in the world. Journalist and activist Sameera Khan said on Twitter: She has every right to wear what she wants but as the wife of Pakistan's leader, she represents all Pakistani women. When the international community sees Pakistan as a regressive state that oppresses women, this is not the greatest representation of Pakistani women, she also said, adding: Nowhere in the Quran does it mandate covering everything but the eyes. Twitter user Azfar replied to Sameera and said: So what? She should take off her veil and drop some inches in her cleavage like yourself just to show the western world? How is that a representation of freedom and progressive society??

On the 2016 campaign trail, and in his Executive Orders since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has called for a new process of extreme vetting would-be refugees and legal immigrants — especially Muslim immigrants — into the United States. For example, his January 27 Executive Order on immigration declared that his policy would be to exclude people with Hostile attitudes:
Rubio said the American people need to learn to work together even if they disagree and if they don't then they will pay the terrible price that their children will grow up where dignified work is only available to a few. He added that their children would also inherit a democracy that is an island in an ocean of tyranny and that their children would live in a world dominated by China. He said in this future world dominated by China, where they will have to depend on them for the latest medical advances in technology and where privacy and free speech, and religious liberty, and human rights are no longer protected, because China, the most powerful country at that point, is a serial violator of each one of these things. And if God forbid, that day should ever come, it will have been because those of us here now allowed it to happen.
The authorities have been plagued with security breaches in recent years, although all harmless in the context of the current era.

Mindy Cohn and Kim Fields, who played members of Mrs. Garrett's brood, recalled her lovingly.
Although Chinese authorities continue to officially frown on sex-selective abortion, some people reportedly continue the practice in response to government imposed birth limits and in keeping with a traditional cultural preference for sons, the report declares.
A Texas Supreme Court Justice has issued a dissenting opinion stating that while the U.S. Supreme Court has declared that same-sex couples may marry, the U.S. Constitution does not necessarily require cities to offer benefits to same-sex spouses of employees. While marriage may be a fundamental right, spousal benefits are not. He says that the same constitutional strict scrutiny does not apply to employment benefits.
The thing that puts me off libertarianism is the more libertarian than thou game so many libertarians like to play.

After all, benefits such as health insurance provide financial security as couples decide whether to have a child. An opposite-sex marriage is the only marital relationship where children are raised by their biological parents. In any other relationship, the child must be removed from at least one natural parent, perhaps two, before being adopted by her new parent(s). This does not diminish any child's inherent dignity, a fact the City presumably recognizes by extending benefits to their employees' children regardless of the employees' marital status. But it does explain why the State might choose to direct resources to opposite-sex couples.
Two of her most-shared political posts came on January 6, in which she criticized certain left-wing ideologies, including the defund the police movement. She also expressed skepticism that Joe Biden legitimately won the presidential election, using the #MAGA hashtag.

Photos of Heard's bruised face, which she claimed was sustained after Depp wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw a cell phone at her, were widely circulated on the Internet over the weekend.
Any attempt by a medical professional to encourage a child to identify with their birth sex would be deemed illegal. The long-term result of this, combined with aggressive state statutes, is pretty frightening: parents with kids suffering from gender dysphoria will be forced to provide them with puberty blockers, hormone treatments, and ultimately sex changes, lest they violate the law.
Let's be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 25, 2020
The so-called #EqualityAct is unfair on many fronts. It is an attack on parental rights and women's sports, but to the millions of people of faith in this country, it is an egregious attack on the freedom to believe and live according to those beliefs. @tperkins pic.twitter.com/HmjONeFBXs — FRC (@FRCdc) May 16, 2019

Deceptively edited video of the Catholic students – attending the March for Life in Washington – portrayed them as disrespecting Native American activist Nathan Phillips and the religious sect known as the Black Hebrew Israelites. However, other video of the entire encounter shows the students were not only verbally accosted and insulted by the black activists – who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at them – but that Philips himself initiated the encounter with the young students, yet failed to provoke them.

This battle — what hangs in the balance is every issue every one of your listeners care about, she said, naming concerns from preserving the Second Amendment to traditional marriage. The New York Times placed [Merrick Garland]… to the left of [Justice Elena] Kagan. So this is a very liberal nominee. Of course. This is such a liberal president who thinks the Constitution is a living, breathing document.

I said, 'Sir, that's up to you. But you'd want to be careful about that, because it might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally, and second, it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen,' Comey said.
It was important for the staff to know not just where she stood on issues, but on personnel as well. I do think that, as a modern First Lady, she had a huge impact on the politics of the White House. I know for a fact that she dialed Ronnie, as she called him, dialed him down on his rhetoric about the Soviet Union because she could see the possibilities of getting something done with Mikhail Gorbachev at that time. And also understood the historic importance of that, if he were the President who could start to unwind the nuclear confrontation.
For more than a century, March 8 has been globally recognized as International Women's Day. The movement is celebrated by the United Nations, which works to create a historic legacy of internationally-agreed strategies, standards, programs and goals to advance the status of women worldwide. While American women still have plenty worth fighting for, the status of women internationally doesn't compare. Women's strikers' decision to hijack this day shows just how far out of touch they are with the more serious problems facing hundreds of millions of women worldwide—problems ranging from human trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced marriage, and female genital mutilation to brutal murders masked in honor. Our foreign sisters need our help, and International Women's Day should be about them. Not us.

Anderson summed up the concerns about the legislation.
The justices did not rule on broader First Amendment claims of free speech or the free exercise of religion, leaving those questions for another day. But the Court's 7-2 decision – while a narrow opinion – was still a major victory for the faith-based community, because the political left's argument was that no First Amendment religious-liberty rights follow a person in the marketplace when he or she opens a business to the public.
Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, passed away on Thursday at the age of 76 years old at her Detroit home, according to her publicist.
I don't think the timing of this is coincidental. After the massive pushback we've seen against the radical Democrat abortion campaigns in places like New York and Virginia, and the attempted censoring of the Unplanned movie recently (Twitter account suspended, advertisements blacklisted), it seems there's a method here, he continued. With abortion being such an active conversation right now, you'd think the social media companies would be on high-alert to NOT be censoring legitimate viewpoints.

8:18 PM: Sanders, when asked if he would deploy the military, says he would use all disposable tools. He says the New York did the right thing calling up the National Guard. Sanders goes right back to talking about the economic fallout. He asks what happens to workers who will lose their jobs after restaurants are shut down. He says if Trump can provide $1.5 trillion to the banks, workers should get a check to be made whole.

Newsom is also a prisoner of his own campaign promises, including a platform promising universal health care and a recent conversion to the cause of high-speed rail.
Team Trump has been spreading all sorts of unproven nonsense about Hunter Biden, and I don't get that, Kimmel said. I mean, why would they align themselves with these conspiracy theories when they can just point out that Hunter Biden is a 49-year-old man with two bracelets? For me, that's all I need to know.
Millions of people across the globe took to the streets for New Year celebrations on Sunday as the world welcomed the start of 2018.

But he added that he doesn't have strong feelings about same-sex marriage one way or another, saying that he [wishes] everybody who's living with one other person the best of luck in the world, because it's fantastic.
Yes, of course, it's hilarious and ironic that the scientist responsible for Britain's lockdown policy should be caught breaking his own rules in such spectacular fashion: enjoying nocturnal visits from his left-wing activist mistress Antonia Staats, taking a break from her £1.9 million South London home where she lives in an open marriage with her SOAS academic husband and children.

The Associated Press noted on Sunday that the king just returned from a two-month medical leave in which he evidently journeyed to Moscow and married a 25-year-old former Russian beauty queen. The wedding has not been confirmed by either the royal palace or Malaysia's elected government, but foreign tabloids and websites have published photos of the ceremony.
Making noises at transgender people, making fun of them, teasing them, or thinking of them as inferior is against sharia law, because such an act amounts to objecting to one of Allah's creations, which is not correct, the ruling said.

Anyone who knows me or has heard me speak knows that this really isn't true — but, I DO preach the TRUTH of the Gospel. Could it be, rather, that these folks are truthophobic or free-speech-ophobic? Graham asks.

The EU's first event dedicated to the protection of fundamental rights, scheduled for 1 October 2015, had originally concerned protecting free speech. Following last January's Charlie Hebdo massacre, the issue could scarcely be said to be more vital to Europe's cultural survival.
There's a cruel irony that a Trump Republican could represent the most Democratic district in America, Ritchie Torres said.
Earlier last year, Francis published a lengthy teaching text on marriage and the family called The Joy of Love (Amoris Laetitia), in which he underscored the unique value of both motherhood and fatherhood, while denouncing the legal deconstruction of the family through the acceptance of same-sex marriage.
Last year, Netflix threatened to pull production from Georgia following the state's passage of the so-called fetal heartbeat bill on abortion. Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, took an overtly pro-choice stance on the issue, saying the company will help to fight the law in court.
In Kenya, 21 percent of women and girls, aged 15-49, have undergone FGM, according to United Nations data. The procedure requires the partial or total removal of the female genitalia and can cause grave health problems for the entirety of a girl's lifetime and death.
As head of the UK's Commission for Racial Equality between 2003 and 2012, Mr Phillips famously had a bust of Lenin on his desk. He does himself a disservice with his recent contrition, and should own up to the distressing worldwide repercussions of his highly effective revolutionary zeal.
Family and Community Services Minister Pru Goward said that children were under enormous pressure from their parents to marry. The minister said 'the community' does know that child brides do exist, but they choose to turn the other cheek, and ignore it.
Melanie Israel of the Heritage Foundation explained Monday at the Daily Signal that, under the legislation, parental rights could take a far back seat to mandated school programs:
Comey relates in his book that Trump brought up the topic of the dossier: He may want me to investigate it to prove that it didn't happen. And then he says something that distracted me because he said, you know, 'If there's even a 1 percent chance my wife thinks that's true, that's terrible.'
The Royal Family has released a now-rare new picture of the Duke of Edinburgh on his 99th birthday, standing in the gardens of Windsor Castle with his wife Queen Elizabeth II.
This viewpoint reduces the human person, whether consciously or unconsciously, to the mind, Eijk said, that is, the rational consciousness and center of the autonomous will, in fact of the highly complex biochemical and neurophysiological functions in the superior nuclei and cortex of the brain.
The Democrats might as well sign a suicide pact, not just for their political future, but for the future of the economy of the United States for all these people to be piling on this Green New Deal, which is a complete and utter ridiculous document. To ban fossil fuels in ten years … first, food production would collapse, second, anybody trying to get food into the cities would fail, because the people on the outside of the cities would capture it so they could have it, and the people on the inside is where it would start. The rot would start in the center of the big cities where people would begin starve to death after they'd eaten all their pets. They would actually start killing and eating each other. It's not just a religion, it's a toxic mix of religion and ideology, of politics and religion. It's just absolutely toxic. … They are against humans. Why would humans be against humans? Especially when we have developed such an incredible civilization.

I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith, but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God.

The progressive push to bend Americans' attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of gender identity has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.

When the Department of Health declined to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed as parents, respondents filed suit in circuit court seeking a declaration that petitioner's refusal to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed violated their constitutional rights, as well as a declaration that certain statutory provisions were unconstitutional. Respondents also sought to enjoin enforcement of petitioner's policy against naming both spouses on the birth certificate under these circumstances and an order requiring petitioner to issue corrected birth certificates naming both spouses.
U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality — mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. Although the decriminalization strategy is still being hashed out, officials say it's likely to include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights. Other U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts throughout Europe, including the U.S. Mission to the E.U., are involved, as is the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration's top geopolitical foe.
Clarke was joined on the panel by Ashley McGuire of The Catholic Association, Margaret Iuculano, of the American Conservative Union, and Dr. Wendy Warcholik and J. Scott Moody, who work on the ACU Foundation Family Prosperity Initiative.
During that terror campaign, PMW reported, encouraging suicide bombings and describing death by martyrdom as a wedding in a paradise of immortals and the video's linking suicide bombers with grooms and brides who have written the marriage contract in blood on the veil were recurring messages.
Fifteen years ago, gay marriage was inconceivable. Look at what we've accepted since. The Supreme Court, by fiat, made gay marriage the law of the land. You can get blacklisted and become unemployable for opposing same-sex marriage or for refusing to believe a woman can magically transform into a man. And it's deemed appropriate to allow a mentally ill guy in a dress to share a locker room with your daughter.

Usually thousands of NPC deputies and CPPCC members descend on Beijing from all over the country, and hundreds of journalists will gather at the Great Hall of the People and other venues to cover the event. However, this year the meetings will be scaled down and the number of journalists will be limited in light of the situation. Therefore, many journalists will have to do video and phone interviews with the deputies or members who attend the meetings. Another way in which this year will likely be different is the length of the sessions, which could be shortened to one week.

The posture of these Never Trumpers is transparently self-serving. It preserves their intellectual credentials as conservatives, and simultaneously takes them out of the line of fire from an increasingly vicious left whose goal is to destroy Trump and his presidency, and – incidentally – conservative America. Sitting on the fence affords them new career opportunities — appearances on CNN and MSNBC and columns in the NY Times. All that's required is that they avoid taking sides in the political war that is engulfing the country. All this reminds me of a memorable Trotsky sneer about liberals, whom he accused of being reluctant to step into the stream of political conflict because they were afraid to get their moral principles wet.

Fact: The Equality Act guts the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and threatens constitutional freedoms by eliminating conscience protections from the Civil Rights Act.

Summarizing Breitbart News's original report, Cody Brown and his four wives from the reality TV series Sister Wives brought a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Utah's law banning polygamy. On December 13, 2013, a U.S. district judge in Utah held in a 91-page opinion that laws saying a person can only be married to one other person at a time are unconstitutional.
While the Equality Act is being sold on promising good things for women, and on ending unfair treatment of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people—which almost everyone agrees are worthy and important goals—it's poisoned with the destruction of the law's ability to allow any accommodations for women on the basis of sex.
Republican North Carolina state Senator Phil Berger applauded the court's decision, issuing a statement reading, We appreciate the court recognizing the plaintiffs failed to identify even one North Carolinian who was denied the ability to get married under this reasonable law which protects fundamental First Amendment rights.

Tulsi Gabbard herself is quoted in a 2000 press release from The Alliance for Traditional Marriage. In it, she attacks gay rights activists who were opposed to her mother Carol's bid for the state's board of education.

Shortly after Gabbard announced her presidential ambitions Friday, her testimony at a hearing opposing a civil unions bill in 2004 resurfaced.

Then, in 1966, Mao launched his Cultural Revolution, an attempt to erase all remaining capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society. The Communist Red Guard enforced a purge of all dissidents. Mao issued his famous book of quotations, The Little Red Book, that became a central part of the curriculum of every school. Chinese citizens were expected to have a copy of Mao's writings with them at all times. Even so, Maoist socialism represented a disastrous alloy of deprivation, starvation and tyranny.

Many observers predict a tougher tenure for Newsom, partly because they predict a dire economic future for the country as a whole — a common theme for mainstream media pundits in recent weeks, driven partly by the gyrations of the stock market but also, undoubtedly, by a desire to see the Trump administration fail, in defiance of the data on job creation and economic growth.

If socialism has produced a worldwide record of misery and tears, and if countries must flee socialism to experience prosperity, what then are American socialists up to? Why would they want to import misery and tears? They insist they are not doing this. In a sense, they disavow history, both the political and the economic legacy of all professed socialist regimes. They insist that everyone else got it wrong. They emphasize that at least some of those depressing examples, maybe all of them, were not real socialism.
If you are homosexually inclined, Nigeria is not a place for you. There is a law [Same-Sex Prohibition Act] here that criminalizes homosexual clubs, associations, and organizations with penalties of up to 15 years in jail. So, if you are a homosexual in nature, leave the country or face prosecution. But before you say, 'does this matter?' Kindly note that anything against the law of the land is criminal and all crimes will be punished accordingly no matter how small you think it is. The law says a person who registers, operates or participates in gay clubs, societies or organizations, directly or indirectly makes a public show of same-sex amorous relationship in Nigeria commits an offense and is liable on conviction to a term of 10 years. Anyone convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage contract or civil union faces up to 14 years imprisonment. All LGBT candidates in Nigeria should beware.

Vanity Fair is not a fan of this particular romance, saying it is a good thing there are no photos of them together, because that level of self-serving malevolence in one single frame would likely crumble the earth onto itself.

It depends what you want in your life and taking the stigma away from those who choose alternative pathways who choose technical schools, vocational education. At the end of the day, it's about connecting workers with their passion, with their jobs. There's very little opportunity for somebody who wants to the vocational route, the technical route because all the money pushes you into a four-year college system.

Instead Raskin said that the First Amendment cannot be a defense. That is absurd. Not all speech is protected by the First Amendment, but speech that is constitutionally protected must by definition not be any sort of criminal speech.

I think, if you look at President Trump, he has divided the country worst than it's ever been divided in its history — or at least certainly for — in the last 100 years. You know, my history, both as a mayor, and as a governor, as a businessperson was to bring people together and find solutions to vexing problems, he said. To — you know, we brought environmentalists together with the oil and gas industry for methane regulations, the equivalent of taking 320,000 cars off the road. We got expanded Medicaid.

So why doesn't the failed track record of socialist regimes deter the socialists of today? What keeps socialism alive for them? The answer is: the socialist dream! Yes, there is a socialist dream just as there is an American dream. And evidently the socialist dream is one that survives all empirical refutation. No purely empirical argument—and no set of economic arguments—is sufficient to send socialism to its grave.

That should not be surprising. It demonstrates that the supply of college graduates has outpaced demand, which is exactly what you would expect would happen when ample subsidies and societal pressure are applied to increase college attendance.

George Orwell's 1984 is no longer an analogy in Democrat-run New York City. It's real.
It's something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that's not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church where it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you're supposed to conduct yourself.
It turned out that this debate was not about a wall. It was about a new immigration policy in America. It was about rejecting the notion that we are a nation of immigrants. Last week, one of our major federal agencies deleted that term, said we no longer want to have that as our mission statement, that America is a nation of immigrants. To deny our birthright as a nation is to really defy who we are, what we are and what we will be.
Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market. But the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.
While the film prominently features the Cubs — and even has a cameo by famed Cubs player Ryne Sandberg — the movie isn't specifically about baseball. The flick features Aaron's character as he finds younger, more tech-savvy competitors beating him out of new opportunities at his place of employment. The film then follows the character's subsequent decision to divorce himself from cell phones, technology, and the Internet. And as Aaron navigates through his decision to dump technology he deals with the fallout from friends, family and his gay husband.

One name that came up later would bring the entire discussion full circle — and that was none other than Andrew Breitbart himself, who Lucas noted embodied both schools of thought.

The Epoch Times on Tuesday cited local reports that suggested Wuhan hospitals are discharging coronavirus patients too early and officials are downplaying the number of both asymptomatic cases and obvious infections.
In my research, there's never been a film that stars LGBTQ actors made with the association of the MLB, the NBA, the NFL, or the NHL, Aaron told the magazine. [But] it's not a film about being gay.

You cannot commercialise this operation… in the military, you are paid a small amount of money and you serve your country. You don't get paid and decide you're going to have a second career on the side. That's not how it works and that's not how it works being a Royal.
The Times article claimed Biden was committing to Pope Francis's focus on environmental protection, poverty, and migration by rejoining the Paris climate accords and stopping the construction of a border wall.
What Cameron will be hoping now is that his personal referendum disaster may turn into a Pyrrhic victory for his enemies. He'll want Boris Johnson to lose the fight to become Prime Minister; he'll want a Remain candidate to win instead – someone like Teresa May – and perhaps, ideally, sabotage the EU negotiations so that we end up with some sort of grubby compromise whereby we might as well have Remained in the EU for all the difference it makes. He'll want, in other words, what the majority of British people demonstrably don't want. Vengeance before country.
The British-American pair are now officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the Duchess will take her place among senior members of the Royal Family.

Some of the victims are as young as 13 and they are frequently threatened with violence and emotional blackmail, pressuring them to marry older men they may have never met.
The Korean example is even more telling, in part because the separation of the two societies has lasted longer and continues to this day. South Korea now is more than 20 times richer than North Korea, a difference manifested in virtually all indicators of human welfare. South Koreans are obviously freer than North Koreans but they also seem happier than North Koreans; have you ever seen a North Korean smile? South Koreans are also taller, healthier and live about 12 years longer than North Koreans. Every year many thousands of North Koreans risk their lives seeking to escape to South Korea.

Leftover women — most of whom reside in Chinese urban centers and are highly educated — should not feel afraid to go and live in rural villages, according to Wu Xiuming, the deputy secretary-general of the Shanxi Think Tank Development Association, a non-governmental organization in central China specializing in social development research.

Targeted groups quickly find that character assassination is just the beginning. The SPLC's ultimate goal is to destroy the groups on its hate map by bankrupting them through online de-platforming and encouraging banks, insurance companies and other vendors to treat them as pariahs.

One officer told me Aikman 'was supposed to be' having a relationship with a male member of a country-western band.

Men and women have sex all the time — on the first, second or third date, that's normal. Wenzel said. It's not a big deal in Germany.
Aurthur appears to insinuate that HGTV is anti-LGBT even after acknowledging in her previous article that two other popular programs on the network, Property Brothers and House Hunters, have featured gay couples in the past. The absence of gay couples on Fixer Upper is apparently enough evidence for BuzzFeed to suggest that the show, the couple and the network are all anti-gay bigots.
Research conducted in April revealed not one of Ireland's TDs (the equivalent of Britain's Members of Parliament) wants to restrict immigration to the country, with 65 per cent telling a survey by independent radio station Newstalk they would keep migration levels the same and 35 per cent wanting them increased, despite 50 per cent of respondents admitting the subject is regularly brought up by constituents as a concern.

If enacted, however, the Equality Act would have a major impact on children and their parents, potentially upending the culture as American families now know it. Lawsuits filed against Americans who adhere to the science of biological sex and the First Amendment rights of citizens would now have a federal law backing them up that states gender identity supersedes biological sex.

It was important for the staff to know not just where she stood on issues, but on personnel as well. I do think that, as a modern First Lady, she had a huge impact on the politics of the White House. I know for a fact that she dialed Ronnie, as she called him, dialed him down on his rhetoric about the Soviet Union because she could see the possibilities of getting something done with Mikhail Gorbachev at that time. And also understood the historic importance of that, if he were the President who could start to unwind the nuclear confrontation.
CARLSON: Happy Inauguration Day. It's a big moment for the country. The changing of the guard, a peaceful transfer of power, another reassuring display of the awesome pageantry of constitutional government.
So why doesn't the failed track record of socialist regimes deter the socialists of today? What keeps socialism alive for them? The answer is: the socialist dream! Yes, there is a socialist dream just as there is an American dream. And evidently the socialist dream is one that survives all empirical refutation. No purely empirical argument—and no set of economic arguments—is sufficient to send socialism to its grave.
The term 'privilege,' in most instances, can be attributed to people who are white, male, and/or straight, or even those who are Christian.

The article then went on to name several of the women in the BBC report and claim that Chinese documentation did not show that those who claimed to be forcibly sterilized endured such an attack. It went on to claim that the BBC provided almost no information to prove the authenticity of the testimonies. Contrary to that claim, the BBC did indicate that some of its witnesses had documents, including travel documents, that indicated that those testifying were in the places they claimed to be when they experienced what they denounced. The anonymous concentration camp guard who spoke to the BBC, for example, provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp, according to the report.

The Left has largely accomplished its grand 50-year mission, destroying the nuclear family, organized religion, and masculine values such as self-reliance, leaving many dependent on government functionaries for sustenance and hope. We aren't supposed to be competitive anymore, and we aren't meant to feel even a twinge of shame about long-term dependency on welfare programs or about dropping by the local Medicaid clinic for more pain pills. We have been strictly instructed to place no particular value on traditional marriage — not for its role in healthy child-rearing, or for the vital and different benefits it brings to men and women.

Fact: By adding sexual orientation and gender-identity rules to the Civil Rights Act's Title IV on desegregation of public education, the Equality Act could pave the way for K–12 federal courts to require sexual orientation and gender-identity curricula the same way they required black history curricula …
However, he acknowledges that furthering LGBT interests, especially in countries with cultures opposed to the promotion of gay lifestyles, will be a challenge.

During another segment, Carlson recalls a story regarding a teacher who had allegedly molested a 13-year-old student nearly 30 times in one week. In response, the shock jock asks Carlson if he was physically capable of enduring such unwanted advances or do you take your hat off to this kid? Carlson replied: So my point is that teachers like this, not necessarily this one in particular, but they are doing a service to all 13-year-old girls by taking the pressure off. They are a pressure relief valve, like the kind you have on your furnace.
I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools, he warned.

This particular anecdote is also deeply unflattering to Mrs. Bush.
A left-wing group that claims to represent true Christian values launched a petition on Saturday asking for evangelical leader Franklin Graham to lose his job because he supported President Donald Trump.
This is really a fight for truth, and the Gospel is what is really being 'banned' from these venues, Graham writes. It really boils down to the fact that they disagree with the message.
We will soon see whether this proves to be true. I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools, he wrote.
I like to say Catholics are right about everything, but in the same way that a Christmas family gathering includes your cousins who are a bit slow, I will include protestants in this discussion as well. There are so many things that we owe the religion as a debt of gratitude joked MILO, before adding I can't listen many of them without this turning into a pep rally for Jesus and his Apostles.

In late April, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the People's Daily, used the Weibo hashtag Why Aren't You Getting Married? to inquire why young people in China seem to have a distaste for starting families. In addition to couples not having children, statistics show that more and more people are less willing to get married every year, the newspaper reported, according to the site What's on Weibo. The marriage rates for 2018, the site noted, hit a new five-year low. Social stigma surrounding older marriage is also partly to blame, the site stated, citing a survey that found that, despite the stark disparity in male to female population, half of Chinese men think that women who are still single at the age of 25 are 'leftovers,' meaning their single status is attributable to something undesirable about them and thus makes them a poor match.
Black leaders were irate when Obama compared the civil rights movement to the same-sex marriage platform on the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march, when black American citizens were beaten for demanding voting rights they were being denied.
The image has since disappeared from Mately's website.
I was in the process of selling the adaptation rights of some of our novels and even considered bringing in investors to expand the platform.

The lawsuit was brought by two Houston taxpayers prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges. The decision granted same-sex marriage rights across the country. The Houston lawsuit was aimed to stop cities like Houston, from granting employee benefits to same-sex couples who were married in a state that recognized gay marriage when Texas law did not. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and granted a temporary injunction blocking the City's actions.
These victims of 'camps' in BBC reports cannot offer evidence for their claims. The Western media has a notorious record on factual accuracy in its reporting — for example, making traffic jams a sign of 'oppression,' The Global Times claimed, without elaborating on what the traffic jams comment was a reference to.
I've been thinking a lot about what it would have been like if my mother had been taken away from us. I know we would have been devastated. That's what the President is doing to these kids – some 2,400 who have been and are being traumatized by his actions. He apparently views them as collateral damage in furtherance of his policy of prosecuting every single one of their parents.
But experts on medical ethics, commenting on the proposal, said procedures to modify girls' genitals could not be compared to male circumcision because they are designed to control women and curb their sexual desire.

Pursuing the American dream gave us purpose, achieving it left us empty and lost, and now we try to fill that spiritual hole by filling our homes with useless shit, by self-medicating, by pretending our social causes and faith are not just another form of narcissism — a sword to jab others and find them lacking and a shield to cover up what selfish and self-centered people we are.
Morse notes the starlets who criticize the exploitation of women, but who still endorse the ideology that objectification of women is acceptable. She observes how many actresses wore black dresses to the Golden Globe Awards to protest sexual abuse toward women, yet many of those dresses were very revealing.
Following thorough maintenance checks and reviews, in total 230 bullet trains are being made ready for departure, according to local media reports. Local authorities also announced on Tuesday that starting from 00:00 on April 8, Wuhan will lift 75 checkpoints designated to control outbound flows and resume normal function of 15 major traffic security checkpoints, while random inspection work would be carried out in line with epidemic prevention and control work. The city's transport authority also warned on Tuesday that lifting the outbound travel ban does not mean relaxation of epidemic measures. Those who do not need to leave Wuhan to resume work should avoid going out, otherwise, those who need to go out and resume work need to make plans regarding travel routes in order to avoid massive gatherings and traffic jams. About 55,000 people are estimated to leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday, most of whom are heading to the Pearl River Delta, home to many of China's warehouses. The first train will go to Nanning, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at 7:06 am, according to the local railway authority.

For the first time since Congress passed a statute making it a crime in the United States to engage in female genital mutilation, to mutilate little girls — it's been a felony in the United States since 1996 — we made the first case, last week, against two doctors in Michigan for doing this terrifying thing to young girls all across the country.
I came to rebuild myself, she said.
The underlying fight in the immigration debate is the nature of the United States, said Durbin, who wants the United States to be a nation of immigrants, not a nation of Americans. He told NPR:
West was a vocal Donald Trump supporter who became a minor candidate for president last year; he ended up having little effect on the election.

Doctrine is a word that I don't like very much, it brings with it the image of the hardness of stone, Abascal said. Instead the human reality is much more nuanced, it is never black or white, it is in continual development.
Disillusionment grew in the 1960s when she discovered that failed investments by her third husband, Martin Melcher, left her deeply in debt. She eventually won a multimillion-dollar judgment against their lawyer.

Comey writes that Trump called him up one week later, on Jan. 11, and he was fixated on the allegation that he consorted with prostitutes in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013.
Perhaps surprisingly, Ivy-league educated Ivanka Trump has recently come out as a skeptic about America's love affair with college. The first daughter has taken up a leadership role in the Trump administration's workforce development efforts—and shown a remarkable candidness when it comes to our college problem.
Stasi's claim of ignorance regarding Guilfoyle's Puerto Rican heritage lacks credibility for a couple of reasons.
Prince Harry and Meghan are quitting the UK because of 'racism'. Or so claims a particularly ludicrous opinion piece in the New York Times.
It's helped me a lot, a 24-year-old woman said.
He added, I think there was nothing loving about that situation. I think he was brutal mayor who basically had a reign of terror of black people in this country — in this city. To me, taking advice from Rudy Giuliani is like Kim Kardashian giving me marriage advice. It is ridiculous. It is ridiculous when you have a person who has set up some of the most heinous things that have happened to black people in this country, and to say something like that every time somebody says something about injustice, they are the terrorists. MLK would be considered a terrorist, Gandhi was a terrorist, Mandela was a terrorist. And all they were trying to do was fight for justice. And to me, when old white men tell black men how to act, that's the most ridiculous thing in the world. To tell black people to speak a certain way and to act a certain way is no different from telling a woman how to dress so she doesn't get raped.
I'm a big advocate of the #MeToo movement, Allen said during an interview with Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos on Monday. I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it's a good thing that they're exposing them. But you know, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years.

The women and children they leave behind are often displaced to informal camps, face sexual violence, and are even at risk of abduction and forced marriage.
Obergefell concerned access to marriage, not an Equal Protection challenge to the allocation of employment benefits. The court of appeals apparently assumed that, if the Supreme Court concluded no government interest justifies recognizing marriage as only between couples of the opposite sex, then no interest justifies offering different benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex spouses of City employees. But, as discussed below, marriage—not spousal employment benefits—is a fundamental right, and laws limiting access to a fundamental right receive stricter scrutiny than laws distributing government benefits. As the majority in Obergefell recognized, 'the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change' when fundamental rights are not at stake.

CNN reported on Monday that at least six members of the Conference of Rulers have already met to discuss who will succeed Muhammad V, and in fact might have prodded him to abdicate, either because they were unhappy with his choice of fiancee or because they thought he was not well-suited to handle an era of fundamental change in Malaysia.
Newsom will govern a state that is not only deeply divided between rich and poor, but in which the rich half is barely aware that the rest of the state is so far behind, or that California faces staggering long-term financial problems, thanks to the concentration of self-regarding media and culture industries in wealthy coastal enclaves.

In order to combat this perceived bias, Baltz states he spent 2020 editing Wikipedia to create or expand articles about female political scientists and increase citations to women on political articles. Under the name Astrophobe on Wikipedia, Baltz claims to have created 264 pages about female political scientists. Reviewing several articles he claimed, many seem to push the boundaries of notability standards on the site, which require significant coverage in secondary sources, evidence of a major impact on an academic field, or holding prominent posts at major academic institutions. One article cited much of its contents to the academic's own work.

Slavery lasted for centuries — even millennia — before it was recognized as a thoroughly wicked and tyrannical regime of human exploitation. Socialism, which dates back to 1917, when Lenin founded the world's first socialist state, has had a much shorter shelf life.

Bias from administrators in Wikipedia disputes is one factor frustrating attempts to balance site content. Narssarssuaq's efforts relating to Biden family corruption allegations were ultimately frustrated by an openly biased administrator who called the allegations Russian disinformation and threatened sanctions against Narssarssuaq citing numerous erroneous reasons. One editor interviewed by Fox noted another administrator favorably displays an anti-democratic quote from Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. This is apparently El C who previously used dubious reasoning to keep ICE detention facilities in a concentration camps list, echoing Democrat attacks against President Donald Trump's Administration. El C also recently expressed support for one editor's profile page suggesting Trump be hanged for treason.

An Uppsala team, feeding Imperial's parameters into its own study, agreed. The modelling envisaged Sweden paying a heavy price for its rejection of lockdown, with 40,000 Covid deaths by 1 May and almost 100,000 by June. The latest figure for Sweden is 2,680 deaths, with daily deaths peaking a fortnight ago. The virus, it turns out, has been spreading at a fraction of the speed suggested. So Imperial College's modelling – the same modelling used to inform the UK response – was wrong, by an order of magnitude.

I think that's true. She was, she didn't let this on to him, but she was terrified whenever he went out, because she saw just how vulnerable he was, even with all that protection. He was such an important part of her life from a personal point of view. She was very anxious about it. But they got through it. She didn't show that anxiety to the public, and she was greatly relieved when he was able to leave office on his own two feet, as it were. And then, of course, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and wrote that very, very touching letter to the American people, hand written, and then she went on to live with him in that condition. He had to have her at his side, at night, for example, or he would get agitated, and she was there, and never complained. I had quite a strong personal relationship with her by then, and I would not bring that up, and she would not… there was never a hint of a complaint from her about the life she had been reduced to. A lot of her friends were gone by then, so she didn't have a very active social life. She had a harder time getting around. She had friends in New York. She would come here from time to time, but then she lost most of them. She was a very brave woman through it all.

Buttigieg is not a genius politician… He lost. He got wiped out. How many people win Iowa, almost win New Hampshire, and drop out two weeks later? No one. He choked. He's awful. He's ridiculously unappealing. He's mean. He's a phony. Good riddance.

Instead Raskin said that the First Amendment cannot be a defense. That is absurd.

Concluding his piece, Baltz states his efforts only marginally improved the coverage of women on political science topics and increased citations of women even less. He argues more effort is necessary and calls for organized action to expand coverage of women on political topics as well as increase citations of women, noting feminist activist campaigns to increase coverage of women on other topics. While many progressive critics of Wikipedia push for more efforts favoring women citing an alleged gender gap on the site, a study released last year found these campaigns have over-corrected in some areas and tilted content disproportionately towards women.

He told Fox News, The days of Wikipedia's robust commitment to neutrality are long gone. Sanger further stated: Wikipedia's ideological and religious bias is real and troubling, particularly in a resource that continues to be treated by many as an unbiased reference work. Last year, Sanger published a blog post on Wikipedia's left-wing bias where he analyzed other political articles, such as the pages on Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. In the post, he declared the site's neutrality policy dead on the basis of its left-wing political bias.

After all, benefits such as health insurance provide financial security as couples decide whether to have a child. An opposite-sex marriage is the only marital relationship where children are raised by their biological parents. In any other relationship, the child must be removed from at least one natural parent, perhaps two, before being adopted by her new parent(s). This does not diminish any child's inherent dignity, a fact the City presumably recognizes by extending benefits to their employees' children regardless of the employees' marital status. But it does explain why the State might choose to direct resources to opposite-sex couples.

So it is with the socialists. They are on a grand quest, and they refuse to look back. The insist that they are the champions of a moral ideal. The only way to refute them is to refute their moral ideal, to expose their dream as a nightmare, to capsize their utopia. Normally people try to defeat utopia by showing it is a fantasy. But this is inadequate, because a fantasy continues to hold its appeal even when it is exposed as a fantasy. So we have to expose the socialist utopia not as an illusion but rather as a racket.
PayPal is committed to preserving human rights and advancing the principles of inclusion and equality that are at the core of our values, they declared. We seek to defend against actions that violate our values, which is why we are signing this amicus brief with other likeminded companies seeking to uphold critical protections against discrimination.

Continuing, Westneat marveled at that February 7 blog post of Bezos, the one headlined, No thank you, Mr. Pecker, in which Bezos recorded that Pecker and AMI had made him an an offer I couldn't refuse—that being a reference to another famous movie villain, the Corleone crime family:

Biden's career in Washington started in 1972 steeped in tragedy when his wife and infant daughter died in a car crash just before he was to be sworn in as U.S. senator. After exiting the national stage next week, he plans to stay active in Democratic politics and work on policy issues at a pair of institutes he's developing at the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania.

Although your parents are the closest of people to you, you do not want to jeopardise your hijrah by telling them where you are going, he explains. There are two options you can have either inform them when you are on the borders of Turkey and Sham about to enter or once you are here in Sham. Both have their pros and cons, and one can decide for himself when they wish to tell their parents. (Sham is another name ISIS uses for its territory.)

This makes the job losses from the China shock fundamentally different from other adverse shocks, such as recessions, that can hit the U.S. labor market. In those situations, job losses are primarily from contractions of the number of people employed at a plant, rather than the outright closing of a plant.

Also writing for Al-Watan, columnist Fahd Al-Ahmari took a slightly different view, claiming polygamy poses health threats, particularly to the husband. The reason for this is he is now expected to provide for several families at once – both from a financial and emotional aspect. She brings proof of her claim, noting a 2015 study conducted at a Saudi hospital and medical research center that showed men with multiple wives suffer from heart problems four times more than the rest of the male population.
The mere fact that the concert was held in Cairo, and especially the flying of the gay pride flag, as well as the massive public response, led senior officials in Egypt to address the issue.
According to a National Bureau of Statistics Report, the sex ratio at birth in 2015 was 113.5 males born for every 100 females born, a disproportion that could only be achieved through sex-selective abortion. Years of such sex-selective favoring of boys has resulted in an estimated 33 to 37 million more males living in China than females. This imbalance is fueling sex trafficking from multiple nations into China for forced marriage or commercial sexual exploitation to help fill the gender gap.
President Joe Biden released a statement Friday urging Congress to swiftly pass the Equality Act, a bill that would eliminate the legal recognition of male and female sex, cater to gender ideology, and designate protection for the unborn as pregnancy discrimination.
Family and Community Services Minister Pru Goward said that children were under enormous pressure from their parents to marry. The minister said 'the community' does know that child brides do exist, but they choose to turn the other cheek, and ignore it.
Let me repeat this somewhat important fact…
In the case of school-age children, boys who identify as, or claim to be, girls, could share their bathrooms and shower rooms at school. Parents who objected would be viewed as discriminating against children identifying as another gender.
It does say something about American culture and politics today that the multibillionaire wannabe playboy with the penis pic peccadillo is the good guy in the story.
Christians are also considered part of lower castes, face severe discrimination from wealthier Muslim Pakistanis, and remain less socially advantaged.
Meghan Markle used her U.S. television interview with Oprah Winfrey on Sunday night to lay out her feelings of isolation and loneliness that came with marrying into the British royal family.
Our low membership growth in [North America] is probably due to our recent price changes and to U.S. competitive launches, executives said in a note to investors.
Pence also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting terrorism, mentioned the Islamic terror bombings on Brussels that killed more than 30 people, then called on the European community to intensify efforts to fight radical Islamic terrorism alongside the United States. This will require greater coordination and intelligence-sharing among EU member states and between the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he said.
Dr. Kelly added, Legal opinions reaching as high as the Supreme Court must answer whether the executive branch of the federal government can override the Tenth Amendment reserving powers not specifically enumerated in the Constitution for the states and local governments. It is hoped that common sense answers are provided prior to the 16/17 school year.
Syed Raheel Farook is the brother of the terrorist, Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife killed 14 in San Bernardino, California on December 2. No arrests were made in the course of the search.

The Born in the U.S.A. singer appeared in court on Wednesday for charges related to his November 14 arrest, which included driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, and consuming alcohol in a closed area.
Many critics have suggested that the British state's scandalous record on FGM should be attributed to the politically correct sensibilities of senior police officers, who have often been reluctant to take on criminals from minority communities — most famously in the case of Muslim child grooming rapists — ever since Lord Scarman levelled the dubious accusation of institutional racism at the police in 1981.
The Globe said it interviewed 20 people who know Hefner or his accusers. The report noted an alleged incident in 2015 when Hefner – who at the time was engaged to Rosenberg – appeared at the doorway of a lobbyist's office as he was about to leave for the evening, and grabbed his genitals.
Three political advisors in Shanghai proposed to set up a public frozen egg bank in a pilot exploration scheme to help women in need, especially cancer patients who might lose fertility after receiving medical treatment, the Times narrated.

After chastising New York and Milan for being a little slow to implement the kind of lockdown measures that ostensibly kept infections to a minimum in Wuhan, the Global Times concluded by restating the Communist Party line: China has and will continue to seek cooperation with other countries. We hope all countries can put aside their political differences and work jointly toward the same goal – defeating this common enemy and restarting the global economy.
In a talk Monday at St Patrick's Church, London, Cardinal George Pell said that a number of regularly worshipping Catholics are unnerved by the turn of events in the church.
When asked if he would run for office again, Bush laughably said he could not imagine having to attack someone to make yourself look strong.
But what will likely sustain the film's successful box office run is word-of-mouth, from mom to mom and dad to dad, letting each other know that this is a safe movie — one that is not politically preachy in the slightest, but which reaffirms classic American values that Hollywood wishes it did not have to embrace to succeed.
This depraved attack reveals the low worth of Christian girls in the mindset that has evolved amongst most Muslim men in Pakistan. Through a biased national curriculum and rogue Imams preaching a special place in heaven for those who rape and convert Christian girls, most of them deem minority women as war-booty. Seeing young Asma in such pain is heart-wrenching for all of us in the West, but the authorities of Pakistan just seem to accept this as the culture of Pakistan. It is this warped belief that has to be reconstructed before we can start to fashion a new more egalitarian nation, however the desire will have to be one driven by the country's Government—sadly I have never experienced a more selfish bunch of politicians.
Sullivan's liberalism allows him to recognize the reality of biology and sex — and of nations and borders — but it does not allow progressives to become liberal moderates.
Anyway, the years passed, Shyamalan lost his storytelling mojo and box office prowess, but he still figured out a way to make Unbreakable 2, in a sneaky and admittedly ingenious way.

There has been a declining curve of yearly new births in China — 17.86 million, 17.23 million, 15.23 million and 14.65 million in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, according to data released by the NBS. The low birth rate in China has reached an alarming degree, but it is not a surprise, Mu Guangzong, a professor from the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The main reason for the decline is the low desire among young couples to have children due to the high cost of supporting a child, he said, noting that for many young couples, the general housing and education policies in China as well as the social environment as a whole do not encourage them to have kids.
One of the signers, Cardinal Raymond Burke, the former head of the Vatican's Supreme Court and an expert in Canon Law, said in an interview that if Pope Francis does not clarify serious doctrinal doubts arising from Amoris Laetitia, the cardinals will be forced to initiate a formal act of correction of a serious error.
Throughout season two, Richie Aprile (David Proval) and Tony have been headed towards a collision. Further complicating things is Richie's engagement to Tony's sister, Janice. At this point we assume Tony will either cave to Richie's demands for more authority or whack him. And then this happens, and it is not only a wonderful surprise, it makes perfect sense.
The moment occurred during the Bulls/Spurs game held Thursday night at Chicago's United Center. The gay couple, identified as Michael and Jake, got engaged on center court during half time.

Isis [has] executed 19 women in the city of Mosul during the past two days, declared Mamuzini. The penalty decision came on the background of the refusal to participate in the practice of sexual jihad.
Remember that under Islamic law, a woman's word is worth half of a man's, so if her husband accuses her, her denial is worthless and she will be found guilty on his word alone. This is brilliantly illustrated in the hard-to-watch movie 'The Stoning of Soraya M', a true story about the stoning of a young mother in Iran on the word of her husband only; he simply wanted rid of her. Her father and sons joined in with the stoning.
Six years after having an abortion, Winter went through a political transformation in which she refound the Catholic Church and gained new perspectives on the sanctity of life.
Re-entering the Paris accord is fine, who cares?
The women summoned for interrogation were given no reason for the summonses they received, but once inside the interrogation room they were bombarded with accusations of espionage and collusion with 'foreign-based currents seeking the overthrow of the Islamic Republic system.' Amnesty International understands that the Revolutionary Guards subjected the women to verbal abuse, including gender-related slurs. The activists were not allowed to be accompanied by their lawyers during the interrogations, which lasted in some cases up to eight hours.
Mexican law enforcement officials confirmed to Breitbart Texas that a series of threats were made by Jose Antonio El Marro Yepez Ortiz, the leader of the hyper-violent Cartel Santa Rosa de Lima. He is warning of terrorist-style attacks in Guanajuato.
In case Camosy's tone of moral superiority had not been detected by this point in his column, he added:
The old-fashioned civil-society resources of church and family have withered under relentless assault from the Left, which seeks to replace all other social institutions with the worship of and dependency upon the benevolent State. The result is a wave of young and middle-aged people with nothing in their lives to inspire or sustain them, leading to a growing dependency on drugs, often beginning with prescription medication and moving on to illicit substances like heroin.
Entertainment Tonight later published text messages purported to be sent from Heard's cellphone that appeared to show that Depp's alleged physical abuse of his wife dates back to at least 2014. However, a source close to Depp has claimed that the text messages were doctored.
Depp responded to Heard's divorce filing on Thursday, with a representative for the actor releasing a statement to People saying he wanted the matter to be resolved quickly.

The news media at the time bought into the story that China had abandoned or scrapped its One-Child Policy, a depiction that Littlejohn called demonstrably false.
Relying on this diversity push, editors last year sparked outcry from family and Christian organizations by banning profile pages from expressing support for traditional marriage. The site's owners also endorsed Black Lives Matter, declaring no neutral stance on racial justice issues. At the same time, they pushed a left-wing code of conduct requiring, among other things, using preferred pronouns on Wikipedia and affiliated sites. The code was approved earlier this month. However, corporate media ignore this increasing left-wing bias and instead rely on Wikipedia as a source of information, even encouraging widespread utilization by Big Tech.

Second is Eric Murphy, who was confirmed 52-46 on March 7. Murphy is the solicitor general of Ohio, and well known as a stalwart conservative. Liberals attacked him for a host of reasons, including defending Ohio's law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. (Defending state laws against legal challenges is a central part of the job of any solicitor general.) He formerly clerked for a prominent judge on the Fourth Circuit and then for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.
Chris Fleming, spokesman for Accountable for Equality, stated the group's behavior is despicable and flat out blasphemous.

Deng's rumored connection to Putin seems a bit tenuous, as Us admits she has yet to be spotted looking romantic with the Russian leader, although they have some very wealthy mutual friends. Deng divorced Murdoch after 14 years of marriage in 2013, supposedly because he grew suspicious she was having an affair with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Enrique Marquez, a convert to Islam and friend of the terrorist, has been indicted, not only as the straw purchaser of two weapons used in the Dec. 2 terror attacks, and for conspiring to commit maximum-casualty terror attacks just a couple years earlier, but also for a sham marriage to the sister of Syed Raheel Farook's wife. Both brides immigrated to the U.S. from Russia.
'And I remember thinking, 'How could your wife think there's a 1 percent chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow?' I'm a flawed human being, but there is literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true. So, what kind of marriage to what kind of man does your wife think [that] there's only a 99 percent chance you didn't do that?
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) spoke at the Road to Majority conference in Washington, DC, on Thursday, listing six victories for conservatives that have taken place since President Donald Trump was elected the forty-fifth President of the United States.
The British-American pair are now officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the Duchess will take her place among senior members of the Royal Family.
If the Republicans said we are ending same-sex marriage, but we promise Democrats a vote later; or we approve of oil drilling in every national park, but you'll have a vote later – do you think the Democrats would say yes?, Gutierrez asked. This shows me that when it comes to immigrants, Latinos and their families, Democrats are still not willing to go to the mat to allow people in my community to live in our country legally.
As has been widely reported, evangelicals have overlooked Trump's personal failings because he has been more faithful than any other president to his promises on pro-life policies, conservative judges, religious freedom, protecting Israel, and other issues.
Steve and his farm have been singled out and excluded from full participation in the life of the community for only one reason, said ADF counsel Kate Anderson. Steve expressed a viewpoint the city did not like.
Communist dictatorships have traditionally abused the rights of their LGBT citizens, placing them in labor camps or executing them for their counter-revolutionary behavior. China is no different; while there are no known statistics on the number of LGBT individuals killed or imprisoned under Mao Zedong, there is ample evidence of such abuse. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but instances of conversion therapy abuses persisted.
The hatred, the death threats, the threats against my children, the threats to disfigure my wife, said Stone. I've had people call the house and say, 'We know where your children go to school,' and hang up. The left is sick in this country. They are mentally ill.
Breitbart reported on May 10 that students at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, jeered, booed and turned their backs on Education Secretary DeVos during her commencement speech.

You can see the problem with this, we definitely can see the problem. This show was not on the air for six months before there was an organized and highly aggressive campaign by prominent Democrats to denounce us as white supremacist. The first time it happened, the people who work on this show, many of them kids, were shocked and horrified by that. White supremacists? What's worse than that?
Although the Republican Party espouses no particular religion and many of its members care more about the economy and national security than religious belief, the GOP has been a home to many people of faith, including those who have felt betrayed by the Democrats' callous treatment of believing Christians and Jews.
The fact that Tony and Carmela use a hollowed out Roman column, the same column that once signified Rome's strength and power, to hide firearms and as a bedroom television stand, is the perfect symbolism for everything Chase wants to say.

I did not catch a glimpse of my wife's face until after we were married. I proposed to her without seeing her because she had never met me without her face being covered with a full veil. The only idea I had of what she looked like came from an old photograph I had seen in her house, the prime minister told the UK Daily Mail in a July interview.
Why shouldn't she feel free to express this and expect support from her party, unless what she is saying is fundamentally untrue (Spoiler: it's not).

Khan's second wife Reham, formerly a BBC weather presenter, was married to him for less than a year, and their divorce was much less amicable. Reham dropped a book just weeks before the election accusing Imran Khan of being a drug-addicted bisexual who sank into depravity under the influence of his first wife and her active Zionist friends and fathered numerous illegitimate children with Indian women.
If the traditional pro-life movement is to regain credibility as something other than a tool of the Trump administration, it must speak out clearly and forcefully against harming innocent children as a means of deterring undocumented immigration.
Inside the classroom, the bill could allow for the normalization of gender ideology and abortion in school curricula.
For a while, it seemed that the Jeff Bezos vs. David Pecker story was dying down. You remember all hullabaloo that from January: the messy stuff about divorces, and hacks, and you-know-what pics. But then the MSM developed a bad case of Michael Cohen on the brain, and the story faded.
The bishops' conference, he said, is simply a pastoral engine for the bishops of a certain area to coordinate their pastoral ministry.
I pray that this chamber will uphold the Virginia family, that the bills and laws being passed will always protect the biblical traditional marriage as God instructed the first man and the first woman in the Bible, that the two shall be one flesh, he added.
Dragged Across Concrete is utterly hypnotic. I never wanted it to end, and I am going to watch it again today. And then I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and give Zahler's debut, Bone Tomahawk (2015), another look. This time with the attention it deserves.
In her appearance at Fatima, the Virgin Mary foresaw and warned us of the risk of hell where a godless life that profanes Him in his creatures will lead, Francis said during the canonization Mass Saturday. Such a life is frequently proposed and imposed, he said.

The funny thing is, and there are many funny things going on right now, every person with a microphone in every TV studio in America today knew the fuller truth when they said things like the ones you just heard. They knew, for example, for certain that Joe Biden isn't well. Everyone in Washington knows that, but no one said it out loud, not a word. They withheld that news from you as they have for months, so much for speaking truth to power.
There are even smaller things. Bradley's proud to hang Old Glory over his house and on top of being a cool, stoic badass, he listens to Christian rock.
Then-President-elect Trump interviewed Ernst at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in July 2016, as he was considering potential running mates. Ernst told reporters later that she made clear she was interested in continuing to serve Iowa in the Senate, to which she was elected in 2014 after serving as a state senator and county official. The president eventually chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) as his running mate.
Chasserio said she hopes to expand training programs, including joining forces with a local mill where women can learn to make bread.
That is, it's possible that Bezos knew, or should have known, that he was just in the midst of a stinky situation, and yet as part of a sort of cover-up, he chose to escalate his accusations, as a way of, in effect, changing the subject away from himself as an adulterer, and toward others alleged to be aggressors.
Andrew Beckwith, the president of Massachusetts Family Institute (MFI), testified Tuesday against the bill, asserting it would remove the ability of children and their parents to receive desired counseling from licensed mental health professions to help address unwanted sexual attractions and gender confusion.
Taiwanese voters have been increasingly rattled by China's hardline response to pro-democracy protests in neighboring Hong Kong and the mass internment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.
Prior to Fox's recent report, Sanger had criticized Wikipedia's left-wing bias himself on his blog. In that post, Sanger analyzed the articles on Trump and former President Barack Obama, describing how the latter was treated much more favorably including by not mentioning any scandals on Obama's page. He also analyzed other articles, such as the one on Jesus Christ, which he said could be fairly described as a liberal academic discussion of Jesus in a criticism later cited by Christian media reports condemning a decision last year banning profile pages expressing support for traditional marriage.
Then as we have seen, this January 21 came a new eruption—that Guardian story, citing a technical report, damning the Saudis, from a firm called FTI Consulting, which had been retained by Bezos. That Guardian piece was followed by a flood of other stories in the Main Stream Media, all of which echoed, at least at first, the basic Bezos/de Becker storyline, namely that Michael Sanchez notwithstanding, the Saudis are the real nogoodniks.
An administration official told The Post that efforts were underway to redirect every single pot of money from the WHO to other organizations. Large international relief organizations already are in many cases doing similar work, they said.

After an inquiry from NBC News, Facebook temporarily suspended several predator hunter accounts, removed some individual posts and deleted at least one group entirely. Some groups voluntarily removed their own pages to escape what they saw as a purge. POPSquad appeared to be unaffected.
The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk, said dictator Kim Jong-Un in his New Year message. This is the reality, not a threat.
It would position the government to lord over churches and other faith-based institutions, dictating potentially who they hire, how their facilities are used, and even punishing them for not falling in step with a view of human sexuality that directly contradicts orthodox biblical teaching:
The relevant hadith is this: The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death) (Bukhari 7.62.88)
The 24 judges so far who are claiming senior status, whereby they may step away from the bench to allow for a replacement while still collecting their salary and work a reduced case load, include three U.S. District Court judges in the California Bay Area: Phyllis Hamilton, the district's chief judge, and William Alsup – both Clinton appointees – and Jeffrey White, appointed by Republican President George W. Bush.
God, promise us, we beg of you…
The Court's ruling declined to answer the big free speech questions in the case, holding instead that because commissioners on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission called Phillips' mainstream Christian beliefs despicable during his official hearing, that the Colorado state government was manifesting hostility toward a specific religion in violation of the Free Exercise Clause in the Constitution's First Amendment.
Stone continued, The internet censorship of my show on Infowars and my Facebook page where — I've written five books; two of them New York Times best sellers — strictly through Facebook promotion, because I understand targeting. I can no longer do that because I'm censored and shadowbanned on Facebook.
Mrs. May told the BBC she was very sorry for the MPs who lost their seats. She said she obviously wanted a different result and would reflect on what has happened.
Center Brandon Linder, wide receiver DJ Chark, right tackle Jawaan Taylor, linebacker Lerentee McCray, kicker Josh Lambo and quarterback Joshua Dobbs were among the players who attended. Some players who were not in Jacksonville, including quarterback Gardner Minshew, linebacker Joe Schobert and defensive end Aaron Lynch, submitted videos in support of the march that were posted on the team's official website. With the NFL allowing only coaches to return to their offices Friday and players still working remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, several Jaguars could not take part in the march.
The petition also claimed that Cornyn was rated 7% by the NAACP, indicating an anti-affirmative-action stance.
The study went on to observe that mortality rates for many other groups have fallen since the turn of the century, including Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and most dramatically black Americans, although their death rates remain generally much higher than whites. The study that originally highlighted rising mortality rates in 2015 explained it was really more a matter of the rates for white Americans of recent generations flattening out, while most other groups saw significant improvement over the past 15 years. The improvements have been attributed to successful crusades against smoking, drug abuse, and other unhealthy lifestyle choices, combined with expanded treatment for maladies like HIV.
Regarding the three nominees confirmed last week – as well as Judge Eric Miller, confirmed one week earlier to the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 53-46 with no Democrats in support – the American Bar Association (ABA) rated all of these nominees as either Qualified or Well Qualified.
The left is obsessed with the idea that Pence is anti-gay, solely because he is a born-again Christian and once advocated for conversion therapy — 20 years ago.
The Australian Christian Lobby describes itself as seeking a compassionate, just and moral society through having the public contributions of the Christian faith reflected in the political life of the nation. They were among the groups that planned to meet at the Mercure Sydney Airport Hotel in September for a conference on same-sex marriage, but the hotel canceled the event, and even shut down its own Facebook page, due to threats of physical violence.
The archbishop noted that marriage is unique because it is the only institution that connects children to their mothers and fathers, and therefore is presumed to be a sexual relationship.
Endemic unemployment and poverty are said to be major contributing factors.
They threatened me with the evil consequences of marrying a Christian and when I objected and tried to escape from illegal confinement they physically assaulted me and outraged my modesty by tearing my dress, the woman testified. There were classes regarding the evil spirits of Christianity and Islam and they used to promote enmity towards Islam and Christ.
A man and a woman united in marriage, together with their children, form a family, it reads. This institution is prior to any recognition by public authority, which has an obligation to recognize it. It should be considered the normal reference point by which the different forms of family relationship are to be evaluated.
Student loans debt has now surpassed home equity revolving debt, car loans, and credit card debt.
In recent days the state had come under severe pressure from major corporations including Coca-Coal that is headquartered in Atlanta, and Disney who said they would pull out, even though Disney is about to open a facility in communist China where women are forced to have abortions and Christian practice is severely persecuted.
The crackdown is part of a larger censorship system debuting last week. According to the Times, The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) made public a guideline that says all online literary platforms will be assessed annually on an 100-point scale, of which 30 points will be dedicated to 'value guidance and style of thought.'
The Chinese Foreign Ministry and government-run newspapers in the country launched a campaign Thursday to discredit women who have testified to being raped and tortured in Communist Party-run concentration camps, referring to them as criminals and actors.
So yes, let's investigate all this. Let's find out if this was just a sordid affair that got amplified globally, because Bezos wanted to drown out the noise of his own misbehaving. Let's find out if Bezos is a victim of global heavyweights—or just of his own hot-bloodedness.
The Home Office report claimed that no conclusions about the ethnic background of rape gang members could really be drawn, in part because the state does not bother, still, to collect reliable statistics on the ethnicity of the predators and their victims in a systematic manner.
Leftists have launched a new dark money group called Accountable Tech aimed at combating misinformation online — essentially acting as gatekeepers of what is acceptable on social media.
Data from UNICEF shows 98 percent of girls in Somalia and 87 percent of Egyptian girls have undergone the procedure.
Not only does the procedure hurt the victim physically, but it can also lead to long-term mental health issues. Experts have identified no legitimate medical reason for a woman to ever undergo FGM.
Speaking directly to the transgender community, Lynch said history is on your side.
I have not even scratched the surface. The oppression of women in Islamic countries is by far the cruellest in the world. No other major societies treat their women in this way and that is not an unfortunate coincidence, it is the direct result of these and many other teachings in Islamic scripture.
The Washington Post spotlighted Democratic Rep. Katie Hill denying that men are using claims of being transgender to enter women' sports. This is fearmongering about transwomen playing in sports … I can tell you no trans person is trying to game the system to participate in sports, she said in response to an amendment from Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube.
Royal relatives on hand include Charles Spencer, the brother of Harry's late mother Princess Diana.
Democrats applauded themselves for voting to free individuals' from civil society and from biology and repeatedly denied the GOP arguments that the legislation would endanger religious freedom, children's health, parents' authority, women's rights, and female sports.

Among his 40-odd films, he played a sheriff who jailed Rambo in First Blood, a serial killer in To Catch a Killer, and a corrupt sheriff gunned down by Kevin Kline in Silverado. He also had some benign roles: the bartender who consoles Dudley Moore in 10 and the levelheaded leader of aliens in Cocoon and its sequel.
As a report from Reuters has noted, the bishops' statement Thursday does not mention Sunday Masses, a serious obligation for Catholics. In this sacred period of Lent, many more Catholics also attend weekday Masses as part of their devotion in preparation for Holy Week and Easter, Reuters adds.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act will be committed to the memory hole, and we will then experience a catastrophic loss of religious freedom in America, and, as a result, every American, those who believe and do not believe, will suffer the consequences. I urge the American people to speak with great force and clarity to Congress to stop H.R. 5, the Inequality Act:
Cruz said although it is being described as a narrow decision, that is not narrow; that is a bedrock principle of our First Amendment and our nation.
Five important signs that some black Americans are awakening to a break with the Democrat Party are:
The stated reason in the petition – The decision to host Mr. Cornyn, as a keynote speaker sends the message that the policies and views he has advocated and supported, including both discriminatory policies and politicians, are acceptable by the university and subsequently the student body.
The two men embraced after Buttigieg finished his opening campaign speech in South Bend, Indiana.
One of her proudest accomplishments at the Foundation was establishing the annual Young Leaders Conference Program, in which upcoming political and cultural leaders from the U.S. spend an intensive week in Switzerland discussing ideas and issues with their Swiss counterparts. This program has continued for 28 sessions. Ambassador Whittlesey personally attended every session. As of 2018 the program has more than 1,200 alumni who have helped forge strong bonds between the U.S. and the Swiss.
Tony Award-winning actress Audra McDonald tweeted: She was so sweet, funny, wise, lovely, and brilliant. She will be so missed. Rest In Peace Sweet Charlotte Rae.
b) What are you saying, man? Don't you see, this is, like, a violation of everything we libertarians believe in? You can't – Pass me that joint, will you? You're bogarting it. Yes you are – where was I? Oh yeah, look, it's like this: if you're gonna complain about Christian bakeries being prosecuted for refusing to bake gay cakes because of they violate their religious principles, you're just being hypocritical complaining when YouTube puts restrictions on PragerU videos because they violate their liberal principles. Either you believe in free markets or you don't.
In November, Florida Angel Mom Kiyan Michael, a member of the Black Voices for Trump advisory board, drew attention to the divide between the Democrat Party and black voters on the issue of school choice.
French Front National firebrand, and niece of Marine Le Pen, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen has announced she is to step down from politics citing personal reasons.
Only 29 percent of young Americans between 17 and 24 are eligible to meet the requirements to join the military, according to the Heritage Foundation. Only one in eight wish to serve in the military, according to the Associated Press.
Finally, there's Bradley's drug dealer-boss Gil (Marc Blucas), an upper middle-class white guy who, upon introduction, matter-of-factly fires off a series of politically incorrect statements about mineral water being gay and Mexicans always traveling with big families. And yet, Gil doesn't seem to say these things out of a racial malevolence but rather for the pleasure of being an outlaw in a world increasingly ruled by the fascism of political correctness.
That was the role that introduced Finney to American audiences, and few would forget the lusty, blue-eyed leading man who helped the film win a Best Picture Oscar. Finney also earned his first Best Actor nomination for his efforts and the smash hit turned him into a Hollywood leading man.
I didn't want to share it with anybody, and in the era of hashtag-MeToo survivors, I always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they're ready, Ernst told Bloomberg. And I was not ready.
If you want to see a movie for grownups about the death penalty, see Dead Man Walking (1995), which was made by three of the most left-wing people ever: Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, and Sean Penn. Yes, the movie opposes the death penalty but it does so without shying away from the reality that almost all the people on death row are not only guilty as hell, but monsters who committed the most heinous crimes imaginable.
How could such a reversal happen in so short a time span? For nearly 70 years, the Republican Party had enjoyed near-monopoly support from black voters. After all, the first Republican President was Abraham Lincoln, who was responsible for freeing the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But, much like the Democrats today, the Republican Party of that era took the black vote for granted. The Republicans thought, How could a black American not vote for the candidate of the Party of Abraham Lincoln? Or, as a Democrat might say it today, How could an African American not vote for the party whose president signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965?
Bautista said his mother is a lesbian, so he does not take too kindly to Pacquiao's views on homosexuality.
Feminist economics might be imagined as a way of radically reconceptualizing and reorienting the study of economics rather than just an approach to make gender inequalities visible. Taking such a position, this course surveys foundational and contemporary feminist scholarship on epistemology, methodology and economic theory in order to trace their evolution over time and explore their transformative potential.
After his first joke failed, Bloomberg directed the conversation back to affordable housing and discussed what he did to improve the system.
The group's two employees listed on the website are both steeped in Democrat politics — far from being neutral arbiters of truth on social media.
Terry Schilling, executive director of American Principles Project (APP), explained further the Equality Act will make permanent in federal law Biden's executive order on his first day as president regarding Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.
The 68-year-old Clearwater, Florida, resident did not react well to husband Thomas Burke's announcement that he was leaving her after nine years of marriage.
Talking to El Mundo in January, 17-year-old Bolsonaro supporter Gabriel, who identifies as gay, denied that his candidate is homophobic, claiming that journalists always exaggerate his words and that he is the only person who will put the country in order.
In Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, the Court will determine whether a Minnesota law that disallows any sort of political message at a polling place—such as a voter wearing a NRA hat or a Don't Tread on Me t-shirt when he casts his ballot—is so much broader than necessary to prevent voter intimidation that it violates the First Amendment.

Myth 6: Safety and Privacy in Sex-Specific Spaces Will Not Be Diminished
As talks of impeachment continue to swirl within the Democrat Party, two individuals from The Nation and Jacobin who have been studying the issue are warning that it is merely political and will most likely end negatively for those on the left.
Another Global Times piece on Wednesday told cities like Milan and New York to look upon Wuhan as a shining example that proves this invisible enemy, while extremely dangerous and tough, can be beaten and that there is indeed a bright light at the end of the tunnel.
While typically reflecting the Chinese government's party line and regurgitating belligerent state propaganda against the United States, the Global Times has printed comments from individuals referring to homosexuality as normal and natural, if only present among a small group of people. That remark, from a sexologist, came in response to new online censorship from the China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA), which banned pornography and vulgar tastes including abnormal sexual relations such as incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse, as well as unhealthy views on marriage such as sexual freedom and wife swapping.
Buckle urged Christians to stand up and affirm their belief in the unchangeable truth that marriage is the stable union of one man and one woman.
DURBIN: You don't believe it's prohibited?
There are chilling things happening in the West, he said. I think that a parliament that authorizes the death of an innocent, defenseless child commits a serious act of violence against the human person.
Crowds cheered as the Hollywood star and his lawyer spouse arrived at Windsor Castle – he in a gray suit, she in mustard yellow dress and matching hat.
Prager continued, I am absolutely convinced that a subtext here is that secular people fear death more. And we don't want to die any more than anyone. I love life. I love my family and friends. I love everything I do. I'm crazy about life, but I don't fear death. I believe there's an afterlife. I don't think this is all there is. Clearly, if you think this is all there is then you will fear losing it more than the guy who thinks this isn't all there is.
Now, however, Gabbard is facing similar accusations after a CNN report by researched Andrew Kaczynski that detailed her family's past support for traditional marriage.
The following post is sponsored by The Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy (CRFP).
The legalization of abortion reduces a country's total fertility rate significantly, by as much as half a child on average, he wrote approvingly, while criticizing America's Mexico City Policy, which denies funding to NGOs that perform or promote abortions.
For many years, Thabet worked with the United Nations and other non-government international agencies to help boys as young as nine years old regain their lives and rejoin their family and larger community. She also helped young girls who married terrorists in a country with high poverty and no laws banning child marriage.
But he expressed disapproval at all this complaining about the press, and now announcing they're off the royal rota with press… actually, for most of his life, Harry's had a very good press, in my view.
Often forced in to marriage, forced to live with domestic violence, and enslaved under a system of 'honour', life can be sheer misery for girls unfortunate enough to have been born in to Islam. To top it off, many will have their clitoris cut off so that sex will be painful and they can suffer the further humiliation of incontinence and other side-effects.

Head and Nelson observed black Americans are becoming the most conservative constituency within the Democratic Party's coalition, particularly where religion and abortion are concerned.
The city's punitive action targets the farmer's use of his own private property, 22 miles outside the city and well outside its jurisdiction. Mr. Tennes has declared that he does not discriminate against LGBT customers at the farmer's market, and gladly sells his produce to all comers.
National Marriage Week USA, launched in 2010, is part of an international event seeking to mobilize individuals, organizations, and businesses in a common purpose to strengthen marriage in communities and influence the culture, the bishops' website states.

Democrats have completely failed black people, and that is by design. Democrats know that once people become middle class, they are much more likely to vote Republican. So the goal is to keep people poor, keep 'em scared, keep their schools crappy (no school choice, no charter schools), tell them there's no hope because America is evil and racist — in other words, keep 'em voting for Democrats.
I'm here for that 10 seconds when that coach goes around the corner, she said. It'll be well worth it.
And the fake news media are certainly not at all interested in the litany of #MeToo promises they made last year to ensure us the 1990s, that horrible era where the media relentlessly smeared all of Bill Clinton's victims, would never happened again. Because…

In an interview with Catholic News Service, Renard also said that while the church could not refuse baptisms, it could require parents seeking the sacrament for their child to commit to raise children according to church rules.
U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality — mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. Although the decriminalization strategy is still being hashed out, officials say it's likely to include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights. Other U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts throughout Europe, including the U.S. Mission to the E.U., are involved, as is the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration's top geopolitical foe.
I don't trust Franklin Graham to help those in need in the LGBTQ community. I've seen far too many anti-LGBTQ activists like Graham ignore the suffering of LGBTQ people. In this instance, Graham is capitalizing upon a crisis to inflict more pain and suffering on an already marginalized population. He has stated, loudly and proudly, too many times that the LGBTQ community is a threat for me to want to place my life, or the lives of people l love and care about, in his hands.
But the study also produced a remarkable chart showing the attitude of Democratic political insiders towards the pro-American views of normal voters.
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is still widespread – but increasingly condemned – throughout much of North and East Africa. However, the recent history of the practice in Egypt presents special challenges for those trying to end it, the UNFPA site read.

In late 2015, the Prison Officer's Association (POA) found that a growing number of non-Muslims are being forced to pay a protection tax, or jizya unless they convert to Islam.
In the framework of responsible stewardship for creation, Francis suggested, the manipulation of gender implies an assault on the Creator and a disrespect for his designs.
The GOP memo documents how the FISA applications did not mention the financing from Clinton's campaign or the DNC, and the documents also left out the role of Fusion GPS in producing the dossier.

This is the first time in history that Muslim clerics have raised their voices in support of the rights of transgender persons, said Qamar Naseem, a transgender community activist. But we have to go further for transgender people and the country needs to introduce legislation on it.
Stasi's claim of ignorance regarding Guilfoyle's Puerto Rican heritage lacks credibility for a couple of reasons.

Gabbard, described by CNN as the first Hindu and American Samoan elected to Congress, made a surprise announcement Friday that she would be running for president in 2020.
9:48 PM: Sanders asked why his message is not resonating with African-Americans. Sanders gives a roundabout answer about winning the ideological struggle. He says almost every state has supported Medicare for all. Sanders says he is also winning the generational struggle in the states. Young black voters are going for Sanders. Sanders says you need energy and excitement to defeat Trump. Sanders is right–Democrats have to energize their young voters because Trump will energize young voters on the right.
A victory for Macron would result in civilisational upheaval and create new injustices and inequalities for women and children, according to the pro-family group.
In Sveen v. Melin, they will decide whether it violates the Constitution's Contracts Clause for a state to pass a law invalidating a previous contract where the private parties agreed to a marriage-related contract before that new law was enacted.
Honestly, does anyone want to live in Mr. French's vision of an idealized Christian world — one where we never let it go, where we condemn people over 12-year-old sins, condemn those for not condemning 12-year-old sins, and remain silent as a Mean Little Mayor uses his national platform to deliberately corrupt the Faith?
Following the migrant crisis on the continent, the number of Muslim child brides in Germany's capital, Berlin, is on the rise, and in Scandinavia, child 'wives' are being 'tolerated' in migrant centres in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.
The proposed Equality Act of 2021 (H.R. 5) would make mainstream beliefs about marriage, biological facts about sex differences, and many sincerely held beliefs punishable under the law. The Equality Act makes discrimination the law of the land by forcing Americans to conform to government-mandated beliefs under the threat of life-ruining financial and criminal penalties. Presented as a bill with commonsense and decent protections against discrimination, H.R. 5 is anything but. The Equality Act politicizes medicine and education and demolishes existing civil rights and constitutional freedoms.
This, of course, is the same explanation sitcom star Roseanne Barr presented in her defense late last month after being fired from her ABC show, Roseanne. In a tweet, Barr compared former-Obama White House advisor Valerie Jarrett to an ape. Barr, however, said she had no idea Jarrett is black. Barr was still disgraced and fired.

Keeping in mind that one of Obamacare's undeclared goals – arguably the only part of the program that actually worked – was the radical expansion of Medicaid, Eberstadt's citation of 2013 Census Bureau data is sobering: 21 percent of all civilian men between 25 and 55 years of age are now Medicaid beneficiaries.

Unfortunately, Pakistani society has become more intolerant than ever before.

Talking about feeling the embryonic kicking of feminism from your unborn child and declaring you'd not have too many children because climate change — which certainly wins applause in narrow, liberal circles — just comes across as a bit odd to the majority.

A year ago, the government released Mayssa al-Amoudi and Loujain al-Hathloul from jail after 72 days in prison for driving. On December 1, 2014, Amoudi drove to the border to support friend Ms. Hathloul, 25, who tried to cross the border in her car one day earlier. Activists claim Amoudi did not intend to cross the border, but authorities arrested her with Hathloul. The government also did not release a statement explaining why they released the women.

And now you know what I meant by a word salad of imperious gibberish.
Putin ended a 30-year marriage to the mother of his two adult daughters, Lyudmila Putina, in 2014, after which he was romantically linked to Russian gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Kabaeva was rumored to have secretly borne Putin a love child at a Swiss hospital last year, a rumor the Kremlin dismissed as a journalistic hoax.
This is my life's work. And so I keep working on this about what's changing in America. I'm studying families that go bankrupt. And the credit card companies, half-dozen giant credit card companies figure out that if they can get the bankruptcy laws changed, that what will happen is they can improve their bottom line by just a little by keeping people locked out of bankruptcy, Warren said.  Never mind that there's people are head over heels in medical debts, that they've had job losses that have put them way behind, that they've had a death or divorce in the family, but they've been cheated by credit card companies and mortgage companies. Never mind any of that. Just improve the bottom line for the credit card companies.

Noting the tide in public sentiment against repression of women, pressuring change even in nations like neighboring Saudi Arabia, the Iranian regime has rolled back only the least important of its abusive policies against women in the hope of receiving international praise. Last year, the regime let some women watch a soccer match at a stadium, then demanded applause.
Having a valid Social Security number is among the few requirements to receive the $1,200 relief outlined in the CARES Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed at the end of March. Those with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN), which includes foreign nationals and those residing in the country illegally, are not eligible for the cash relief. Married couples are also not eligible if one of the spouses does not have a Social Security number — a point that sparked the lawsuit.
Cardinal John Onaiyekan, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Diocese in Nigeria, said that the position of Catholics against homosexual behavior is irrevocable and that the Church will continue to maintain its stand against same-sex marriage.
I'm frustrated, I just feel that the police are taking the **** out of me. They should be communicating with me, they should be talking to me, complained Hannah, who managed to get the police to reopen the investigation only in late 2019, after pressure from third parties over failings in the original investigation.
And then I really started being awakening [sic] to what was happening with the Democratic Party — making so many promises but then abandoning the community that I worked so hard in, he continued.

A 2013 analysis by USA Today found that 32 members of Congress had doled out more than $2 million to relatives who staffed their campaigns in the 2012 election. One of the biggest recipients was the wife of Rep. Bobby Rush, Illinois Democrat, who received $147,549 in the 2012 cycle, an order of magnitude less than the $2.8 million Mr. Mynett's company was paid for its work on the Omar campaign, as reported Nov. 10 by Fox News.
Mary Rice Hasson, fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) explains:
Every dollar that was spent went to a team of more than 20 that were helping us fight back against attacks and organize on the ground and online in a COVID-19 world. And Tim — beyond his salary at the firm — received no profit whatsoever from the consulting relationship the firm provided, Omar said in an email obtained by the Associated Press.
In Patchak v. Zinke, they will decide an important constitutional separation-of-powers question of whether Congress can pass a law instructing the courts is dismiss a particular federal case or group of cases that are already in the court system.
McAdams also charges his boss with selective quotation from the report of the Faculty Hearing Committee and incomplete description of its conclusions. You fail to acknowledge that you are not simply implementing the recommendations of the Committee (as wrong as they are) but are going beyond them, writes McAdams.
Pro-life students at the Georgia Institute of Technology have filed a lawsuit against their university over its refusal to provide funding for a scheduled guest lecture event featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, Dr. Alevda King. The students argue that it is unconstitutional for the university to reject their request for student funds on the basis of King's pro-life views.
Dr Kovács also expressed concern that seemingly laudable provisions of the Convention requiring signatories to take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that gender-based violence against women may be recognised as a form of persecution and allow gender-based asylum claims are intended to pave the way for more bogus asylum applications by illegal migrants, rendering it yet another attempt by pro-migration groups to find a way to force the issue of migration.
He is generally supportive of international trade deals and he backs the treaty with Canada.
For example, Mark Zuckerberg' FWD.us group declared that the Biden amnesty is Vital to Restoring the U.S.' Moral Leadership. The statement from the investor group continued:
In our case, it all started when we began criticizing the people in charge. Other channels fill their air with attacks on so-called Proud Boys, whoever they are, or the QAnon enthusiasts or gun owners in Central Pennsylvania who fix air conditionings for a living and tend to vote the wrong way. They go after those people, and you can see why. Attacking those people isn't hard. None of them have real power. They don't — let's be honest, they don't.
As a bastion of staunch royalism, however, the Armed Forces has been less than impressed with the prince's recent antics, as he announced — reportedly without giving the Queen or other senior royals more than a few minutes' notice — his intention to walk away from much of his public duties along with his American wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to help her establish them as a celebrity power couple in North America.
Now, when people ask him what the secret is to a long and happy marriage, Nick has only one answer.
Further, the bill makes discrimination on the basis of a sex stereotype illegal, he added. This means that any tangible step to refuse participation in a gay 'wedding' would be illegal discrimination under this legislation.
A new video from the BBC features slang-talking, hijab and niqab-clad women waxing lyrical on how empowered they feel as a result of obscuring their identities from the outside world.
CBS reported on Friday that L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said he was proud to stand with the City Council banning travel for City employees to North Carolina and Mississippi.

If Trump hadn't hired Manafort and Flynn, the independent counsel investigation would have been over in about a week.
Bonino's appearance at the parish was part of events organized to celebrate World Refugee Day 2017.
An Uppsala team, feeding Imperial's parameters into its own study, agreed. The modelling envisaged Sweden paying a heavy price for its rejection of lockdown, with 40,000 Covid deaths by 1 May and almost 100,000 by June. The latest figure for Sweden is 2,680 deaths, with daily deaths peaking a fortnight ago. The virus, it turns out, has been spreading at a fraction of the speed suggested. So Imperial College's modelling – the same modelling used to inform the UK response – was wrong, by an order of magnitude.
Political bias at Wikipedia and the Foundation has been a growing cause of concern. Last year the Foundation endorsed the Black Lives Matter movement, ignoring violent rioting associated with it and declaring no neutral stance existed on the issue, while editors on Wikipedia pushed the movement's agenda. The Foundation cited the code of conduct as one way it would address equity issues on Wikipedia in its endorsement. Numerous studies and analyses have demonstrated a left-wing bias on the site, a bias criticized by co-founder Larry Sanger last year, with one study finding the push for off-setting a pro-men bias on Wikipedia has over-corrected into a pro-women bias. With the new code of conduct, such biases are likely to worsen.
Detective Chief Superintendent Declan Daly said that the couple's sentencing sends a strong and important message that Female Genital Mutilation will not be tolerated in the country. He said: It is a heinous and barbaric practice which is a criminal offence in Ireland.

As Mother Teresa is canonized a saint on Sunday, Stephanie Mann recalls the media frenzy over the death of Diana, and describes her funeral as her canonization. She writes at National Catholic Register:
Both the husband of the girl, who has been detained by Swedish police, along with her two parents claim that the marriage was voluntary and deny they committed any crime.
Barbara Bush blamed Donald Trump for her heart attack. It wasn't technically a heart attack, though she called it that. It was a crisis in her long battle with congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease that hit her like a sledgehammer one day in June 2016. An ambulance was called to take her to the hospital. The two former presidents who had been at home with her that day, her husband and her oldest son, trailed in a car driven by the Secret Service. The tumultuous presidential campaign in general and Trump's ridicule of son Jeb Bush in particular had riled her. Angst, she told me. Afterward, Jeb, whose presidential campaign was already history, urged her to let it go, to focus on herself and have faith in the country. There's just a lot of angst among those distressed by President Trump's leadership, Jeb Bush told me, using the same word that his mother had used. So I think one of the solutions is don't watch it; don't obsess. Jeb said, 'Mom, don't worry about things you can't do anything about,'  Barbara Bush recalled. He's right. Just do good, make life better for someone else.
There remains much to be done, though. Far too many people still face harassment, discrimination, and violence for being who they are. This is unacceptable.
The Pope has in fact been an outspoken critic of LGBT agitators' efforts to impose same-sex marriage and theories of gender fluidity that divorce gender from biological sexual differences.
Curiously, despite Mr. Salvini's complete alignment with the Catholic Church on key moral issues such as the right to life, traditional marriage, gender theory, and freedom of education, the Italian Church establishment has been waging an open war on the interior minister, comparing him to Satan and the antichrist, because of his commitment to reining in illegal immigration.

Meghan Markle's departure from the UK has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with her insistence on acting like a spoilt, unaccountable Hollywood princess in a country that takes a dim view of spoilt, unaccountable Hollywood princesses.
[This ideology] would allow men who 'identify' as women to gain access to intimate facilities like changing rooms, locker rooms, and bathrooms, and saying that any women who object that they are uncomfortable with such an arrangement are 'bigoted,' he said. Obergefell v. Hodges … illegitimately determined that all states must issue and recognize 'marriages' to same-sex couples, imposing the skewed values of a handful of judges on the nation with no legal foundation and in a gross example of legislating from the bench, Brown said , according to the Christian Post.
Although for the moment the police say they have no suspects, Olsen reportedly fought with her boyfriend three days prior to her death and the couple hadn't spoken since then. The boyfriend, a 40-year-old Florentine painter named Federico Fiorentini, is the one who found Ashley and alerted police to her death.
Robertson used the calendar to explain that something remarkable happened in the man Jesus, after all, our calendar is dated beginning with his life. He said, If your calendar is dated on of (sic) all the human beings who have ever walked on the earth, and your calendar is dedicated and predicated to just one of them, evidently something rather large went down back then.
The intent of the Equality Act may be to promote equality and tolerance — love is love! — but the practical application of it would be to grant biological men the right to impose their will on women, whenever and wherever they want, he observed, adding:
In response, the band released a statement saying that it was determined not to quit or succumb to pressure meant to restrict their freedom of speech.

So to my Republican friends … you have to praise the president when he does good things…. But when he goes beyond the line, or anyone else does, for that matter, you have to stand on principle.
Carter also claimed in 2018 that Jesus Christ would be in favor of same-sex marriage.
Not surprisingly, the growing online media market for women is using the same tactics traditional media does: fear. Before there was online click bait, women's magazines used the fear factor to grab women's attention. A couple examples:
Corker also opposed confirming Richard Grenell, who will be the Trump administration's highest openly gay official as U.S. ambassador to Germany.
Obama, joined Thursday by his wife and daughters, was effusive in his praise for the man who ran against him in 2008, then agreed to be his running mate. He said Biden had made him a better president, calling him a lion of American history.

The Supreme Court declined to take the case. However, Chief Justice John Roberts took the unusual step of issuing a statement with the denial, noting that the lower court had ordered additional court proceedings to determine whether the Texas Legislature enacted SB14 with a discriminatory purpose and whether the law results in a denial or abridgement of the right to vote.
He becomes the second governor to enter the sprawling field, after Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) announced last week and is trying to cast himself as a pragmatist who can also take on President Donald Trump. Though as governor Hickenlooper prided himself for staying above partisan fights, he has argued his record as a former governor and big-city mayor distinguishes him from a broad field of Democratic hopefuls who are backing ambitious liberal plans on health care, taxes and the climate.
As a result of the backlash stemming from the drunk driving arrest, Jeep suspended the campaign.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump ordered a 60-day hold on U.S. funding to the W.H.O., asserting the organization failed to vet information about the novel coronavirus coming out of China, and ultimately covered up the seriousness of its effects because of its friendly relationship with that nation.
We are here to encourage them to let her in, Love said. She's been recognized by the U.N. as a refugee so we believe the Australian government needs to step up, recognize her plight and recognize what she's gone through, and she could be an icon for the rest of the world that women shouldn't be oppressed and they should be fleeing countries that they are oppressed in.

Then things deteriorated further as the student said that it was his right as an American citizen to make arguments against gay marriage. Abbate replied that you don't have a right in this class to make homophobic comments. She further said she would take offense if the student said that women can't serve in particular roles. And she added that somebody who is homosexual would experience similar offense if somebody opposed gay marriage in class.

This is the profile of an extremist, Donohue concludes. He throws the health of New Yorkers overboard to allow for a jammed protest he likes, and then invokes his health edict to ban people of faith from attending their house of worship.
You know, [Trump's] goal in changing the face of immigration in America is one that I will never buy into. You know, we have a diverse nation, and that is our strength as far as I'm concerned. We come from many different places, all proud to be Americans, all working together as an American team, if you will. But we do have these background differences. And for this president to say that for the first time in 90 years he wants to dramatically cut legal immigration in America, that is a complete reversal of the policy of immigration that we've had since 1965.
As Breitbart News reported, the same-sex marriage debate in Australia is proving to be fiercely divisive. The postal ballot was called after the conservative government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull preferred option of a national referendum was twice rejected by the upper house.

As it happens, I've known Jonah for twenty years or more, admired his wit and insights, promoted his books, and put him on my platforms. I was distressed when he joined the chorus of Never Trumpers, but never wrote a critical word about him, hoping I guess that, as Trump systematically undid the damage that the Obama regime had inflicted on the country, Jonah would return to his senses.
Ibrahim Omerdic has been convicted for marrying a child bride to a much older man under laws prohibiting forced marriage in Melbourne, Australia.
It seems silly to go over there and beg for an award, he told the paper.
Twitter has bowed to Islamic blasphemy laws and is now going after truth-tellers about Jihad and Sharia oppression. That is why Tommy Robinson and Shazia Hobbs are banned permanently from Twitter, it why Twitter suspends the accounts of people like ex-FBI agent John Guandolo and illustrator Bosch Fawstin. These are people who are simply trying to defend freedom as well as to protect Muslim and non-Muslim people from Jihad and Sharia. I have been suspended in this case because they are saying I violated their rules against hateful conduct. I have engaged in no hateful conduct whatsoever. I am a human rights activist fighting on behalf of Muslim women and girls who suffer under Sharia oppression. All that my two tweets in question did is refer to the verses in the Hadith and Qur'an that record Mohammed's marriage to Aisha when she was 6 years old and that sanction sex slavery. This is not me saying it. I am simply referring to Islamic texts that say it. For them to allege that Islamic texts are hateful is a grave insult to Muslims across the world. But this is the key: If a Muslim had referred to these same texts in support of child marriage and sex slavery, he would not be suspended. It is referring to these texts if you are against child marriage and sex slavery that constitutes the problem on Twitter. It is a sad day for free speech and for the effort to protect Muslim women and girls from oppression.
But even that paled in comparison to the sensation of knocking off the top three European teams before routing South Africa 11-1 in September to earn the Europe/Africa Olympic berth and becoming the first team to qualify after host Japan.

If this logic is followed, there is only the calculation of advantages and disadvantages, Francis claimed. Choices are not made on the basis of ethical criteria, but by pandering to dominant interests, often cleverly obscured by a humanitarian or ecological veneer.

The reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago. [N]umber two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when I'm elected president – if I'm elected president – a codification of Roe v Wade, amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And in fact, I've gotten 100% rating from NARAL as well.

Another theme Chase often touches on is how America is becoming Generica, a country where no matter where you go, every place looks like every other place by way of the cancerous spread of corporate chains and box stores. The visual character of this country has literally been bulldozed by hotels, restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores, strip malls, and coffee shops that all look alike.

Elsewhere in its coverage of the two sessions, the Global Times noted that some lawmakers are seeking government policies to ban the feminization of male characters in films, TV dramas and other public media. The article, citing a member of one of the two sessions, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), defined masculinity as fervent belief in communism, or having a firm political stance. Zhang Shuhua, the CPPCC member, complained of too many feminized men appearing in popular culture.

Mike Pence @VP asks what kind of anti-Christian bigot would keep us from being anti-gay bigots?

The legislation, dubbed H.R. 5 or The Equality Act, is unlikely to get through the GOP-led Senate.

I knew this stuff happened when my mom was a young practicing lawyer, graduating law school in the 1960s'. At age 20, she had to wait for a year to take the bar. I knew it happened with Justice O'Connor, couldn't get a job as a lawyer when she graduated Stanford Law School and had to work as a secretary. I am shocked it still happens every year that I get women, not men, raising their hand to that question. Thank you for the opportunity to clarify that Senator.

There were people who voted for Brexit, who did it in good faith, they were angry, and they thought their situation was impossible, because the system was unjust, stated Macron, before claiming that UK citizens are now starting to realise that all the figures they were given are entirely false, and what they were told could be done overnight in fact can't be delivered.
The GOP leadership stayed out of view. GOP Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, for example, did not speak against the legislation — even though it would make it legally risky for parents or doctors to question a child's claim to have an opposite-sex gender identity or deny an unhappy teenager's demand for risky sex-related medical treatments.
This practice is harmful to the mental and physical health of minors, she said. We want to make sure they're in a healthy and medically-sound situation that doesn't foster an environment of prejudice and discrimination.

The Left has largely accomplished its grand 50-year mission, destroying the nuclear family, organized religion, and masculine values such as self-reliance, leaving many dependent on government functionaries for sustenance and hope. We aren't supposed to be competitive anymore, and we aren't meant to feel even a twinge of shame about long-term dependency on welfare programs or about dropping by the local Medicaid clinic for more pain pills. We have been strictly instructed to place no particular value on traditional marriage — not for its role in healthy child-rearing, or for the vital and different benefits it brings to men and women.

Meanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz went even further, headlining its piece, The Question Isn't Whether NSO Hacked Jeff Bezos' Phone—but Whether It Was Even Hacked at All. The article quoted one expert as saying, There is zero information and 100 percent conjectures. We don't know if there was even an infection, we simply suspect it.

Democrats have completely failed black people, and that is by design. Democrats know that once people become middle class, they are much more likely to vote Republican. So the goal is to keep people poor, keep 'em scared, keep their schools crappy (no school choice, no charter schools), tell them there's no hope because America is evil and racist — in other words, keep 'em voting for Democrats.
One of her proudest accomplishments at the Foundation was establishing the annual Young Leaders Conference Program, in which upcoming political and cultural leaders from the U.S. spend an intensive week in Switzerland discussing ideas and issues with their Swiss counterparts.

However, the eight-member GOP vote for the transgender claims counts as a partial success for a series of conservative organizations amid passivity from GOP leaders and GOP donors, and amid hostility from progressives, gay advocacy groups, the established media, and the well-funded transgender advocacy groups. Without the conservative groups, many additional GOP legislators would have gone along with the establishment pressure.

The other major case the justices rejected this week is Abbott v. Veasey, a challenge to Texas' voter-ID law, SB14. A federal district court declared the law unconstitutional. Then, the full U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed, with five judges dissenting in multiple opinions totaling 100 pages, comparing the majority's position to Area 51 conspiracy theories.
The gay lobby wants Graham's money but they do not want the Christian worldview that inspires people to give money to his organization or to volunteer their time to serve others.

The media made much of the 8-0 ruling, but the same media masked reports of the Court's divisions. Justice Thomas agreed with the result only because he thought states had leeway to apportion state legislative seats as under our constitutional system.

It is unclear how prevalent FGM is in the United States, but Comey's FBI believes Nagarwala and Attar's FGM operation has been operating for over a decade and has mutilated girls from across the American Midwest. Both the doctors and their named victims are part of the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim sect, named only as a particular religious and cultural community in the complaints. Dawoodi Bohra is based in India and boasts over a million members across the world, with increasing numbers in the United States. The sect's leadership has made clear time and again that FGM is absolutely necessary as an act of religious purity and a religious obligation for all women and girls.

During his presidential campaign, now-President Donald Trump made clear that he supported the United Kingdom's Brexit vote to leave the European Union. The day after the June 23 Brexit vote, then-candidate Trump compared the vote to the upcoming presidential election in the U.S. and attributed the U.K. vote to leave the EU, and prospectively the U.S. presidential vote, in large part to people's desire to control borders and block illegal immigration.
Egyptian women were significantly more supportive of women's rights on most of these questions, although one point of agreement concerned women at work.

The League is for the freedom of education, for the right to life, for the defense of the natural family, the 45-year-old leader of the League said.

The 2011 incident occurred at the remote outpost where Martland was stationed. The boy and his mother showed up at camp, and the boy showed the Green Berets where his hands had been tied. A medic took him to a back room for an examination with an interpreter, who told them the boy had been raped by a man identified as Afghani Police commander Abdul Rahman. Rahman allegedly beat the boy's mother for reporting the crime after learning that they went to the Army outpost. This led Martland and team leader Daniel Quinn to confront Rahman.

The fact is, being a Royal is a pretty globetrotting job and folk accept that — the British monarchy is also the monarchy for 15 other Commonwealth Realms worldwide including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.

We're still living through very hard times but justice, equality and real freedom are not always a tide rushing in. They are more often a slow march, inch by inch, day after long day. I believe President Obama feels these days in his bones and has the strength to live them with us and to lead us to a country '…where no one crowds you and no one goes it alone,' Springsteen said at the time.

You know, I have no idea how I'm going to exit this life. I might be found under a stripper covered in cocaine dust or buried under all the cans of food amassed in my doomsday prepping, but I sure as hell know how I'm not going out — and that's while obsessing to the point of fake heart attacks over politics, or who's president, or glued to the criminal stupidity of cable news.

The other thing that I think is going to come out of this is I think that all these young people in America who have a cavalier attitude toward marriage … may realize that being alone with my CEO status or my Yale PhD isn't quite as good as being with somebody that I might love and who loves me, Prager determined.

They are widely-held views likely related to underlying personality differences and political predispositions … I agree that they are related to the preference for social stability, which can be quite rational.
In other words, as an overtly Christian association, Samaritan's Purse requires that volunteers share the same values and ideals that inspire the group. Groups like PETA and Greenpeace do the same thing, looking only for volunteers who share their commitment to animal rights and the protection of the environment. Apparently, this commonsense principle does not apply to Christians.

In addition to support for abortion on demand, Ocasio-Cortez is also demanding that American taxpayers, regardless of whether they morally oppose the procedure, pay for the abortions of others through a repeal of the longstanding Hyde Amendment.
A growing population is necessary for a healthy economy, given that older citizens retire or otherwise exit the workforce, leaving vacancies that need to be filled. Experts expect that the 2020 birth rate will be significantly lower than 2019's given the extreme coronavirus lockdowns that China implemented nationwide and the crisis status of many of its hospitals, in which overcrowding could result in an increase in infant or maternal mortality.
In fact, revulsion at the haughty way a growing number of well-to-do people regard those at the bottom of the ladder was one of a thousand little nudges that pushed the United Kingdom to vote for Brexit in 2016 — have no doubt. The idea that the Queen would be rude to a member of the public just rings hollow.

There is no bitterness, only great respect and affection between Sinatra and his first wife, Gay Talese wrote in 1966, and he has long been welcome in her home and has even been known to wander in at odd hours, stoke the fire, lie on the sofa, and fall asleep.
In any other case in which you see people feeling uncomfortable or horrified or unfamiliar in their own body, it's a form of dysphoria. Children should be able to see a therapist to help them ease this dysphoria. Laws against conversion therapy are setting up children to be miserable and to never get them the help they need because mainstream media is telling them they're trans.
Yes I know I was nice about him immediately after his resignation speech. But that was three days ago when I was still in shock over the Brexit result. Now I've had time for a bit more reflection, I can see his disgraceful, petulant, arrogant behaviour for what it is.
8:21 PM: Sanders says this is not the time to be punishing people when asked about China's role in the coronavirus crisis. He says we have to work with China, Italy, WHO, etc. Biden says he has insisted that we should have our experts in China and make it clear to China there would be consequences if we were denied access. Sanders says we must tell the big companies that this is not a time for profiteering.

For Lucas, there are two seminal moments in the rise of Trumpism. First, the publication of Michael Anton's The Flight 93 Election — in which Anton, under an alias, lays out the perfect case for why a Trump-like figure can only arise as a Phoenix from the ashes of a corrupt, California-like Republic — and the tragic murder of Kate Steinle, the beautiful 32 year-old woman cut down in the prime of her life by an illegal alien set loose on the streets of San Francisco by liberals' sanctuary policy.
The scene above is from early in the third season, and my guess is that it was at this point Chase decided he needed to lay down the law, to come straight out and tell the audience what the series is about — shopping malls and ethnic pride parades — and that nothing these characters do is in any way okay.

The lawsuit filed against three Texas officials is Mark Christopher Sevier's third attempt to question the U.S. Supreme Court case legalizing same-sex marriage.
Fact: The Equality Act goes far beyond the Supreme Court's 2020 Bostock ruling. While Bostock invented a misguided theory of sex discrimination in employment law, it did not redefine sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity … Because Bostock was limited to employment, it said nothing about schools, sports, or medicine. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity to all of them.

We argued then that Texas is devaluing the votes of certain citizens by improperly including noncitizen nonvoters when determining the equal population of legislative districts. Under federal law and the laws of all 50 states, only citizens may vote in federal elections. Texas' scheme to give weight to non-voting non-citizens along with lawful voters is contrary to the principles embodied in citizen voting laws. As a result, the votes of some Texas' citizens have, by some measures, almost twice the electoral power of the votes of other Texas citizens.

The line was eventually removed with one editor objecting on the article's discussion page by claiming Stalin was a Christian and therefore it would be like including his acts under the article on Christianity adding, Communism didn't kill these people; Stalin did.
Beijing has repeatedly attempted to smear survivors of its elaborate concentration camp system in far-west Xinjiang province as actors who have made a living somehow out of accusing China of human rights atrocities, providing no evidence for those claims.

What prompts this firing is Mefli's own therapist, Dr. Kupferberg (Peter Bogdanovich) who, in his own underhanded and cowardly way, forces Melfi to confront a study that says sociopaths cannot be treated in therapy. In fact, treating a sociopath only makes them a better criminal.
Yet Virgil is sure we'll be hearing a lot more about this case; one way or another, Team Bezos will make sure of that.

Both organizations claim to advocate for women's rights, but actually now focus primarily on abortion rights and appear to place gender identity above biological sex.
Considerably more resistance emerged at the Polish-language Wikipedia where a thread about the public consultation prompted users to vote on rejecting the code of conduct only to become frustrated when informed its implementation was already decided by the Foundation. Editor Zezen was particularly vocal citing the 2019 editor revolt, English Wikipedia banning profile pages supporting traditional marriage last year in a move criticized by family and Christian organizations, and English Wikipedia users advocating a No Nazis standard while allowing Stalinists and other left-wing extremists. Zezen argued similar political bias could be imposed on all Foundation sites, including to persecute critics of political correctness. One user called the code of conduct's approval the beginning of the end.

In the wake of the storming of the Capitol, many are blaming President Trump for the violence. Of course, he never instructed anyone to engage in violence. Nevertheless, his critics argue that he stoked people's passions, which he did, and can therefore be held accountable. If this is the standard—inflammatory rhetoric—then Trump's critics are at best ethically compromised.

Now, as you said, I've known Joe Biden for a long time. My grandchildren love Joe Biden. He's an affectionate person to children to senior citizens, to everyone. That's just the way he is. But, that's just not the way. Join the straight-arm club with me if you will. And also, for example my grandchildren, when they were little, like five and six — Now they're ten, eleven — they would say, plays games, and then they'd say Open Sesame except we don't saw Open Sesame, we say Open Biden. That's the magic word. Because he was just so lovely to them and paid attention to them.
Wenzel chatted about pick-up lines, paying compliments and original ideas for first dates. Impress and entertain the girls, Wenzel advised. Invite them to the theater, rock climbing, a concert, or take them on a trip to London or Amsterdam. That last piece of advice would probably work better for Wenzel's regular clientele of rich Germans; asylum seekers aren't allowed to leave the city they're registered in, and don't have the money to travel in any case.
Helping control the level of discourse in Ireland during elections is the European Network Against Racism (ENAR), an organisation funded by Hungarian-American financier and convicted insider trader George Soros, as well as EU taxpayers, which drew up an anti-racism protocol which has been signed by a total of 12 Irish political parties including the ruling Fine Gael and all other major parties.

Deng's rumored connection to Putin seems a bit tenuous, as Us admits she has yet to be spotted looking romantic with the Russian leader, although they have some very wealthy mutual friends.

The decree to stop recognising all child marriages was not accepted by all parties within the parliament as the ruling Social Democrats requested exemptions for special cases.

The company did not say which posts it found objectionable. Ensing appears to have started talking about politics only after the 2020 election.

Relying on this diversity push, editors last year sparked outcry from family and Christian organizations by banning profile pages from expressing support for traditional marriage. The site's owners also endorsed Black Lives Matter, declaring no neutral stance on racial justice issues. At the same time, they pushed a left-wing code of conduct requiring, among other things, using preferred pronouns on Wikipedia and affiliated sites. The code was approved earlier this month. However, corporate media ignore this increasing left-wing bias and instead rely on Wikipedia as a source of information, even encouraging widespread utilization by Big Tech.

In addressing the relationship between the pope and then-cardinal McCarrick, Martel seems to confirm an August 25, 2018 report from the former papal nuncio to the United States, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, who said he had informed Pope Francis of McCarrick's crimes in 2013, shortly after the pope's election. The pope proceeded to lift sanctions that had been imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict XVI, Viganò stated, and reinstated him in a position of influence in the Vatican.
The regretful decision Ballestero was referring to was the circumstances that led to Bryant's arrest in 2003 for allegedly raping a woman in a hotel room in Colorado. The case was eventually dismissed after the accuser declined to testify. Bryant would later settle a civil lawsuit with the woman and issue a public apology to her acknowledging that she did not consider the encounter to be consensual.
Sexual orientation and gender identity issues reflect a rapidly increasing and incorrect societal attitude that individual behaviors in life should pursue immediate and personal choices rather than eternal truth, Broglio stated.

When asked who were some of the names who sparked what Lucas later in the interview calls an important intellectual moment, more than 80% of the names are likely familiar to Breitbart's audience:
Again, such broad behavioral trends demand a cultural explanation. Why are so many people in certain demographic groups behaving in ways that reduce their lifespans, at a time when medical science is pushing average lifespan ever higher? University of Pennsylvania sociologist Irma Elo suggested rising mortality could be related to the economic circumstances that many Americans have experienced in the last eight years, or so, since the recession.
Myth 7: The Equality Act Treats All Students Fairly, Promotes Inclusion, and Cannot Affect School Curricula.
In 2011, Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry wanted to pass a law that set a minimum age to marry, since family members force many young girls to marry much older men.

Hawazin Mirza, a lecturer at King 'Abd Al-'Aziz University in Jeddah, took to national television earlier this year to promote the establishment of a polygamy academy. Mirza's institution promises that within a single month, any man requesting its services would be provided with three wives – a single woman, a divorcee, and a widow. If such a marriage would prove itself a decade later, the husband would be provided with a fourth wife – free of charge. In return, the man would be expected to attend a six-month marriage prep course.
Twitchy posted the exchange and promoted it this way: It's On! Jonah Goldberg, David Horowitz Duke It Out Over Trump's Character. The donnybrook led to 500,000 impressions off my Twitter feed, including legions of anti-Trump zealots eager to demonstrate how creative they could be in devising insults to throw at me for defending Trump: beyond dumb, in need of psychiatric help, and probably receiving payments through offshore bank accounts.

I don't believe that that God will protect me from COVID-19 more than a secular guy, Prager stated. I do not believe that, so I just want to make that clear, however, that doesn't mean you don't call on God. 'God is my shepherd. I shall not want.' It doesn't mean God is going to save me and not my secular neighbor. I don't believe that.
The president's likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired.

Wikipedia's page on communism incredibly even mentions the Moscow Trials in a section on the Soviet Union yet does not mention they were widely seen as show trials and leaves unmentioned how they served as the starting point for Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, which led to the deaths of as many as a million people targeted by Soviet secret police. As Fox notes, the famines that occurred under Mao and Stalin's respective reigns in China and the Soviet Union are not mentioned and the word famine is not even present in the article on communism.
Levin tweeted that he wants to hear about all experiences, including positive stories/impact about your time in school, implying that likely most responses to the hashtag would be negative:

The full credits of the film, for some reason, seem to also have been scrubbed from the internet. We obtained a copy by using the Wayback machine and made a startling discovery: the movie's chief investors included none other than the social deputy of the State Welfare Organization (SWO) of Iran (SWO-معاونت اجتماعی سازمان بهزیستی کشور) as well as the Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran. (سازمان فرهنگی و هنری شهرداری تهران) These two investors in the film might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations—but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran states: This organization was founded in 1996 and [does] its activities under the supervision of a board of trustees composed of various cultural institutions such as IRIB and Islamic propaganda organization.

When asked by Marlow if life is going to get better or worse for conservatives in California, Lucas had a warning.
Christianity teaches that God made man in his own image, in the image of God He created him; man and female he created them (Gen. 1:27). Men and women are complementary, a fact that extends beyond the spheres of marriage and procreation, the cardinal said, but pertains also to biopsychic differences in their relationship as spouses and with third parties and society as a whole.

The proposed Equality Act of 2021 (H.R. 5) would make mainstream beliefs about marriage, biological facts about sex differences, and many sincerely held beliefs punishable under the law. The Equality Act makes discrimination the law of the land by forcing Americans to conform to government-mandated beliefs under the threat of life-ruining financial and criminal penalties. Presented as a bill with commonsense and decent protections against discrimination, H.R. 5 is anything but. The Equality Act politicizes medicine and education and demolishes existing civil rights and constitutional freedoms.

The alliance of Democratic-appointed judges, progressives, and Islamic political groups are fiercely opposing any new tests, even though the existing immigration and citizenship process already includes questions and tests designed to exclude people who were terrorists or members of the Nazi or Soviet communist parties.

As we can immediately see, there's a big difference between the Guardian's story, which alleges that Saudi Arabia apparently hacked Bezos's cell phone, and the Journal story, which suggests that Bezos's girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, having received racy texts and photos from Bezos, in turn gave them to her brother, Michael Sanchez—and Michael then sold them to the National Enquirer for a reported $200,000.

We're tired of being taken for granted by politicians who don't reflect our values. The black church has long been the center of the black community. But Leftists are now actively trying to push Christians out of the public square. When they're not trying to silence us, they're mocking us or our values.
Then, in 1966, Mao launched his Cultural Revolution, an attempt to erase all remaining capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society. The Communist Red Guard enforced a purge of all dissidents. Mao issued his famous book of quotations, The Little Red Book, that became a central part of the curriculum of every school. Chinese citizens were expected to have a copy of Mao's writings with them at all times. Even so, Maoist socialism represented a disastrous alloy of deprivation, starvation and tyranny.

The outlet quoted Qin as stating that the United States considers freezing women's eggs a standard medical service and that China has much to gain from following that example. Among the hurdles the program would face is the fact that the Communist Party in Shanghai strictly regulates who has access to egg-freezing, limiting the list to couples with a history of infertility and cancer patients who expect to preserve their fertility before undergoing surgery or chemotherapy. Most preservation of eggs is not freezing in China, however, which means most expire after five years, the newspaper noted.

Socialism has proved to be a living hell pretty much everywhere it has been tried. It has been tried pretty much all over the world. Let's not forget that within about a century since Marx wrote, and less than half a century since the Bolshevik Revolution, some 60 percent of the world's people were living under governments that embraced some form of socialism. At once time, Josh Muravchik writes, it was the most popular political idea ever invented, arguably the most popular idea of any kind about how life should be lived or society organized.
Texas, as it allocates benefits to employees' spouses, may recognize the differences between same- and opposite-sex spouses. To withhold this decision from the people is to undermine precedent, democracy, and the limited role of courts in our nation. It bears repeating that the Supreme Court in Obergefell embraced 'democracy [as] the appropriate process for change, so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights.' I would take the Court at its word. Because the court of appeals did not, I respectfully dissent to the denial of the petition for review.

In a section of the paper under the heading, The Trouble with Heterosexuality, Brook argued that heterosexuality is often seen as a singular experience.

Queer identities are seen as provisional, fluid and contingent, but heterosexuality – or, at least, institutionally buttressed, mainstream heterosexuality – is more often perceived to be steadfastly monolithic, she wrote.
The measure is fair, popular, good for families and children, and long overdue. They have everything to gain.
Having a valid Social Security number is among the few requirements to receive the $1,200 relief outlined in the CARES Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed at the end of March. Those with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN), which includes foreign nationals and those residing in the country illegally, are not eligible for the cash relief. Married couples are also not eligible if one of the spouses does not have a Social Security number — a point that sparked the lawsuit.
The UN secretary-general included the Houthis, government forces, pro-government militias, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and, for the first time, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition on his annual 'list of shame' for grave violations against children during armed conflict. The coalition was responsible for 60 percent of the 785 children killed and 1,168 children wounded, and nearly half of the 101 attacks on schools and hospitals, according to the report. Houthi forces, government and pro-government forces, and other armed groups have used child soldiers, an estimated one-third of the fighters in Yemen. The UN found in 2015 that 72 percent of 762 verified cases of child recruitment were attributable to the Houthis, with an overall five-fold increase in recruitment of children and a shift towards forced or involuntary recruitment. Under Yemeni law, 18 is the minimum age for military service. In 2014, the government signed a UN action plan to end the use of child soldiers. Without an effective government in place, the action plan has not been implemented.
Egypt scored the lowest on the report's Gender Equitable Men scale and is the source of the most striking headlines. For example, CNS News reports that 70 percent of Egyptian men approve of female genital mutilation. For that matter, 56 percent of Egyptian women also voiced approval for the hideous procedure, which is illegal but not unheard-of, in much of the world.

Zezen had previously been banned from the English Wikipedia mostly for edits relating to LGBT issues that editors found offensive such as editing a caption about LGBT-free zones in Poland to reflect the actual wording of non-binding resolutions by local governments promoting what they called pro-family positions. Also cited was Zezen's criticism of the No Nazis essay on the site arguing Wikipedia should be open to people of all ideologies or beliefs so long as they follow site policies. Those calling for the ban and the administrator who imposed the ban in turn cited the No Nazis essay as justification for banning Zezen.

Fact: The Equality Act goes far beyond the Supreme Court's 2020 Bostock ruling. While Bostock invented a misguided theory of sex discrimination in employment law, it did not redefine sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity … Because Bostock was limited to employment, it said nothing about schools, sports, or medicine. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity to all of them.

Keep families together. The bill reforms the family-based immigration system by clearing backlogs, recapturing unused visas, eliminating lengthy wait times, and increasing per-country visa caps. It also eliminates the so-called 3 and 10-year bars, and other provisions that keep families apart. The bill further supports families by more explicitly including permanent partnerships and eliminating discrimination facing LGBTQ+ families. It also provides protections for orphans, widows, children, and Filipino veterans who fought alongside the United States in World War II. Lastly, the bill allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join family in the United States on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.
Comey recalls telling the president the FBI was investigating it as quickly as possible, and that he had told Congress that Trump was not personally under investigation, to which the president repeatedly told him, We need to get that fact out. Two weeks later, on April 11, Trump called Comey again to check on his request to get out that he is not under investigation, Comey writes. He seemed irritated with me, Comey recalls. I have been very loyal to you, very loyal. We had that thing, you know, Trump told him, according to the book, apparently referring to the loyalty dinner.

The famous British stiff upper lip has taken a mighty beating in the modern era — amid the army recruiting millennial snowflakes and young men being encouraged to talk about their feelings rather than learning to regulate them like sane, well-adjusted people.

Princeton economics professors Angus Deaton and Anne Case calculate that if the death rate among middle-aged whites had continued to decline at the rate it fell between 1979 and 1998, half a million deaths would have been avoided over the years from 1999 through 2013.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and has vowed to primary Democrats who are demographically and ideologically out of touch with their districts, tore into Biden just hours after he officially announced his presidential candidacy, signaling that Biden's road to the nomination will be far from being smooth. Ocasio-Cortez, the headliner for Justice Democrats, recently said that a Biden candidacy does not animate her in the least. The group highlighted Biden's past support for the Iraq War, the Crime Bill, and the Bankruptcy Reform Act while also pointing out his previous opposition to gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.

Throughout the April 19 Australian press conference, the journalists and politicians tacitly recognized the problems created by the immigration of Islamic adherents who bring their peculiar institutions and values which endorse domestic violence against women, child marriage, 'Female Genital Mutilation,' and reject the authority of what Australians describe as secular law. For example, one reporter cited several of Islam's peculiar practices before asking Prime Minister, I'm not clear why practices such as female genital mutilation, forcing children to marry and what have you, how they're being or could be included in values questions when they're already illegal under Australian law. What's the need for a values question when it's illegal under Australians law, Australian law? that these values [in the test] aren't really enforceable outside of the law. If someone passes a test and says, Tick, yes I don't beat my wife. Tick, I know who [cricket player]

By this time, Jeb(!) had already dropped out of his hapless low-energy bid for the 2016 Republican nomination, so why would a 90-year-old woman who had already been through four decades of the political wringer allow a presidential primary, allow a Donald Trump, allow anything other than a family crisis to discombobulate her to where she had a fake heart attack?
The couple began dating in 2012 and had their first child in 2013. West proposed later that year using the giant screen at the empty waterfront ballpark of the San Francisco Giants, and the two married May 24, 2014, in a ceremony at a Renaissance fortress in Florence, Italy.

Comey relates that Trump brought up the topic of the dossier: He may want me to investigate it to prove that it didn't happen. And then he says something that distracted me because he said, you know, 'If there's even a 1 percent chance my wife thinks that's true, that's terrible.'

The WSJ survey does not explore the political gap between the pro-immigration professional class and the GOP-aligned business class, which is quietly using free trade, globalization, and immigration to cut the salaries paid to the Democrats' pro-diversity college graduates.

Somewhat ironically, though, Biden has attempted to improve his standing in Iowa by playing to the state's long history of backing populist causes and candidates. As such, the former vice president has lambasted lesser-known rivals, like billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, for using their personal fortunes to boost their White House ambitions.

[In] 2000, Bernie was in Washington D.C, serving in Congress. Jane and her children a new LLC called Sanders and Driscoll. The new firm was a for-profit consulting company, and was run by Jane, daughter Carina, and son David. The family ran this new business out of the Sanders family home. Because of the way it was structured, it's impossible to know just how much money Bernie's wife and children made from his congressional campaign.

Jane would even set up a media buying company, meaning that she would get paid every time candidate Bernie Sanders bought television advertising for his Congressional campaigns. Then, during his 2016 presidential run, the Sanders campaign would funnel $82 million dollars through a mysterious media buying company run by Jane's former colleagues. That company, known as Olde Towne Media, was located in private home in a cul de sac in Virginia.

Mattresses akin to kerosene (Good Morning America)
For the first time on television we are rooting for the villain, and this makes us as complicit, and that complicity is thrilling … at least for a while. The Tony we first meet, the man struggling with depression, panic attacks, conscience, the man capable of empathy, will slowly devolve into a rank bastard. And like Melfi, we come to realize we have been conned by a sociopath. And yes, there is also something thrilling about that, about being so expertly hustled for so long by Chase and his team of genius writers.

Everyone's a bad Christian, except our Mean Little Mayor.

In effect, Biden was saying: I have never been a 'moderate,' and I am a 'progressive,' which used to be understood as 'liberal.' But today, the definition of 'progressive' has become 'socialist.'

Batchelder's latest act of service in her long career occurred when she sent her letter to President Trump informing him that she was ready to take senior status, which is a semi-retired status where judges still hear cases part-time but give up their seat to be filled by a new judge.

The president-elect argued that it could not be true because he had not stayed overnight in Moscow but had only used the hotel room to change his clothes. And after Trump explained that he would never allow people to urinate near him, Comey recalls laughing.
I said, 'Sir, that's up to you. But you'd want to be careful about that, because it might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally, and second, it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen,' Comey said.
Dear Twitter, You recently banned Focus on the Family's The Daily Citizen from your platform for stating a biological fact: A biological male is a male. I stand with Focus on the Family. So, if you are going to ban them, are you going to ban millions of others like me who believe that biology is reality—and that freedom of speech matters in America? If your censorship continues, Twitter will become a stagnant echo chamber. We, the undersigned, are both state and national organizations who represent millions of Americans who all hold to the truth that a person's biological sex cannot be changed. And we will continue to speak this truth freely. You recently locked out Focus on the Family's The Daily Citizen from their Twitter account for speaking this truth. We all stand beside Focus on the Family. So, if you ban them, are we next?
And so, Jeberoni, the Jebster, Jeb!, Yeb!, Mr. Sensitive Conscience, is not only a pathetic weakling and more confused in his thinking than any national political candidate in memory, he is not even talented in his passive-aggressive attacks on Trump, because he looks like a braying jackass.

BIDEN: No — REPORTER: Can you win in a primary? BIDEN: We'll find out if I can win in a primary. But let me say one last thing. Here's the deal. I think you guys, if you look at all the polling data and look at the actual results, the party has not moved to the way — however you — I don't want to characterize it, whatever characterization you just made. The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense. … So the idea the Democratic Party has sort of stood on its head, I don't get it. And by the way, we should welcome, the party should welcome this — I don't know how you want to characterize it, the progressive left. It should be welcome. We should have a debate about these things. That's not a bad thing. But the idea, all of a sudden, the Democratic Party woke up, you know, everybody asked me now, what kind of Democrat — I'm an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. And I'm proud of it. Thank you.

Maybe NBC News is finally going to use its power for a moral good — to put an end to this disgraceful era of public shaming. From where I sit, this would be a healthy turnabout from a craven media that have spent years championing and emboldening the Woke Fascists who shame, boycott, de-platform, and personally destroy people over jokes, decades-old tweets, offbeat opinions, honest mistakes, and slips of the tongue.

Yet soon, new elements entered into the picture. In February 2019, the month after the Enquirer stories ran, Bezos escalated the story by telling his version of it; he posted an article under his own name, declaring that the Enquirer had tried to use extortion and blackmail on him. That allegation was hot enough right there, but then Bezos got even hotter. Citing the work of his hired security expert, Gavin de Becker, he intimated that perhaps Trump and the government of Saudi Arabia were in cahoots with the Enquirer, as part of some larger nefarious plot against the Seattle mogul.

Justice Democrats, the group that was founded after the 2016 elections by former supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and has vowed to primary Democrats who are demographically and ideologically out of touch with their districts, tore into Biden just hours after he officially announced his presidential candidacy, signaling that Biden's road to the nomination will be far from being smooth. Ocasio-Cortez, the headliner for Justice Democrats, recently said that a Biden candidacy does not animate her in the least. The group highlighted Biden's past support for the Iraq War, the Crime Bill, and the Bankruptcy Reform Act while also pointing out his previous opposition to gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.

Dragged is not, as its reactionary critics suggest, about white men who fear losing their place in a changing world.

Many cases involve girls from South Asian backgrounds, but Britain's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) said it has handled cases involving more than 90 countries since 2005.
The article outlined nine ways in which Jihad can be countered both online and in person. Glazov's tips include: 1. Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment. 2. Scrap Countering Violent Extremism. 3. Stop Partnering With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups. 4. Implement a Concrete Countering-Jihad Strategy. 5. Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.
Stone said, [FBI agents] walked me out in the middle of the street to make sure the CNN camera could get great footage of the whole thing. The street was sealed off, so how CNN had a camera right outside the door; that's very hard to understand, because nobody else was allowed on the street.
I had no idea, Biden said of the award, insisting he didn't deserve it.

The anonymous email, signed, A concerned Green Beret, accused the leaders of the school of moral cowardice for lowering the standards, and weakening instructors' ability to discipline students as they look to get further through the pipeline.
Last month, Donald Trump instituted his zero tolerance policy on people crossing the border, and the consequences have been severe. Children have been ripped away from their parents, placed into mass detention, deprived of adequate legal counsel, and isolated from everyone they've ever known.
Last week, Harris County authorities charged a now former Katy High School art teacher with having an improper relationship with a student in 2015. Katy school district police arrested Robert Evan Milton, 42, for the alleged sexual misconduct an 18-year-old female student in her senior year. He bonded out of jail on $30,000.
In one headline, the Daily News proclaimed that the manifesto is straight out of the 1980s, suggesting that sexual norms have moved beyond traditional biblical morality.

Bernie Sanders and others who have endorsed the idea of relieving students of the burden of paying for college address the debt side of the problem only. And it's not clear that this is really much progress at all since professors will still have to be paid, buildings maintained, textbooks purchased. So while a student might not have to foot the bill, that debt will need to be borne by workers—which is really just a transformation of individual debt into higher taxes. And if history is any experience, the government will not effectively be able to contain the burgeoning costs. If anything, quite the opposite: cost increases will accelerate once individuals no longer see the bills.

Aggressive gay advocacy groups are using their court-backed transformation of marriage law as a legal hammer to impose an unprecedented genderless society on Americans, says the president of the National Organization for Marriage.
McGuire said all society talks about is toxic masculinity, while forgoing the critical role that men play as husbands and fathers. Or society says that women who decide they want to put their careers on the back burner to focus on child-rearing have wasted their education. I think we need to reclaim, as positive goods, the differences between men and women and the essential roles of mothers and fathers.
The media are not at all interested in the fact Reade has seven — seven! — pieces of corroborating evidence to back up her allegation Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 — which is seven more than Christine Blasey Serial Liar had.
He said the resulting deep divisions not only paralyze Americans from taking action but are used against America by international adversaries.
The suspension is what drives everything.
An analysis in the Critic last year examined the question of administrative bias and found Wikipedia editors favoring right-wing views were six times more likely to be sanctioned by administrators than left-leaning editors. That analysis cited administrator Guy Chapman as another example of left-wing bias, including him joining a Black Lives Matter group on Wikipedia by stating: You can be one of three things: ally, enemy, or collaborator. Chapman is among many editors who supported Black Lives Matter and the far-left Antifa group on Wikipedia articles. Late last year he resigned as an administrator after banning an Antifa opponent from the group's page, though he denied his resignation was related.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell him that the Steele Dossier had been financed by his political opponents? JAMES COMEY: No. I didn't– I didn't think I used the term Steele Dossier, I just talked about additional material. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Did he– but did he have a right to know that? JAMES COMEY: That it'd been financed by his political opponents? I don't know the answer to that. I– it wasn't necessary for my goal, which was to alert him that we had this information. Again, I was clear on whether it's true or not, it's important that you know, both because of the counterintelligence reason and so you know that this maybe going to hit the media.
Some provincial-level Chinese population planning rules continue to explicitly instruct officials to carry out abortions, often referred to as 'remedial measures' for 'out-of-plan' [illegal] pregnancies, with some provinces urging functionaries to use all means necessary in enforcing the regulations.
Yes, she has ethics and found her Italian ex-husband's obsession with identity politics absurd, but she is also attracted to Tony. She enjoys being a tourist in his world.

The full scale of the abuse may be unknown, however, as some girls do not speak out because they are worried about family honour and being isolated by their communities and fear their relatives would be punished if they sought help.
One of the things that infuriates me is this idea that we shouldn't want to eat food that has ingredients we can't pronounce or spell. Have you seen that old Breyers commercial, with the little kids trying to read what's in their ice cream? And the idea is Breyers is better because of how simple the words are. Like the only thing you should ever consume is a thing a child can read. It goes to the chemical fallacy that we shouldn't eat any chemicals at all. Little do they know that they live in a universe made up of chemicals. That is one of those ploys that plays to our intuition. If you look up the chemicals that make up an apple, it can sound pretty scary. There's so many myths that people can leverage. They'll find a substance that is cancer-causing in huge doses and then say you shouldn't be consuming any of it, ever. I find the Honest Jessica Alba thing very frustrating: It's built of guilt, fear, and pseudoscience. I've seen quotes associated with her in which she claims autism and ADHD and childhood cancers are caused by all toxins that exist in this world, toxins that her products don't have. But now she's being sued, so.

The PAC made its first large scale expenditure on December 6 when it paid Old Town Media LLC, a Virginia-based public relations firm, $623,922 for media placements. The payment was earmarked specifically for Iowa's media markets. On the same day that buy was made, the PAC also paid more than $31,000 to Putnam Partners, LLC., a Washington, D.C.-based political messaging company, for ad production. In total, the PAC spent more than $655,000 in one day, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).
Mann contrasts the coverage of Diana's death and funeral with that of Mother Teresa:
In surveys, young adults commonly report that their student loan debts are preventing them from buying a home, Fed researchers Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, and Kamila Sommer found. Our estimates suggest that increases in student loan debt are an important factor in explaining their lowered homeownership rates, but not the central cause of the decline.
In a series of segments on Bubba the Love Sponge Show between 2006 and 2011, Carlson discussed issues such as underage women, statutory rape, and polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, who was sentenced in 2011 to life in prison for raping a 12-year-old girl. He made the remarks during his tenure at MSNBC (2005-2008) and his tenure at Fox (2009-present).

Pope Francis has done more to divide Catholics than any pope in 150 years. He has clouded the Church's teaching on marriage and sexuality. Francis has thrown out the clear, recent teaching of two of his immediate predecessors — which echoed Church practice and preaching for 2000 years. He has politicized the papacy, using its bully pulpit to further crudely crafted left-wing talking points on everything from the economy to immigration to climate science. He has marginalized and punished his critics, to the point that a new book calls him the Dictator Pope. Now he's defending his handpicked lieutenant, Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga. That Honduran leftist (and anti-Semite) is accused of massive corruption that benefited him personally, to the tune of $40,000 per month. Other favorites of Pope Francis include the disgraced Belgian Cardinal Wilfrid Daneels — who was caught on tape trying to silence a sex abuse victim — and LGBT advocate Fr. James Martin, SJ.
A lower California state court upheld their action, and we've now completed the briefing for the appeal of the lower court ruling with the filing of a reply brief last week. We brought this litigation on behalf of Earl De Vries, a legal resident and taxpayer of California (Earl De Vries v Regents of the University of California (BC555614)). Under California law, taxpayers have the right to sue government officials to prevent unlawful expenditures of taxpayer funds and taxpayer-financed resources.
The biggest socialist experiment was the Soviet bloc, an orbit of countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and East Germany. Prior to the Soviet occupation of its eastern region, Germany tried its own distinct version of socialism, National Socialism or Nazism for short, for 12 years, from 1933 to 1945. In Asia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and China experimented with socialism. In South America, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Venezuela tried it. Most of Africa went socialist in the aftermath of colonialism: Angola, Ghana, Tanzania, Benin, Mali, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. I count here 25 experiments in socialism, all ending in unmitigated disaster.
We need to begin to say to those who support Israel to brutalize Palestinians that the blood of the people of Palestine will be sought from them because they collaborate by allowing this system to continue, said Chikane, a South African Pentecostal pastor.
And so, according to both the Times and McGowan, all the way back in 1997, Messick was on her side, her champion, did all she could, and although the matter was out of her hands after she reported the alleged assault to her superiors, McGowan ended up with a six-figure settlement from Weinstein.

Moore recalled his departure from Greenpeace following the organization's adoption of anti-human ideology:

This is the third time a Facebook property has tried to silence me without any justification, declared Ford to PJ Media. The first was for a comic defending traditional marriage, and the second was when I was running The Babylon Bee and they tried to label it as 'fake news.' It just keeps happening. And it only seems to happen to conservatives.
This is why conservative and libertarian critiques of socialism have gotten nowhere. The conservatives and libertarians keep chanting, Socialism doesn't work, and they produce charts and tables to prove it. The socialists glance over the charts and tables and then they clamor for more socialism. They don't care about data because no amount of data can refute a dream. The socialist mantra is, We don't care if it hasn't worked. We will figure out a way to make it work. The critics are focused on yesterday, while the socialists are all about tomorrow. Owen Jones expresses this futuristic hope, A socialist society…doesn't exist yet, but one day it must.
VF wishes Deng well, noting that everyone deserves love… even if it means settling for a former KGB spy accused of heinous crimes, who coincidentally might be the richest man in the world, with a net worth of over $200 billion.
Proposition 187 of 1994, which sought to deny non-emergency social services to illegal aliens in California, was the first of several important referendums to be passed by voters but reversed by the judiciary, with help from Democrat-run state governments that refused to defend them in court. (Another was Proposition 8 of 2008, which established traditional marriage in the state and was overturned in the courts.)

Once again, the expenditures coincided with the release of new ad by Unite the Country. This one, titled Refuse to Give Up, intermixes Biden's position on gun control with portions of a speech the former vice president delivered on the topic.
Since January 7th, I've been accused by 'anonymous' sources and leaky 'Amazon investigators' of just about everything, including involvement in an international conspiracy theory involving President Trump, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and conservative operatives trying to 'take down' Jeff Bezos.
Pro-transgender activists oppose laws and civic culture that promote the existence of the two distinct sexes, which they criticize as the gender binary.
Then as we have seen, this January 21 came a new eruption—that Guardian story, citing a technical report, damning the Saudis, from a firm called FTI Consulting, which had been retained by Bezos. That Guardian piece was followed by a flood of other stories in the Main Stream Media, all of which echoed, at least at first, the basic Bezos/de Becker storyline, namely that Michael Sanchez notwithstanding, the Saudis are the real nogoodniks.
Allowing men to compete against women in sports. … is demoralizing because it makes [women's] talent irrelevant. … Never before in American history has a political party tried so dramatically to rewrite the federal civil rights laws to include an undefined, self-referential ideological term called gender identity in the U.S. code, applicable to literally any entity that receives federal assistance, including elementary schools, colleges, and healthcare centers.
The Australian Christian Lobby describes itself as seeking a compassionate, just and moral society through having the public contributions of the Christian faith reflected in the political life of the nation. They were among the groups that planned to meet at the Mercure Sydney Airport Hotel in September for a conference on same-sex marriage, but the hotel canceled the event, and even shut down its own Facebook page, due to threats of physical violence.
With movies trending for more explicit sex, she turned to television to recoup her finances. The Doris Day Show was a moderate success in its 1966-1973 run on CBS.
However, his claim that politicians who address the subject present some sort of peril to the country is a view shared almost unanimously by the media and political establishment in Ireland, who reacted with anger last month at former Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín commenting that there needs to be sustainable levels of immigration in this country, it needs to be managed.

It's not an accident that Martin Luther King was a Christian Minister and that Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong were not. Secular leaders are the ones most likely to count their populations by race, and then to embrace collective punishment. Through history, they often have. We've said all of that before in the show many times.
It is liberals such as Buttigieg who treat the public expression of religion as if it were some sort of communicable disease, Donohue adds, whereas conservatives want a robust public expression of religion.
The threats are considered credible by Mexican law enforcement agencies now operating in a heightened state of alert. They are checking for suspicious vehicles throughout the region. El Marro and his criminal organization are linked to the use of explosive devices–including some placed outside an oil refinery with threats toward Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
The lesson from Europe in 2015 is that a migrant surge fuels itself, as word gets back home. And then white nationalism takes off. We could, in other words, be in the mother of all immigration scares as the first primaries take place. We could have a million more migrants to grapple with. Currently, no Democrat has any response to this. The only candidate with an actual immigration policy, Julián Castro, favors a much more lenient system and an end to criminalizing illegal border crossing. He wants the immigration surge to become a flood, all but guaranteeing Trump's reelection.
The lobbyist said earlier in the evening Hefner had bragged to him about his clout in state politics and about his influence with Rosenberg.

It's desperately important that those are frightened or feel that they have no one to turn to get in touch with Childline.
When I last wrote about the increased mortality rates among lower- and middle-class whites, I suggested the welfare state played a significant role in creating the death wave. Now, in a massive and extensively researched article for Commentary, Nicholas Eberstadt shows how Medicaid is funding the gateway drugs — opioid prescription painkillers — which lead people towards deadly heroin and early death.
The Supreme Court's recent decision on whether a Christian baker can be forced to make a wedding cake for a gay marriage (no) arriving on the same day that Bill Clinton reared his syphilitic head on NBC's Today reminded me how liberals always use black people as props.

Harry, Farage suggested, was at risk of becoming a modern-day Edward VIII, who abandoned his post to pursue a marriage with his American mistress Wallis Simpson, who reportedly boasted Soon I shall be Queen of England when George V — the Queen's grandfather — passed away in 1936.
The Global Times noted on Thursday that China already last laws in place mandating sex education in schools, but the sex education curriculum in China's compulsory education is still almost absent.
Stone added, Reading the indictment, there are several people who are preparing to lie on behalf of the Mueller investigation and bear false witness against me. So they want to let them know that this will happen to them unless they say what they're told to say.
As children of God, we are all equal with our dignity as persons, Francis said. But each one should have the freedom to express his faith. If a Muslim woman wants to wear a veil, she should be able to. In the same way, if a Catholic wants to wear a cross. Everyone should be able to profess his faith–not outside the culture, but at the very heart of the culture.
White Death is the shorthand way of describing the frightening rise in mortality rates for middle-aged, middle- and low-income white Americans. Since the trend was first propelled into the headlines in the fall of 2015, we've gradually recognized it as a symptom of generational despair, with drug abuse and death serving as the exit from lives without hope.
Baltz, himself a political scientist, stated Wikipedia is widely praised for its success in spreading reliable information about political events. He further claimed misinformation is largely suppressed on breaking news events. While praising the site's impressive record of political and ideological neutrality in his piece, Baltz also claimed, it has serious biases in its coverage of political topics. Those biases, Baltz claimed, include focusing too much on wealthy countries and too little on women. Such a narrative is consistent with other corporate media, who praise Wikipedia as a tool against fake news yet routinely criticize its diversity issues.
We can also add that on January 28, Bezos's newspaper, the Washington Post, dipped a careful toe into this murky pool; its reporter, perhaps mindful of her career, was careful to print both sides of the story: Three people close to AMI [owner of the Enquirer], she wrote, say that Lauren Sanchez's brother Michael Sanchez—a talent manager in Hollywood who had previously placed stories in AMI publications—is the only source for their report on the Bezos affair.

Blue-Collar Democrats, who lack bachelor's degrees, feel the most economically vulnerable. The Professional Class, which has college degrees, feels the most secure. As the aging Old Guard fades, the Blue-Collar Democrats' skepticism of trade, U.S. leadership abroad and other matters may clash with the Professional Class's support of engagement with the world. … Blue-Collar Democrats as a group have often been least likely to see globalization as a benefit to the U.S. economy. This helps explain why some Democratic lawmakers agree with President Trump that trade deals have hurt workers.
Public school groups have not been shy about sounding the alarm on this case, HuffPo states, predicting that it could have a devastating effect on education and play a major role in disintegrating the U.S. doctrine of the separation of church and state.
DURBIN: Does that refer to sexual orientation as well?

Curiously, despite Mr. Salvini's complete alignment with the Catholic Church on key moral issues such as the right to life, traditional marriage, gender theory, and freedom of education, the Italian Church establishment has been waging an open war on the interior minister, comparing him to Satan and the antichrist, because of his commitment to reining in illegal immigration.
Soon some critics were hailing him as the next Laurence Olivier — a commanding presence who would light up the British stage. Britain's pre-eminent theater critic, Kenneth Tynan, called the young Finney a smoldering young Spencer Tracy and warned established star Richard Burton about his prowess. In London, Finney excelled both in Shakespeare's plays and in more contemporary offerings.

It's true. Lots of what happens in UKIP could not have occurred without many of the behind the scenes forces, the local councillors, the activists, and back office staff. But lets also face facts: a figurehead like Farage was the driving force behind the party, and the sole, anthropomorphic inspiration for those who pounded the pavements and helped (and are still helping) lead Britain out of the European Union.
The report added that a separate exchange captured and posted by the person who first spread the alleged DMs appears to show that she made everything up, but it's unclear if the woman is referring to the alleged Hammer posts or something else that is unrelated to the matter.
They were married Islamically and legally, a spokesperson for the congresswoman told People.
The reality of Iran's regime is that it brutally subjugates the will of its women, liberally imposing the death penalty on those who defy strict Islamic laws that have little cultural basis in pre-revolutionary Iran. When free-thinking Iranians take to the streets in protest, women are often the first to receive beatings or bullets, bleeding out in their native streets. Watching live sports is haram, a sin, for women unless Iran desperately needs good publicity on any given week.

The UN secretary-general included the Houthis, government forces, pro-government militias, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and, for the first time, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition on his annual 'list of shame' for grave violations against children during armed conflict. The coalition was responsible for 60 percent of the 785 children killed and 1,168 children wounded, and nearly half of the 101 attacks on schools and hospitals, according to the report. Houthi forces, government and pro-government forces, and other armed groups have used child soldiers, an estimated one-third of the fighters in Yemen. The UN found in 2015 that 72 percent of 762 verified cases of child recruitment were attributable to the Houthis, with an overall five-fold increase in recruitment of children and a shift towards forced or involuntary recruitment. Under Yemeni law, 18 is the minimum age for military service. In 2014, the government signed a UN action plan to end the use of child soldiers. Without an effective government in place, the action plan has not been implemented.

A.J. Soprano (Robert Iler) will never follow in his father's footsteps as a gangster. That would require two things he does not possess: physical courage and a work ethic. Instead, A.J. is the archetype of the utterly useless millennial, the glassy-eyed sloth whose sense of empathy has been washed away by material excess, by never facing the consequences of his actions, by never being allowed to fail or face adversity.
In recent years, Christians in Pakistan have become a heavily persecuted minority, and have fallen victim to multiple Islamist attacks designed to intimidate them and force them out the country, which remains overwhelmingly Muslim.
The approvals are legal: The Immigration and Nationality Act does not set minimum age requirements. And in weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives.
There was this wave of people who were upset that I was possibly married to a white man, she said of those who gossiped about her relationship. In America, interracial dating or marriage is not something that is as accepted. Acceptance of interracial marriage is dubious but the sheer number of them has skyrocketed just two generations after the end of the Civil Rights Movement.
This is a love match, like the Obamas were, so I think that'll be healing for the country, too.
The reaction of the Catholic Church to the coronavirus outbreak has left some observers perplexed, as they draw comparisons to the way the Church handled the far more serious pestilences in ages past.
You've heard of Jim Crow and Southern Segregation…? That was ALL Democrats. George Wallace and Bull Connor were Democrats. The whole system was created and enforced by Democrats. Black lives were destroyed in the South to keep Democrats in power then; black lives in urban areas are destroyed to keep Democrats in power now.
Socrates said the first virtue of a good judge is to listen courteously and decide impartially.
The Obama-appointed ambassador to Romania, Hans Klemm, has stoked a national debate on the role of U.S. diplomacy abroad by openly advocating same-sex marriage as the country deliberates over a proposed constitutional amendment affirming traditional marriage.
Only about 1,000 kids play baseball in Israel and there is just one regulation baseball field in the country. In 2007, a group of American supporters launched the Israel Baseball League, a semi-professional league comprised almost entirely of foreign players that generated little interest and folded after just one season.

Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan was sworn in on Saturday. He did not make the best impression on local media, which pronounced him poorly tailored and chuckled at his inability to follow protocol or pronounce some of the Urdu words in his oath of office. His wife Bushra Bibi, on the other hand, made a major fashion statement by wearing a white niqab.

Sorties in aircraft are an official military statistic. Motor-vehicle trips are so routine no one would bother to keep track, any more than someone would log how many times Pete Buttigieg took a shower. No one cares. So Buttigieg himself created this phony statistic. Picture it: He made himself a little Hero's Log but all he had to put in it was routine trips. It's pathetic. It's hilarious. It's apple-polishing, résumé-buffing, box-checking, attention-seeking vaporware. Just like his whole career. … [Here's] why we are unimpressed with Pete Buttigieg's military career. Three things stand out about his brief sojourn in the Navy: One, he joined via direct commission. This, to most veterans, is a jaw-dropper. To say the least, this isn't the way it's usually done. Many of us recall the intensive pre-commission training (in my case, four years of ROTC in Connecticut and Advanced Camp with the 82nd Airborne in Fort Bragg) as the most trying intervals of our careers. Others spent four years at Annapolis or West Point. Buttigieg just skipped all of that. He passed a physical. He signed some papers. Voilà. To put this in terms a liberal might understand: Imagine you heard that someone got a direct diploma from Harvard but didn't actually have to do four years of papers and tests. You'd never forget it. You'd probably think of that person primarily as a short-cut specialist for the rest of your life.

When Christian's wife and children discover that he is about to leave on a quest, having no idea when, if ever, he will return, they summon the neighbors and together the whole group rails against Christian, mocking and threatening him. They tell him he is a fool, and that he is neglecting his responsibilities and pursuing an illusion. But none of this deters Christian, who in Bunyan's words, put his fingers in his ears and ran on, crying Life! Life! Eternal life!
I wore a dress on my wedding day because I felt like it, I straightened my hair because I felt like it, she said. But that doesn't make me become some instantly 'polite hetero lady,' she added.
In nearly all the cases, the girls were the younger person in the relationship. In 149 instances, the adult was older than 40, and in 28 cases the adult was over 50, the committee found. Among the examples: In 2011, immigration officials approved a 14-year-old's petition for a 48-year-old spouse in Jamaica. A petition from a 71-year-old man was approved in 2013 for his 17-year-old wife in Guatemala.

Clearly, the current resident of the White House who for months has repeatedly and deliberately lied about nonexistent election fraud, and who, even as Confederate-flag wielding thugs strolled throughout the Capitol, is guilty of inciting violence in his morning speech on the Ellipse.

Not one candidate on the debate stage Tuesday mentioned Kimia Alizadeh, or Neda Agha-Soltan, or any of the millions of women Iran has executed, abused, tortured, or exploited.

Keep families together. The bill reforms the family-based immigration system by clearing backlogs, recapturing unused visas, eliminating lengthy wait times, and increasing per-country visa caps. It also eliminates the so-called 3 and 10-year bars, and other provisions that keep families apart. The bill further supports families by more explicitly including permanent partnerships and eliminating discrimination facing LGBTQ+ families. It also provides protections for orphans, widows, children, and Filipino veterans who fought alongside the United States in World War II. Lastly, the bill allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join family in the United States on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.

Stoning for adultery occurs under Islamic law for a reason that you may by now be able to guess: it was endorsed by Mohammed. There are several Islamic sources to back this up. I will recount just one part of Sahih Bukhari 3:50:885 which reads: Allah's Apostle said, By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death. Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah's Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death.
To be sure, Khashoggi's death was a shocking crime. And in response, the Post had, understandably, taken a hard reportorial and editorial line against the Saudi government. So the implication of Bezos's article was that perhaps the Saudis had something to do with the original leak from Bezos's phone because they wanted to hit back at him for his newspaper's pursuit of the Khashoggi story.
Hickenlooper joins an ever-growing presidential field, which including Sens.

The National Catholic Reporter, which has made its reputation through open dissent to Catholic Church teaching for decades, pushing everything from women's ordination to gay marriage to abortion, said in its op-ed that it is unprecedented that the Church's leadership would cozy up so cravenly to a president whose most consistent attribute is an uncontrollable propensity for lying.
Figueroa, the former principal of Viridian Elementary in the Dallas area Hurst-Euless-Bedford (HEB) school district, was under investigation after placing a Craigslist online ad seeking male-male oral sex at a movie theater with young partners. An undercover male police officer answered the ad, posing as a 16-year-old. The two began to text, arranging to meet at the fashionable Frisco Stonebriar Centre Mall AMC movie theater. Instead of a hook up, Figueroa was arrested as he and the undercover officer walked to a unisex bathroom. In July, a federal grand jury indicted Figueroa. During the trial, the feds introduced Figueroa's text messages with the undercover agent, his interview with law enforcement, approximately 120 Craigslist ads Figueroa posted seeking sexual activity, and the contents of his cellular phone, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Texas. In addition to 120 months of federal prison, Figueroa will be required to register as a sex offender.

Maher and Sefidari further elaborated on the code of conduct plans in an interview with Reuters. Sefidari indicated their concerns about inclusivity were specifically about bringing in more women and marginalized groups. Although corporate media increasingly praise Wikipedia as a counter to fake news in a messaging strategy originally suggested by firm of the Clinton Foundation's PR head, the media have remained critical of Wikipedia on diversity matters. Concerns about control over Wikipedia and other Foundation-owned sites becoming more centralized were dismissed by Maher as she told Reuters they would not yet be expanding the Foundation's Trust and Safety team who enforce the site's Terms of Use and would be training communities and interested task-forces of users in enforcing the code of conduct.

First, these are not immigrant children. They are children of illegal alien parents. Second, no innocent children are being physically harmed in any way, certainly not killed in their mother's womb. The Border Patrol is not Planned Parenthood. If illegal alien parents don't want to be separated from their children, how about not crossing the border illegally with them? This comparison is obscene and slanderous. Abortion and Planned Parenthood separate more kids from their families and mothers than the Border Patrol which, by the way, doesn't kill them in the womb. Liberals such as Camosy, whom I assume supports sanctuary cities, offer no sanctuary for the unborn who also seek to avoid violence and murder in what should be the safest safe space in the world — their mother's womb.

Rubio said the American people need to learn to work together even if they disagree and if they don't then they will pay the terrible price that their children will grow up where dignified work is only available to a few. He added that their children would also inherit a democracy that is an island in an ocean of tyranny and that their children would live in a world dominated by China. He said in this future world dominated by China, where they will have to depend on them for the latest medical advances in technology and where privacy and free speech, and religious liberty, and human rights are no longer protected, because China, the most powerful country at that point, is a serial violator of each one of these things. And if God forbid, that day should ever come, it will have been because those of us here now allowed it to happen.
The Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip — often affectionately known in the United Kingdom as the 'Iron Duke' for his longevity and constitution — retired from public life in 2017.

Murphy's confirmation marks the passing of a baton, as he takes the seat being vacated by Judge Batchelder, who has been one of the originalist champions on the federal bench for 27 years.

So the Indians decided to follow in the economic path the Chinese had marked out. Large parts of the Indian economy are still government regulated, but the trend for three decades now has been away from that, toward privatization, deregulation, economic liberalization. And India too has seen spectacular results. Technological capitalism has realized Gandhi's dream of wiping millions of Indian tears. As for Indian socialism, the leftist writer Pankaj Mishra frets that it shows no signs of revival.

The death toll was smaller than the much-publicized 675,000 dead from AIDS from the 1980s, Princeton economics professors Deaton and Case write in their new book, Deaths of Despair. The toll, they write, is the equivalent of three full 737 MAXs falling out of the sky every day [for three years], with no survivors.
Prager responded, This is the oldest question. The book of Job is entirely about this. First of all, religious people are are not only allowed — but expected — to ask God, 'Why do you seem like you've abandoned me?' For a Christian, Christ on the cross's last words are, 'Why have you abandoned me?'
This is one reason this political decision by the High Court will not stand the test of time.

As it happens I am well aware of the vulnerabilities of what I tweeted. I should never have written it and fallen into the Twitter trap. Tweets don't provide enough space to account for the complexities of this subject or provide sufficient examples to make one's case. Character is notoriously mercurial and complex to judge.

Mr. Bean's face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar, The New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, The Blue Angel. It said he showed a quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat.
TEL AVIV — A gay pride flag flown by fans at a concert by the controversial Lebanese band Mashroo Layla (Night Project) has set off a storm in Egyptian media.

NFL policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard. Whether the laws and regulations of a state and local community are consistent with these policies would be one of many factors NFL owners may use to evaluate potential Super Bowl host sites, the NFL said in a statement last week.
The Equality Act would be used to remove custody rights from parents who refuse to have their minor children undergo transgender medical interventions and procedures.
The hypocrisy grows even thicker because of the mayor's own, well-known racism, Donohue notes, since he has adopted racial quotas, repeatedly promoting policies that discriminate against Asian Americans by denying them seats in New York's public schools.

His final act – resigning in a fluster in order to poison the wells and salt the fields for the side that democratically defeated him – is, I fear, entirely typical of the man.
The statute in question establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Obergefell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders.

Like many on the Left who seek to minimize the unlawful actions of people who use children as a means to gain entry to the United States, Camosy employed the term undocumented instead of illegal in his column as he criticized pro-life organizations for not taking a stand on the portrayal of the illegal immigrant situation by the left-wing media.

Yet the EU's Fundamental Rights Colloquium was soon reformatted, and became primarily focussed on combatting 'Islamophobia' and curtailing online free speech instead.
Glazov commented to Breitbart News, saying: First I was banned for reporting a member of the Religion of Peace threatening me. Now I am banned, on 9/11 mind you, for daring to give suggestions on how we can stop another 9/11. It is against Facebook's 'community standards' to try to stop Jihadist attacks on Americans. This is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.
A letter circulated by the boycotters exhorted: Please urge your friends to not attend this concert, which helps normalize bigotry in our community. One boycotter, violinist and UCLA professor Andrew Apter, told Prager on his show that he would be willing to play for the pleasure of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un rather than playing in the orchestra under Prager's baton.
So it's not hard to envision that the whole skein of events, from Washington to Riyadh to wherever else, could well be remembered as some fantastic tale, like something that Ian Fleming might have written for his character James Bond.
Lurasetti and Ridgeman are caught on video mildly (at least when compared to Rodney King or what we usually see in movies) roughing up a big-time, Hispanic drug dealer. In a terrific scene, their boss (and Ridgeman's former partner — played by the great Don Johnson) explains the sorry ways of a sorry world — a world where the entertainment industry we now call the news media needs a villain, where the handling of every perceived intolerance is done with total intolerance.
Biden swipes Bernie's wealth tax and keeps defending the bailout (doing himself a disservice the more he keeps defending the bailouts).
It's over for the little guy.
It would allow anyone, at any time, to declare that he or she is a member of the oppo sex without any medical or psychological diagnosis … It would erase women's and girls' rights by requiring facilities, such as schools, churches, dormitories, domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, to allow biological males who identify as women, in women's bathrooms, women's and girls' shelters, women's and girls' showers, and in women's locker rooms. This will indeed violate women's' privacy and can ultimately violate their safety … [it] will eliminate women's and girls' sports … will also require, require, doctors to provide sex change surgeries and sex change hormones to adolescents without parental consent and without a medical or psychological diagnosis. This could permanently sterilize young girls … Congress should only pass laws that protect women, not threaten, silence or abandon them.
While the code of conduct has been approved, the method of enforcement is yet to be decided and has been the subject of public consultations since January. Communities of select Foundation-owned sites have been asked about various methods of enforcement and what role the Foundation should play. At Wikimedia Commons, a file and image repository for Foundation sites such as Wikipedia, many users complained the Foundation was ineffective on harassment. Users at both Commons and Wikidata, a Foundation site focused on compiling data tables on subjects, insisted most enforcement should be publicly transparent with some allowance for a private reporting system in severe cases.

He's bringing out an ugly side of America that we wanted to believe was gone, and it's still here. We still gotta deal with it, the Run This Town rapper said of Trump in 2018.
The big reason that having children, and even marrying in the first place, hurts women's pay relative to men's is that the division of labor at home is still unequal, even when both spouses work full time. That's especially true for college-educated women in high-earning occupations: Children are particularly damaging to their careers.

Of course, the focus on Michael doesn't mean that the Bezosians aren't still going after Pecker, Trump, and whoever else. After all, it would certainly elevate Bezos if he could turn his peccadillo into a major case against the Vast Trump Conspiracy. That is, liberals everywhere would love it, and soon enough if the Bezos People play it right, over time, it might seem as if the whole mess was Trump's doing, thus easing the stain on Bezos.

In contrast to left-wing editors supporting violence and violent groups, one even having praised an Antifa terrorist attack on an ICE detention facility, editors who favor the right have been treated more harshly. An editor who expressed general support for Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on January 6th was banned indefinitely, one of many banned when opposing left-wing bias on the topic, despite having brought articles on two American Presidents and one Vice President up to featured status, the highest standard on the site.
Instead, he chose to double down, and support Remain more wholeheartedly than ever. In the absence of evidence that the EU was good for Britain – which clearly he was incapable of producing – he instead resorted to the dire, mendacious bully tactics mentioned above. Not only that, but he cynically hijacked the entire apparatus of the Civil Service – with the full support of the sinister mandarin Sir Jeremy Heywood. – to try to crush the brave minority of Leave MPs such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson in their tracks.
The fentanyl crisis represents an extraordinary public health challenge — and requires an extraordinary public health response, the experts wrote [in March 2016] to six administration officials, including the nation's drug czar and the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The administration considered the request but did not act on it. The decision was one in a series of missed opportunities, oversights and half-measures by federal officials who failed to grasp how quickly fentanyl was creating another — and far more fatal — wave of the opioid epidemic. … On Jan. 11, 2017, in the waning days of the administration, Obama delivered his annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. Four years after the epidemic began in Rhode Island, the White House called fentanyl a national crisis.

But the question is, what is it exactly? Now that we're waging war on white supremacists, can somebody tell us in very clear language what a white supremacist is?

HR 5 is a sweeping assault on the religious liberty rights of people of faith while simultaneously enacting powerful special legal rights for the LGBT community, he explained.

Josi Denise became a mommy blogger in 2013, building up her American Mama blog until it reached tens of thousands of monthly readers, generating the mother of three thousands of dollars in some months. But the blog came to an abrupt end late last week, when Denise had a crisis of conscience and quit. In a splenetic rant on her new namesake blog (which is worth reading in full), Denise said much of the content posted to her mommy blog — and countless like it online — was garbage. She has deleted many of those posts, she said, Because, like 90% of the fake nonsense I used to share on the internet as a mommy blogger writing about my fake life and oh-so-happy marriage, they are pure b——t.

So by now, we can see that we have the makings of a new James Bond-ish saga: The world's richest man, owner of one of the nation's most important newspapers–a man willing to play hardball with the largest metropolis in the U.S., New York City, over a new corporate location, which he will now put elsewhere–now finds himself stalked, and perhaps even hacked, by a prominent tabloid publication–which he reportedly considered buying, as a way of shutting down the story. In the meantime, even as multi-billion-dollar divorce proceedings begin, insinuations and accusations swirl around the president of the United States, as well as an exotically wealthy foreign government. And oh yes: All of this can be further connected, maybe, to the special counsel investigation of Robert Mueller, who seems to be casting a wide international net.

In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.

That's the exact opposite of what fashionable liberals have told us for generations now: marriage is a silly formality, there's nothing special about marriage between men and women, the nuclear family is obsolete, it's monstrous for society to expect women to sacrifice their career ambitions to focus on raising kids, and single parenting is every bit as good as the traditional family (with a little help from Big Government to cover for Dad's missing paycheck). Those who warned about the dangers of family breakdown three decades ago were relentlessly mocked for their obsession with outmoded, overrated, narrow-minded family values.

JAMES COMEY: Yes, I– I was told at some point that it was– the effort had originally been financed by a Republican source to develop– material– opposition research on Donald Trump. Then after the Republican nominating process ended, the effort was taken up and funded by a Democratic aligned group trying to get opposition research on Trump. I never knew which– who the groups were, but I knew it started with Republicans paying for it and then Democrats were paying for it.

Late in life, Whittlesy continued to be active and relevant on the national political stage, endorsing the Republican ticket in 2016 and writing numerous op-eds, largely counseling restraint and prudence in U.S. foreign and domestic affairs. She served as a bridge between the Reagan Revolution and the Trump Revolution 36 years later. As co-chair of Reaganites for Trump, she pushed for the resumption of Reagan's core agenda. A practicing Roman Catholic, she also served as a member of the Trump campaign Catholic Advisory Group.

Rather than humility, Buttigieg is displaying intolerance, adding to the sense religious voters have that what Democrats want is not just to drive them out of the public square, but out of their own faith.
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court this week found that, the one-person, one-vote allows states to use total population only, rather than voter population, when apportioning state voting districts: Adopting voter-eligible apportionment as constitutional command would upset a well-functioning approach to districting that all 50 States and countless local jurisdictions have fol­lowed for decades, even centuries.
The Act states discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity can take many forms:
How coherent is this idea of real socialism? If an economic idea fails once or twice or even three times, one can still insist it was a fine idea that was merely implemented poorly. But if an idea fails 25 times, all over the world, everywhere it has been tried, without even one counterexample of a socialist regime that works well, it strains credulity to insist that there is still some undiscovered form of socialism, heretofore unattempted, that will finally prove its viability. Yet another go at socialism now feels like Elizabeth Taylor's eighth marriage, a triumph of hope over experience.

Lucas was very open about the way he and other liberals were taken by complete surprise by Trump's election — something that many conservatives in California understood intuitively was a foregone conclusion once Trump made it clear he would stand and fight like Reagan did, instead of cutting and running like the Mitt Romney wing of the party. But unlike most liberals, Lucas admitted that he believes it is important to understand how we got here, instead of simply demonizing Trump and his supporters.

So the Indians decided to follow in the economic path the Chinese had marked out. Large parts of the Indian economy are still government regulated, but the trend for three decades now has been away from that, toward privatization, deregulation, economic liberalization.

They disagreed, too, on occasion, including when Biden advocated against the high-stakes raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

You see, once upon a time, in that glorious era between the original Production Code and today's increasingly oppressive Production Code of Political Correctness, movies weren't afraid to get real, to offer us characters in all their complexities, to reflect them through a humanist prism — flaws and all.

Saturday, as President Tusk said, I was pleased to address the Munich Security Council to speak about the importance of the strategic alliance [inaudible] … entered the bond so many years ago in the North American Treaty Organization. But the president did ask me to come here, to Brussels, to the home of the European Union, and deliver an additional message, so today it is my privilege on behalf of President Trump to express the strong commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union. Whatever our differences, our two continents share the same marriage, the same values, and above all, the same purpose — to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. And to those objectives, we will remain committed. This has been European Union's goal since before its formal founding in 1993. What began as a modest Western European trade agreement in 1951, freedom of movement, has grown into a commitment to the four freedoms — the freedom of movement, goods, capital, services and people, the common currency, and common approach to foreign and security policy.
In his nine-page dissent, Scalia ripped into the majority opinion, calling it a judicial Putsch that poses a threat to American democracy. He added that a system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.

Robertson used the calendar to explain that something remarkable happened in the man Jesus, after all, our calendar is dated beginning with his life. He said, If your calendar is dated on of (sic) all the human beings who have ever walked on the earth, and your calendar is dedicated and predicated to just one of them, evidently something rather large went down back then.
Membership in the multiracial, post-ethnic national overclass depends chiefly on graduation with a diploma—preferably a graduate or professional degree—from an Ivy League school or a selective state university, which makes the Ivy League the new social register. But a diploma from the Ivy League or a top-ranked state university by itself is not sufficient for admission to the new national overclass. Like all ruling classes, the new American overclass uses cues like dialect, religion, and values to distinguish insiders from outsiders. Dialect. You may have been at the top of your class in Harvard business school, but if you pronounce thirty-third toidy-toid or have a Southern drawl, you might consider speech therapy. Religion. You may have edited the Yale Law Review, but if you tell interviewers that you recently accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior, or fondle a rosary during the interview, don't expect a job at a prestige firm. Values. This is the trickiest test, because the ruling class is constantly changing its shibboleths—in order to distinguish true members of the inner circle from vulgar impostors who are trying to break into the elite. A decade ago, as a member of the American overclass you could get away with saying, along with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I strongly support civil unions for gay men and lesbians. In 2020 you are expected to say, I strongly support trans rights.

Moreover, the bill will apply to Mississippi, reports the Los Angeles Times, because of a new law that allows government employees to refuse issuance of marriage licenses or perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples. The law also allows private business to refuse housing, jobs and adoption services to people based on their sexual orientation.
To some extent, Turnbull's flip towards pro-Australian position is designed to help his pro-business wing of the party from Abbot's pro-Australian wing of the party, and from the growing support being given to Pauline Hanson's nationalist One Nation Party, which is skeptical about Islam's ability to integrate into Australian society. In 2016 and before, Turnbull repeatedly endorsed immigration, invited additional refugees, and told the parliament in October 2016 that everyone sitting in this chamber and every Australian is a beneficiary of the diversity that is at the heart of our nation … the most effective weapon against the [Muslim] terrorists is an inclusive nation.

Younger adults— those under age 35—have reduced their spending compared with previous generations possibly because of weakened job prospects, delayed marriage, and educational debt. Policy makers have recognized that lower spending limits economic growth. As a result, a number of policies to boost younger adults spending such as forgiving student debt have entered the political arena, according to Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey. Student loans make up the majority of the $1,005,000,000,000 owed by this cohort, followed by mortgage debt. New mortgages among young adults today remain quite a bit below levels incurred in the early 2000s.

The women summoned for interrogation were given no reason for the summonses they received, but once inside the interrogation room they were bombarded with accusations of espionage and collusion with 'foreign-based currents seeking the overthrow of the Islamic Republic system.' Amnesty International understands that the Revolutionary Guards subjected the women to verbal abuse, including gender-related slurs. The activists were not allowed to be accompanied by their lawyers during the interrogations, which lasted in some cases up to eight hours.

Iran is one of the world's most repressive nations against its women and girls. The Islamic revolution of 1979 undid decades of progressive laws and policies towards the nation's women that allowed them to work outside the home, maintain public personas, and function largely as equals in society, relative to how many other nations at the time treated women. As Haleh Esfandiari wrote for the Atlantic Council, the regime rapidly went about erasing women from society:

The latest attacks on those accusing China followed a harrowing BBC exposé in which survivors of the concentration camp system said they were regularly subject to gang rape and tortured by being raped with electric batons, among other atrocities. Some of those sharing their experiences with the BBC included guards and prisoners forced to help the guards by disrobing and tying women up in torture chambers prior to their gang rape. Nearly all of those testifying said that a common characteristic of the concentration camps was that everyone inside could hear the screams of agony of those being tortured while they awaited their turn.

Wu and other Chinese social development researchers have suggested the matchmaking scheme as part of an overall push for the Chinese government to address a worsening social crisis in China caused by a decades-long gender imbalance. The gender imbalance is rooted in China's only recently defunct one-child policy, which the Communist Party of China (CPC) implemented in 1979 in an effort to control China's then-rapidly growing population. CPC authorities relaxed the policy, which encouraged selective abortions for females in favor of the preferred male sex, in late 2015 to allow families to have up to two children. Nearly four decades of the scheme's enforcement severely warped China's gender demographics, producing one of the most unbalanced sex ratios in the world.

And how would that be? How would the Enquirer gain such omniscience? As De Becker puts it, The initial information came from other channels—another source or method. And at least one of those other channels, he explains, was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which had somehow hacked Bezos' phone:
The Times article claimed that the U.S. government had invested more than $700 million into supporting the gay agenda globally and that more than half of that money had targeted sub-­Saharan Africa.
My own organization, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), has been targeted by the SPLC. Our crime? Defending the interests of American citizens and legal immigrants of all backgrounds while politicians, corporations and well-funded advocacy groups exploit our laws to benefit foreign nationals. The SPLC has come down firmly on the side of illegal aliens, many of whom drive down wages for Americans, act as a drain on our social services and commit felonies that injure or kill innocent Americans.

The one-child policy and subsequent remaining limitations on family expansion apply only to ethnic Han Chinese citizens. Ethnic minorities are legally allowed to expand their families further, but are subject to much more brutal methods of birth control. In Western China, the Communist Party has pursued a campaign of forcibly sterilizing Uyghur women, which the U.S. government deemed genocide last week.
Some women cried out in pain as a masked sharia officer lashed them, and at least two had to be carried from the scene by sharia officers.

Now, as you said, I've known Joe Biden for a long time. My grandchildren love Joe Biden. He's an affectionate person to children to senior citizens, to everyone. That's just the way he is. But, that's just not the way. Join the straight-arm club with me if you will. And also, for example my grandchildren, when they were little, like five and six — Now they're ten, eleven — they would say, plays games, and then they'd say Open Sesame except we don't saw Open Sesame, we say Open Biden. That's the magic word. Because he was just so lovely to them and paid attention to them.

These non-medical reasons typically include supposedly protecting a Muslim girl's modesty by depriving her of sexual pleasure. The practice offers no health benefits and can result in severe pain, hemorrhage, genital tissue swelling, fever, infections, and urinary problems.

Keep in mind that all this piety is coming from a man who lives in open defiance of God with his husband — which is fine. I don't care how Mean Little Mayor Pete lives his life, and if he'd promise to lower taxes, kill terrorists, and deport illegals, I'd consider voting for him. But it's a bit much to lecture the rest of us about Real Christianity when you're living an openly homosexual life.
Phillips's article even describes a conversation with Amra, a female Sharia court judge, detailing advice for the aspirant bigamist, which calls into question the on-going legal standing of such tribunals. At no point during their cosy chat does anyone mention that they are discussing the facilitation of a criminal offence made illegal in Britain in 1861.
It is no exaggeration to say that homosexuality has become a plague in the clergy, and it can only be eradicated with spiritual weapons, he said. It is an enormous hypocrisy to condemn the abuse, claim to weep for the victims, and yet refuse to denounce the root cause of so much sexual abuse: homosexuality.

Maybe NBC News is finally going to use its power for a moral good — to put an end to this disgraceful era of public shaming. From where I sit, this would be a healthy turnabout from a craven media that have spent years championing and emboldening the Woke Fascists who shame, boycott, de-platform, and personally destroy people over jokes, decades-old tweets, offbeat opinions, honest mistakes, and slips of the tongue.

The result is the sociopath A.J. who, by the end of the series, has no job skills, other than the ability to emotionally blackmail and manipulate everyone around him to get what he wants. A phony suicide attempt, a lot of pouting and moping, a passive-aggressive threat to join the military, and suddenly A.J.

There has been a declining curve of yearly new births in China — 17.86 million, 17.23 million, 15.23 million and 14.65 million in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, according to data released by the NBS. The low birth rate in China has reached an alarming degree, but it is not a surprise, Mu Guangzong, a professor from the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The main reason for the decline is the low desire among young couples to have children due to the high cost of supporting a child, he said, noting that for many young couples, the general housing and education policies in China as well as the social environment as a whole do not encourage them to have kids.

According to Al-Qusheiri, polygamy is nothing but legal adultery … that no sane person who has reached adulthood would consider.
Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.
In 2011, Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry wanted to pass a law that set a minimum age to marry, since family members force many young girls to marry much older men. Saudi Justice Minister Mohammed Al Issa said the issue came to light after a surge in such weddings and growing criticism by local human rights groups.
In a legal first, a British High Court judge has recognised a shariah marriage when ruling on a 'divorce' petition of a Muslim woman, likely setting a precedent on the acceptance of Islamic marriages and divorces in the UK.

I think the challenge that I see among a lot of people that go to Donald Trump rallies, and then they will go to church on Sunday, and I'm not … I don't know what faith they are worshipping. Donald Trump has done more to hurt the least of us among us than just about any president I can think of:

These days, you could be forgiven for not realizing that civil rights ever had anything to do with black people. According to Equal Opportunity Employment Commission statistics, for a least a decade, 65 percent of all civil rights claims have had absolutely nothing to do with race discrimination.
CARLSON: Bringing America together, Biden said. Uniting our people, uniting our nation, to which we said as we watched it and we meant it when we did. Amen. Unity. That is precisely what this country needs more than it needs anything. We are all in this together, every single American and we have no choice but to hang together.
The state has experienced two political turning points. First was the presidential election of 1992, when California voted for Bill Clinton. It has chosen the Democrat ever since, thanks in part — ironically — to immigration reform signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. That law, also known as Simpson-Mazzoli, granted amnesty to illegal aliens –including many in California — but failed to secure the border, creating incentives for future illegal immigration.
He backed civil unions for gay couples and signed a law providing them in Colorado in 2013, before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Hickenlooper announced in 2013 that he opposed the death penalty and refused to execute a quadruple-murderer who was on death row. And, as he prepared to leave office and was openly mulling a presidential bid, he ordered the state to adopt California's low-emission vehicle standards to fight climate change.

It stated, quite rightly, that to use the term 'honour killing' when describing the murder of a family member – overwhelmingly females – due to the perpetrators' belief they have brought 'shame' on a family, normalises murder for cultural reasons and sets it apart from other killings when there should be no distinction.

Pursuing the American dream gave us purpose, achieving it left us empty and lost, and now we try to fill that spiritual hole by filling our homes with useless shit, by self-medicating, by pretending our social causes and faith are not just another form of narcissism — a sword to jab others and find them lacking and a shield to cover up what selfish and self-centered people we are.
I don't know whether it was the snide-ness of this comment or its absoluteness that triggered me, but it seemed so pig-headedly self-righteous, so oblivious of the complexities of human character, not to mention the nuclear dimensions of the left's war against Trump, that I responded, and in doing so walked into a hornets' nest.

The Queen's late mother believed the unexpected burden of taking up the crown at a time of great national upheaval — George VI reigned through much of the Great Depression and throughout the Second World War — precipitated his early death, and the Queen's own equally unexpected elevation to the throne at the age of 25.

Chinese state media have been advocating for the Communist Party to implement programs that not just repeal limitations on having children, but actively incentivize couples to do so given the dire state of the country's birth rate. The latest available data show that 14.65 million babies were born in China in 2019, a record-low in this century and a number last documented in China in 1961, at the height of Mao-era persecution and poverty. A scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Yi Fuxian, called that number seriously overestimated and claimed the true number of births that year was closer to 10 million.

In what amounted to a brief history lesson, Scalia underscored the gravity of the Court's action by comparing it to England's treatment of the American colonies that ignited the movement for American independence.

Wu and other Chinese social development researchers have suggested the matchmaking scheme as part of an overall push for the Chinese government to address a worsening social crisis in China caused by a decades-long gender imbalance. The gender imbalance is rooted in China's only recently defunct one-child policy, which the Communist Party of China (CPC) implemented in 1979 in an effort to control China's then-rapidly growing population. CPC authorities relaxed the policy, which encouraged selective abortions for females in favor of the preferred male sex, in late 2015 to allow families to have up to two children. Nearly four decades of the scheme's enforcement severely warped China's gender demographics, producing one of the most unbalanced sex ratios in the world.

All that's required is that they avoid taking sides in the political war that is engulfing the country. All this reminds me of a memorable Trotsky sneer about liberals, whom he accused of being reluctant to step into the stream of political conflict because they were afraid to get their moral principles wet.
The Trump administration has won praise from religious groups for promoting their agenda abroad, including the Mexico City policy, which bars U.S. foreign aid for being used to fund or promote abortion.

Li said the fertility rate has plunged dangerously beneath the rate of 2.1 births per woman required to maintain a stable population, urging government action to boost the fertility rate to meet China's growing need for workers. Other Chinese analysts estimated it could take 15 years or more for relaxed family planning rules to noticeably increase the birth rate, while China's population of retirees swells inexorably to 300 million over the next few years.

The polls show Americans' deep and broad opposition to cheap labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into the jobs needed by young and old Americans.
We already knew from other sources (such as BLS time use surveys) that the overwhelming majority of the prime-age men in this un-working army generally don't do civil society (charitable work, religious activities, volunteering), or for that matter much in the way of child care or help for others in the home either, despite the abundance of time on their hands. Their routine, instead, typically centers on watching—watching TV, DVDs, Internet, hand-held devices, etc.—and indeed watching for an average of 2,000 hours a year, as if it were a full-time job.
Before the U.N. agency's decision to refer her case to Australia, the country's Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said there would be no special treatment for her.

In a 2016 letter on marriage and the family, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), Pope Francis said that sex education should teach respect and appreciation for sexual differences, as a way of helping the young to overcome self-absorption. This respect includes self-acceptance and learning to embrace the body one is born with, rather than playing with fictional identities that deny reality.
For his part, the head of the Knights of Columbus, Carl Anderson, expressed the gratitude of his organization for the balanced and prophetic statement issued by Archbishop Gomez.
One Twitter user thought maybe it was a first-of-its-kind proposal.
The tweets that resulted in Glazov's temporary suspension related to Sahih Bukhari's texts discussing Mohammed's marriage to Aisha when she was six years old, and a quote posted by Glazov from the Quranic Suras that mandates the Hijab for women and sanctions sexual slavery. These direct quotes from Islamic religious texts were apparently enough to result in Glazov's account being locked until he deleted the offending tweets.

The matriarch of the Bush dynasty, the wife of one president (George H.W. Bush, who died in November of last year) and the mother of another (George W. Bush), passed away in April of last year at the age of 92 after a years-long fight with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Buttigieg is a gay Episcopalian veteran in a party torn between identity politics and heartland appeals. He's also a fresh face in a year when millennials are poised to become the largest eligible voting bloc. Many Democrats are hungry for generational change, and the two front-runners are more than twice his age.
At this year's Republican primary, Heck beat out a long list of GOP contenders with 65 percent of the vote.
While I will always speak out for women to maintain our just civil rights, I do want Sharia Watch to spend significantly more time on freedom of speech (we will run an autumn campaign 'Islam Kills Free Speech') and the impact of Islam on children, but before I do, I intend to spend the summer doing something very important – informing the ludicrous feminists of today of something they desperately need to know: Islam Kills Women.
Corporations should be encouraged to support gay rights as a means to further economic gain, attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos will hear this week.
Which brings me to the show's relentless and righteous condemnation of identity politics.

We are really grateful to the police for continuing to prioritise the protection of people being abused through slavery despite all the extra demands currently placed on them as part of their response to the pandemic, said Major Kathy Betteridge, Director of Anti-trafficking and Modern Slavery for The Salvation Army — which is responsible for much of the victims' aftercare.
A video of the ceremony shows the cleric instructing the girl that, as a wife, you have a duty to obey your husband. The groom, meanwhile, is advised of his obligation to provide the minor with a sexual education.
When I last wrote about the increased mortality rates among lower- and middle-class whites, I suggested the welfare state played a significant role in creating the death wave. Now, in a massive and extensively researched article for Commentary, Nicholas Eberstadt shows how Medicaid is funding the gateway drugs — opioid prescription painkillers — which lead people towards deadly heroin and early death.
I can guarantee you in these two states that hate crimes are going to increase and people are going to be beaten, insists Bonin, who is gay and represents coastal neighborhoods in West Los Angeles.

Al-Britani tells young recruits to trust only a few older people who can provide money and other assistance for the journey to jihad, and touchingly suggests they take a last look at your parent's faces before departing for the caliphate, so you will always remember this once you are here.
I feel terrible about the fact that Monica Lewinsky's life was defined by it, unfairly I think, he says, before suggesting that she move on from the controversy. Over the years I've watched her trying to get a normal life back again, but you've got to decide how to define normal, he said.
A 42-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman, both understood to be of African background, are due in court to be charged with FGM offences after the incident was investigated by the Metropolitan Police Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command, according to the London Evening Standard.
Twitchy posted the exchange and promoted it this way: It's On! Jonah Goldberg, David Horowitz Duke It Out Over Trump's Character. The donnybrook led to 500,000 impressions off my Twitter feed, including legions of anti-Trump zealots eager to demonstrate how creative they could be in devising insults to throw at me for defending Trump: beyond dumb, in need of psychiatric help, and probably receiving payments through offshore bank accounts.
That assertion may be a surprise to Aikman's former wife and children. The three-time Superbowl champion was married to former Cowboys publicist Rhonda Worthey for 11 years and has two daughters from that marriage.
Her job waiting tables at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort had sustained her through the painful end of her marriage and the struggles of being a single parent to two teenage girls, one of whom is autistic and struggles with basic motor skills and speaking. Throughout the summer and fall as lawmakers were fighting over an economic relief bill and the number of coronavirus cases was climbing, Flaviana was scouring the Disney fan blogs for glimmers of hope that the tourists might be returning. But the once famously long lines at Disney World remained short even as Orlando's free food lines, packed with laid-off hotel and theme park workers, grew longer. All the while Flaviana's unemployment checks shrank from more than $800 a week in July to $247 a week in October, which didn't even cover her rent. … The hardest parts for Flaviana were accepting the reality that her Disney job was gone; that the modest middle-class life that she had built was no longer sustainable; that she wouldn't be able to provide Victoria, a bright and imaginative teenager whose autism made everyday tasks difficult, with the classes and therapists that enabled her to learn and share her thoughts and feelings. … As Trump's prospects dimmed in the days after Election Day, Flaviana held on to the faint chance that he might somehow prevail. Her hopes were dashed on Nov. 7 when she glanced at her phone and saw the election was being called for Biden.
The Hollywood Reporter has also confirmed that Judge Judy will be coming to a close after the courtroom show's 25th season which will air from 2020 to 2021.
Biden and Sanders have far more in common on abortion, religious liberty, gun rights, health care, immigration, economic policy, and education than what the media has portrayed. Biden, the so-called moderate, and Sanders, the democratic socialist, are really two sides of the same Democratic coin.

Jeb, however, is another matter. On top of being utterly clueless about how the real world works, his unmoored principles have once again exposed him as a man who should not be allowed anywhere near an oval-shaped office.
The status of Bert and Ernie's sexuality has been debated for years. The two puppets have been the subject of at least one gay wedding cake, and were featured on the cover of the New Yorker shortly after the defeat of the Defense of Marriage Act in California in 2013.
The question before the court in Pavan v. Smith was whether a state violates the 14th Amendment by denying married same-sex couples the same right afforded to married opposite-sex couples under state law to have the name of the birth mother's spouse entered as the second parent on their child's birth certificate.
It is a win of sorts for Jim Carrey, who makes a comeback in a leading role as the movie's villain, Dr. Robotnik. But unfortunately for Carrey, who has built a second career as a vociferous critic of President Donald Trump, Sonic is a deeply conservative film — which may explain its success.
She would make it harder to qualify for asylum and curtail policies that let migrants bring relatives to France, while also making it impossible for illegal migrants to secure residency status.
I can't bear the thought of her, al-Faqira said of the second wife. He destroyed my household when he started another.
I put an emphasis on having sex only with your spouse, but having the full range of sexual experiences with that spouse, Muladhat told the Guardian. Islamically, there's an emphasis on enjoying physical relationships within the context of marriage, not just for procreation. It is the wife's right that her husband satisfy her sexually.
I came to the conclusion an awfully long time ago that there is black and there is white, and we're all somewhere in the middle in a wonderful mix of male and female, Mirren said.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll of 6,426 people found that 16 percent had stopped talking to a family member or friend because of the election, while 30 percent said they ended a relationship entirely.

Klemm's overt advocacy of gay marriage has met with backlash in the conservative country, and the ambassador has been criticized for abusing his position to meddle in the internal affairs of the nation. One of the most celebrated journalists in Romania, Ion Cristoiu, the founder of the country's most important daily newspaper, has publicly accused Klemm of being not the ambassador of the USA but of Hillary Clinton.

I started crying to my mum, saying 'I don't want to get married,' but apparently it was organised before and she couldn't do anything about it because her reputation would go down, the 19-year-old told the jury on Monday.
Wagner said, 'Restore' means something that has nothing to do with economics. It is about rewinding the clock on social progress. It is rewinding the clock on whatever debate we're having, and potential progress on the environment, on gay marriage, on — the conversation about criminal justice, about racial progress, or lack thereof. I mean, that is, I think, what the — certain people in the Republican Party. It's not actually, 'Let's go 7 — $5 a gallon gas.' It's, 'Let's go back to a time when gay marriage was illegal. Let's go back to a time when there wasn't the ACA.'
It seems to me a perfectly tenable position to believe that Christian bakeries should be free not to bake – say – gay marriage cakes because they do not hold a monopoly market position. Anyone can set up a bakery, with minimal effort. There are minimal barriers to entry. How difficult can it be to bake a cake, shove some pink icing on top, then add two male figurines holding hands? Even I could do that if you rang me up and gave me reasonable notice.
In Israel, soccer and basketball reign supreme while baseball, long popular among American Jews, has failed to catch on with the rough-and-tumble native-born Israelis who have taken more of a liking to the strategy and hard hitting of American football.
In later years he brought authority to action movies, including the James Bond thriller Skyfall and two of the Bourne films.

And if the Mean Little Mayor was running on a platform of lower taxes, ending abortion, killing terrorists, building a wall, deporting illegal aliens, and never taking any foreign policy advice from David French's Merry Band of War-Happy Lunatics, he could be married to three men, a cactus, and a toaster oven and I'd still vote for him.

For decades Democrats have had sole providence over almost every major city in America. We've literally poured trillions of tax dollars into the War on Poverty and public schools… In other words, Democrats have had sole control over these areas, have instituted every policy they believe in without opposition, and have received swimming pools full of federal dollars… And look at the result… Total failure.
In an investigative report, monthly journal Causeur notes that the sharp uptick in naturalisations far exceeds previous patterns and asks whether agencies' rush to grant citizenship to more new French is a coincidence against the backdrop of presidential elections in 2017.
Just imagine where Raskin's reasoning would take this country. If a president is a faithful Roman Catholic, devout Southern Baptist, or Orthodox Jew, whose faith teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman, and that sex is defined by biology rather than the gender a person chooses to identify with, that could run afoul of antidiscrimination laws. The correct response is that such beliefs are protected by the Free Speech Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution's First Amendment, which trumps federal and state antidiscrimination laws, and therefore are perfectly legal.
His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around. I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry, Fraser says of the alleged 2003 encounter, in a GQ profile titled, What Ever Happened to Brendan Fraser?
Stasi spends a couple hundred words slashing Guilfoyle's romantic life (which laughably boils down to OMG an attractive, successful single woman maybe dated that guy last year and is dating this guy now — that's two guys in two years!), so how are we supposed to believe Stasi is unaware of Guilfoyle's most well-known relationship, her five-year marriage to former-Mayor Gavin Newsom (D-CA), a relationship where Guilfoyle was famously celebrated as the first Latina First Lady of San Francisco.
The film, called Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan (Extra Careful of Marriage), is a romantic comedy featuring Ayushmann Khurrana and Jitendra Kumar as a same-sex couple named Kartik and Aman, the latter of whom's parents remain unable to accept their son's sexuality and continues to try and arrange his marriage to a woman.
…the share of interracial and interethnic marriages in America has increased fivefold, from 3% of all weddings in 1967 to 17% in 2015, notes the Guardian, the left-wing UK paper Turner-Smith should be familiar with. And multi-ethnic births accounted for 1 in 7 newborns in the U.S. in 2015, Pew data shows. And Americans today are far more satisfied with race relations under President Donald Trump than they were under President Obama, according to Gallup.

There exists a feeling among an ever-smaller minority in Brazil that I'm that man who could be a dictator, even though I say that in Brazil there wasn't a dictatorship, Bolsonaro was quoted as saying last year, in reference to the country's troubled military past.

The former Soviet republic of Belarus, number 4 on the list, punishes various offenses — including criticizing the government — with forced and compulsory labor. The U.S. News report notes that some 7,000 people suffering from alcoholism or drug dependencies are held in medical labor centers with an obligation to work. The government of Belarus also requires the participation of factory workers, civil servants, and students in harvesting on state-owned farms or in street cleaning.

Overall, in the week and a half time span between December 6 and December 17, Unite the Country spent more than $1.19 million to boost Biden's position in Iowa.

Stanhope claims that Depp hadn't slept for days. So when the actor finally told him he felt like he could sleep, after a number of friends had expressed worry over Heard, they left.
In the wake of the storming of the Capitol, many are blaming President Trump for the violence. Of course, he never instructed anyone to engage in violence. Nevertheless, his critics argue that he stoked people's passions, which he did, and can therefore be held accountable. If this is the standard—inflammatory rhetoric—then Trump's critics are at best ethically compromised.
On December 7, 2020, the U.S. State Department designated Nigeria for the first time as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC), the short list of the world's worst violators of religious freedom.

The United States Army, a trusted institution, if there ever was one has used an entire manual on what is and what is not white supremacy. So you should know this. Among the telltale signs of a committed white supremacist are these: celebrating Columbus Day, using the term American exceptionalism, any support for Federal border security or English only measures or, quote, education funding from property taxes, all white supremacy.

The fact that Tony and Carmela use a hollowed out Roman column, the same column that once signified Rome's strength and power, to hide firearms and as a bedroom television stand, is the perfect symbolism for everything Chase wants to say.
These crimes are indeed the most horrific, but the crises in the United States and Chile that have largely precipitated the upcoming summit have to do with abuses committed against young adults, including seminarians, not only against minors, Viganò said. Almost nothing has been said about sexual misconduct with adults, which is itself a grave abuse of pastoral authority, whether or not the relationship was 'consensual.'

Now, before we go any further, I need to be perfectly clear about something… I personally have no problem with bare-knuckle politics, dirty politics, brutal politics. As long as violence, the condoning of violence, or the justifying of violence is not involved, I am pro-brutal politics. The nastier the better. Listen, when you live in a world with a corrupt establishment media that will stop at nothing — like accusing John McCain of having an affair with a lobbyist — to put Democrats in office, when you live in a world where Mitt Romney is accused of killing a woman, when you live in a world where CNN folk heroes a anti-Trump thug, you have to play the game as it is lays.
In every generation, Christians must struggle with the question of how far they should adapt to the ways of the world, and in what ways they should remain distinct from it.

In an interview with Politico Playbook, Pelosi suggested Biden should join the straight-arm club and change his hugging style. She did not, however, address Biden's well-documented practice of sniffing women's hair, even total strangers like Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores.
If you fire me for failing to make a statement you demand, you will be committing yet another violation of the Due Process and the academic freedom provisions of the Faculty Statues. Unless you rescind your demand that I do so by April 14, 2016, I will assume that you mean what you say and that is precisely what you intend to do.
Including judges who had already taken senior status or retired before the 2020 election, more than 70 vacancies await Biden, the majority on the trial level district courts.

In the wake of this upheaval, two people associated with McGowan and Argento took their own lives. We now know Messick and Bourdain spent years battling with the black pool of depression. This means we cannot know what drove them to end their own lives. Sometimes there is a trigger. Sometimes not.
As an Islamic country with Sharia law, the United Arab Emirates has strict penalties for homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgenderism.
Yes, she has ethics and found her Italian ex-husband's obsession with identity politics absurd, but she is also attracted to Tony. She enjoys being a tourist in his world. This gives her mundane life a thrill. For this reason, she is also no hero, at least not until the penultimate episode where she finally fires him as her patient.
You know, Matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. And Matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, I fed you. When you were naked, I provided you with clothing. When you were an immigrant, I welcomed you. I think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from Donald Trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.
Shiite Iran continues to criminalize women's right's activism, designating peaceful female advocates as enemies of the state and using its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to crack down on them, reports human rights watchdog Amnesty International.
Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2019
The 2011 incident occurred at the remote outpost where Martland was stationed. The boy and his mother showed up at camp, and the boy showed the Green Berets where his hands had been tied. A medic took him to a back room for an examination with an interpreter, who told them the boy had been raped by a man identified as Afghani Police commander Abdul Rahman. Rahman allegedly beat the boy's mother for reporting the crime after learning that they went to the Army outpost. This led Martland and team leader Daniel Quinn to confront Rahman.

Listen, normally I would never dream of bringing this up. If Mean Little Mayor Pete believed in lowering taxes, killing terrorists, securing the border, and protecting religious freedoms, I would vote for him if he were married to six bikers, a bottle of tequila, and a moon rock. Honestly, I could not care less… But I do care when someone lies about the Faith, when a hypocritical and self-righteous snake oil salesman twists and weaponizes the Faith into something unrecognizable as a means to become The Most Powerful Man In The World.
Despite affirming his support for the #MeToo movement, Allen has previously expressed concern that such a climate could lead to a witch hunt against innocent men.
The attack was condemned in the strongest terms by the Chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association, Wilson Chowdhry, who called on the country's politicians to do more to protect the Christian minority:
The Met will continue to work with partners, including The Salvation Army, to combat human trafficking and modern slavery in order to safeguard those who are most vulnerable.

Faithful America cited Graham's social media post that said he tends to believe there was fraud in the 2020 election and also his comments on Republicans that voted for Trump to be impeached a second time.
At that time, no one had a recorder to take down his words, the Jesuit superior responded. What is known is that the words of Jesus must be contextualized, they are expressed in a language, in a specific setting, they are addressed to someone in particular.
In 2005, at age 79, she appeared in a new comedy, Leading Ladies, at Ford's Theater in Washington.
Conscience is not the last word in a number of ways, the cardinal said, adding that it must be formed according to revealed teaching and the moral law. Quoting Blessed John Henry Newman's writings on conscience, Pell said that many have embraced a miserable counterfeit of conscience, which Newman understood as nothing more than the right of self-will.

Bannon also asked if this old-fashioned marriage [between Nancy and Ronald Reagan], even though he was divorced, is it something that the first couple can have, does the new First Lady have to be too policy oriented or do you think they could actually have this throw-back marriage?
According to Teen Vogue, several beauty influencers, including Jackie Aina, responded to these posts with mockery and even a call to defund her.
The fentanyl crisis represents an extraordinary public health challenge — and requires an extraordinary public health response, the experts wrote [in March 2016] to six administration officials, including the nation's drug czar and the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The administration considered the request but did not act on it. The decision was one in a series of missed opportunities, oversights and half-measures by federal officials who failed to grasp how quickly fentanyl was creating another — and far more fatal — wave of the opioid epidemic. … On Jan. 11, 2017, in the waning days of the administration, Obama delivered his annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. Four years after the epidemic began in Rhode Island, the White House called fentanyl a national crisis.

Both groups said that, by inviting FRC and Focus on the Family to the Father's Day event, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was revealing herself as espousing anti-LGBT sentiment.
In the end, what Donohue objects to is not Buttigieg's belief that gay rights should always trump religious freedom. What he objects to is the hypocrisy of trying to pass off that agenda as somehow consistent with Christianity.
It is very sad that blasphemy continues to be used as an easy tool to settle personal scores and grudges against Christians and other religious minorities, said Nasir Saeed, U.K. director of the Centre for Legal Aid, Assistance and Settlement (CLAAS-UK), following the recent arrest of three young Pakistani Christians on blasphemy charges. Unfortunately, Pakistani society has become more intolerant than ever before.
It is mere hypocrisy to condemn the abuse and claim to sympathize with the victims without facing up to this fact honestly. A spiritual revitalization of the clergy is necessary, but it will be ultimately ineffectual if it does not address this problem, the archbishop stated.
The gender pay gap is largely the result of women's choice to have children, writes Claire Cain Miller in a recent column for The New York Times.

Again, the Global Times did not explicitly link this measure to China's shrinking birth rate, but Zhang told the outlet, this feminization reflects a sense of escape and the timidity of some young people who fear normal marriage and love, leading to abnormal values placed on love and marriage, and this will eventually cause a decline in the birth rate.
Right as mass begins I see a huge shadow in my right peripheral vision and hear a decently loud creak from probably a big man. I double took to see… it was KOBE BRYANT IN THE SAME PEW AS ME ON THE OTHER END! Ballestro wrote. As we went up to communion, he waited for me to go. If you grew up in the Catholic Church, you understand this is a respectful thing men do in church as a sign of respect to women. He said I have a beautiful voice. I said thank you and went up to communion.
Discussion of the code of conduct continues as the next public comment phase on its enforcement started in January. Members of Foundation-owned sites have responded with a mixture of hostility and caution regarding the code of conduct and the prospect of more Foundation intervention in the largely self-governing communities, such as the intrusions that prompted a Wikipedia editor revolt in 2019.

The asylum seekers involved were aged between 22 and 48 years old and are mostly all related by marriage or blood. Only one of them, a 27-year-old, gave a comprehensive confession to the rape and received a 10-year sentence. The youngest member of the group, a 22-year-old, received the lightest sentence at nine years.
Any form of sexual intercourse is going to bring shame on your family. Even rape, Hannah explained.
They were very, very much aware of the importance of symbolism. I think it was helped shaped a little bit by their years, not just in Hollywood, but eight years as Governor of California, Brokaw added.
He also read statements that Prager had made that he considered offensive, such as describing leftism as a terminal cancer in the American bloodstream and soul. Apter said that rhetoric sent chills down his spine, and that it evoked calls for extermination.

Haridas told police she was tortured by Hindu fundamentalists to take her away from her marriage with a Christian, Rinto Issac. When I objected and tried to escape from the illegal confinement, they tortured me, she said.
In 2011, Bryant's wife Vanessa filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Yet those differences were reconciled, thirteen months later. They remain a married couple. I'm not going to say our marriage is perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, Kobe says. We still fight, just like every married couple. But you know, my reputation as an athlete is that I'm extremely determined, and that I will work my ass off. How could I do that in my professional life if I wasn't like that in my personal life, when it affects my kids? It wouldn't make any sense.

It may have been the case that Meghan privately believed that under the staid exterior, curly sandwiches, and luke-warm tea the British people were actually mega-woke and just praying that some forward-thinking Royal would finally bring up their children as gender-neutral.
Yet the EU's Fundamental Rights Colloquium was soon reformatted, and became primarily focussed on combatting 'Islamophobia' and curtailing online free speech instead.
Prince Harry and Princess Meghan astounded the world — and the Royal family, apparently — when they announced they were giving up on their senior royal duties and decamping to Canada. In fact, Meghan has gone already — appearing to leave Harry to pick up the pieces at home.

Liberation theology has been generally understood to be a marriage of Marxism and Christianity, Pacepa said. What has not been understood is that it was not the product of Christians who pursued Communism, but of Communists who pursued Christians.
Wenzel chatted about pick-up lines, paying compliments and original ideas for first dates. Impress and entertain the girls, Wenzel advised. Invite them to the theater, rock climbing, a concert, or take them on a trip to London or Amsterdam. That last piece of advice would probably work better for Wenzel's regular clientele of rich Germans; asylum seekers aren't allowed to leave the city they're registered in, and don't have the money to travel in any case.
GORSUCH: Because the first I heard of this was the night before my confirmation hearing. I've been teaching legal ethics at the University of Colorado for seven or eight years. It's been a great honor and a pleasure.
Still, the young man seemed determined not to pursue conventional Hollywood stardom. After an extensive screen test, he turned down the chance to play the title role in director David Lean's epic Lawrence of Arabia, clearing the way for fellow RADA graduate Peter O'Toole to take what became a career-defining role.
Al-Haddad had spoke about non-Muslims being thrown into the fiery pits of hell at an IslamHood lecture in 2014 and is known to have expressed approval of child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), and the stoning to death of adulterers.
Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person's attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey's desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her. It broke Jill, who was just starting to get her life back on track. What makes Rose's inaccurate accusations and insinuations against Jill ironic was that she was the first person who stood up on Rose's behalf, and alerted her bosses to the horrific experience which Rose suffered. Twenty years ago, as a very junior person in a management company hierarchy, Jill exhibited her integrity in doing the right thing — she raised the red flag with the heads of her firm. In the face of inappropriate behavior, Jill handled the situation appropriately.

The entry of same sex couples or transgendered persons as parents would be contrary to the aforementioned canon and the teaching of Our Lord and of the Church on marriage as God desires it as the union between a man and a woman. If one of the partners is the natural father or mother of the child, it must be mentioned on the record, the other partner cannot be entered.

Rasky's initial decision to form Unite the Country was controversial because of his relationship with the government of Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic. In April 2019, the same month that Biden launched his presidential campaign, Rasky registered as a foreign agent to lobby on Azerbaijan's behalf. Officially, Rasky was to be paid $15,000-per-month for his services, according to documents filed with the Department of Justice (DOJ).
Accompanying this text are figures showing a majority (54 per cent) said they felt pride in their nation's vote to allow same-sex marriage, but only 53 per cent of respondents were either neutral to or disagreed with the statement We are losing Irish identity in face of foreign national influx.
At the other end of the scale, British people seem less accepting of the prospect of a gay Royal wedding. While those fine with the idea are fractionally ahead at 44 per cent, those saying it would not be acceptable stand at 41 per cent, a figure that Pink News has called shocking. Some 15 per cent didn't know either way.
What made it unthinkable was that all the experts had lined up to tell us it was. First came President Obama warning us that we'd be banished like naughty boys to the back of something called the queue; then came all the other bigwigs from the IMF's Christine Lagarde and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, all variously confirming with the expertise and authority of their office that no actually it would be worse than that: markets would crash, property prices would plummet, businesses would hurry to relocate, the pound would become as worthless as the Zimbabwean dollar, men would say openly that Christ and his saints slept etc. Oh, and also, of course, World War III would break out.

It has often been suggested that this is because it is difficult to secure convictions without the testimony of the victims, who are often reluctant to speak against the perpetrators — usually African-background parents — but this is contradicted by the record of the French authorities, who face a similar phenomenon but have mounted hundreds of successful prosecutions.
I think Han can change the situation for Taiwan and I believe his promises that he can improve the economy and make people rich.

The lawsuit filed against three Texas officials is Mark Christopher Sevier's third attempt to question the U.S. Supreme Court case legalizing same-sex marriage.
Except for the racist white people, everyone is so gosh-darned earnest and virtuous, including everyone on death row. No joke: according to Just Mercy, everyone on death row is noble and decent, and either completely innocent or noble and decent enough to admit their guilt. There's not a single death row inmate who acts like a real person, much less a criminal or murderer. They're all Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption: Clean prison cells. Pure minds.

Durbin's pitch also includes elements of Italian-style left-wing corporate fascism, which also wanted to classify and organize politics around fixed groups of people, such as business leaders, industrial workers or farmers, Fonte said. Under the rule of government-imposed diversity, people are just clients of the administrative state, not citizens of their country, he said.

The truth (which is available with a few keystrokes to anyone with integrity) is that Guilfoyle is an opinion pundit for Fox News. Also, her relationship with Don Jr. is not a secret. Therefore there is no conflict of interest, there is no reporting, there are no ethical issues.
The GOP leadership stayed out of view. GOP Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, for example, did not speak against the legislation — even though it would make it legally risky for parents or doctors to question a child's claim to have an opposite-sex gender identity or deny an unhappy teenager's demand for risky sex-related medical treatments.
So to be clear, @JoeBiden didn't answer directly why he isn't winning more Hispanic voters and @BernieSanders didn't answer directly why he isn't winning more black voters.

Justice Democrats argued that Democrats need a candidate who will fight racism and inequality with solutions that match the scale of the crises we're facing — not piecemeal compromises with corporate America and the party of Donald Trump.
President Trump has also been a supporter of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group which represents LGBT Republicans, recently issuing an official statement congratulating the group on its 40-year anniversary.
And when he got divorced [from first wife Jane Wyman], it was very hard for him to accept. He kept thinking for awhile that they would get back together again. But Ms. Wyman, whom I didn't know, but I've heard from others who talked to her, just, he was consumed with politics 24-7. He was the head of the Screen Actors Guild for example. He was very liberal, he was very involved in politics, and then he made the transition to becoming the kind of typical conservative of his time. Divorce in those days was almost a lower s scandale. People didn't get divorced. They covered it up. I think he was very conscious of that. He came out of a strong Protestant background in the Midwest. He was part of that culture. His mother was a huge influence on him.
NSPCC Chief Executive Peter Wanless commented: Forcing a child to marry shows a complete lack of regard for their feelings, thoughts or ambitions. We must be clear that, regardless of cultural expectations, this is a crime and an abuse of human rights.

If you want to bleed art into something bland, the fastest route is through ideological conformity. Audiences are pretty smart these days and after two decades of this shit, we're starting to roll our eyes. As tired of these tells as the rest of us, Zahler has chosen instead to be an artist who surprises, who thrills in ways big and small, who zigs where other artists, either out of fear or a lack of imagination, censor themselves.
Of course we're better prepared, replied Prager, describing religious practice as preparation to deal with suffering. Who's better prepared if a ship sinks — people who have been practicing swimming their whole life or people who don't know how to swim? The religious know how to swim when there's bad stuff.
Don't tell them you love them at least for the first three months of your relationship, or they'll run away, he explained patiently. German women don't like clinginess.

[In] 2000, Bernie was in Washington D.C, serving in Congress. Jane and her children a new LLC called Sanders and Driscoll. The new firm was a for-profit consulting company, and was run by Jane, daughter Carina, and son David. The family ran this new business out of the Sanders family home. Because of the way it was structured, it's impossible to know just how much money Bernie's wife and children made from his congressional campaign. But critics would claim that Sanders doled out more than $150,000 to his family through the new company. Jane would even set up a media buying company, meaning that she would get paid every time candidate Bernie Sanders bought television advertising for his Congressional campaigns. Then, during his 2016 presidential run, the Sanders campaign would funnel $82 million dollars through a mysterious media buying company run by Jane's former colleagues. That company, known as Olde Towne Media, was located in private home in a cul de sac in Virginia.
Overnight the age of marriage for girls was reduced from eighteen to nine; it took ten years of effort by women activists to raise it again, but only to thirteen. Women lost the right to seek a divorce and the right to child custody. Family protection courts were dissolved, eventually replaced by civil courts, and women no longer could become judges. Polygamy once again was permissible under the law. … The streets became a sea of black, brown, and navy manteaus (ankle-long coats) and head covers; bright colors were banned.

Prince Harry is — was — really popular with the British people. And little wonder. He was the handsome attack-helicopter pilot who served on the front line with the infantry in Afghanistan prone to occasional silly decisions (extremely questionable fancy dress choices and turning up naked at a pool party, for instance). He was the man who tragically lost his mother at a young age in the public eye and has devoted much of his adult life to charity work.

Intrigued by these many spidery lines of inquiry, Virgil first wrote about the Bezos story on March 10, 2019. In particular, he quoted various media observers who said that one result of Bezos's published escalation was to reposition himself in the public eye. That is, if he was attacking Saudi Arabia and Trump, he was no longer a billionaire who just got caught in the dirty. Instead, his escalation was elevation: elevating himself, that is, so that he was now a champion of the free press, the First Amendment, and the protection of journalists. (In that piece, Virgil couldn't help but notice, also, that Bezos bears a resemblance to Ernst Blofeld, a fictional villain from the James Bond movies.)
The asylum seekers claimed in their defence the 28-year-old woman had given them mixed signals which the prosecutor slammed asking if intoxication meant automatic consent to the men.

That's how we have multinational corporations who have no problem chasing a profit in a repressive, communist dictatorship like China, but they won't do business in the state of North Carolina. It's how Google won't help develop technology for the American military, but they're willing to partner with Chinese spy companies like Huawei.
The bill's authors made clear that gender identity is to take precedence over and replace sex as a protected category. The bill doesn't mention individuals with clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria, or undertaking surgical or hormonal transition, thus making clear that self-declared gender identity would be sufficient to claim protected legal status.
The Jacksonville Jaguars decided take to the streets and launch their own protest against police brutality on Friday, marching from their stadium to the local sheriff's department.
Facebook, Twitter and Google have established a virtual monopoly on social media. In terms of online expression, these outlets are the de facto Internet. Restricting people's access to these platforms based on their political beliefs is a human rights issue. Just as the phone company should not be able to disconnect you because of the content of your conversations, people should not be banned for their ideology, except in extreme circumstances when laws are being broken. We need to rally lawmakers to make holding big tech accountable one of their top priorities. We need to demand Google, Facebook and Twitter adhere to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which dictates they remain non-partisan, or face losing their legal immunity for user content. We need transparency, we need an amnesty on all those who have been unfairly banned by big tech. This is one of the defining issues of our generation and we cannot afford to lose this battle.
High-ranking prelates, especially from opulent nations, are working to bring about changes in Christian morality concerning absolute respect for life from conception to natural death, the problem of the divorced and civilly remarried, and other problematic situations, he said.

We are stunned that this container, which carries the worst homo-trans-phobic and misogynistic thought, is arriving in Italy, the first Western European country to host it. This is an unprecedented, frightening fact that does not bode well for the recognition of human and civil rights, said Arcigay's General Secretary Gabriele Piazzoni.
To provide a taxpayer-funded platform for these organizations is outrageous, the Human Rights Campaign said. Families in this country are increasingly diverse, and include those with same-sex parents, and those led by single parents.
In Janus v. AFSCME, the Court will decide whether to restore First Amendment protections to government-employed union workers who do not want to support leftwing government union political agendas, and in doing so overrule the infamously liberal Abood decision from 1977.
Flake was swift to declare his active resistance to the tariffs:
Anti-heroes have a code and are willing to sacrifice to honor that code. Other than self-interest, Tony has no code. Through and through he is a gangster, adulterer, cold-blooded killer, inveterate liar, unrepentant racist, a bully, master manipulator, abuser of women, and a horrible, horrible father who made his children complicit to his crimes to devastating effect.
The candidate, however, did not explain or address the discrepancy between making everyone feel welcomed and his having worn gay pride clothing sprinkled in rainbow paint coupled with his active participation and promotion in and of gay fun runs.

Iran is one of the world's most repressive nations against its women and girls. The Islamic revolution of 1979 undid decades of progressive laws and policies towards the nation's women that allowed them to work outside the home, maintain public personas, and function largely as equals in society, relative to how many other nations at the time treated women. As Haleh Esfandiari wrote for the Atlantic Council, the regime rapidly went about erasing women from society:
But even so, perhaps the United Kingdom's much-reduced sense of reserve is not easy to acclimatise to if coming from the emotions-trump-facts luvvie world of Hollywood. Nobody expected Meghan Markle to break with Royal protocol in a television interview with British network ITV in 2019 to talk about how hard her life was — not least the interviewer, who appeared genuinely amazed to have his questions answered.
The globalist Davos World Economic Forum begins on Tuesday in Switzerland and for the first time organizers are welcoming young activists to the event, including climate change teen guru Greta Thunberg.
I am and have always been male, he said. That is my biological truth, the only thing capable of grounding me to reality.

If SFAS is correct, and we believe it is, the SFQC is not a place where high attrition rates should occur. Instead, the mission of the SFQC cadre is to train to standards, he said at the time.

However, police discovered a Certificate of Islamic Marriage during their investigation. Magistrate Phillip Goldberg said he it was clear that Omerdic had taken steps to conceal the illegal wedding from the authorities, and he was satisfied the prosecution has proved all elements of the charge.
The left-wing group said they would support Biden if he becomes the nominee but insisted that a centrist like Biden will only divide Democrats. Presumably referencing policies like the Green New Deal that establishment Democrats oppose while using one former President Barack Obama's trademark lines on the stump, Justice Democrats said Biden will turn Democrats into the party of No, we can't.
I mean, why wouldn't God be okay with that? Goldberg asked. It's nowhere in the Bible.
Donohue also suggests that Buttigieg's efforts to trash Vice President Mike Pence are really a ham-fisted attempt to steal the mantle of religion from him, a Herculean task given that Buttigieg opposes religious liberty legislation.
FGM, a practice most popular among certain parts of the Muslim world, had not been well-known before recently in the United States. The practice involves cutting a pre-pubescent girl's genitals in a ritual designed to make her clean before her eventual marriage. There are differing forms of mutilation, some more extreme than others, but all involve the removal of varying amounts of a young girl's clitoris, labia majoria, and labia minora. The most extreme form of FGM is called infibulation, in which virtually all external genitalia is removed and the wound is sewn together, leaving only a single tiny hole from which to urinate and menstruate until the girl is married.
His links to the leftist agenda, however, did not end with same-sex marriage. The so-called Human Rights Campaign, to which Singer continues to cut checks, led boycotts of the entire state of North Carolina when the elected representatives of that state saw fit to pass a law maintaining the separation of bathrooms on sex.
The actor maintained a healthy skepticism about the British establishment and even turned down a knighthood when it was offered, declining to become Sir Albert. Finney once said he didn't believe in such honors.
Schilling warned while the Equality Act sounds virtuous, every member of Congress should recognize that a vote in favor of it is a vote against women, particularly women and girl athletes, as well as a vote against Americans of faith.
Comey's description of events makes clear that he failed to tell the president on multiple occasion that his FBI was already fully aware that the dossier had been paid by Trump's primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

Long before Warren started to hone in on Biden's past corporate alliances, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer first exposed and extensively documented the Biden family's so-called new corruption in his blockbuster best-selling book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.
Martel asserts that 80 percent of Vatican clergy and prelates are gay, many of them actively so, a figure he claims to have arrived at after four years of research in which he interviewed more than 1500 experts and Church insiders — including 41 cardinals — in 30 different countries.
This is a man from very humble origins who became rich when he was very young, said Quentin Falk, author of an unauthorized biography of Finney. It brought him a lot of side benefits. He's a man who likes to live as well as to act. He enjoys his fine wine and cigars. He's his own man. I find that rather admirable.

Unfortunately, this remarkable ability almost always gets in the way of anything approaching rational thought and basic human decency. French is a nasty piece of work, the Frank Burns of the Internet, a sanctimonious tattletale and fool.
Dear Twitter, You recently banned Focus on the Family's The Daily Citizen from your platform for stating a biological fact: A biological male is a male. I stand with Focus on the Family. So, if you are going to ban them, are you going to ban millions of others like me who believe that biology is reality—and that freedom of speech matters in America? If your censorship continues, Twitter will become a stagnant echo chamber. We, the undersigned, are both state and national organizations who represent millions of Americans who all hold to the truth that a person's biological sex cannot be changed. And we will continue to speak this truth freely. You recently locked out Focus on the Family's The Daily Citizen from their Twitter account for speaking this truth. We all stand beside Focus on the Family. So, if you ban them, are we next?
If you want to see a movie for grownups about the death penalty, see Dead Man Walking (1995), which was made by three of the most left-wing people ever: Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, and Sean Penn. Yes, the movie opposes the death penalty but it does so without shying away from the reality that almost all the people on death row are not only guilty as hell, but monsters who committed the most heinous crimes imaginable.
The editorial staff of the left-wing National Catholic Reporter fussed and fumed that Catholic supporters of President Donald Trump have blood on their hands after the violent chaos that erupted at the U.S. Capitol Wednesday.

I knew this stuff happened when my mom was a young practicing lawyer, graduating law school in the 1960s'. At age 20, she had to wait for a year to take the bar. I knew it happened with Justice O'Connor, couldn't get a job as a lawyer when she graduated Stanford Law School and had to work as a secretary. I am shocked it still happens every year that I get women, not men, raising their hand to that question. Thank you for the opportunity to clarify that Senator.
Earlier last year, Francis published a lengthy teaching text on marriage and the family called The Joy of Love (Amoris Laetitia), in which he underscored the unique value of both motherhood and fatherhood, while denouncing the legal deconstruction of the family through the acceptance of same-sex marriage.

The plaintiff in the suit is a U.S. citizen and Illinois resident identified as John Doe, who was not eligible for a relief check because he files with his immigrant spouse, who has an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.

When the Court issued its ruling, the four dissenting justices foresaw that the decision would be used as a stick with which to beat those who uphold traditional marriage, and their predictions have already come true.
The sports world in Australia is still roiling after famed Aussie tennis player Margaret Court criticized same-sex marriage. Now, gay tennis player Martina Navratilova is demanding that the City of Melbourne rename its sports arena named after Court.
It is now clear exactly who Court is: an amazing tennis player, and … a homophobe. Her vitriol is not just an opinion. She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too). She is demonizing trans kids and trans adults everywhere, Navratilova added.
Bloomberg's remarks came shortly after a spar with his challenger Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on redlining, in which the senator hinted that the former New York mayor is a racist liar.
The House is expected to vote on the Equality Act, H.R. 5, next week. The legislation, which would rewrite civil rights law to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes, would likely upend the national culture as Americans have known it.

She said she did not want to see her parents go to prison but wanted to send a signal to others in Sweden and across the world that child marriage was not acceptable as a practice. No religion says: Give away your child! she said.
Durin's reference to a 'major federal agency' likely refers to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services which declared February 22 a shift in focus away from serving foreign customers, and dropped the nation of immigrants rhetoric from its mission statement.

Parroting language from the abortion lobby, the nominally Catholic paper describes abortion as merely a women's issue that seemingly has nothing to do with the massacre of unborn children.
The issue with the bloomberg campaign hiring a comedy writer is that he ended up hiring the kind of comedy writer who would go to work for michael bloomberg, wrote Rob Flaherty, former Vice President Joe Biden's digital director:
The Justice Ministry's director-general Emi Palmor, who spearheads the campaign, says she's determined to enforce the law but is trying to do so with input from the community. She said she has spent two years researching the issue and discussing solutions with Bedouin activists.
The right became synonymous with more conservative politics, irrelevant for minorities, he told the BBC. It also became associated with authoritarian, even nostalgic feelings about the dictatorship, like Bolsonaro.

Whenever anyone asks her about her past romances or if she has a husband, she says, 'I've never had one, that's why I'm this age,' said her niece Diana Heaton. She says she has not had the stresses of marriage; it's tongue-in-cheek more than anything. She has always loved her clothes and has always dressed immaculately.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed several bills into law Tuesday, increasing the penalties for female genital mutilation.
I notice that he was not the first black president when Democrats were singing Fleetwood Mac at his inauguration, nor when he was appointing the first woman attorney general or passing welfare reform. Only after Clinton was caught in the most humiliating sex scandal in U.S. history did he suddenly become the first black president. (Which is not true, according to Monica Lewinsky's description of Clinton's private parts.)
What bothers me is that I get linked in with them. People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse and abuse and abuse– and I, who was only accused by one woman in a child custody case which was looked at and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people, he continued.

The chapter details the business deals of Warren's son-in-law, Sushil Tyagi, who is married to her daughter, Amelia. Tyagi was born in India but moved to the United States, where he met Amelia while they were both pursuing MBAs at Wharton Business School.
If this logic is followed, there is only the calculation of advantages and disadvantages, Francis claimed. Choices are not made on the basis of ethical criteria, but by pandering to dominant interests, often cleverly obscured by a humanitarian or ecological veneer.
Counter-extremism think tank Quilliam said at the time: We are aware of several individuals employed by the prison service who have links to extremist groups. Prisons are incubators of extremism. Young men are going in petty criminals and coming out extremists.

When we grew up we came to know that a great injustice had been done to us, exclaimed Abda Khan. Vani is equal to a murder. If we were to marry those boys, it would be the same as killing us.
Leftists like Kimmel are now so blinded by ideology they are not only no longer standing up for artistic freedom, they are revealing a latent homophobia to express their seething anti-Christian bigotry.

In his 2001 song Heart of the City (Ain't No Love), the 49-year-old raps:
Instead of basing favored treatment under the law on a history of brutal and widespread injustice in America, liberals thought it should also be based on other forms of suffering, such as: being a woman, being a Muslim, wanting an abortion, having been born in Mexico, being a smelly homeless person stinking up the public library and — according to Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week — being a gay couple who wants to force a Christian to bake a cake for your wedding.
Biden says people don't want a revolution. He then keeps talking about making people whole so people don't have significant financial disabilities because of the (says sars but means corona) virus.
Numerous Christian churches have been added to the SPLC's list along with racial supremacist groups, under the guise that these religious groups are anti-LGBT. Have these churches ever committed acts of violence against LGBT Americans? No, most simply believe, because of their religious faith, that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Speaking of the likely decision last year, conservative Kirk minister The Rev David Robertson wrote in a blog post: The liberals who reject the Bible as the Word of God are delighted, declaring that this is the Holy Spirit speaking through the Church. Stonewall are delighted. The self-styled 'Equality Network' are delighted. The metro elites are delighted. But many of us who love the Church of Scotland are devastated.
Children who are feeling dysphoric in their gender should see a therapist, she told Breitbart News in an interview. I don't think the point of that therapy should be to confirm that delusion. Transgenderism is a dysphoria.
Delegates to the Illinois GOP convention are retaining a plank in the party's platform that defines marriage to be between a man and a woman.
The couple, who will remain unnamed to protect the identity of the child, pleaded not guilty to procuring FGM, claiming in the trial that their daughter had suffered the injury as a result of falling onto a toy while not wearing a diaper, according to RTE.

In his nine-page dissent, Scalia ripped into the majority opinion, calling it a judicial Putsch that poses a threat to American democracy. He added that a system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.
One such company, Kasoku, based in Tokyo, advertises its apartments as the solution for couples on the brink of separation due to quarantine stress.
Since then a couple of other villages across the country have followed suit. Small but viciously insular, these Buddhist-only outposts serve as microcosms of the festering religious tensions that threaten Myanmar's nascent experiment with democracy.
North Carolina is in the homosexual crosshairs next. That state passed a bill that makes it illegal for biological males to use women's bathrooms unless their birth certificate has been changed. Pressure is mounting.
Reuters reported the village elders decided that the girl would be married to a 14-year-old cousin of her brother's deceased wife, while the brother would pay 150,000 rupees ($1,430) to his dead wife's family.
Judge Williams disagreed, writing that the marriage had been valid but was now void under section 11 of the 1973 Matrimonial Causes Act because it was entered into in disregard of certain requirements as to the formation of marriage. It is therefore a void marriage and the wife is entitled to a decree of nullity.
I believe that Jesus would approve of gay marriage, he said in an interview.
In the forthcoming documentary, Hillary, Clinton recalls how the pressure of being president made him feel like a boxer who had fought 30 rounds and that his fling with Lewinsky was something that will take your mind off it for a while.

We have gotten a nasty preview of it during the Coronavirus epidemic.

Prager took a moment to thank the audience, and to explain how he became interested in classical music and in conducting, which he has done for 25 years. He had chosen Haydn, he said, because the composer was his favorite and because the symphony exemplified the ideal of controlled passion, save in the fourth movement, when Haydn allowed for an explosion of musical emotion.
Religious Freedom is the first freedom, Brownback tweeted after the announcement of his nomination was made. The choice of what you do with your own soul. I am honored to serve such an important cause.

Italian Catholics are in uproar over an invitation to Education Minister Valeria Fedeli—an outspoken LGBT and gender theory advocate—to write the preface for a new book on education attributed to Pope Francis.
Modern gender confusion contradicts the plan of God, Francis said last October, who has entrusted the world and history to the alliance between man and woman.
According to the Japan Times, decreased tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic has left many Airbnb-style rental properties across Japan empty. Several companies have seized the opportunity to market the vacant apartments as short-term sanctuaries for people who need space from their spouses.

Fact: The Equality Act's politicization of medicine and education through gender ideology will undermine parental rights. Since most schools will be pressured to comply with sexual-orientation and gender-identity policies, parents will have limited educational choices for their children. Those who do not believe that their daughters should have to compete against biological males in sports …

Proposal No. 87 of the presidential candidate's programme for France promises to repeal gay marriage without cancelling same-sex unions which have already taken place.
In fact, it is the American mainstream media which made such a meal out of ethnicity, not the British. And yet North America is where the couple is heading.
While the Equality Act is being sold on promising good things for women, and on ending unfair treatment of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people—which almost everyone agrees are worthy and important goals—it's poisoned with the destruction of the law's ability to allow any accommodations for women on the basis of sex.
The UK's Methodist Church joins its U.S. cousins in the United Methodist Church which also allowed transgender Rev. David Weekley and the non-binary transgender Deacon M. Barclay to lead congregations as clergy.
Why have we said that? Why are we opposed to judging people on the basis of their race? Not simply because we were taught to oppose doing that though we were, but because it's immoral, and it's immoral because we believe in God. That's the real answer.
Mautone, the outlet said, went as far as praising Springsteen's driving record. He says he has two violations, one use of a handheld device, the outlet reported.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the practice of FGM is seen by some Muslim sects in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East as a religious ritual and involves cutting or removing parts of female genitalia. Often, the rationale among these sects is to make women discouraged from having sex outside of marriage.
Several Twitter users made note of the proposal.

In November, they were notified that Sonntag had decided to drop their Article 15s. They were then both sent a General Order Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) — a letter of reprimand from a commander that requires zero evidence. GOMORs either stay on one's record temporarily or permanently, and if permanent, can hurt a soldier's ability to be promoted and stay in the military.
In 2014, when the United Nations Human Rights Council published its routine report on human rights in the country, it found growing repression of women: proposed laws to ban women from working in public locations like coffee shops and the cancellation of artistic performances after the government became aware women were involved.
[For] Special Forces specifically, we are gonna have the biggest deficit of eligible… population, to select from, he said on The Joe Rogan Experience on May 17.

But Raskin took this sham to a new low of unconstitutionality when he argued that there is no First Amendment defense against impeachment. Actually, the Constitution is a 100 percent defense against impeachment. That goes to the heart of what impeachment is about.

Breitbart News has covered other complaints raised by Google staff — such as when employees had a meltdown over the use of the word family during a discussion about a Google product aimed at children. Breitbart News also reported in December of 2018 that internal emails appeared to show Google targeting Breitbart News' advertising revenue specifically. A Google spokesperson later claimed that despite the internal discussion, no modifications were made to Google search results for political purposes.

It's not just the children who suffer from the demise of traditional families and the loss of good parenting skills. The parents find themselves hitting middle age without the financial, social, and emotional resources of an intact family—without children to give them purpose as they begin productive adult lives, without grown sons and daughters to help them as they get older, without financial assets accumulating from one generation to the next.
Philip later joined the Royal Navy as an officer cadet in 1939 and enjoyed a varied career during the Second World War, serving in several roles including the first lieutenant of a destroyer.

A.J. Soprano (Robert Iler) will never follow in his father's footsteps as a gangster. That would require two things he does not possess: physical courage and a work ethic.

We thought about how to announce our two miracles to the world. Everything we could think of fell short of doing them justice. Doing ourselves justice, for every trial and tribulation we have been through these past years. Taking out these needles by the handful to take this photograph was… surreal. Half way through my hands started to quiver, my breath got short, and I had to stop. I sat down, looked at it and started to cry. Not because I was sad about what it took to get here, but because it was a representation of my world, our world, for the past over two and a half years staring back at me. There was a lot of pain, hope, and fear behind each of these needles. Each one representes [sic] a different day, a different path, a different emotion. It's a lot to take in. After a good cry, the more I looked at it, the more the needles started to blur together. Now all I see are these tiny onesies that so perfectly sum up our journey: Worth the wait. And wait, and wait, and wait.

The action is set in the fictional rural Idaho town of Green Hills, whose inhabitants are portrayed, for the most part, as ordinary, decent, and tolerant people — if a bit boring. The fact that the hero happens to have an interracial marriage, with veterinarian Dr. Maddie Wachowski (Tika Sumpter), plays no role at all, except — possibly — for Dr. Sumpter's urbane sister, who disapproves of the marriage for reasons that are never quite made clear. But the town simply overlooks race.

A Texas Supreme Court Justice has issued a dissenting opinion stating that while the U.S. Supreme Court has declared that same-sex couples may marry, the U.S. Constitution does not necessarily require cities to offer benefits to same-sex spouses of employees.

And when he got divorced [from first wife Jane Wyman], it was very hard for him to accept. He kept thinking for awhile that they would get back together again. But Ms. Wyman, whom I didn't know, but I've heard from others who talked to her, just, he was consumed with politics 24-7. He was the head of the Screen Actors Guild for example. He was very liberal, he was very involved in politics, and then he made the transition to becoming the kind of typical conservative of his time. Divorce in those days was almost a lower s scandale. People didn't get divorced. They covered it up. I think he was very conscious of that. He came out of a strong Protestant background in the Midwest. He was part of that culture. His mother was a huge influence on him.

Death at any age is devastating for those left behind, but premature death is especially so, in particular for children and parents, said senior study author Amy Berrington of the National Cancer Institute in a press release. The study, which analyzed death certificate data ranging from 1999 to 2014, found that mortality rates for 30-year-old white women rose up to 2.3% per year over that time period; those for 30-year-old white men rose .6% per year; annual rates for 30-year-old Native Americans rose 4.3%; and rates for 30-year-old Alaska Natives rose 1.9% per year. For white Americans, that represents a reversal, but the authors write that premature death rates for middle-aged American Indians and Alaska Natives have risen for every birth cohort since 1948. The researchers write that these sorts of increases are extremely unusual in high-income countries. They say increases this high are on par with premature mortality spikes at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the US (mid-80s to mid-90s) or in Russia in the post-economic crisis late-1990s.

I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith, but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God.

I don't think the timing of this is coincidental. After the massive pushback we've seen against the radical Democrat abortion campaigns in places like New York and Virginia, and the attempted censoring of the Unplanned movie recently (Twitter account suspended, advertisements blacklisted), it seems there's a method here, he continued. With abortion being such an active conversation right now, you'd think the social media companies would be on high-alert to NOT be censoring legitimate viewpoints.

Durbin's 1965 reference is to the 1965 immigration law which dramatically expanded the inflow of non-European migrants to the United States. Durbin seems to argue that the 1965 law is a permanent, unreformable, unchangeable birthright that must determine the future identity of the United States, or as he described it earlier, to deny our birthright as a nation is to really defy who we are, what we are and what we will be.

Let me also say since I have the floor for a second that I really am surprised that all of my fellow contestants up here, I guess would be the right word for it, given nobody pays attention to the clock.

Her job waiting tables at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort had sustained her through the painful end of her marriage and the struggles of being a single parent to two teenage girls, one of whom is autistic and struggles with basic motor skills and speaking. Throughout the summer and fall as lawmakers were fighting over an economic relief bill and the number of coronavirus cases was climbing, Flaviana was scouring the Disney fan blogs for glimmers of hope that the tourists might be returning. But the once famously long lines at Disney World remained short even as Orlando's free food lines, packed with laid-off hotel and theme park workers, grew longer. All the while Flaviana's unemployment checks shrank from more than $800 a week in July to $247 a week in October, which didn't even cover her rent. … The hardest parts for Flaviana were accepting the reality that her Disney job was gone; that the modest middle-class life that she had built was no longer sustainable; that she wouldn't be able to provide Victoria, a bright and imaginative teenager whose autism made everyday tasks difficult, with the classes and therapists that enabled her to learn and share her thoughts and feelings. … As Trump's prospects dimmed in the days after Election Day, Flaviana held on to the faint chance that he might somehow prevail. Her hopes were dashed on Nov. 7 when she glanced at her phone and saw the election was being called for Biden.

The State uses those certificates to give married parents a form of legal recognition that is not available to unmarried parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not, consistent with Obergefell, deny married same-sex couples that recognition.
In September, New York Times columnist Thomas B. Edsall warned black voters should not be taken for granted.
The plaintiff in the suit is a U.S. citizen and Illinois resident identified as John Doe, who was not eligible for a relief check because he files with his immigrant spouse, who has an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. He contends that this rule, preventing him and his family from receiving relief, is discriminating against U.S. citizens based solely on whom he chose to marry.
They were basically telling us to not uphold standards, said Robertson. The reason they were doing that is because they were trying to make quota…In Special Forces you don't sacrifice quality for quantity.
That the likes of Trevor Phillips are still so wilfully ignorant, of those facets of sharia law, and the Quran, actively prohibit Muslims from emulating or even befriending non-Muslims (Q3:28), goes a long way to explaining Europe's integration crisis.
Bloomberg's remarks came shortly after a spar with his challenger Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on redlining, in which the senator hinted that the former New York mayor is a racist liar.
She expressed this view one day at the Heritage Foundation's showing of Reagan, a documentary on the president released in 2011. There's a section at the end of the movie, Whittlesey points out, which purports to show why Reagan would've supported the Iraq War. After the viewing, Whittlesey stood up. She said, I had the privilege of working with Reagan for eight years, and I think differently. I don't think Reagan would've supported these wars.

The numbers for Alice were a little better overseas, where it topped the international box office with an estimated $65 million to bring its total overseas take to $99.1 million. But any way the numbers are cut, the film is a huge bust for Disney, which has otherwise enjoyed a strong year.
Her own life was marked by tragedy, Rae told the AP in a 2015 interview. She said the most devastating thing she faced was her son Andy Strauss' diagnosis of autism at a time when there was far less understanding of or attention to the disorder. Andy died in his mid-40s of a heart attack in 1999.

The terrorist-designated group CAIR launched a counter-protest opposing the March against the inhumane practices of Sharia law. Consider this: while so many patriots were marching in opposition to practices such as female genital mutilation, honor killings, and the stoning of homosexuals, CAIR and their ANTIFA thugs were marching to silence them.

Human reality is much more nuanced and never black and white, said Abascal, who was elected superior of the Society of Jesus in October.
I don't know whether it was the snide-ness of this comment or its absoluteness that triggered me, but it seemed so pig-headedly self-righteous, so oblivious of the complexities of human character, not to mention the nuclear dimensions of the left's war against Trump, that I responded, and in doing so walked into a hornets' nest.
The NPC, scheduled to meet on Friday, will also look at what the South China Morning Post called legislation for a new national security law tailor-made for Hong Kong that will proscribe secessionist and subversive activity, foreign interference and terrorism. Reports indicate the law is intended to expand the definition of secession to make it more difficult for pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters to legally participate in peaceful protests against the Communist Party.

The fourth and final pillar Rubio listed was the belief that doing all of this is worth it because America is a special country. And that this does not mean forgetting sins of the past, but remembering that America has overcome them: the end of slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights, end of segregation, a number of social causes.
And then, after his hate, bigotry, and lies earned him enough attention from a media that thrive on such things, the Mean Little Mayor morphed into one of the biggest presidential phonies ever.

After ten years, nearly one-third of college graduates wind up in a job that does not require a college degree, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Obergefell concerned access to marriage, not an Equal Protection challenge to the allocation of employment benefits. The court of appeals apparently assumed that, if the Supreme Court concluded no government interest justifies recognizing marriage as only between couples of the opposite sex, then no interest justifies offering different benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex spouses of City employees. But, as discussed below, marriage—not spousal employment benefits—is a fundamental right, and laws limiting access to a fundamental right receive stricter scrutiny than laws distributing government benefits. As the majority in Obergefell recognized, 'the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change' when fundamental rights are not at stake.
The left-wing documentary filmmaker praised the 16-year-old climate activist in a series of tweets, saying adults should feel shame for allowing her to show us the way to deal with climate change.

And almost certainly, there will be calls for Mother Teresa to be canonized a saint. Mother herself always rejected such talk.

The old guard of the Democratic Party failed to stop Trump, and they can't be counted on to lead the fight against his divide-and-conquer politics today. The party needs new leadership with a bold vision capable of energizing voters in the Democratic base who stayed home in 2016. — Justice Democrats (@justicedems) April 25, 2019
In 2011, post-graduate voters split their vote 46 percent Democratic to 33 percent Republican. In 2017, that split widened to 53 percent versus 26 percent after non-college voters showed that they strongly backed Donald Trump in 2016. That switch shows blue-collar voters were turning away from the Democrats' elite-boosting policies of imposed civic variety — or diversity — plus cheap blue-collar labor via immigration, favoritism for sexual minorities, funding for urban growth, and deference to unelected international government.
Observing marriage trends in France over recent decades, the statistics bureau pointed out that while unions between French nationals and Italians or Spaniards accounted for 31 per cent of mixed marriages in 1977, this had dipped to just 4 per cent by 2015.
Any attempt by a medical professional to encourage a child to identify with their birth sex would be deemed illegal. The long-term result of this, combined with aggressive state statutes, is pretty frightening: parents with kids suffering from gender dysphoria will be forced to provide them with puberty blockers, hormone treatments, and ultimately sex changes, lest they violate the law.
In April 2014, CNN published a story about a father who sold his six-year-old daughter into marriage to pay off a debt. With help from U.S. lawyer Kimberley Motley, the father paid off his debt and rescued his daughter.

In rending their garments over the bishops' supposed capitulation to political expediency for the sake of advancing their moral agenda, the NCR editors may wish to take a long, hard look at themselves.

A wedding cake, even one without an inscription, is an artistic expression by the person making it, Kern County Superior Court Judge David Lampe said Monday in a ruling denying a state agency's request to require the bakery owner, Cathy Miller, to comply with California's antidiscrimination law. The state asks this court to compel Miller against her will and religion to allow her artistic expression in celebration of marriage to be co-opted to promote the message desired by same-sex marital partners, Lampe said. The right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment outweighs the state's interest in ensuring a freely accessible marketplace. … Cathy would never discriminate against anyone who walks through her bakery's doors, said Charles LiMandri of the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund, a religious conservative nonprofit. She will gladly serve anyone, including same-sex couples. But Cathy will not use her artistic talents to express messages that conflict with her sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage.

Communist dictatorships have traditionally abused the rights of their LGBT citizens, placing them in labor camps or executing them for their counter-revolutionary behavior.

China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but instances of conversion therapy abuses persisted.
The development will have wide social and economic implications. For instance, if the country's labor productivity has not reached a certain level, the decrease in working-age population means the decline of national wealth, China Daily noted.

Elsewhere in Eberstadt's article, he looks at the failure of the Obama economy to provide opportunities for advancement – which in turn was the acceleration of job-market trends that date back to the end of the dot-com boom in the Nineties – and the calcification of both social and physical mobility.

So I don't believe any of that stuff. At the highest level, I had to get out of Greenpeace at that point because my fellow directors were all pushing this narrative about humans being the enemies of the Earth. It's way too much like Original Sin for me, where all the other life is good and only the humans are bad, and I just do not buy that. We're from nature, just like all the other species are, and humans are mostly good. A few bad people make a big difference, it's true, but people are mostly good and mostly try to be good. So I didn't buy that.

[Diaz is] a flamboyant, cowboy hat-wearing New York City councilman who immediately distinguished his views when he announced his run in 2019, saying I am the opposite of AOC in the South Bronx. And that has national Democrats, opponents and progressives like Planned Parenthood and LGBT groups in a panic because the 77-year-old minister has a history of making inflammatory statements about homosexuals and strongly opposes abortion because of his religious beliefs. He would instantly become Donald Trump's favorite New York congressman, strategist Eric Koch of anti-Diaz super PAC Bronx United told Newsweek, adding that Diaz Sr. would be an unreliable Democratic vote in the House caucus.

I think in any situation where anyone is accused of something unjustly, this is a sad thing, Allen said. I think everybody would agree with that… Everyone wants justice to be done. If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that's a good thing.

Gutierrez blasted Democrats for acquiescing to a three-week spending bill in exchange for a DACA vote, adding that he did not see how a vague promise from the Senate Majority Leader about a vague policy to be voted on in the future helps the Dreamers or maximizes leverage the Democrats and American people have over the Republicans right now.

It's funny, the hunting story I think goes to how polarizing he could be. Because if you think of the two, I think, foundational Scalia hunting stories, one is, as you remember, he was out hunting with Dick Cheney while there was a case pending at the court that involved Dick Cheney. And there were calls for his recusal, and it was really, I think, a dramatic example of how he liked to pal around with people who were Washington players. sometimes edging right up against the ethics rule.
Death at any age is devastating for those left behind, but premature death is especially so, in particular for children and parents, said senior study author Amy Berrington of the National Cancer Institute in a press release. The study, which analyzed death certificate data ranging from 1999 to 2014, found that mortality rates for 30-year-old white women rose up to 2.3% per year over that time period; those for 30-year-old white men rose .6% per year; annual rates for 30-year-old Native Americans rose 4.3%; and rates for 30-year-old Alaska Natives rose 1.9% per year. For white Americans, that represents a reversal, but the authors write that premature death rates for middle-aged American Indians and Alaska Natives have risen for every birth cohort since 1948. The researchers write that these sorts of increases are extremely unusual in high-income countries. They say increases this high are on par with premature mortality spikes at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the US (mid-80s to mid-90s) or in Russia in the post-economic crisis late-1990s.

In May, after the general election that saw former governing coalition Barisan Nasional toppled for the first time in its 61-year rule, there was widespread speculation that the palace had delayed Mahathir's swearing in as prime minister. In June, the government and the Agong reached an impasse regarding the appointment of ethnic Indian lawyer Tommy Thomas as attorney general, a position normally reserved for a member of the Malay-Muslim majority race – although the constitution does not specify a specific race, gender or religious requirement for the role. The Agong consented to the appointment after two weeks of the stand-off.

The statute in question establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Obergefell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders.
You can see the problem with this, we definitely can see the problem. This show was not on the air for six months before there was an organized and highly aggressive campaign by prominent Democrats to denounce us as white supremacist.

Making life worse for black people is not a bug in the Democrat Party, it's a feature. As is tyranny. Good grief, what better example of the Democrat tyranny do you need than these anti-science lockdowns? What more proof do you need than Democrat governors and mayors arresting people for going to church just days before they openly encourage and join massive protests?
Yet still, as the founder and chief executive of the world's second-most valuable corporation—who has also spent billions to develop his own private rocket company—Bezos is a movie-worthy figure, and he has had his recent moment of notoriety.

In a separate statement, senior members of the Department of History defended Fulton Brown's right to express herself. The current debate about race and medieval history is playing out, as it should, in the public arena, and it is up to the participants to make their arguments and draw their own conclusions, the statement reads. It is essential to uphold the value of free speech in that context, especially when it is controversial or unpopular.

However, the eight-member GOP vote for the transgender claims counts as a partial success for a series of conservative organizations amid passivity from GOP leaders and GOP donors, and amid hostility from progressives, gay advocacy groups, the established media, and the well-funded transgender advocacy groups. Without the conservative groups, many additional GOP legislators would have gone along with the establishment pressure.

It therefore seems unlikely that a newly established quango, such as extremism commission, will solve such problems. It is not wise to foster a society where volatile public opinion can be used to determine what might be extreme or acceptable views, he said.

What Sheffield seems not to realize is that for many Americans, the choice of being Christian is not just a means to a secular end. Embracing or rejecting faith in God is not the result of a political calculus whose ultimate goal is mirroring societal trends and thus achieving popularity and victory. To let social surveys dictate one's political platform, raising a finger to the wind every time fashions change, is to have the shallowest of views of the meaning of politics.
And the income and employment benefits may overstate the lifetime effects of college degrees. The college wealth premium—the amount of extra wealth college graduates have accumulate the course of their lifetime—has declined even more rapidly than the income and employment premium, according to a recent study by the Federal Reserve.

Men like Archbishop McCarrick and Weinstein think they are entitled to sex. And they both have (or used to have) enough power to take whatever they wanted. The fact that Archbishop McCarrick's preferred sex partners are male and Weinstein's are female should not distract us from this most basic point. Both men live by the Sexual Revolutionary Creed: Sex is a private recreational activity with no moral or social consequences. Everyone is entitled to the sex lives they want, with a minimum of inconvenience. Any sexual activity is morally acceptable, as long as the participants consent. Believing all this is called being sex positive.

I believe that gender identity is a fraud perpetrated by psychiatry, the likes of something the United States and other nations hasn't experienced since the lobotomy era. As a result, I have returned to my male birth sex. On January 25, 2019, in the State of Florida, the Marion County Department of Motor Vehicles in Ocala, Florida issued me a male driver's license. Ocala, Florida has been my home since July 2018. In the days ahead, I will be taking further steps to restore my birth sex to male more formally. In my thirty plus year marriage, I am the husband. To my daughter, I am her Father. I no longer identify as a transgender or non-binary person and renounce all ties to transgenderism. I will not be a party to advancing harmful gender ideologies that are ruining lives, causing deaths and contributing to the sterilization and mutilation of gender-confused children. My history-making and landmark sex change to non-binary was a fraud based on the pseudoscience of gender identity. I am and have always been male. There should be no social or legal penalty for others to state that. In addition to supporting the President's ban on gender dysphoria in the military, I also support President Trump's policy of recognizing and enforcing that there are only two biological sexes, male and female.
In reading this editorial, one gets the sense that the true villain of the 'McCarrick Report' is not the predatory ex-cardinal, but rather Pope John Paul II, Donohue said, adding:

By gutting the Iran nuclear deal — one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran — by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war, Buttigieg stated.

Militants claim they adhere to a very conservative interpretation of Islam, one that allows them to run brothels and keep sex slaves. They allow women from the West to perform sexual jihad for the terrorists. A 2013 edict allows this behavior to boost the morale of fighters. Islamic State issued its own edict in June after conquering towns in Iraq. Jihadists set up brothels filled with kidnapped females and placed British women in charge. One Yazidi sex slave begged the West to bomb the brothel at which she was held to end her suffering. A video in November showed militants laughing and joking about buying female Yazidi slaves.

Is this real life? First, Cuba does not have the highest literacy rate. Second, don't be surprised if the same people who report Cuba's admittedly high literacy rate are related to those who report its election results — the ones in which the Castros get 100 percent of the votes. Third, could it be Cuba doesn't have to invest a lot in its prison system because, you know, dungeons and firing squads (El Paredon) are not too expensive to maintain?

I know it's been that way for 7,000 years, but we know best for what's everybody.'

In his 27-page dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts lamented the Court's usurpation of democratic process by legislating its own view of marriage.

The WSJ survey does not explore the political gap between the pro-immigration professional class and the GOP-aligned business class, which is quietly using free trade, globalization, and immigration to cut the salaries paid to the Democrats' pro-diversity college graduates. However, since President Donald Trump was elected by populist voters in 2016, the Democratic Party's post-graduate class has moved towards a tacit political alliance with Wall Street.

So at least for now, maybe we're back to square one on this story—which is to say, the basic facts as they could be known back in January 2019. That is, Bezos did things he shouldn't have done; his actions were harmful to his personal dignity and professional reputation. Moreover, his deeds cost him his marriage and that $35-billion divorce settlement. And yes, perhaps Amazon's suitability for sensitive government contracts–especially contracts involving the CIA and similar institutions—might need to be examined.

If Buttigieg counters with a campaign for a path to citizenship for most here, but also in favor of mandatory e-verify (a completely humane way to enforce immigration law in the interior of the country via employment), he'd break out of the pack.

You could make similar arguments for public officials who exercise their Second Amendment right to bear arms, or their Fourteenth Amendment rights to travel to another state (like, for example, Florida – which seems to be controversial these days). There could be legal arguments made against those officials, who could assert those constitutional rights as protecting their actions. But if the First Amendment is not a defense against impeachment, neither is it a defense of the rights guaranteed by another constitutional amendment.

Human rights lawyer Reda el-Danbouki said the law only criminalizes FGM in cases where there is no medical justification.
In what amounted to a brief history lesson, Scalia underscored the gravity of the Court's action by comparing it to England's treatment of the American colonies that ignited the movement for American independence. The justice said that in its hubris, the majority decision had carried out a more serious offense than the one that sparked the Boston Tea Party and later the American Revolution itself.

When abortion is imposed, especially in developing countries, saying that if they do not accept it, they will receive any more aid, it is violence, he continued.
Those levels are the best for a GOP president or presidential candidate since 1968, the report noted.
No social significance for once, he said. No contemporary problems to lay bare. Just a lot of colorful, sexy fun.
Mitt Romney has reportedly been calling members of the Big 12 to tout his alma mater, Brigham Young University (BYU), and to push its inclusion as a possible expansion team, according to a report in the Austin American-Statesman.
The term 'honour' disguises the horror of the violence that is inflicted and can be used by the perpetrator as an excuse to intimidate the prosecutor, she added.
The report, Tulsi Gabbard once touted working for anti-gay group that backed conversion therapy, accuses her of anti-gay stances (original link):
Houston's Texas Southern University (TSU) told media outlets on Friday that the senior senator from Texas would no longer be speaking at the university's ceremony on Saturday.
However, Trump has stayed out of debates over same-sex marriage and has promoted gay officials, such as Grenell, who share his broader agenda.
Panelists included: The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, Town Hall's Guy Benson, Cato Institute's Ilya Shapiro and The Heritage Foundation's Ryan Anderson.
The bill is part of broader French efforts to fight extremism in recent years that gained new urgency after a teacher was beheaded in October and other attacks. President Emmanuel Macron says the efforts are also needed to protect French values like gender equality and secularism from encroaching fundamentalism in some communities.
The NPC is the National People's Congress, the body that convenes the second of the two sessions.
So why can't the biggest pro-life organizations join these religious leaders in condemning the administration's treatment of children? he asked disapprovingly. Where is National Right to Life? Where is the Susan B. Anthony List?
I ended up talking to her and said that from a young age my cousins were blackmailing me'… but she listened to what had happened and [said] 'It wasn't blackmail, it was sexual abuse, she said.
The entire government-funded sequence is a grim update of Timothy Leary's infamous 1966 advice for the counter-culture: turn off, tune out, drop in, and then die off.
The door has really opened now for all kinds of individuals to start their own family. Same-sex adoptions are at a record high, and it may be that the legalisation of gay marriage in 2013 has been a catalyst for more same sex couples to adopt, declared Wilsons associate lawyer Sarah Wood-Heath, who added that medical breakthroughs could be the reason for a decline in adoption applications from heterosexuals.
In [the video that is still up] he speaks about a system of tricks and lies, and says that Hollywood's Jews have forced aspiring actors into anal sex to get parts, and that former president Barack Obama was under under Jewish influence when he advocated for same-sex marriage, which Farrakhan deemed Satanic. I wonder, will you recognize Satan? I wonder if you will see the satanic Jew and the synagogue of Satan… because Satan has deceived the whole world, he said to the crowd he was addressing as they agreed and applauded. Think about the message that I was blessed by God to give you today. Think about what they [the Jews] are going to say when they have been completely and thoroughly unmasked. Whenever you read that God has told the Jews to hear and obey and they say 'I hear and I disobey,' that's Satan… [the Jews] are openly disobeying God. He [The Jews] will take down the whole world with him.
Thabet left her native Yemen in the wake of armed conflict between the government, Houthis rebels, and terrorist groups– including the local affiliate of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), or Ansar al Sharia.
Our endorsement is not animated by hostility to either Donald Trump or Governor Kasich, both of whom are running well ahead of Mr. Cruz in the polls in New York. All three are better on key issues than either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders. We like Mr. Trump's willingness to re-think the United Nations. We're not against better trade deals. We are against a retreat from NATO, and Mr. Trump has been too xenophobic in his use of language in respect of religion and the immigration issue. Mr. Cruz, a former solicitor general of the border state of Texas, has been more sage.
Durbin's Nation of Immigrants view also has huge economic implications.
While these figures represent the polling of Britain as a whole, YouGov's polling also broke down the results by age, and by voting preference at the EU Referendum in 2016.
In his failed bid for the Democrat nomination for 2020, Beto O'Rourke said churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status. In other words, toe the non-Biblical party line or else!
Incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) remains heavily favored to win, but Tsai herself advised supporters to come together and never underestimate our rival, meaning Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Han Kuo-yu.
So while the story was often played for laughs—sample headline, Bezos Exposes Pecker—the underlying narrative could be vastly more serious.
In a 1983 New York Times interview, he recalled his early career in small clubs where the show consisted of me — master of ceremonies, comedian and magician — maybe a dog act, and a stripper. It was a piano player in one such club, he said, who suggested replacing Dallas Burrows with some funny name like Roger Duck — or Orson Bean.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of requests by men to bring in child and adolescent brides to live in the United States were approved over the past decade, according to government data obtained by The Associated Press. In one case, a 49-year-old man applied for admission for a 15-year-old girl.
Let me also say since I have the floor for a second that I really am surprised that all of my fellow contestants up here, I guess would be the right word for it, given nobody pays attention to the clock. I'm surprised they showed up, because I would have thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that.
McCaig called herself the Princess of Darkness and it was she eventually cut the cord on Cover Oregon to protect her boss' reelection campaign. McCaig then turned around and directed state officials to sue and blame begin the contractor, Oracle, for the $305 million mess.
GORSUCH: Senator, it sounds like a potential hypothetical case. It might be a case or controversy I might have to decide, and I wouldn't want to pre-judge it sitting here at the confirmation table. I can tell you it would be inappropriate.
When Fedeli was appointed Education Minister last December, the Italian pro-family group Generazione Famiglia called the decision a declaration of war against the traditional family and the right of children to have a mother and a father.
With the presidential election set for next year, polls have for months shown president François Hollande losing to all likely adversaries. According to a 2012 survey of 10,000 voters, 93 per cent of Muslims in France voted for the Socialist Party president, who is the most unpopular head of France in modern history.
Sanders says it is also a time to re-think America and create a country where we care about each other instead of a country of greed and corruption that only benefits the corporate elite.
It is necessary to rediscover the plan drawn up by God for the family, to reiterate its greatness and irreplaceability in the service of life and of society, he continued. In the house of Nazareth, Mary lived the multiplicity of family relations as daughter, betrothed, wife and mother. For this reason every family, in its different members, finds here acceptance and inspiration to live its own identity.
Vani means child marriage, which is common in Pakistan to build and strengthen alliances, settle disputes or pay off debts. Pakistani law does not allow children to marry under the age of 16, but most thwart the law and marry off their children. Police rarely intervene in these family matters.
Back in New York City in 1965, he pursued acting while working at side jobs. I learned first-hand how a truck driver lives, what a bartender does, how a salesman thinks, he told The New York Times in 1989. I had to make a life inside those jobs, not just pretend.

Two years ago, Breitbart News reported Jovan Rendon-Reyes, Saul Rendon-Reyes, Felix Rojas, Odilon Martinez-Rojas and Severiano Martinez-Rojas pled guilty to substantive offenses of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.
The Vatican Congregation responded that beyond the obvious problem with a female wishing to present herself as a godfather, there were other moral issues at play as well, since transsexual behavior publicly reveals an attitude contrary to the moral imperative of resolving the problem of one's sexual identity according to the truth of one's sexuality.
The fact is, being a Royal is a pretty globetrotting job and folk accept that — the British monarchy is also the monarchy for 15 other Commonwealth Realms worldwide including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. Far from hating on the Queen for the flights she makes, Britons really love the modest way she also travels by train a lot, in preference to the private motorcade or helicopter, without feeling the need to lecture everyone about it.
Over a decade later, Iran's women are once again taking the streets. During the protests against the regime on Monday, video surfaced of another woman, whose identity remains unknown, bleeding profusely in the streets of Tehran, apparently from a gunshot wound to the leg.
There also was action this week in the U.S. Supreme Court on a matter that concerns illegal aliens. Last year, we joined with the Allied Educational Foundation (AEF) in the filing of two amici curiae briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of Sue Evenwel, a Texas resident who filed a lawsuit to overturn a Texas malapportionment law (Sue Evenwel, et al. v. Greg Abbott, et al. (No. 14-940)) and (Sue Evenwel, et al. v. Greg Abbott, et al. (No. 14-940)).

The organisation, which was responsible for protests in which hundreds of thousands of people turned out to protest gay marriage in 2013, released a statement describing Macron as an openly anti-family candidate and urging their supporters not to vote for him.
As a result, it is now an offense in Washington State to ask a man in a woman's bathroom if he thinks he is male or female. Similarly, Obama and gay advocacy groups have slammed a popular North Carolina law, dubbed HB2, because it requires people to undergo medical procedures before they can use a bathroom reserved for the opposite sex.
In the wake of this upheaval, two people associated with McGowan and Argento took their own lives. We now know Messick and Bourdain spent years battling with the black pool of depression. This means we cannot know what drove them to end their own lives. Sometimes there is a trigger. Sometimes not.
But while the coronavirus has hit the district hard, it might help Diaz Sr. win given that lockdowns have made all campaigns virtual.

The so-called Equality Act is legislative malpractice that turns equality on its head, said Ryan Anderson, president of Ethics & Public Policy Center (EPPC), in a statement. It isn't drafted as a shield to protect vulnerable minorities from unjust discrimination, but as a sword to persecute those who do not embrace new sexual and gender ideologies.

Unfortunately, as the TOI notes, Pakistan's military has at least as much to say about foreign policy as the prime minister does, and Pakistan's drift into China's orbit could be difficult to reverse even if Khan wants to. The Indian paper suspected Khan will find the Chinese to be an overbearing partner whose pockets are not as deep as they previously led Pakistan to believe.
Philadelphia's actions discriminate against Plaintiffs for their religious beliefs and practices, constitute a breach of contract, unlawfully try to coerce them to speak contrary to their religious beliefs, and restrict Plaintiffs' religious exercise in violation of state law and the Pennsylvania and U.S. Constitutions, the 40-page complaint stated.

Elsewhere in Eberstadt's article, he looks at the failure of the Obama economy to provide opportunities for advancement – which in turn was the acceleration of job-market trends that date back to the end of the dot-com boom in the Nineties – and the calcification of both social and physical mobility. As other sources cited in my previous article argued, the welfare state has largely eliminated the incentives for people to move away from disadvantaged areas.
In late April, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the People's Daily, used the Weibo hashtag Why Aren't You Getting Married? to inquire why young people in China seem to have a distaste for starting families. In addition to couples not having children, statistics show that more and more people are less willing to get married every year, the newspaper reported, according to the site What's on Weibo. The marriage rates for 2018, the site noted, hit a new five-year low. Social stigma surrounding older marriage is also partly to blame, the site stated, citing a survey that found that, despite the stark disparity in male to female population, half of Chinese men think that women who are still single at the age of 25 are 'leftovers,' meaning their single status is attributable to something undesirable about them and thus makes them a poor match.
According to the report, a Putin insider says the relationship between 63-year-old Putin and 47-year old Cheng has become serious.

Like FGM and forced marriage, the third-world practice has been imported to the UK due to mass migration and allowed to exist because politically-correct British institutions fail to robustly challenge harmful aspects of multiculturalism.
Staats, who is identified as a left-wing activist, was said to be in an open marriage, The Telegraph claimed.

Students of poverty often point to the general increase in our material standard of living, coupled with generous welfare assistance, to note that poverty in the 21st Century is often objectively better than middle-class life 75 or 100 years ago. And yet, we have a generation killing itself—often actively killing itself, given the rise in suicide rates. That didn't happen in far more hardscrabble times, although it would be fair to note that lower average life expectancies and more primitive data-gathering methods would have made a mortality spike more difficult to detect, if one did occur.
PARIS (AFP) — Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and right wing leader Marine Le Pen, who go head-to-head in the second round of France's presidential election on May 7, are diametrically opposed on issues ranging from taxes to Europe.

In other words, as a religious charity, while we lawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefs, we do not discriminate in who we serve. We have provided billions of dollars of medical care and supplies, food and water, and emergency shelter without any conditions whatsoever. Our Christian faith compels us—like the biblical Good Samaritan—to love and serve everyone in need, regardless of their faith or background.
If any of these groups had funded and erected their own emergency field hospitals to serve COVID-19 patients in Central Park, Graham added, we would join what we believe would be most New Yorkers—and Americans—in applauding and praying for them, not harassing them.

Sorties in aircraft are an official military statistic. Motor-vehicle trips are so routine no one would bother to keep track, any more than someone would log how many times Pete Buttigieg took a shower. No one cares. So Buttigieg himself created this phony statistic. Picture it: He made himself a little Hero's Log but all he had to put in it was routine trips. It's pathetic. It's hilarious. It's apple-polishing, résumé-buffing, box-checking, attention-seeking vaporware. Just like his whole career. … [Here's] why we are unimpressed with Pete Buttigieg's military career. Three things stand out about his brief sojourn in the Navy: One, he joined via direct commission. This, to most veterans, is a jaw-dropper. To say the least, this isn't the way it's usually done. Many of us recall the intensive pre-commission training (in my case, four years of ROTC in Connecticut and Advanced Camp with the 82nd Airborne in Fort Bragg) as the most trying intervals of our careers. Others spent four years at Annapolis or West Point. Buttigieg just skipped all of that. He passed a physical. He signed some papers. Voilà. To put this in terms a liberal might understand: Imagine you heard that someone got a direct diploma from Harvard but didn't actually have to do four years of papers and tests. You'd never forget it. You'd probably think of that person primarily as a short-cut specialist for the rest of your life.

Listen, I take no pleasure in writing this about Buttigieg, or anyone. If he wasn't running around puffing himself up as the world's greatest Christian; if he wasn't condemning the Christianity of others based on an un-Christian purity test that demands we embrace his homosexuality; if he wasn't blaspheming by blaming God for his sin because God made me this way, I wouldn't say a word about the Mean Little Mayor's private life.

In Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the Supreme Court will decide whether a Christian baker has any First Amendments rights of either free speech or the free exercise of religion to decline to custom-design a cake to celebrate same-sex marriage. It looks likely that the baker will win 5-4 on a narrow ground that will be very significant to people of faith, but not a decisive victory or loss that will resolve all these matters for both sides.

One of the things that infuriates me is this idea that we shouldn't want to eat food that has ingredients we can't pronounce or spell. Have you seen that old Breyers commercial, with the little kids trying to read what's in their ice cream? And the idea is Breyers is better because of how simple the words are. Like the only thing you should ever consume is a thing a child can read. It goes to the chemical fallacy that we shouldn't eat any chemicals at all. Little do they know that they live in a universe made up of chemicals. That is one of those ploys that plays to our intuition. If you look up the chemicals that make up an apple, it can sound pretty scary. There's so many myths that people can leverage. They'll find a substance that is cancer-causing in huge doses and then say you shouldn't be consuming any of it, ever. I find the Honest Jessica Alba thing very frustrating: It's built of guilt, fear, and pseudoscience. I've seen quotes associated with her in which she claims autism and ADHD and childhood cancers are caused by all toxins that exist in this world, toxins that her products don't have. But now she's being sued, so.

We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.

Nonetheless, it is not a crime, and should not be a crime, to be a racist. As ugly and evil as racism is, what you personally believe, what personal opinions you hold, are up to you.

Knowing the main points the Trump team's arguments are about to make to the Senate, lead manager Raskin included in his remarks that even if Trump's words on January 6 were protected by the First Amendment, he can still be impeached and convicted for them.
Saudi Arabia and Bezos have not been on good terms since at least last October, when Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. And as De Becker mentions, Amazon has a large presence in Saudi Arabia, through a subsidiary, Souq.com. So who knows all the possible angles here—after all, not everyone loves Amazon.
For the first time in my life, I admitted during my walk this morning that I am a child of God. On my path forward, I am going to embrace faith to sustain me. Psychiatry hasn't cured me. Transgenderism hasn't helped me. It's now time to give God and my newly found faith a chance. — James Shupe (Formerly Jamie Shupe) (@NotableDesister) March 21, 2019
She only released a few albums over the past two decades, including A Rose is Still a Rose, which featured songs by Sean Diddy Combs, Lauryn Hill and other contemporary artists, and So Damn Happy, for which Franklin wrote the gratified title ballad. Franklin's autobiography, Aretha: From These Roots, came out in 1999, when she was in her 50s. But she always made it clear that her story would continue.

Those who break the rules, which also include mandatory use of face masks outside the home, can be fined as much as $16,000 and jailed for up to three months.
During this era, India was widely known as the begging bowl of the world. Americans told their children, Eat your food because there are millions of starving people in India. Gandhi spoke wistfully about wiping a tear of every Indian face. A whole generation of young Indians in the 1960s and 1970s saw no future for themselves and fled to sea, like my brother, or to Dubai to do manual labor, like some of my cousins, or to Australia, Canada and America, like me.

Shortly after the publication of the Pope's letter, the Vatican reaffirmed the binary male-female distinction of human beings, banning transgender persons from being godparents posing as the opposite sex from which they were born.
A Washington Post article published this week criticizes bias in political science articles on Wikipedia. However, rather than attacking the left-wing bias afflicting political articles, the author argues instead the problem is articles not citing enough female authors and academics. The author, Samuel Baltz, boasted of trying to fix this bias by expanding coverage of women in political articles, while otherwise celebrating Wikipedia's political and ideological neutrality in its coverage.
There is no indication that Badmos is a police chief as reported by some news outlets. Nigeria media described her as a spokeswoman for the country's federal police.
It seems a very important intellectual moment in bringing together these sort of two strands of Conservatism that have emerged in Southern California. On the one hand, this idea from the Claremont Institute — that the United States was founded as sort of an expression of ancient political theory coming from Aristotle and people like that. And that we're in serious trouble with the rise of Progressive Liberal Government in the 20th Century. And on the other hand, sort of Andrew Breitbart's idea that culture is ahead of politics — that you had to create a media vehicle that sort of spoke to people where they are — and bring them along politically after that. And it struck me that was very obviously the formula for Trump…

The actor — whose career skyrocketed after 1997's box office hit George of the Jungle, and continued to rise for more than a decades with starring roles in the Mummy franchise, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and 2014's animated hit Nut Jobs — tells a story of abuse that has resonated in the wake of the MeToo and Time's Up era that has seen several powerful male Hollywood figures be accused of sexual harassment or assault.

The article then went on to name several of the women in the BBC report and claim that Chinese documentation did not show that those who claimed to be forcibly sterilized endured such an attack. It went on to claim that the BBC provided almost no information to prove the authenticity of the testimonies. Contrary to that claim, the BBC did indicate that some of its witnesses had documents, including travel documents, that indicated that those testifying were in the places they claimed to be when they experienced what they denounced. The anonymous concentration camp guard who spoke to the BBC, for example, provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp, according to the report.

Alyssa Milano, the actress who's become a major online presence on issues of women's rights as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday to Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz, telling him the candidate needed to change. More calls came in, more tough conversations.
In many ways, Buttigieg is Trump's polar opposite: younger, dorkier, shorter, calmer and married to a man. His success may depend on whether Democrats want a fighter to match Trump, or whether Americans want to 'change the channel,' as Buttigieg puts it. 'People already have a leader who screams and yells,' he says. 'How do you think that's working out for us?'
In surveys, young adults commonly report that their student loan debts are preventing them from buying a home, Fed researchers Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, and Kamila Sommer found. Our estimates suggest that increases in student loan debt are an important factor in explaining their lowered homeownership rates, but not the central cause of the decline.
I don't know what the tape is, Greenberg said of the video Avenatti gave prosecutors. We haven't seen it. No one's showed us the tape.
Unfortunately, that's a common way to shoot someone in the back and that's what it amounts to, Womack said. I've had cases — a few of them in recent years — where the evidence was not there to convict someone of a crime, but the command believed they had done something wrong. So they say, 'We'll give you this GOMOR.' It's a common tactic.
He said Sonntag likely dropped the Article 15s because he knew he would lose in a court-martial. Robertson and Squires called their bluff, and the GOMOR was a face saving measure, he said.

PENCE: Look, the Supreme Court has made their decision.
Chase hardened the mold of the ten to thirteen episode format, and through adult storytelling, respect for the intelligence of his audience, cinema-quality production values, and pitch-perfect performances, showed the world what television was truly capable of. His mold is now the norm, what we expect. At the time, we had never seen anything like it, and therefore it is not hyperbole to argue The Sopranos is to television what Rock Around the Clock was to music.
He told the audience this is why they must work to invigorate community, defend religious liberty, create space for communities to flourish, and provide positive examples of moral communities that advance a vision of the common good.
The program mandated that the KGB take secret control of the World Council of Churches (WCC), based in Geneva, Switzerland, and use it as cover for converting Liberation Theology into a South American revolutionary tool, Pacepa said.

Nonetheless, a more important consideration should be made here.
It's a proud moment for us – times are changing, Ahmed said. Who would have thought a Hollywood actress would become a British princess?
It's strange the Church is being advised to adapt to state laws this way – I see no need for it, said Antoine Renard, honorary president of the Federation of Catholic Family Associations. The Church teaches families are created by fathers and mothers, and that other forms are not families. Lesbian and other couples could demand otherwise, but this won't be accepted by the Church.
We are not arguing that any procedure on the female genitalia is desirable, they said. Rather, we only argue that certain procedures ought to be tolerated by liberal societies.
Schweizer concluded, While Sanders may not be a fan of charity, he seems to have no problem awarding jobs and contracts to those closest to him.

For Dolan and his fellow episcopal travelers, the all-consuming issue is abortion, the article notes with thinly veiled scorn. That tops the agenda in any political consideration.

A-list couples including George and Amal Clooney have arrived for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
Most celebrations involved a firework display, although some cities used the occasion for overt political messaging. Here is a round-up:
The Constitution ought to be a unifying instrument; it is, after all, the only thing that all of our legislators, officers, and judges — from the President to the county sheriffs — must be bound by oath to support, states the Sun.
It sacrifices the equality, safety, and privacy of women, while privileging men who identify as women: If this bill becomes law, they'd have a civil right to spend the night in a battered women's shelter, disrobe in a women's locker room, and compete on a women's sports team—even children at K-12 public schools. Religious institutions fare no better. Religious schools, adoption agencies, and other charities would face federal sanction for operating according to basic biology and mainstream Biblical teaching on sex and marriage. Outrageously, this act exempts itself from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Pope Francis would be treated as the legal equivalent of a Jim Crow segregationist.
His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around. I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry, Fraser says of the alleged 2003 encounter, in a GQ profile titled, What Ever Happened to Brendan Fraser?

His work also helped propel Roberts to her first Best Actress Oscar. Still, Finney declined to attend the Academy Awards ceremony — possibly damaging his chances at future wins by snubbing Hollywood's elite.
I think that the statehouse belongs to all the citizens, Grant told reporters. And all the citizens have a voice. If it's my turn to have a voice, and I am a pastor, what do you expect from me? If you don't want to hear what a pastor has to say, then don't invite one.
Moreover, Amazon is a big player, too, in cloud computing, including for the Pentagon; in fact, Bezos' company is currently embroiled in a $10 billion legal battle with another mysterious corporate giant, Oracle, complete with flying allegations of improper influencing.
The root of the addiction comes from the hopelessness that people feel in towns like Elyria, said Grodell. When you are in a state of hopelessness, you reach for something that gives you relief, that helps you escape. Too often government programs and the political rhetoric that promotes them keep people trapped in that hopelessness, tethering them to the life of handouts and government dependency.

Since 2017, Trump has accelerated efforts to curb the fentanyl epidemic, and he has reduced the inflow of blue-collar illegal immigrants. The efforts have helped push up wages and employment for blue-collar Americans, and also to push down the drug deaths and to slow the suicide rates.
What Cameron will be hoping now is that his personal referendum disaster may turn into a Pyrrhic victory for his enemies. He'll want Boris Johnson to lose the fight to become Prime Minister; he'll want a Remain candidate to win instead – someone like Teresa May – and perhaps, ideally, sabotage the EU negotiations so that we end up with some sort of grubby compromise whereby we might as well have Remained in the EU for all the difference it makes. He'll want, in other words, what the majority of British people demonstrably don't want. Vengeance before country.
The race has been a huge comeback for Tsai and the DPP, which was trounced so badly in the 2018 local elections that Tsai stepped down as leader of the party. The protest movement in Hong Kong is widely credited with shifting the Taiwanese center of political gravity back in her direction as apprehension about China grows. Solid economic growth helped defuse Han's accusations that Tsai compromised Taiwan's prosperity by taking a tough stance against Beijing.
He would also ban the use of cellphones in elementary schools.
Opposition to the Gospel shouldn't really surprise us. Jesus warned that it would come, Graham wrote. As you may know, my eight-city evangelistic tour across the UK has been met with resistance by LGBTQ activists who inaccurately claim that I am homophobic, Islamophobic, and say that I speak hate.
Sanders says it is also a time to re-think America and create a country where we care about each other instead of a country of greed and corruption that only benefits the corporate elite.
The National Catholic Reporter, which has made its reputation through open dissent to Catholic Church teaching for decades, pushing everything from women's ordination to gay marriage to abortion, said in its op-ed that it is unprecedented that the Church's leadership would cozy up so cravenly to a president whose most consistent attribute is an uncontrollable propensity for lying.
One of the main instances of bias Baltz identified is many articles on political topics, such as the Electoral College, citing men more than women to an extent he claims is disproportionate to their representation in the political science field. He stated of the dozen academic citations on the Electoral College's Wikipedia page, only one had a woman as the primary author. Baltz also criticized the article on democracy, stating only 10 percent of the works in the article's further reading section listed a woman as the first author. He cited similarly low percentages for articles on conservatism (11 percent), socialism (3 percent), and dictatorship (0 percent).
Therefore, the series doesn't believe that she, or us, deserve to feel righteous after being complicit (there's that word again) for so long.

Unless global action is taken, the Taliban will remain a hugely wealthy organization, with a self-sustaining funding stream and outside support from regional countries. Its role as a destabilizing force, not only in South Asia but globally, will only be enhanced by the withdrawal of the United States from the Afghan theater, and its expected return to the power equation in Kabul, the NATO report warned.

Perhaps ringing the bell on these potential lines of attack, Warren told Anderson Cooper at a town hall event this week that she became a Democrat in the 1990s when she realized that while all of the Republicans were for the big banks, only half of the Democrats were for big corporations and bankers. Warren said she had been working over and over and over on what's happening to America's working families, to America's middle class, how it is that people who work hard, who play by the rules are just finding the path steeper and rockier year by year, and for people of color even steeper and even rockier.
The Soviets used influence to ensure that the WCC did not criticize its invasions of Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia, they state.
In a sure sign of his approval, Trump simply wrote: Great!
It would position the government to lord over churches and other faith-based institutions, dictating potentially who they hire, how their facilities are used, and even punishing them for not falling in step with a view of human sexuality that directly contradicts orthodox biblical teaching:
Biden and Sanders have far more in common on abortion, religious liberty, gun rights, health care, immigration, economic policy, and education than what the media has portrayed. Biden, the so-called moderate, and Sanders, the democratic socialist, are really two sides of the same Democratic coin.
Rubio moved from talking about individualism that transcends the left into other areas of business and politics, to talking about those who equate wealth with being good. He said this is why we have a financial elite that outsources American jobs to countries that do not share our values and views the traditional beliefs of regular Americans as backwards.

Part of why Baltz claims this is a problem is the fact studies suggest Wikipedia can shape scientific literature. He claims groups underrepresented in academia tend to be missing at an even higher rate on Wikipedia and together this means Wikipedia does not just passively reflect biases. It amplifies and reinforces them. Baltz further criticizes Wikipedia claiming only 20 percent of political scientists with articles are women when 30 percent of political scientists are reportedly women. He raises a similar issue with nearly half of articles on political scientists being Americans.

If the Pentagon is forced to accept the claim that gender (not the bright line of biology) decides a person's male or female sex, then progressives will have won a huge victory in their campaign to erase the public's immense variety of helpful civic practices and laws which help men and women manage their competitive and cooperatives lives together. Those non-government rules — marriage, dating, sports leagues, privacy, and much else — are based on the recognition that women and men are legally equal and also different and complementary.

Intrigued by these many spidery lines of inquiry, Virgil first wrote about the Bezos story on March 10, 2019. In particular, he quoted various media observers who said that one result of Bezos's published escalation was to reposition himself in the public eye. That is, if he was attacking Saudi Arabia and Trump, he was no longer a billionaire who just got caught in the dirty. Instead, his escalation was elevation: elevating himself, that is, so that he was now a champion of the free press, the First Amendment, and the protection of journalists. (In that piece, Virgil couldn't help but notice, also, that Bezos bears a resemblance to Ernst Blofeld, a fictional villain from the James Bond movies.)

The latest attacks on those accusing China followed a harrowing BBC exposé in which survivors of the concentration camp system said they were regularly subject to gang rape and tortured by being raped with electric batons, among other atrocities. Some of those sharing their experiences with the BBC included guards and prisoners forced to help the guards by disrobing and tying women up in torture chambers prior to their gang rape. Nearly all of those testifying said that a common characteristic of the concentration camps was that everyone inside could hear the screams of agony of those being tortured while they awaited their turn.

The PISD superintendent also said, In my personal opinion, this is one more example of unconstitutional interference and social engineering by the federal government. When the Supreme Court re-defined marriage and invented new constitutional rights, the door was opened for re-defining all social norms, now including executive branch dictates about bathroom and locker room rules in local schools.

This was the most important moment in the series. From here, there was no going back. Until now, we could rationalize our sympathy for Tony. Through four episodes, he had not yet killed or even ordered a killing.

Davis said Cornyn told them he wanted this graduation to be about their hard work and accomplishments. Davis, a member of the TSU Alumni Association, invited the senator to return to the campus at a later date for a discussion, a town hall meeting, a Q&A from a group of your constituency that feels underrepresented or misrepresented.

Hate groups are on the rise! That was the message from breathless reporting on the new hate map by media enthusiastic to advance the SPLC's narrative. Why are hate groups allegedly on the rise? One reason might be that the SPLC has watered down the definition of a hate group to the point where anyone advancing a traditional or pro-American position is deemed guilty.
Fiorentini claims he was worried because he could not contact his girlfriend, and so went to her apartment Saturday afternoon and was let in by the landlord. The young woman was lying in the bedroom, naked. According to the first autopsy, Olsen may have died several hours before the discovery of the body, and her body bears no signs of sexual assault.

So again, what is a white supremacist? You might be surprised to learn just how broad the definition for that has become. Bloomberg News has described a wall on our southern border as, quote, a monument to white supremacy so be certain not to support that.
Perhaps one reason that sense weighs so heavily upon the last couple of generations is the growth of mass media and the Internet, giving even the poorest Americans a sense of cultural awareness—including keen awareness of their own plight—that wasn't possible in the days when there were only a handful of stations on the TV set.
Despite widespread rumors over their relationship, the couple had consistently denied the claims. Yet earlier this year, Scarborough was quoted as saying that as well as having crackling on-air chemistry, [we have] crackling off-air chemistry, too,
This is having a profound effect on American society. People are getting married later, which reduces the number of children they have. Women, in particular, delay marriage when they bear lots of student debt. And a significant number of people who say they do not want children cited student debt as the reason.
Judge Williams disagreed, writing that the marriage had been valid but was now void under section 11 of the 1973 Matrimonial Causes Act because it was entered into in disregard of certain requirements as to the formation of marriage.

On Monday, O'Rourke boasted his campaign raised more than $6 million in the first 24 hours. The record-breaking $6.1 million collected last week came without a dime from political action committees, corporations or special interests, O'Rourke spokesman Chris Evans tweeted.

At the same time, though, he doesn't let them off the hook. While Ridgeman undoubtedly would have treated a white dealer the same way and is about to be unfairly crucified as a racist by the Roman circus the news media has become, he still went too far and needs to box the compass of his humanity.
A 2017 analysis by U.S. News & World Report noted that the five countries with the worst record for human trafficking were all governed by authoritarian regimes with highly regulated markets and little respect for human rights. None of the worst offenders are free market economies.

It's about the founding ideals that have led to this country haltingly but inexorably in the direction of fairness, inclusion and equality for all Americans.
Today Americans live under two constitutions: the political constitution and the corporate constitution. The political constitution is functioning reasonably well. The corporate constitution, by comparison, is a lawless realm of out-of-control tyranny. … Of graver concern in a democratic republic should be arbitrary powers exercised by [giant] companies in the real economy against dissident individuals or unpopular businesses or organizations. If businesses are banned from advertising their goods and services on electronic platforms and other forms of media; if authors of controversial books can be banned from online and physical book distributors; if political groups are banned from making electronic transactions, or having bank accounts; if individuals who hold the wrong opinions can be denied health insurance; if lenders deny credit cards to people who voted the wrong way in the last election or said something inflammatory on social media, then the United States is now a tyranny, even if the courts are open and elections are free. … The remedies for arbitrary corporate power in the new infrastructure industries, then, are simple and straightforward. Define online opinion and video platforms as regular publishers, subject to traditional publishing regulations that seek to deter dissemination of libels, profanity, obscenity, intellectual property theft, and so on. And define all the other big tech firms either as common carriers or public accommodations that are clothed in a public interest.
The left seems to delight in misunderstanding Robertson. None more so than when Robertson supposedly used the calendar to show that Jesus was God.
Why does Pope Francis keep and even call as his close collaborators people who are notorious homosexuals? Viganò said. Why has he refused to answer legitimate and sincere questions about these appointments? In doing so he has lost credibility on his real will to reform the Curia and fight the corruption.
Moreover, what Mean Little Mayor Pete is doing is even more sinful than parading his sin. He is literally hoping to mislead people into believing something that will put their immortal soul in danger, he is deliberately trying to deceive people of good faith into believing his open and defiant homosexuality is not a sin.
And what does it say about NBC that the only public shaming victims NBC News wants to defend are not those who have been annihilated by the Humor Vigilantes or the Ten-Year-Old Tweet Vigilantes or the Rodeo Mask Vigilantes or the You're Fired for Opposing Gay Marriage Vigilantes, but those who apparently showed up at a house to have sex with a child?
Trump should have read Jared the snake poem before he hired Cohn. (You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.)
For about the fourth time, he argued that the golden showers thing wasn't true, asking yet again, 'Can you imagine me, hookers?'  Comey writes of the call. In an apparent play for my sympathy, he added that he has a beautiful wife and the whole thing has been very painful for her. He asked what we could do to 'lift the cloud.' 
So, it turns out that British people really aren't that fond of hypocrisy. And one of the most obvious forms of the art this century has come from the media class, lecturing the ordinary folk on not taking flights while on jet aircraft themselves.
In Sydney, celebrations centered around the city's harbor in a multi-million dollar display.

So it dawned on us today that maybe we ought to stop playing all these stupid media clips every night. It's like watching the town drunk throw up on himself over and over again. Obviously, it's repulsive and shocking. It's hard to turn away. But can you really be surprised by it?
First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year, Bryant stated in his 2004 public apology. Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.

Sanders says he voted against the Hyde Amendment while Biden voted for it. Sanders says it take courage sometimes to do the right thing.

Socialists today disavow this historical record, insisting that these were authoritarian forms of socialism that they have no intention of copying. While socialism may have been the economic program of Communism and early Fascism, modern socialists seek to dispense with the tyranny and merely keep the economic program.

The Supreme Court made it clear twenty years ago that if public universities wish to force students to pay student activity fees, then those universities have an affirmative duty to ensure that the funds are distributed in a viewpoint neutral manner—not by a simple majority vote. But the officials at Georgia Tech have done the opposite. They force students to fund other students' expression through the student activity fee, but students may only access those funds through a system that permits, and in some cases demands, viewpoint discrimination.

The following day, December 17, the group paid Putnam Partners a further $31,900.02 for ad production—bringing the PAC's spending total to more than $531,000 for the two days.

At the station in Slough, the changing point for travelers from London, revelers found sign boards reading All aboard the royal wedding special to Harry & Meghan Central.
Stasi spends a couple hundred words slashing Guilfoyle's romantic life (which laughably boils down to OMG an attractive, successful single woman maybe dated that guy last year and is dating this guy now — that's two guys in two years!), so how are we supposed to believe Stasi is unaware of Guilfoyle's most well-known relationship, her five-year marriage to former-Mayor Gavin Newsom (D-CA), a relationship where Guilfoyle was famously celebrated as the first Latina First Lady of San Francisco.
For years I've written about mommy bloggers' obsession with BPA, the danger du jour perpetuated by the hysterical, click-seeking women's media. It involves the level of BPA found in water bottles, canned foods, and even thermal cash-register tape. Popular celebrity bloggers like Gwyneth Paltrow and the Food Babe have hyped several inherently flawed studies that blame everything from breast cancer to diabetes on BPA. Unfortunately for the fear-based online media, last week a new study came out that Paltrow, the Food Babe and other wannabe health bloggers can't be too thrilled about – GMO Crops Don't Harm Human Health, Report Says.
[T]here is not a specific law with respect to the entry of same sex couples or 'transgendered persons' as parents on the baptismal record, the cardinal reportedly explained. The term 'parents' used by the Church's Canon 877 clearly refers to the father and mother, the man and the woman created by God who are united in the sacrament of marriage.

While these figures represent the polling of Britain as a whole, YouGov's polling also broke down the results by age, and by voting preference at the EU Referendum in 2016.
Finally, there's Bradley's drug dealer-boss Gil (Marc Blucas), an upper middle-class white guy who, upon introduction, matter-of-factly fires off a series of politically incorrect statements about mineral water being gay and Mexicans always traveling with big families. And yet, Gil doesn't seem to say these things out of a racial malevolence but rather for the pleasure of being an outlaw in a world increasingly ruled by the fascism of political correctness.
The archbishop's statement reflected the bishops' ongoing vocal concern over Biden's full-bore support for Planned Parenthood, his opposition to school choice, his attacks on the Little Sisters of the Poor, his support for gender transition even for minors, his promises to repeal legislation protecting U.S. taxpayers from financing abortion domestically and abroad, his promotion of same-sex marriage, and other related issues, all of which fly in the face of Catholic teaching.

In the past, the pope has insisted that the natural family is under attack from gender ideology, which seeks to blur essential differences between men and women.
Bean's quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on To Tell the Truth. The game required the panelists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a national catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said: Will the real (notable's name) please stand up?
The second pillar he identified as the family. He spoke of values and the percentage change in children born outside of a marriage, from fewer than five percent in the 1950s to over 40 percent today. He added that many families today are buffeted by economic pressures and social engineering. He lauded the Faith and Freedom Coalition and used these are reasoning for him fighting to expand the child tax credit and for fighting alongside Ivanka Trump to expand paid family leave
Instead of cashing in by taking lucrative film roles after Tom Jones, Finney took a long sabbatical, traveling slowly through the United States, Mexico and the Pacific islands, then returned to the London stage to act in Shakespeare productions and other plays.

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Well, look, I worked very closely with Mayor Pete when I was governor of the state of Indiana. We had a great working relationship.

Two of her most-shared political posts came on January 6, in which she criticized certain left-wing ideologies, including the defund the police movement. She also expressed skepticism that Joe Biden legitimately won the presidential election, using the #MAGA hashtag.
We argued then that Texas is devaluing the votes of certain citizens by improperly including noncitizen nonvoters when determining the equal population of legislative districts. Under federal law and the laws of all 50 states, only citizens may vote in federal elections. Texas' scheme to give weight to non-voting non-citizens along with lawful voters is contrary to the principles embodied in citizen voting laws. As a result, the votes of some Texas' citizens have, by some measures, almost twice the electoral power of the votes of other Texas citizens.
It turned out that this debate was not about a wall. It was about a new immigration policy in America. It was about rejecting the notion that we are a nation of immigrants. Last week, one of our major federal agencies deleted that term, said we no longer want to have that as our mission statement, that America is a nation of immigrants. To deny our birthright as a nation is to really defy who we are, what we are and what we will be.
Perhaps surprisingly, Ivy-league educated Ivanka Trump has recently come out as a skeptic about America's love affair with college. The first daughter has taken up a leadership role in the Trump administration's workforce development efforts—and shown a remarkable candidness when it comes to our college problem.
Guido Lamell, the music director and conductor of the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra, was thrilled, telling the audience that the concert was one of the best evenings of my life. Asking for a show of hands, he noted that many people were attending a classical music concert for the first time. That, he said, had been his hope in asking Prager to conduct — that he would draw new fans to the orchestra. But the response was much greater than he expected.

But not even these high-profile releases could juice domestic subscriptions.
Princess Diana was born into privilege, married into and even died in opulence. She spent most of her life in comfortable pursuit of `good things'. The hurt of her unhappy marriage and the pain of her public humiliations only reminded much of the watching world that not even the wealth of the Windsors can buy love.
But over time, she became more than a name above the title: Right down to her cheerful, alliterative stage name, she stood for a time of innocence and G-rated love, a parallel world to her contemporary Marilyn Monroe. The running joke, attributed to both Groucho Marx and actor-composer Oscar Levant, was that they had known Day before she was a virgin.
The attack occurred in an apartment on Rustenschacherallee street in Vienna's second district, home of the famous Prater Ferris wheel and the Pater amusement park. Four of the asylum seekers are said to have found the woman intoxicated and brought her back to the apartment where the nine men took turns having sex with her as she lay defenceless.
Just imagine where Raskin's reasoning would take this country. If a president is a faithful Roman Catholic, devout Southern Baptist, or Orthodox Jew, whose faith teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman, and that sex is defined by biology rather than the gender a person chooses to identify with, that could run afoul of antidiscrimination laws. The correct response is that such beliefs are protected by the Free Speech Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution's First Amendment, which trumps federal and state antidiscrimination laws, and therefore are perfectly legal.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He filled that empathy void.
House Democrats are poised to pass the Equality Act once again, claiming it will merely amend federal civil rights law to ensure sexual orientation and gender identity are included among the protected classes, even though the Constitution already provides protection for the rights of all American citizens, regardless of their identity group.

Certain people feel strongly against it, in both communities, she said. I felt it from the black community. It is so complicated. I don't want to give it too much energy. The horrific things that people were saying, it makes you … I'm learning there are certain things I have to really keep for myself.
And almost certainly, there will be calls for Mother Teresa to be canonized a saint. Mother herself always rejected such talk. Yet for millions of people living in a century that did much to make us cynical, Mother Teresa was a glimpse of God even agnostics could respect. In our time, she was `the Word of God made flesh.'
I want to thank my wife Anna, I love you. You've given me so much. You gave me the greatest star in the galaxy in my little boy, I love him and I love you, he said at the time, according to the Daily Mail. We have bonded to make this molecule that is more important to me than air or water, and without it none of this means anything to me. With every challenge, with every day, week, month, decade, we become more bonded.
Christianity teaches that God made man in his own image, in the image of God He created him; man and female he created them (Gen. 1:27). Men and women are complementary, a fact that extends beyond the spheres of marriage and procreation, the cardinal said, but pertains also to biopsychic differences in their relationship as spouses and with third parties and society as a whole.

With the truth staring her in the face, Melfi summons the courage to do the right thing. But if you watch the above scene, it is marvelously real. She's scared and angry, but also clumsy, and for this reason the moment is terribly unsatisfying. There is no catharsis, and this is deliberate.

The Australian government has taken the lead from President Donald Trump in the race to improve vetting of immigrants who may hold hostile Islamic attitudes, and to reform wage-slashing guest-worker programs like the H-1B white-collar outsourcing visa.
That is, it's possible that Bezos knew, or should have known, that he was just in the midst of a stinky situation, and yet as part of a sort of cover-up, he chose to escalate his accusations, as a way of, in effect, changing the subject away from himself as an adulterer, and toward others alleged to be aggressors.

What bothers me is that I get linked in with them. People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse and abuse and abuse– and I, who was only accused by one woman in a child custody case which was looked at and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people, he continued.
Robertson claimed that high death rate, which has actually decreased in recent years, is the fault of LGBT people. 'When you allow men to determine what's right and what's wrong, you get decisions like the five judges who said, 'I may not know we have 7,000 years of history of men marrying women, Robertson continued. 'A male and a female. For that reason, they'll leave their father and mother and cleave to one another and become one flesh. I know it's been that way for 7,000 years, but we know best for what's everybody.'
Responses from some non-English language versions of Wikipedia sites were generally less hostile to the Foundation. A user from the Arabic-language Wikipedia who lives in Morocco mentioned some complaints with the Foundation's lack of transparency in handling cases and along with other users suggested members of the Arabic-language community should be more involved in the code of conduct's implementation to give users confidence in it. Users at the Korean-language Wikipedia seemed more open to direct Foundation involvement in enforcement, with one suggesting Foundation involvement should be allowed on request of the reporting user.

Whittlesey was an early supporter of Ronald Reagan's ambitions for the White House. She backed his insurgent 1976 campaign against sitting President Gerald Ford. In Reagan's epoch-defining campaign of 1980, Whittlesey served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Detroit, where she co-chaired the Subcommittee on Foreign Policy and Defense. She then co-chaired Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign for her state and was credited with delivering the crucial eastern Pennsylvania votes. I became fluent in explaining Reagan's foreign policy during that period, Whittlesey told the American Conservative in a 2015 profile. I had to go out into the far reaches of Pennsylvania to explain it to ordinary people.

Honestly, does anyone want to live in Mr. French's vision of an idealized Christian world — one where we never let it go, where we condemn people over 12-year-old sins, condemn those for not condemning 12-year-old sins, and remain silent as a Mean Little Mayor uses his national platform to deliberately corrupt the Faith?

Last year the Wikimedia Foundation announced that it was imposing the code of conduct on Wikipedia and other Foundation-owned sites because it wanted them to be welcoming, inclusive, harassment-free spaces in which people can contribute productively and debate constructively. Months later, a committee responsible for writing the code of conduct that was staffed with radical leftists submitted their draft for public comment from members of Foundation-owned sites. In the draft, several provisions advanced left-wing identity politics stances, including required use of preferred pronouns and other provisions criticized as threatening free speech.

Why does Pope Francis keep and even call as his close collaborators people who are notorious homosexuals? Viganò said.

Mean Little Mayor Pete, on the other hand, is guilty of all of that. So far, he has based his entire presidential campaign on the championing of his homosexuality, of his open defiance of God, of his sin; while at the same time he proclaims himself to be a purer-than-pure Christian, a much better Christian than any Christian who voted for Trump. Everyone's a bad Christian, except our Mean Little Mayor.

Josi Denise became a mommy blogger in 2013, building up her American Mama blog until it reached tens of thousands of monthly readers, generating the mother of three thousands of dollars in some months. But the blog came to an abrupt end late last week, when Denise had a crisis of conscience and quit. In a splenetic rant on her new namesake blog (which is worth reading in full), Denise said much of the content posted to her mommy blog — and countless like it online — was garbage. She has deleted many of those posts, she said, Because, like 90% of the fake nonsense I used to share on the internet as a mommy blogger writing about my fake life and oh-so-happy marriage, they are pure b——t.

The Second Amendment was written into the Constitution's Bill of Rights in order for the citizens of the United States to have the ability to ward off all enemies, both foreign and domestic, including those of an overbearing government. Included is the ability to protect ourselves and our families from those wishing to harm us. And, the exercise of these rights should be available to citizens no matter where we travel throughout this great country. However, such is not the case in today's world.
To be sure, there are fringe groups in our country that truly espouse hatred, and they deserve to be marginalized. Fighting groups such as the Ku Klux Klan several decades ago gave the SPLC stature and credibility. Sadly, the SPLC has squandered that heritage by now acting as a left-wing thought police bully, hurling the hate group slur at people and organizations who simply have different political views.

Ferguson's modelling then (and since) has been heavily criticised by experts as not fit for purpose.
He noted that at the time the Constitution's 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, every State limited marriage to one man and one woman, and no one doubted the constitutionality of doing so, which makes it extraordinarily suspicious that the 2015 court could suddenly find differently.

Global Times approaches the topic from an economic standpoint, noting that outlets that have had success publishing danmei fear that they will no longer be able to profit from the content, as foreign distributors interested in buying the fiction now fear running afoul of the Chinese government.
Prager went on, God does not abandon us. Just because God doesn't save us doesn't mean he's abandoned us. If God saved everyone in hardship, then belief would be idiocy. It would be nonsense. Of course people would believe. It's like a celestial butler, 'God, I have a trouble here, okay?'

Rarely in history is there is a chance to actually compare social systems to see which one works better. One might compare the Plantagenet kings of England with the Tang Dynasty in China, but even if we line up the dates we are talking about two completely different societies: different people, different culture. Consequently, England's superiority and China's inferiority — or the other way round — can hardly be attributed to their rival systems of government, since so many other factors could be involved.

FRC's Perkins – who referred to Trump's executive order as a significant first step to defending religious liberty – is also hoping Perdue's statement will serve as encouragement to other conservatives and constitutionalists who are apprehensive about the order, given the situation that a more robust draft of the order was first leaked to leftwing media in February.
On October 19, Archbishop Viganò released another statement in which he reiterated his belief that a crisis of homosexuality is at the root of the Church's current scandals, and that former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, accused of serial homosexual abuse over decades, was just the tip of the iceberg.

A growing population is necessary for a healthy economy, given that older citizens retire or otherwise exit the workforce, leaving vacancies that need to be filled. Experts expect that the 2020 birth rate will be significantly lower than 2019's given the extreme coronavirus lockdowns that China implemented nationwide and the crisis status of many of its hospitals, in which overcrowding could result in an increase in infant or maternal mortality.
According to official Catholic teaching, as summed up in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, IVF techniques are morally unacceptable because they dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act.
I didn't want to contend with how that made me feel, or it becoming part of my narrative. I became depressed, the actor said.

That summer wore on—and I can't remember what I went on to work on next.
The Home Office report claimed that no conclusions about the ethnic background of rape gang members could really be drawn, in part because the state does not bother, still, to collect reliable statistics on the ethnicity of the predators and their victims in a systematic manner.
Keep in mind that all this piety is coming from a man who lives in open defiance of God with his husband — which is fine. I don't care how Mean Little Mayor Pete lives his life, and if he'd promise to lower taxes, kill terrorists, and deport illegals, I'd consider voting for him. But it's a bit much to lecture the rest of us about Real Christianity when you're living an openly homosexual life.
Danmei, the gay fiction genre in question in the Times article, consists of more than consensual adult gay activity, however. Many of the stories, the New York Times reported in a 2014 story on the genre, involve abuse of men and father-son incest; though a high percentage of danmei authors are women, few of the characters created are. Some fantasies in question, the New York Times cites a scholar explaining, are meant to subconsciously subvert the state. The same year this profile surfaced, the Chinese government arrested over twenty women for participating in writing gay fiction online.

We are here to encourage them to let her in, Love said. She's been recognized by the U.N. as a refugee so we believe the Australian government needs to step up, recognize her plight and recognize what she's gone through, and she could be an icon for the rest of the world that women shouldn't be oppressed and they should be fleeing countries that they are oppressed in.
The number, though, is inaccurate. The Bidens, in fact, have seven grandchildren in total. Two are from their late-son Beau's marriage to Hallie Olivere, while five are from their son Hunter's various relationships.

Scioli tried to regain momentum by frequently attacking Macri. He said a Macri win would subject this nation of 41 million people to the market-driven policies of the 1990s, a period of deregulation that many Argentines believe set the stage for the financial meltdown of 2001-2002.

Chapman University's president says he cannot and will not fire a professor and former law school dean amid growing campus calls for action against the faculty member's participation in a pro-Trump rally during which he made claims about election fraud on the day a violent mob stormed the Capitol. … John Eastman, an endowed professor and constitutional law scholar at Chapman, spoke alongside Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani at the Save America rally Jan. 6, citing secret folders in ballot machines that were used to skew vote totals. … A Jan. 8 letter signed by more than 160 Chapman faculty members called for the university's faculty senate, provost, president and law school dean to take action against Eastman, including stripping him of his endowed professorship and removing him from teaching students. Free speech is sacred, and tenured academics like Eastman have the privilege of speaking their mind without fear of repercussion. But Eastman abused that freedom, they wrote, saying that his conspiratorial claims about a stolen election formed the basis of the insurrection.
Prior to the latest directive, students were required to manually log aerobics points into a fitness journal. ORU President William M. Wilson stated:

So at least for now, maybe we're back to square one on this story—which is to say, the basic facts as they could be known back in January 2019. That is, Bezos did things he shouldn't have done; his actions were harmful to his personal dignity and professional reputation. Moreover, his deeds cost him his marriage and that $35-billion divorce settlement. And yes, perhaps Amazon's suitability for sensitive government contracts–especially contracts involving the CIA and similar institutions—might need to be examined.

LifeSiteNews has published the translation of the interview – which included the topic of remarriage following divorce. Abascal, who is from Venezuela, was asked by Rusconi about Jesus's teaching regarding marriage as provided in the Gospel of Matthew:
The economy added 266,000 jobs in the month, far more than expected. Black men over 20 picked up 14,000 of those jobs, according to Labor Department data released Friday. That matched in increase in the civilian labor force for that cohort. As a result, the unemployment rate for black men stayed at the all-time low of 5.1 percent hit in October.

The bill outlaws underage marriages and recommended harsher punishments for those entering conjugal contracts with minors. CII Chairman Muhammad Khan Sherani said Islamic laws say marriage can be solemnised when a girl attains puberty.
The great drift became evident when some prelates or Catholic intellectuals began to give 'a green light for abortion' or 'a green light for euthanasia' I their speeches and writings. Now, from the moment that Catholics abandon the teaching of Jesus and the Magisterium of the Church, they contribute to the destruction of the natural institution of marriage as well as the family and it is now the entire human family that finds itself fractured by this new betrayal on the part of priests, he said.

While the show is about countless things, it is primarily concerned with two that are even more relevant today: the emptiness of American consumerism and the toxicity of identity politics.
Millions of Americans sense that the Democrats have become unmoored from the constitutional principles, the Sun adds.

I was not provided with any warning by Apple that pornography was highly addictive and could alter my reward cycle by the manufacturer.

Naturally, I fell in love with my computer and preferred having sex with it over all other persons or things, as a result of classic conditioning upon orgasm.

At issue was a Tweet pointing to a story about Dr. Rachel Levine, President Biden's controversial nominee for Assistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services. The tweet included the following sentence:

Texas, as it allocates benefits to employees' spouses, may recognize the differences between same- and opposite-sex spouses. To withhold this decision from the people is to undermine precedent, democracy, and the limited role of courts in our nation. It bears repeating that the Supreme Court in Obergefell embraced 'democracy [as] the appropriate process for change, so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights.' I would take the Court at its word. Because the court of appeals did not, I respectfully dissent to the denial of the petition for review.

To begin with, as someone who has lived in a small town in the south since 1993, and who is also in an interracial marriage, I found the depiction of the south ludicrous. If it wasn't for the wider ties and lack of crew-cuts, you would think you were watching Mississippi Burning 2. Just a few years prior to O.J. Simpson's acquittal, we're supposed to believe black people are kept out of a courtroom so only the white people are allowed to sit? That white boys in pick-up trucks phone in bomb threats and drive by in slow-motion to glare at the noble black folk? That the sheriff and his men embrace the Rebel Flag and use the N-word in the presence of Harvard-trained defense attorneys?

Political bias at Wikipedia and the Foundation has been a growing cause of concern. Last year the Foundation endorsed the Black Lives Matter movement, ignoring violent rioting associated with it and declaring no neutral stance existed on the issue, while editors on Wikipedia pushed the movement's agenda. The Foundation cited the code of conduct as one way it would address equity issues on Wikipedia in its endorsement. Numerous studies and analyses have demonstrated a left-wing bias on the site, a bias criticized by co-founder Larry Sanger last year, with one study finding the push for off-setting a pro-men bias on Wikipedia has over-corrected into a pro-women bias. With the new code of conduct, such biases are likely to worsen.

While it is true that some Islamic scholars have condemned FGM, many others promote it and use hadiths to do so. The Muslim Brotherhood for example pushed for FGM when it took over Egypt, and in moderate Indonesia, where somewhere between 80 and 100 per cent of girls suffer this mutilation, 100 per cent of women interviewed believed it to be an Islamic obligation. According to 'Stop FGM Mid East' the practice did not exist in Indonesia until the introduction of Islam.

Another reason why hate crimes might be on the rise is because being a self-appointed hate crime watchdog is a highly profitable enterprise. The poverty part of SPLC's name reeks of Orwellian irony, as the group has raised nearly a half-billion dollars in donations from the likes of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and actor George Clooney. This is in addition to the cozy relationship the SPLC enjoys as the trusted flagger for Big Tech giants, serving as judge, jury and executioner for content on platforms like Google and Facebook. An IRLI investigation revealed that the Department of Defense was using SPLC manuals for its employee training on hate groups and hate crimes until the practice was discontinued in 2017.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the Supreme Court will decide whether a Christian baker has any First Amendments rights of either free speech or the free exercise of religion to decline to custom-design a cake to celebrate same-sex marriage. It looks likely that the baker will win 5-4 on a narrow ground that will be very significant to people of faith, but not a decisive victory or loss that will resolve all these matters for both sides.
It–it–it is utterly an amazing coincidence that the two most famous women in the world really, according to surveys, should die within just a few days of each other. And while they were very different, to be certain, they were friends. Princess Diana, in fact, was buried holding a rosary given to her by Mother Teresa. And this weekend their losses seem to resonate with some similar meanings.
Corley said it raises questions about just how much people know about this candidate. We know he served in the Air Force, and I appreciate that, Corley told Breitbart Texas in a phone interview on Saturday. But, what else do we know about him. This is an agricultural region and we need candidate who knows ag. We don't need another Neugebauer.
In her Tuesday column for the far-left Daily News, Stasi called on Fox News to fire Guilfoyle for dating Donald Trump Jr.
Wiping away tears, the young woman told Birmingham Crown Court that she felt she was an object that could be moved from place to place.
Maybe what we're missing most acutely are the resources for coping with despair—resources of family, community, and church that were more plentiful in times gone by. Ronald Bailey touched on this in a Reason article from January, written after his return to McDowell County, West Virginia some four decades after his family moved away.
In particular, I am grateful to him for stating clearly once again that opposing the injustice of abortion remains our 'preeminent priority,' while acknowledging that 'preeminent' does not mean 'only,' Archbishop Cordileone stated.
So yes, let's investigate all this. Let's find out if this was just a sordid affair that got amplified globally, because Bezos wanted to drown out the noise of his own misbehaving. Let's find out if Bezos is a victim of global heavyweights—or just of his own hot-bloodedness.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He filled that empathy void.
My guess is that you will not. You will not even respond to my requests, and you certainly won't have the courage to debate me. You will continue to pretend that the truth is bigotry and that the lie is moral, and you will continue to deny the most pertinent truth about the treatment of women in the Middle East, Africa, and increasingly in Europe – this abhorrent treatment of women has everything to do with Islam.
Biden and Sanders disagree on whether Sanders voted against the auto bailouts.
Children who are feeling dysphoric in their gender should see a therapist, she told Breitbart News in an interview. I don't think the point of that therapy should be to confirm that delusion. Transgenderism is a dysphoria.
A further 70 per cent per cent said an abortion should be allowed if a woman does not want the child or if a couple cannot afford any more children.
Yet there's also the undeniable magnetism of Bezos' money and power. That was the point of a February 8 column in the Seattle Times headlined, How Amazon gets whatever it wants. In the words of columnist Danny Westneat:
Proving once again that he has no core, no solid set of established beliefs or principles that would enable him to communicate a consistency of thought, Bush made a public fool of himself with his glaring hypocrisy, and yet another example of the hopelessly muddled thinking that made him a non-starter as a 2016 presidential candidate.
China's state-run Global Times on Tuesday reported the country registered 10 million newborns in 2020, a 15-percent decline from 2019 that brought China's birth rate well below the warning level demographics experts have established.
President Donald Trump opened up his press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday by offering condolences to the Bush family after former First Lady Barbara Bush's death.

Voice of America News (VOA) obtained Akhundzada's order, written in the Pashtun language, from two Taliban officials. They said they were instructed to share the order with their subordinates.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party accepts the reality of independence, and Tsai rejects Beijing's view that Taiwan is part of one China.
Afua Hirsch knows why Meghan and Harry are leaving — it's the racism, obviously. But if that's true, why move to a country where the Prime minister regularly dresses up in black face https://t.co/2gLNMnvna9 — Toby Young (@toadmeister) January 9, 2020
Sure, there is a socialist temptation, and this is the same temptation that some cult leaders and TV evangelists hold out to their gullible audience. They offer the temptation of paradise, freed from the normal drudgery and travails of life, with manna dropping into their laps from heaven. This is pretty much what the socialists promise, too. The main difference is that the televangelist promises these wonders in the next life; the socialist in this one. All you are expected to give up is your ownership of yourself, including your right to keep what is yours, your personal autonomy and dignity, and your independence of mind.
A huge rally for Tsai on Saturday was brimming with references to Hong Kong, including a profusion of flags emblazoned with the main slogan of the protest movement, Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.

Eberstadt quotes from the award-winning 2016 book Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic by Sam Quinones. As one passage in Dreamland explains:
Since 2017, Trump has accelerated efforts to curb the fentanyl epidemic, and he has reduced the inflow of blue-collar illegal immigrants. The efforts have helped push up wages and employment for blue-collar Americans, and also to push down the drug deaths and to slow the suicide rates.
The ladies laugh amongst one another, occasionally pausing to lecture the viewer.

This is the profile of an extremist, Donohue concludes. He throws the health of New Yorkers overboard to allow for a jammed protest he likes, and then invokes his health edict to ban people of faith from attending their house of worship.
Moody said in states like New England where the economies are weaker, and not vibrant, people lose hope. And when they lose hope, they look for other things to fill that void and, unfortunately, that's been opioids and now heroin and now fentanil, which is 100 times stronger than heroin.
The UK scientist whose doomsday predictions triggered a massive lockdown on both sides of the Atlantic has resigned his government advisory position, amid claims he broke the strict lockdown rules he pushed to meet his married lover.

The piece also stoops to an ad hominem attack on Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple last year, citing her religious beliefs that compelled her not to cooperate in sanctioning such a relationship.
The seven were handed over to Egyptian prosecutors.
Once that line jumps over racism, what's next? What will the government tell us is WrongThink next?
Nur Qistina Fitriah Ibrahim, a transgender woman who has not undergone a sex-change operation, and her friend, freelance fashion photographer Muhammad Fadli Bin Abdul Rahman, were arrested in Abu Dhabi on Aug. 9, reported ABC News on Thursday. Police stopped them at Yas Mall as they tried to eat at a food court, said Radha Stirling, CEO of the advocacy group Detained in Dubai. Fadli at the time of his arrest was wearing a white T-shirt, a bow tie and earrings, his brother Muhammad Saiful Bahri Bin Abdul Rahman said.
Nancy and Frank Sinatra had been dating as teenagers and married at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic church in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Feb. 4, 1939, just as Frank's singing career was about to take off. Three years before marrying the former Nancy Barbato, he had landed a 15-minute radio show on local station WAAT.

In an article in December 2015, the New York Times lamented that President Obama's full-court press for homosexual rights had sometimes backfired, resulting in increased hostility toward gays rather than greater acceptance.
Islam kills women not only physically – although of course it does – but it kills the spirit of far greater numbers. From birth, girls are degraded and humiliated, most often by their own mothers. These girls accept their status and then pass it on to their own daughters in an endless cycle of what can only be described as evil.
Hours before his wedding in 2011, Prince William, Harry's brother and best man, became the Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus.
An appreciation of our body as male or female, he said, is necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves. Efforts to cancel out sexual differences based in anatomy are a symptom of a sick society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he wrote.
Comey quoted Trump ask saying, I may order you to investigate that.
The members of the public selected for prime viewing spots for the royal wedding have started arriving.

GORSUCH: Senator, I — I know he testified in the Romer case. I can't say sitting here I recall the specifics of his testimony or that he gave a deposition.
All works of fiction must now reflect core socialist values and abide by moral norms.
Moreover, the authors insist, while the WCC was busy doubling down on Israel, there was little or no criticisms of the truly brutal regimes in Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, China, and Iran.
I don't know if he's worried the wrong cake might bring that to life or what. Kimmel taunted, because ha ha you might be gay.

She then became pregnant sometime later that year and travelled back to Sweden where she gave birth to twins in Gothenburg. In 2009, Alicia travelled back to Iraq where she asked for a divorce, which was supported by her father if she gave up her rights to her children under Iraqi law.
Because, damn it, they were fighting for the near-impossible on a wing and prayer. Unlike Remain, they didn't have the full resources of the government, the European Union, the big banks, the corporations, the trade unions and the BBC behind them. Indeed, David Cameron and the Civil Service made sure they were treated like pariahs, even to the point of denying them parliamentary briefings.
A spokesman with the Sheriff's Office said police have significant digital forensic evidence implicating the Mexican couple in the alleged murder of Cabrera. The spokesman also said the police have evidence that Cabrera was threatened to stay in the sham marriage.

A previous HuffPost investigation found that at least 14% of private religious schools around the country that receive public funding through programs like the one in Montana actively discriminate against LGBTQ staff and employees. In the Montana tax credit program, these numbers were even higher.
I'm betting there isn't another Republican who would not have wilted under these attacks. Who would have had the fortitude to stay the course and keep his promises. That's really good character. And its presidential.
He also wants to turn France's so-called solidarity wealth tax on people claiming more than 1.3 million euros ($1.4 million) in assets into a tax on real-estate wealth, which would exclude financial assets.
The 28-year-old woman, Swetha Haridas, filed a report with police on Monday recounting torture and abuse at the hands of Yoga and Charitable Trust in Kochi, a center run by the woman's brother-in-law Manoj Guruji, where she said she was held against her will until she managed to escape in late August.

Although Micah and I had nothing to do with it, it spoke true to what's happening in the regiment. This guy Sonntag, who's basically the one who's trying to screw us over — he's trying to make his career about putting a female through the course, Squires said. He added that he did not oppose women in Special Forces, but opposed lowering the standards.
LONDON (AP) — Albert Finney, the charismatic Academy Award-nominated British actor who starred in films from Tom Jones to Skyfall, has died. He was 82.
The PISD superintendent also said, In my personal opinion, this is one more example of unconstitutional interference and social engineering by the federal government. When the Supreme Court re-defined marriage and invented new constitutional rights, the door was opened for re-defining all social norms, now including executive branch dictates about bathroom and locker room rules in local schools. It is astonishing to watch the flip-flop by leaders who ten years ago strongly endorsed traditional marriage. A hostile vocal minority now rules in America aided by an apathetic, unengaged majority. What's next? Legalizing pedophilia and polygamy? Unless we return to the Biblical basis on which our nation's laws were established, we are in serious trouble – and cannot expect God's continued favor.
Springsteen's support of Obama spans back to 2008 as the then-senator faced off against the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). The Glory Days crooner supported Obama again in 2012, calling him the best choice to get us and keep us moving in the right direction.

The Swedish government is under fire from critics after giving an Iraqi man custody of children he conceived with a then-13-year-old girl who was raped by the man after being sent to Iraq to marry him in 2007.
Following the divorce, Alicia had been designated the sole guardian of the children in Sweden; but a new Stockholm District Court judgement has given the father sole custody.
The miners were kidnapped near a coal mine in Machh, close to Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. The militants blindfolded the miners and tied their hands behind their backs before executing them.
The one-child policy and subsequent remaining limitations on family expansion apply only to ethnic Han Chinese citizens. Ethnic minorities are legally allowed to expand their families further, but are subject to much more brutal methods of birth control. In Western China, the Communist Party has pursued a campaign of forcibly sterilizing Uyghur women, which the U.S. government deemed genocide last week.
COGIC joined with the pro-life Human Coalition to create the Family Life Campaign, a three-year initiative that serves to save babies from abortion.
DURBIN: Judge, would you agree that if an employer were to ask female job applicants about their family plans, but not male applicants, that would be evidence of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called women's inequality stupid and a cause for global shame, personally pledging to press governments to end discriminatory laws in the face of a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights.
To date, only one forced marriage case in England has led to a prosecution.
I feel after all this time they should give me a little bit of information and they're giving me nothing. Since 2015/6 I've given the police 15 names of girls I believe were probably abused by the same gang, Hannah said. She claimed police had told her that officers outright discounted one particular potential victim because she was known to the force and not considered credible.
A spokesman for the low-cost retailer — which has hundreds of stores throughout Europe and the United Kingdom — justified the Soviet-style alterations by saying: We avoid the use of religious symbols because we do not wish to exclude any religious beliefs.
9:09 PM: Biden says his administration will look like America and will pick a woman to be his vice president. In previous interviews, Biden seemed to indicate he was looking for someone like Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). Sanders says, in all likelihood, he will.
We (Africans) are fond of imitating others. They have popularized homosexuality and abortion, and some of us have imitated. I am aware there are some NGOs in the country that dish out medical equipment for abortion, the archbishop said.
Shupe responded with the irony of the situation:
DURBIN: I guess the reason I'm raising this is this is a man who apparently had an impact on your life, certainly your academic life. And I'm trying to figure out where we can parse his views from your views; what impact he had on you as a student; what impact he has on you today with his views. GORSUCH: Well, then I guess, Senator, I think the best evidence is what I've written. I've written over — gosh, written or joined over 6 million words as a federal appellate judge. I've written a couple of books. I've been a lawyer and a judge for 25 or 30 years. That's my record. And I guess I'd ask you respectfully to look at my credentials and my record. And some of the examples I've given you from my record about the capital habeas work, about access to justice. I've spoken about over-criminalization publicly.
Amidst these no comments, we might surmise this much: If it's the case that Lauren Sanchez simply gave, or otherwise transferred, the naughty Bezos items to her brother Michael—and prosecutors seem to have evidence that it was just a simple hand-off— then it's harder to believe that the Saudis, or that Israeli company, or any other larger force, were also involved.
PENCE: — in a party that is sliding off to the left —
Most celebrations involved a firework display, although some cities used the occasion for overt political messaging. Here is a round-up:
Federal Reserve economists recently studied the impact all that debt is having on those aged 24 to 32. They found that while it plays a significant role in keeping young people from buying homes, although other factors—including the high price of homes—were more important.
From Elle Griffiths writing at Mirror:
International observers wishing to claim that China has somehow become capitalist have long upheld Ma as an example of a self-made entrepreneur. Yet Ma, like every Chinese executive, is a lifelong member of the Communist Party, a revelation he made in late 2018. Chinese state media rapidly came to his defense, publishing pieces challenging centuries of Marxist thought by claiming there is no conflict at all between being a Party member and doing business.
They added that Any programme we broadcast will adhere to the BBC's strict editorial guidelines.
So Democrats and the left can cover up their own staggering failures.
In response, Lucas quoted a conservative friend from high school, who was a contestant on The Apprentice and knew Donald Trump a little: Scott, I feel like this piece does a really, really good job of understanding sort of how I see the world, seeing things through my eyes.
Of course these power-hungry leftists want us helpless and defenseless.
Responses from some non-English language versions of Wikipedia sites were generally less hostile to the Foundation. A user from the Arabic-language Wikipedia who lives in Morocco mentioned some complaints with the Foundation's lack of transparency in handling cases and along with other users suggested members of the Arabic-language community should be more involved in the code of conduct's implementation to give users confidence in it. Users at the Korean-language Wikipedia seemed more open to direct Foundation involvement in enforcement, with one suggesting Foundation involvement should be allowed on request of the reporting user.
The American actress' ring has been made with Welsh gold given by Queen Elizabeth II. The company also made her engagement ring.
It was the only time Obama has presented the medal with distinction, also awarded only once by each of the previous three presidents.
The exchange continued, with Heard allegedly writing: Obviously he has no idea what he did or the extent that he did it. If someone was truly honest with him about how bad it really was, he'd be appalled.
So, when this tweet from Jonah Goldberg appeared on my feed, I abandoned my self-restraint and answered it:
Recent proposals to help increase the birth rate include speed dating programs organized by the Communist Youth League, mandatory family building classes for couples applying for a marriage license, mandatory relationship and family classes in universities, government-funded egg-freezing; and shipping urban women to rural areas with a high percentage of single men. Chinese lawmakers also reportedly railed at the two sessions against the alleged feminization of Chinese men, defined in part as insufficient loyalty to the Communist Party.
Comfort Momoh, one of the nation's top FGM experts, said alarm bells should ring if a girl talks about going on holiday for a special ceremony or shows a marked change in behavior following the summer break.
Clearly, as far as Navratilova and Stosur are concerned, someone's achievements in any particular field should be invalidated if they don't agree with the left's political opinions.
Below are my favorite four minutes in all of television:
Omar filed for divorce in October from her husband, Ahmed Hirsi, after reports of the affair surfaced. Her filing, the Washington Post reported, did not mention an affair. But divorce filings from Mynett's wife did allege an affair, though both Omar and Mynett denied the allegations, the Post reported.
The Congregation said that discrimination had nothing to do with its refusal to allow Alex to sponsor her nephew, but rather based its decision on the lack of the qualities needed to assume the responsibility of being a godparent in the Church.
Bryant is survived by his wife, Vanessa, and three of their daughters. The couple's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, was also killed in the helicopter crash that took Bryant's life and seven others.
WASHINGTON, DC – The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sent the case involving a Christian florist who declined to participate in a same-sex wedding back to the lower courts in the state of Washington to reconsider in light of the Supreme Court's recent Masterpiece Cakeshop decision, keeping hope alive for a Christian grandmother who might face a million dollars in legal fees.
Naturally, none of this gets through to Carmela. This wise man didn't tell her what she wants to hear, so she shops around until someone does tell her what she does want to hear — that she is trapped in this life (she loves) by her sacred marriage vows. Sadly, this rationalization comes from a Catholic priest.
Even in the case of legislation allowing such things as euthanasia or same-sex marriage, Francis said, people of faith should be able to opt out, without suffering negative repercussions.

When pressed about same-sex couples being welcome on Fixer Upper in particular, the representative for HGTV highlighted the phrase in any of our shows. The series, which just launched its fourth season, has yet to do so.
Taxpaying California citizens deserve to have their hard-earned money spent lawfully, De Vries says. What the Regents are doing is not only illegal, and it's grossly unfair to taxpayers.
Since Jonah brings up Trump's three marriages let me ask the question: who can see inside another person's marriage? I thought, moreover, that since Reagan, who had two wives, entered the White House and performed as a conservative hero, Republicans would have gotten over their puritanical prejudices. All politicians have flawed characters. It's the nature of the job, which requires compromises, prevarications, dirty deals, and the like. In Trump's case what is important is not his loyalty to his wives (and none of them seem to be complaining), but his loyalty to the cause he champions and the people who support him.
The New York Post's Page Six reported Tuesday that the final straw in Pitt and Jolie's marriage came when the actress and UN special envoy hired a private investigator to tail Pitt on the set of Allied because she suspected him of cheating with Cotillard. The report alleges Pitt was, in fact, cheating with the French actress, although multiple reports and sources have since said the claim is untrue.
Our immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.
The fatwa declared that any act intended to humiliate, insult or tease transgender persons is haraam (sinful), adding that transgender persons should not be deprived of family inheritances, nor the right to be buried in Muslim ceremonies.

The conference heard about the case of teenager Banaz Mahmod, a Kurdish girl in London killed by her family in 2006 after being spotted kissing a boyfriend, having left an abusive marriage. She knew she was in danger, but police ignored a plea for help.
The Supreme Court's recent decision on whether a Christian baker can be forced to make a wedding cake for a gay marriage (no) arriving on the same day that Bill Clinton reared his syphilitic head on NBC's Today reminded me how liberals always use black people as props.
Music is my thing, it's who I am. I'm in it for the long run, she told reporters in 2008. I'll be around, singing, 'What you want, baby I got it.' Having fun all the way.

I thought [white working-class voters] did rebel by electing Donald Trump, I mean it's in some sense they were a lot of people … they're the people who have been done very badly over a long period of time. They don't seem to be well represented … The Democratic Party seems to have abandoned working-class people, and you know it's a form of an alliance between the educated elite and the [non-white] minorities … So we do need a political realignment, I think, which gets a real voice for working-class people again.
WINDSOR, England (AP) – The Latest on the Royal wedding (all times local):
The University of Chicago administration, specifically the Dean of Social Sciences, vigorously defended Professor Fulton Brown's right to express herself online. This defense adheres to the principles laid out in the Report on the Committee on Freedom of Expression at the University of Chicago, which explains that the views of their faculty will not be suppressed even if others find such views to be immoral or offensive.
Feminists as well recognize the Equality Act as Biden's war on women.
And the ugliness is not coming from the defenders of marriage as it's always been understood — the ugliness, the intolerance and indeed in this instance, the hint of violence, is coming from those who tell us in the name of decency and fair-mindedness and freedom, we've got to allow same-sex marriage, he said.
And yet Buttigieg cannot help himself. Like many other Democrats, he disdains religion in the public sphere until he can use it to bludgeon his opponents, adopting the self-righteous posture towards other Christians that he accuses them of taking toward the LGBT community.
Now, you might say, there's no way Democrats will abolish the police; this will only make life infinitely worse for the people who live in Democrat-run cities, which is where a bulk of the black population live.
I don't have a problem standing up to somebody who was working on Celebrity Apprentice when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan, he said in May.
Despite pushback from Swedish legal experts against sharia law in this case, demographic trends suggest that Sweden will become one-third Muslim by the year 2050 and makes the prospect of continued legal challenges inevitable.

She hasn't seen him since he moved down the road in their dusty Bedouin town and started a new family, with seven more children.
And for many, those convictions not only tolerate religious faith, they are born of it and sustained by it.
In 2009, Cortez Masto became embroiled in a political controversy for attempting to prosecute Republican Nevada Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki for mismanagement of state funds. The case was ultimately dropped when it was learned that her husband was a supporter of Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, Robert Randazzo.
The author of the email was given an Article 15 around June for disrespecting a general grade officer. An Article 15 is an administrative, non-judicial punishment, according to the United States Code of Military Justice, which hurts one's ability to be promoted and to stay in the military.
The trend to attack Christian organizations and individuals for their opposition to gay marriage provides a telling confirmation of the prophetic words of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in his 2015 dissent on the Obergefell v. Hodges case, which imposed same-sex marriage on the country.

Tom Arnold to Diamond and Silk: 'Get Your Big Booties Back Into Big Daddy's Hot Tub'
Chase hardened the mold of the ten to thirteen episode format, and through adult storytelling, respect for the intelligence of his audience, cinema-quality production values, and pitch-perfect performances, showed the world what television was truly capable of. His mold is now the norm, what we expect. At the time, we had never seen anything like it, and therefore it is not hyperbole to argue The Sopranos is to television what Rock Around the Clock was to music.
Trump expressed similar disdain for fake news hits on the first lady in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News this week. If our first lady, if I were a Democrat instead of a Republican, she'd be Jackie O times twenty. Instead, they go after her, Trump said making reference to the often lauded former first lady and wife of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, whose subsequent marriage made her Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Jackie O.
The youthful, well-groomed governor is best known for championing the cause of gay marriage over a decade ago as mayor of San Francisco, but has tackled few major governing challenges since.
Based on what? I said take it to court martial so I could have my day in my court, so I could have my voice, and give my testimony, and show how jacked up this is, and I was not given my chance to tell my side, said Squires.
The Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, epicenter of the global virus pandemic, formally ended its two-month lockdown on Wednesday with a huge celebration.
[Relationships and Sex Education] must be balanced, objective and critical, not pushing particular controversial views such as transgender ideology, he added.
But there's a new regime in power starting today and they seem to be planning to accelerate things dramatically. They're getting the FBI and the Pentagon involved in this hunt for people who may criticize them. That's a very big change, and you should understand what it's really about.
A Washington Post article published this week criticizes bias in political science articles on Wikipedia. However, rather than attacking the left-wing bias afflicting political articles, the author argues instead the problem is articles not citing enough female authors and academics. The author, Samuel Baltz, boasted of trying to fix this bias by expanding coverage of women in political articles, while otherwise celebrating Wikipedia's political and ideological neutrality in its coverage.
GLAAD is honoring Jay-Z, though, despite the New York rapper's long history of anti-gay slurs in his song lyrics.
It sacrifices the equality, safety, and privacy of women, while privileging men who identify as women: If this bill becomes law, they'd have a civil right to spend the night in a battered women's shelter, disrobe in a women's locker room, and compete on a women's sports team—even children at K-12 public schools. Religious institutions fare no better. Religious schools, adoption agencies, and other charities would face federal sanction for operating according to basic biology and mainstream Biblical teaching on sex and marriage. Outrageously, this act exempts itself from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Pope Francis would be treated as the legal equivalent of a Jim Crow segregationist.
The report said that between 240,000 and 480,000 may travel to Britain thanks to EU free movement rules.

In New Zealand, the government's health minister was demoted after ignoring his own advice. Dr David Clark was photographed going for a country bike ride, and subsequently drove his family to the beach to go surfing. Reflecting on his breaking the advice of his own department, Dr Clark noted: I've been an idiot.
Bob Moser, a former SPLC staffer, wrote in the New Yorker last week: The work could be meaningful and gratifying. But it was hard, for many of us, not to feel like we'd become pawns in what was, in many respects, a highly profitable scam.
Panodrama shows the real meat of Brown's recording in a segment in which Robinson goes to meet Sweeney — which Robinson believed was being set up as a gotcha interview for the planned BBC Panorama documentary, but which he instead used to question Sweeney on statements allegedly made to Brown and others about the programme.
Bezos' implication seems clear: Trump and the Saudis are somehow tied to the Enquirer's scoops. Indeed, as if there were any need to juice things up further, it was even suggested by others—although far from proven—that the Saudis had used Israeli spyware to hack Bezos.
The president has also endorsed Bible literacy in public schools, defended the rights of students to pray, and defended faith-based adoption agencies that have been under attack for declining to place children in same-sex households.
The Mötley Crüe frontman took to Twitter in August to repost a letter warning that supporters of President Trump would face pay back if the Democrats win back the White House. The message ended with the threat that the payback would see a gargantuan metal mountain made of confiscated guns emblazoned with the face of Hillary Clinton.

The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has voted to allow its ministers to enter same-sex marriages and continue serving.
But what will likely sustain the film's successful box office run is word-of-mouth, from mom to mom and dad to dad, letting each other know that this is a safe movie — one that is not politically preachy in the slightest, but which reaffirms classic American values that Hollywood wishes it did not have to embrace to succeed.
The real con man here is the Catholic priest, the spiritual grifter who has taken all that money from Paulie (Tony Sirico) without ever telling him he cannot buy his way out of his sins.
Proposition 187 of 1994, which sought to deny non-emergency social services to illegal aliens in California, was the first of several important referendums to be passed by voters but reversed by the judiciary, with help from Democrat-run state governments that refused to defend them in court. (Another was Proposition 8 of 2008, which established traditional marriage in the state and was overturned in the courts.)
Earlier this year, 53 companies signed a brief, also organized by the Human Rights Campaign, calling for protections for transgender students, after one student was denied entry to the preferred restroom.
In his 2018 wish list, John Zmirak, Senior Editor of The Stream and author of the new Politically Incorrect Guide to Catholicism, writes that he hopes Pope Francis repents or else resigns this year.
China's gender imbalance is most acutely felt today in the country's rural areas; women have increasingly abandoned rural communities in recent years for urban centers to pursue educational and career opportunities. The exodus of women from rural villages has left men in the communities with limited marriage prospects. These men are likewise referred to as leftover men, or sheng nan.

O'Donnell has been very outspoken about her disdain for the president, and their infamous feud dates back nearly a decade. She has previously called Trump an orange piece of sh*t and a bully who is not even qualified to run a game show.
The outcome does not protect my children from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected, he said, calling the process one-sided.
She followed with another impressive film, Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, starring her and James Stewart as an innocent couple ensnared in an international assassination plot. She sings Que Sera, Sera just as the story reaches its climax and viewers are beside themselves with suspense. The 1958 comedy Teacher's Pet paired her with an aging Clark Gable as an idealistic college journalism teacher and her student, an old-school newspaper editor.

To do its part, the Government of Canada today will introduce legislation that will help ensure transgender and other gender-diverse people can live according to their gender identity, free from discrimination, and protected from hate propaganda and hate crimes, it continued.
If Buttigieg counters with a campaign for a path to citizenship for most here, but also in favor of mandatory e-verify (a completely humane way to enforce immigration law in the interior of the country via employment), he'd break out of the pack. Just actively treating the fears about immigration as legitimate — and seeking to assuage them — would mark him as a different kind of Democrat.

Sexual information, it's just going to be the norm, that the schools will start promoting the idea of sexual orientation or gender identity as just part of the curriculum, without us knowing about it, or having an opportunity to opt in or opt out because it'll just be considered discrimination.

Instead of cashing in by taking lucrative film roles after Tom Jones, Finney took a long sabbatical, traveling slowly through the United States, Mexico and the Pacific islands, then returned to the London stage to act in Shakespeare productions and other plays.

Virginia Democrats walked off the floor of the House of Delegates this week during a pastor's opening prayer that condemned abortion and same-sex marriage.
Discrimination based on sexual orientation includes discrimination based on an individual's actual or perceived romantic, emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to other persons, or lack thereof, on the basis of gender. LGBTQ people, including gender nonbinary people, also commonly experience discrimination because of sex-based stereotypes. Many people are subjected to discrimination because of others' perceptions or beliefs regarding their sexual orientation. Even if these perceptions are incorrect, the identity imputed by others forms the basis of discrimination.
As a result, it seems evident that many people are now happy thinking about some far-flung conspiracy involving big shots in the White House and Riyadh, featuring sidebars in Los Angeles (home of Lauren Sanchez and Michael Sanchez) and New York City (home to AMI). Indeed, just on April 2, one of Bezos' employees, Fred Ryan, publisher of the Post, wrote a tough op-ed for his newspaper headlined, It's been six months since Jamal Khashoggi's murder, and Trump has done nothing—the point being that the Bezos Post is still harping on the connection between the Saudis and Trump. And that's a clear signal—go get 'em!—to investigative reporters, both at the Post and everywhere else.
Unless global action is taken, the Taliban will remain a hugely wealthy organization, with a self-sustaining funding stream and outside support from regional countries. Its role as a destabilizing force, not only in South Asia but globally, will only be enhanced by the withdrawal of the United States from the Afghan theater, and its expected return to the power equation in Kabul, the NATO report warned.

Why have we said that? Why are we opposed to judging people on the basis of their race? Not simply because we were taught to oppose doing that though we were, but because it's immoral, and it's immoral because we believe in God. That's the real answer.

In addition to protesting the illegitimate Supreme Court ruling of last year, and the [lawsuit] threats to religious liberty and freedom of conscience which have arisen in its wake, we will also be standing against the unprecedented and deplorable overreach of the Obama administration in trying to force the radical gender ideology of LGBT extremists on our communities.

The Korean example is even more telling, in part because the separation of the two societies has lasted longer and continues to this day. South Korea now is more than 20 times richer than North Korea, a difference manifested in virtually all indicators of human welfare. South Koreans are obviously freer than North Koreans but they also seem happier than North Koreans; have you ever seen a North Korean smile? South Koreans are also taller, healthier and live about 12 years longer than North Koreans. Every year many thousands of North Koreans risk their lives seeking to escape to South Korea.

While their marriage was extremely high profile in some ways as two experts in self-promotion became a team, the two did not appear together in public all that frequently. And the inner workings of their marriage were usually a well-guarded secret that took years to spill out into public view. On Keeping Up with the Kardashians, West appeared only occasionally, mostly serving as an oft-discussed off-screen character, and unlike other Kardashian couplings, viewers didn't see even made-for-TV versions of fights or especially tender moments.
In California, conservatives are the truest of true believers, whose isolation has made them all the more ardent about their beliefs.

As long as Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association stand by Franklin Graham, it must be said that these once-vaunted organizations have forgotten their original Christian missions, abandoned the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and are complicit in the spread of dishonest, discredited election conspiracy theories and the deadly, unpatriotic, white-nationalist terrorism at the U.S. Capitol incited by those lies. Our faith in Jesus Christ demands that we do better than this. Your fellow Christians from across the country call on you to fire Franklin Graham, or to resign from the Board in individual protest.
On Wednesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) asked Cohen about the money. The exchange went like this:
Feminist economics might be imagined as a way of radically reconceptualizing and reorienting the study of economics rather than just an approach to make gender inequalities visible. Taking such a position, this course surveys foundational and contemporary feminist scholarship on epistemology, methodology and economic theory in order to trace their evolution over time and explore their transformative potential.

Morse contends the root cause of the sexual abuse problems of both men is the same:
Numerous Christian churches have been added to the SPLC's list along with racial supremacist groups, under the guise that these religious groups are anti-LGBT. Have these churches ever committed acts of violence against LGBT Americans? No, most simply believe, because of their religious faith, that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
The Court rejected that argument, holding that First Amendment rights do apply, and the only questions are how broad or narrow of circumstances violate the religious person's rights, and whether those rights include only the free exercise of religion, or free speech as well.

Also cited was Zezen's criticism of the No Nazis essay on the site arguing Wikipedia should be open to people of all ideologies or beliefs so long as they follow site policies. Those calling for the ban and the administrator who imposed the ban in turn cited the No Nazis essay as justification for banning Zezen.

If the Equality Act were to become federal law and public school curricula become further entwined with sexual orientation and gender identity ideology, Planned Parenthood is well-positioned to further its presence in public schools and take advantage of an additional avenue to promote both sexual orientation and gender identity ideology as well as the organization's hormone treatment services. In other words, additional sexual orientation and gender identity curricula could become yet another marketing tool for America's abortion giant.

Lucas was very open about the way he and other liberals were taken by complete surprise by Trump's election — something that many conservatives in California understood intuitively was a foregone conclusion once Trump made it clear he would stand and fight like Reagan did, instead of cutting and running like the Mitt Romney wing of the party. But unlike most liberals, Lucas admitted that he believes it is important to understand how we got here, instead of simply demonizing Trump and his supporters.

This unholy alliance with Trump, coupled with the GOP stacking of the Supreme Court, may get the bishops the abortion ban they so covet, but it will not end the debate, the editors whine.
I am not defending underage marriage at all — I just don't think it's the same thing exactly as pulling a child from a bus stop and sexually assaulting that child… The rapist, in this case, has made a lifelong commitment to live and take care of the person, so it is a little different.

An undercover male police officer answered the ad, posing as a 16-year-old. The two began to text, arranging to meet at the fashionable Frisco Stonebriar Centre Mall AMC movie theater. Instead of a hook up, Figueroa was arrested as he and the undercover officer walked to a unisex bathroom. In July, a federal grand jury indicted Figueroa.

But, hey, maybe this is a good thing.
For more than a century, March 8 has been globally recognized as International Women's Day. The movement is celebrated by the United Nations, which works to create a historic legacy of internationally-agreed strategies, standards, programs and goals to advance the status of women worldwide. While American women still have plenty worth fighting for, the status of women internationally doesn't compare. Women's strikers' decision to hijack this day shows just how far out of touch they are with the more serious problems facing hundreds of millions of women worldwide—problems ranging from human trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced marriage, and female genital mutilation to brutal murders masked in honor. Our foreign sisters need our help, and International Women's Day should be about them. Not us.

As the New York Post reported on February 6, Michael Sanchez's lawsuit against Bezos suggests that he had been conspiring with his sister Lauren–who is now, he suggests, engaged to Bezos–back in 2018 to leak the news of the romance.

That order, signed on the National Day of Prayer, loosened restrictions on the Johnson Amendment, which had been needlessly silencing clergy since 1954.

In May, Obama chose to endorse Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who is seeking her fifth term, over former State Senate President pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) in May.

The Church of God in Christ, a seven-million-member black denomination, unanimously passed a historic resolution affirming the value and dignity of every human life and opposing the practice of elective abortion in America. A key excerpt from the Resolution on the Sanctity of Human Life reads: COGIC is one of the largest historically black Protestant denominations, which also include the National Baptist Convention, the National Baptist Convention of America, the Progressive National Convention, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. Like these other groups, COGIC does not have a history of institutional involvement with causes typically associated with the Republican Party. Yet given the direction that abortion policy is moving in this country, its leaders felt compelled to act.

But the question is, what is it exactly? Now that we're waging war on white supremacists, can somebody tell us in very clear language what a white supremacist is?

Bernie Sanders and others who have endorsed the idea of relieving students of the burden of paying for college address the debt side of the problem only. And it's not clear that this is really much progress at all since professors will still have to be paid, buildings maintained, textbooks purchased. So while a student might not have to foot the bill, that debt will need to be borne by workers—which is really just a transformation of individual debt into higher taxes. And if history is any experience, the government will not effectively be able to contain the burgeoning costs. If anything, quite the opposite: cost increases will accelerate once individuals no longer see the bills.
Sessions gets it. He understands the necessity of preserving the Rule of Law and of rectifying Obama-era abuses. Look at just some of the things the Justice Department has already done to erase Obama's corrosive legacy and to restore the Rule of Law: The DoJ won a 7-2 victory at the Supreme Court in support of President Trump's existing legal authority to implement a Travel Ban designed to safeguard the homeland.

EPPC Fellow Mary Rice Hasson commented on the far-reaching consequences of passage of the Equality Act, warning the measure would extend the federal octopus into almost every aspect of Americans' lives, imposing 'gender identity' requirements that effectively snuff out the sex-based rights of females, endanger parental rights, and silence religious believers in the public square.
Rape gangs — or grooming gangs, as they are often termed in the mainstream media — are generally comprised of Muslims of South Asian heritage, and their victims are generally non-Muslims; typically white working-class girls but often Sikh and Hindu girls, too.
China was the second-worst offender because of its widespread use of human trafficking for state-sponsored forced labor as well as extensive sex trafficking to provide Chinese men with wives. Years of sex-selective abortions have resulted in an estimated 33 to 37 million more males living in China than females, an imbalance that is fueling sex trafficking from multiple nations into China for forced marriage or commercial sexual exploitation.

It has often been suggested that this is because it is difficult to secure convictions without the testimony of the victims, who are often reluctant to speak against the perpetrators — usually African-background parents — but this is contradicted by the record of the French authorities, who face a similar phenomenon but have mounted hundreds of successful prosecutions.
Muhammad V was the 15th king of Malaysia since it peacefully separated from the United Kingdom in 1957 and the first to abdicate. If he had remained on the throne, the 49-year-old monarch would have served only three more years, because Malaysia has a unique rotational monarchy in which the ceremonial royal office is passed between nine sultans. The throne has little practical power but great ceremonial importance, including the king's role as symbolic head of Islam in Malaysia.

Mass incarcerations, especially of black males, is a myth. Look, the Democrats did this. They have screwed this country up. They screwed it up with failed, liberal urban polices.

The reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago.

Recently, I purchased an Apple computer. The computer was sold to me without filters to block out pornography. I was not provided with any warning by Apple that pornography was highly addictive and could alter my reward cycle by the manufacturer.

Naturally, I fell in love with my computer and preferred having sex with it over all other persons or things, as a result of classic conditioning upon orgasm.

Yet here we have socialism in America attempting a comeback, and on precisely those terms: This time we're gonna get it right. Serious people advocate it; there is a sustained cultural push to apotheosize it; a major political party is pushing aggressively toward it. How is this possible?

Vanity Fair is not a fan of this particular romance, saying it is a good thing there are no photos of them together, because that level of self-serving malevolence in one single frame would likely crumble the earth onto itself.

One Yazidi sex slave begged the West to bomb the brothel at which she was held to end her suffering. A video in November showed militants laughing and joking about buying female Yazidi slaves.

Supposedly long sentences have also been exposed as shockingly weak, with rape gang ringleaders the public were told would be locked up for decades being released after just a few years — such as Ahdel Ali, who was freed after serving just eight years of a supposedly 26-year-term, due to the headline figure being an aggregation of multiple sentences to be served concurrently, with the fact that most criminals only have to serve half their prison terms in custody before being automatically released on licence in Britain not taken into account.

But he never shows how socialism creates this totalitarianism, and he leaves open the possibility of a more benign socialism that avoids it.

It's something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that's not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church where it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you're supposed to conduct yourself.
Twenty-two percent of college graduates were delayed by at least two years in moving out of a family member's home due to their student loans, a survey of millennials by the National Association of Realtors found.

8:15 PM: Biden says this is not about co-pays and Sanders says there are various loopholes that will still make Americans pay for treatments. Sanders says we need a simple system that exists in countries like Canada–if you are an American, you get the health care that you need. Sanders wonders if we have the guts to take on the health care/pharmaceutical industries that are funding Biden's campaign.

And it's a shame, because the UK really did seem ready to embrace its new American princess when the pair tied the knot in a fairytale wedding at Windsor in 2018. Furthermore, the British people really do support the monarchy and do tend to cut them a lot of slack. So what could possibly have gone wrong?

Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo transition surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study. A Pentagon report commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that rates for genital surgery are exceedingly low- 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.

The papers have run with repeated claims that Meghan has had to be told off by other Royals including Princess Catherine and the Queen herself for failing to treat members of the Royal staff with sufficient respect.

It is unclear how prevalent FGM is in the United States, but Comey's FBI believes Nagarwala and Attar's FGM operation has been operating for over a decade and has mutilated girls from across the American Midwest. Both the doctors and their named victims are part of the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim sect, named only as a particular religious and cultural community in the complaints. Dawoodi Bohra is based in India and boasts over a million members across the world, with increasing numbers in the United States. The sect's leadership has made clear time and again that FGM is absolutely necessary as an act of religious purity and a religious obligation for all women and girls.
Home Secretary Priti Patel, who has styled herself as tough on crime, illegal immigration, and foreign criminals even as crime rises, illegal immigration increases, and deportations fall dramatically, struggled even to get a promised Home Office report on the ethnicity of grooming gangs published — and when it did come out it represented a huge step backwards from previous probes, such as the Alexis Jay report.

We took the high road. Unfortunately, Johnny's team immediately went to the press and began viciously attacking Amber's character, Spector added. Amber is simply a victim of domestic violence, and none of her actions are motivated by money. Amber is a brave and financially independent woman who is showing the courage of her convictions by doing the right thing against Johnny's relentless army of lawyers and surrogates.

As a Hispanic pastor, he understands the importance – particularly in minority communities – of involving fathers in every aspect of their children's lives, writes FRC president Tony Perkins. Despite what some people would have you believe, dads aren't just an optional accessory.
Part of the present crisis is that people do not wish to see the true causes and cover them up with the help of propaganda phrases from the homosexual lobby, the cardinal said.
Yes, indeed, it's an outrage of hypocrisy that while sternly preaching one thing – lockdown; extreme social distancing – Ferguson should be practising quite another with his younger, punch-above-his-weight mistress. (She's 38; he's 51).

Sanders wants Biden to be straight with the American people. Biden says that is not true when Sanders asks if he has ever been on the Senate floor time and time again calling for cuts to Social Security. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sanders says. He says Biden just contradicted yourself. Sanders says one minute he said he was not on the floor and now he's bringing up deficit. Biden tries to weasel himself out by saying he never voted to cut Social Security but that is not what Sanders asked.
Politico then spends a half dozen paragraphs on Reade's apparent struggle for money. Did you know this monster tried to hide her car so it wouldn't be repossessed?
We're still living through very hard times but justice, equality and real freedom are not always a tide rushing in. They are more often a slow march, inch by inch, day after long day.

The Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the progress of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers free preventive care including contraception by repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.

Twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also launched a podcast ahead of the 2020 presidential election titled You and Me Both with Hillary Clinton, interviewing a range of personalities, from activist Gloria Steinem to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

Chinese observers warned that the current rate is not stable and has declined to an alarming degree following the publication of the latest statistics.

It matters, of course, which journalistic account is true—or at least which is more true. If the Guardian is correct, then we have the stuff of a serious international incident—involving major players in Saudi Arabia, in Israel, and maybe also in the United States. And if all that's true, then one can only guess at the laws that might have been violated, norms trampled, and torts committed. But if the Journal version is right, then we just have a . . . salacious sex scandal.
I went over to shake his hand and he headbutted me. He wasn't very good at it, but he did make contact, but the only damage was a very slightly swollen lip, to former Prime Minister said.
A man was walking in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Brian Wendling initially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene. Police were investigating and didn't identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.
Another reason why hate crimes might be on the rise is because being a self-appointed hate crime watchdog is a highly profitable enterprise. The poverty part of SPLC's name reeks of Orwellian irony, as the group has raised nearly a half-billion dollars in donations from the likes of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and actor George Clooney. This is in addition to the cozy relationship the SPLC enjoys as the trusted flagger for Big Tech giants, serving as judge, jury and executioner for content on platforms like Google and Facebook. An IRLI investigation revealed that the Department of Defense was using SPLC manuals for its employee training on hate groups and hate crimes until the practice was discontinued in 2017.
In November, Florida Angel Mom Kiyan Michael, a member of the Black Voices for Trump advisory board, drew attention to the divide between the Democrat Party and black voters on the issue of school choice.
Recent weeks, however, have brought a surge in nationalist activity.

It is unclear exactly which of these two children Jill Biden seems to have overlooked on Sunday. It is not, however, the first time one of the Bidens has failed recognize all of Hunter's offspring. Last year, when Hunter's lovechild with Roberts was first confirmed via DNA, the former vice president refused to discuss the child, choosing instead to mock a reporter for broaching the topic.

Pastor Ruben Diaz Sr., a Trump-supporting Democrat on the city council in New York's 18th Congressional District, has raised the concern of progressive party members after tossing his hat in the ring to run for the 15th district's open House of Representatives seat.
Another young activist, identified as 21-year-old Fernando Holiday, has also made inroads into conservative politics. Also gay and from a working-class background, he was recently elected as a city councilor in São Paolo for the right-wing Democrats party, he says young people have long been disengaged in Brazilian politics.
Senator Crane said Deal's veto is another example of how the political class is bought and paid for by corporations and lobbyists. Rather than standing up and protecting the 1st Amendment, the political class would rather sacrifice those rights to keep the money flowing.

In January, four wealthy men kidnapped and gang-raped a seven-year-old boy. Officials said the men, while drunk, kidnapped the young boy and took him back to their settlement. They killed him with a rope after they raped him.
The Democrats may have likely sensed this, as the issues of containing Iran and empowering women never crossed paths during their discussion. The debate opened with discussion on Iran, leaving the candidates open to condemn Trump for weakening the Islamic revolutionary regime.
The order also took the side of Priests for Life against the Obama mandate that every employer must provide abortifacient drugs and devices to their employees. Priests for Life was among dozens of petitioners who challenged that Obama mandate all the way up to the Supreme Court. In 2018, HHS finalized a rule that protected faith-based organizations from that mandate.
Other reporters were pushing for the Dolphins to sign the quarterback who started the anthem-kneeling movement to protest police brutality and social injustice, and recently settled his collusion lawsuit against the NFL.
Justice Democrats argued that Democrats need a candidate who will fight racism and inequality with solutions that match the scale of the crises we're facing — not piecemeal compromises with corporate America and the party of Donald Trump.

We don't want to completely ban Valentine's Day but it's not for teenagers, a Nahdlatul Ulama secretary said at the time. Teenagers see it as a time to express love and affection and they often end up in sex parties, like in the West.

Sanger is quoted by Fox as stating: Wikipedia's ideological and religious bias is real and troubling, particularly in a resource that continues to be treated by many as an unbiased reference work. Sanger also told Fox the deck is too stacked on Wikipedia for it to ever be salvaged and he has instead focused on helping facilitate the spread of alternative online encyclopedias through his Encyclosphere project. Those efforts are complicated by Big Tech's reliance on Wikipedia in their campaign against fake news online in keeping with messaging suggested to Wikipedia's owners by a public relations firm run by the Clinton Foundation's Head of Communications.

Debate raged about who was to blame for her death after a car crash in Paris: the drunken limousine driver, the paparazzi, or the Royal Family… Diana's funeral, held in Westminster Abbey, included both tradition and innovation, with Sir Elton John singing a special version of Candle in the Wind, originally written about Marilyn Monroe, and her brother's eulogy which attacked the press and criticized the Royal Family. English pomp and circumstance combined with celebrity status. Hundreds of thousands watched the services on screens in Hyde Park and the funeral was carried live on TV and radio.

Hughley said, When Rudy Giuliani says that Black Live Matter are terrorists — let me tell you something, I don't think all black people or all white people are all anything. But to be castigated with the same brush that they did Micah Johnson would be the equivalent of me telling you all white people think like Dylan Roof, and that would be deeply offensive. And to allow somebody to say that on air —and to go unchallenged and say that on air because a lot of people want that narrative because it edifies their perspective.
Honestly, Barbara Bush always struck me as a much stronger woman than this, someone with poise and self-control. Even more surprising is that she would admit to such a thing. If that were me, I would at least have the self-respect to keep something so embarrassing to myself.

Sanders says he voted against it in the House and he was right. He says leadership is having the guts to take unpopular votes. Biden seems agitated and snaps and claims he didn't help write the Bankruptcy Bill. Sanders says he's proud of his leadership on many issues and says Joe has come around. Biden seems like someone who is entitled and doesn't like being called out on inconsistencies. In many ways, he's reminding Democrats of what they hate about Trump.

I think it's also important that we stop seeing religion used as a kind of cudgel as if God belonged to a political party. If he did, I can't imagine it would be the one that sent the current president into the White House.

Naturally, the intellectually dishonest French doesn't give Graham credit for this. But in his defense, French is probably too blinded by his own self-regard to see anything other than the bloodlust powering his Mighty Sword of Moral Justice.
Yes the anti-abortion movement is primarily about controlling women's bodies under the premise (for many, sincere) of saving lives, and yes this law is primarily the work of white men HOWEVER a white woman sponsored the bill and a white woman signed it into law, the Oscar-winner's lengthy Instagram message began.
And we might also add that on January 31, the Guardian–which seems to be Bezos's go-to journalistic outlet–reported that in 2019, the FBI interviewed Bezos about his allegations of a hack, as part of, the newspaper said, a larger investigation of that Israeli company, NSO. So while it's possible that Team Bezos is just blowing more smoke, it's also possible that there's some fire there, somewhere.
Stirling said the U.A.E. has a long history of prosecuting rape victims, instead of their attackers, because the nation's interpretation of sharia law bars all sex outside of marriage, as well as homosexual sex and same-sex marriage.

The fact is the UK Independence Party has been pusillanimous on this issue for years. Only Lord Pearson, a friend of the Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders, attempted to grasp the nettle on Islam, Shariah, and the issues emanating from migrant communities whose sons and daughters are not only failing to integrate, but are becoming more and more radical as time passes.
He has the rare gift of having both a deep intellect and an innate ability to relate to people from all walks of life, John Sykes, president of entertainment enterprises for iHeartMedia said of Clinton, describing him as a born storyteller.

If I had not stopped, I would have had children and if I had children, it would be a chaos for me. If you're going to live in a prison, it's better to die, the 17-year-old said.
Outside of sexual crime concerns, the call for an open and systematic sex education system in China comes as Beijing struggles to combat the nation's plummeting birth rate, which continued reaching near-record lows in the past five years despite the end of the communist one-child policy, which mandated all women who become pregnant a second time must kill their children, either through abortion or infanticide. China currently imposes a two-child policy on its majority Han ethnic group, but few families have taken the opportunity to increase their size.

Because of the failure of these Church leaders to teach the faith and its doctrine on sexuality and marriage, Morse asserts the Church is no longer the guardian of traditional sexual morality. Instead, the Catholic Church has become a symbol of hypocrisy or worse.
The Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran campaign against the holiday is unique in that the group advocates against any romantic dating all year round. Instead, the group's leaders urge young people to remain single and immediately marry someone if they are interested in a relationship, with no period of dating prior to marriage in which the two would get to know each other. A profile published by PRI last year described the group as a movement to eliminate premarital dating, derided as a sinful, Western ritual that will ruin your life. These young Muslims instead want to push their island nation, long branded as religiously moderate, toward practices that more closely resemble norms in, say, Saudi Arabia.
.@SymoneDSanders just said on @CNN with @ChrisCuomo that the CDC said it's safe to vote on Tuesday. That's wrong.

DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Those lights that are — that are just shooting out from the Lincoln Memorial along the reflecting pool, I look — it's like almost extensions of Joe Biden's arms embracing America. It was a moment where the new President came to town.
Maybe people in America think being a 'Sir' is a big deal, he said. But I think we should all be misters together. I think the 'Sir' thing slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery. And it also helps keep us 'quaint,' which I'm not a great fan of.
Egypt scored the lowest on the report's Gender Equitable Men scale and is the source of the most striking headlines. For example, CNS News reports that 70 percent of Egyptian men approve of female genital mutilation. For that matter, 56 percent of Egyptian women also voiced approval for the hideous procedure, which is illegal but not unheard-of, in much of the world.
Isn't it incredible that five of the six justices who signed on to that opinion just last year imposed gay marriage across America despite thousands of years of tradition and law!
This is a cultural horror, and as a new Lancet study reported by Business Insider noted, it's affecting American Indians and Alaska natives as well:
She later added, As you'll recall in his dissent last year in the gay marriage case, he really, really reserved special vitriol for Justice Kennedy; went out of his way, not just to insult in his dissent Justice Kennedy's reasoning, but really went after him, calling it pretentious and calling it akin to fortune cookies.

Domestic and honour violence can be banded together as I believe they emanate from one verse of the Koran – Sura 4, verse 34, which reads: Men have authority over women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.
A new United Nations survey of male attitudes toward gender equality finds precious little appetite for it across the Middle East.
I'm reminded of the early scene in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress where the pilgrim, Christian, is warned by the Evangelist to pursue eternal life and flee the wrath to come. But how, Christian asks, do I do this? The evangelist points to a wide field. Do you see yonder wicket gate? No. Do you see yonder shining light? Christian looks hard; he can barely see it. He thinks he sees something. The evangelist is undeterred; he urges Christian to follow the light, and he will reach his desired destination.

Fact: The Equality Act's changes to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act do not uphold Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act. Gender-identity policies will require biological males to be permitted to participate in female-only activities …
The legislation, dubbed H.R. 5 or The Equality Act, is unlikely to get through the GOP-led Senate. But it marks the Democratic Party's almost unanimous support for the revolutionary claim that every American must accept that each person's legal sex will be determined by the individual's current choice of gender identity.

It seems to me a perfectly tenable position to believe that Christian bakeries should be free not to bake – say – gay marriage cakes because they do not hold a monopoly market position. Anyone can set up a bakery, with minimal effort. There are minimal barriers to entry. How difficult can it be to bake a cake, shove some pink icing on top, then add two male figurines holding hands? Even I could do that if you rang me up and gave me reasonable notice.
A specter is haunting America — the specter of socialism.
Openly gay candidate Buttigieg said, My emotions about this president is not what's going to matter most. I'm not interested in expressing my anger about him as much as I am in defeating and ending this presidency. If we want to have a debate or fight over any number of things from the difference between how I approach service and the way he did. The fact that I was packing my bags for Afghanistan, as he was working on the seventh season of Celebrity Apprentice. We could have that fight. Or if somebody who wants to raise the question of which one of us has the more traditional attitude on marriage we can have that fight.
Everything above is a lie. Pence has never commented on Buttigieg's or anyone else's lifestyle. But to win media love, this demagogic bully fabricated a straw man to smear a decent man as a bigot.
Biden has also embraced numerous elements of the Green New Deal, which would be a major setback for U.S. production and manufacturing, and cost American taxpayers trillions of dollars while causing major job losses.
We should not be celebrating this kind of behavior, the former number one ranked player insisted.
When you get married, you go into it knowing that divorce – or you should go into it, in my opinion, knowing that divorce is not an option, Hostin said.

But even so, perhaps the United Kingdom's much-reduced sense of reserve is not easy to acclimatise to if coming from the emotions-trump-facts luvvie world of Hollywood. Nobody expected Meghan Markle to break with Royal protocol in a television interview with British network ITV in 2019 to talk about how hard her life was — not least the interviewer, who appeared genuinely amazed to have his questions answered.
Considerably more resistance emerged at the Polish-language Wikipedia where a thread about the public consultation prompted users to vote on rejecting the code of conduct only to become frustrated when informed its implementation was already decided by the Foundation. Editor Zezen was particularly vocal citing the 2019 editor revolt, English Wikipedia banning profile pages supporting traditional marriage last year in a move criticized by family and Christian organizations, and English Wikipedia users advocating a No Nazis standard while allowing Stalinists and other left-wing extremists. Zezen argued similar political bias could be imposed on all Foundation sites, including to persecute critics of political correctness. One user called the code of conduct's approval the beginning of the end.
The court was also told the sheikh divorced Princess Haya without her knowledge on February 7, 2019 — the 20th anniversary of the death of her father king Hussein of Jordan.
We're going to bring America together, Joe Biden told us today, but not everyone is going to be included. Unity doesn't mean every single American because not everyone who is born within our borders really is an American, some of us are beyond the pale of citizenship, morally. We may have American passports and birth certificates, but effectively, we are hostile foreigners, we are the enemy, we must be defeated.
These scandalous remarks are an insult to the millions of French people mobilized since 2012 to peacefully show their attachment to the family, the first place of solidarity and refuge for the most vulnerable. These remarks are also an insult to the victims of Islamist terrorism whose suffering they relativize, the group said.
This is also the backway way progressives say Americans are not allowed to build their own communities, not to protect their communities from foreign migrants who lower their wages, crowd into their children's blue-collar schools, and fuel the divisive diversity which helps progressives grab power in fractured societies.
The scene above is from early in the third season, and my guess is that it was at this point Chase decided he needed to lay down the law, to come straight out and tell the audience what the series is about — shopping malls and ethnic pride parades — and that nothing these characters do is in any way okay.
A partial transcript is as follows:
Back in June, Cabrera's car was set ablaze in a wooded area and her four children, who are now in police custody, have not heard from her since. Cabrera's body has not been found.

In his Facebook post, Schwarzenegger appealed to his social media followers to continue the fight: Gerrymandering has completely broken our political system and I believe my best platform to help repair it is from the outside, by campaigning for independent redistricting commissions.

Christie says, I'm freezing cold, my back is sore, and I just want to go to bed.
Whereas Unbreakable cost $75 million to produce all those years ago, in 2016 Shyamalan wrote and directed Split for a mere $9 million, and surprised everyone, not only with a $280 million worldwide gross, but a closing scene with Willis's David Dunn that tied his new hit into the Unbreakable universe.
Let's move on to forced marriage. Child marriage is rife in the Muslim world, and it is not, as some suggest, simply a consequence of extreme poverty. The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, for example, has endorsed it on Islamic grounds for the simple reason that Mohammed married a six year old, therefore it must be permissible.
Abu-Shareb has remained in Palmor's committee, despite a backlash of Bedouins accusing her of betraying her community.

The Catholic Herald reported some of the criticism of the new recommendation.
This is a disgrace, all those (men) who wear earrings and are happy about it, he said. The security forces should arrest those who raised the flag of the perverts.
Unbreakable ends where the second act of origin movies begin — with Dunn realizing he is indeed imbued with superpowers and the introduction of the super-villain.
Biden, defending his bailout vote, claims if the banks wend under, all the little people Sanders cares about would have been in big trouble. But Biden says he agrees with Bernie that some of them should have gone to jail.
Girls threatened with forced marriage might appear anxious, depressed or withdrawn, lose interest in schoolwork or disappear from social networks such as Facebook, they said.

Traditional Islamic jurisprudence allows Muslim men to marry up to four women — a custom initially meant to ensure the welfare of widows and orphans of those who had died fighting for Islam.
What's next? Will Kimmel taunt people because they might be Jewish or black?
It may have been the case that Meghan privately believed that under the staid exterior, curly sandwiches, and luke-warm tea the British people were actually mega-woke and just praying that some forward-thinking Royal would finally bring up their children as gender-neutral.

While Starr did not answer the questions, it appears he has been very active in supporting gay rights groups on his base. Photos, like the one above from a 2014 Dyess Pride running event and the photo below from a 2015 Pride Alliance 5K Color Run held last summer, show the Colonel not only approved of the gay organizations but actively engaged in their event–with great enthusiasm and pride. The photo below shows Colonel Starr wearing a gay pride t-shirt painted in rainbow colors.
It was not clear why Comey failed to inform Trump of the specific activity described in the dossier, the claim that he hired a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers' (urination) show in front of him.
Good Christians sin. Good Christians fall short. Good Christians give in to temptation. Good Christians sometimes do terrible things. But good Christians also feel shame, regret, guilt, and an overwhelming desire to repent and ask for another chance.
Despite fierce opposition from her family, last year Haridas married a Christian man. Under the pretense of reconciliation, Manoj and his parents invited the victim to their sister's home and from there took her to the Yoga and Charitable Trust. All of this allegedly happened between July 28 and 31 this past summer.
Tracy Hsueh, a saleswoman in her 50s, said she felt Tsai's government had been fanning hatred towards China.
In Arlene's Flowers, an Evangelical Christian grandmother named Baronelle Stutzman likewise declined to participate in a same-sex wedding by doing the floral arrangements for the ceremony. Like Phillips, she had previously served gay customers – including the man who filed this complaint against her – but declined to be part of his same-sex wedding because of her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. (Stutzman is a Southern Baptist.)

Indian government officials expect several million people to gather in northern India's Uttarakhand state over the next several weeks as part of the Hindu Kumbh Mela pilgrimage.
At the heart of Lovell's complaint about McAdams is his charge that McAdams should be responsible for the negative emails the teaching assistant received. McAdams writes to Lovell, After posting some vitriolic emails sent by others to Ms. Abbate, you went on to tell the university that 'a professor inflicting this type of personal attack on a student' is unacceptable as if I either had a hand in these emails or launched a comparable attack on Ms. Abbate. Both implications are outrageous and you know it.

It is utterly shameful that the Iranian authorities are treating peaceful activists who seek women's equal participation in decision-making bodies as enemies of the state. Speaking up for women's equality is not a crime. We are calling for an immediate end to this heightened harassment and intimidation, which is yet another blow for women's rights in Iran. Rather than addressing Iran's disturbing record on women's rights the Iranian authorities have once again opted for repression, accusing women's rights activists of collusion in western-orchestrated plots in a bid to maintain their discriminatory practices towards women.
And so, Glass was green-lit, which completes the promised Unbreakable trilogy, and what a terrible disappointment it is.
In my research, there's never been a film that stars LGBTQ actors made with the association of the MLB, the NBA, the NFL, or the NHL, Aaron told the magazine. [But] it's not a film about being gay.

8:02 PM: Biden, when asked what he would say to Americans confronting the new reality, says his heart goes out to people who have lost loved ones and calls for a national rallying. Biden says we have to take care of those who have been exposed and are likely to be exposed with test kits. Second, he wants to make sure every state has at least 10 drive-thru testing centers. He talks about the need for additional hospital beds. Says Department of Defense and FEMA can set them up. Biden says we have to deal with the economic fallout.

We have regularly and strongly objected to what the bishops were doing in the public square regarding the issue of abortion because the strategy has proven most effective in dividing the Catholic community and turning the institutional church into a partisan enterprise, the editors note.
Another theme Chase often touches on is how America is becoming Generica, a country where no matter where you go, every place looks like every other place by way of the cancerous spread of corporate chains and box stores. The visual character of this country has literally been bulldozed by hotels, restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores, strip malls, and coffee shops that all look alike.

Meghan — and by extension, Harry— has turned out to be an absolute master of the genre. Flying to Africa to hector the rest on climate change was a highlight — working to save the world, one private jet at a time.
As for the violence that left five dead, the court evangelical simply shrugged it off: We knew he had flaws when he ran for office in 2016. There is absolutely nothing Christian about that. With blasphemous preachers like Graham blessing Trump's Big Lie and pretending antifa was behind the attack, it's no wonder the failed coup featured crosses and Jesus saves banners and flags. Graham and the religious right must be held accountable for their deadly dishonesty. Graham gets away with his hatred and conspiracy-theories by hiding behind the humanitarian work of Samaritan's Purse and his late father's name. It's time for Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) to realize that by propping up Franklin's unchristian extremism, they are abandoning their Gospel missions, undermining democracy, and helping incite white-nationalist sedition.

Robinson and Eberle added that, as Trump's policies have helped the black community, Blexit activists and individuals such as recording star Kanye West have refused to be shamed into silence by the Democrats and the left-leaning news media. They wrote:
One of the most contentious is FGM so let me start there. FGM is sanctioned by Islam. Fact. There are several hadiths which justify it. You can read these here, but I shall recount just one which should be enough to ring a few bells: Abu al-Malih ibn `Usama's father relates that the Prophet said: Circumcision is a law for men and a preservation of honour for women.' Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167.

So, it turns out that British people really aren't that fond of hypocrisy. And one of the most obvious forms of the art this century has come from the media class, lecturing the ordinary folk on not taking flights while on jet aircraft themselves.
This unholy alliance with Trump, coupled with the GOP stacking of the Supreme Court, may get the bishops the abortion ban they so covet, but it will not end the debate, the editors whine.
This is what is so dishonest about the Remainers' question: Why doesn't the government have a plan?
In the provincial and increasingly simple-minded world of Hollywood, casual racism is usually the telliest tell of all, its own kind of tired spoiler that predictably informs us that Gil is either a villain or will suffer a comeuppance — because that's what today's Production Code of Political Correctness requires. In the end, though, Gil steps up, and within the context of the situation, is revealed to be both heroic and loyal.
As a Hispanic pastor, he understands the importance – particularly in minority communities – of involving fathers in every aspect of their children's lives, writes FRC president Tony Perkins. Despite what some people would have you believe, dads aren't just an optional accessory.
Everything Johnny had told us that she'd been threatening had actually come to be, Stanhope wrote of the claims that Heard later made in court. It blew up in the news, raced through the Internet like a plague and blew up on Twitter like it was the McMartin child abuse scandal. People are swarming with torches on social media.
Buttigieg is gaining perception as a young, progressive, charismatic answer to Trump, and it is a reputation with which he seems very comfortable. If the substance of your ideas is progressive, but there's mistrust about them among conservatives, you have three choices, he told the magazine:
Monica Lennon, health spokesman for Scottish Labour, remarked that Calderwood's actions were extremely disappointing and hypocritical, and asked: If the Chief Medical Officer can't lead by example what chance do we have of convincing people to stay at home?
Many other plausible theories could be advanced as to why the Republican Party lost the last two elections, none of which would involve its supposed over-dependency on the Christianity of its base.
The second pillar he identified as the family. He spoke of values and the percentage change in children born outside of a marriage, from fewer than five percent in the 1950s to over 40 percent today. He added that many families today are buffeted by economic pressures and social engineering. He lauded the Faith and Freedom Coalition and used these are reasoning for him fighting to expand the child tax credit and for fighting alongside Ivanka Trump to expand paid family leave
Nur Qistina Fitriah Ibrahim, a transgender woman who has not undergone a sex-change operation, and her friend, freelance fashion photographer Muhammad Fadli Bin Abdul Rahman, were arrested in Abu Dhabi on Aug. 9, reported ABC News on Thursday. Police stopped them at Yas Mall as they tried to eat at a food court, said Radha Stirling, CEO of the advocacy group Detained in Dubai. Fadli at the time of his arrest was wearing a white T-shirt, a bow tie and earrings, his brother Muhammad Saiful Bahri Bin Abdul Rahman said.
The Front National candidate's globalist rival in the election, Emmanuel Macron, backs gay marriage and has previously said he is in favour of extending the right to PMA to lesbian couples.
As Breitbart News reported in October, Biden was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina due to his ardent support for abortion on demand.
Further, a jaw-dropping 57 percent of non-working white males in the same age bracket are now collecting disability benefits. Some of them are receiving benefits from multiple government programs. Almost half of the men who have dropped out of the labor force are taking some form of pain medication on a daily basis, according to a 2016 study cited in the article.
Though intended to document and prevent hate crimes, committed against Muslims, the Runnymede report rapidly transitioned into classifying 'Islamophobia' as a mental pathology – deemed to have eight separate characteristics.
GORSUCH: Senator, I try to treat each case, and each person, as a person, not a this kind of person, not a that kind of person — a person. Equal justice under law is a radical promise in the history of mankind.
Hi, I had an amazing experience during 8 years of Catholic school where I was surrounded by teachers, coaches and administrators who challenged me to be the best student I could be every single day. I had so many opportunities that I would not have if I went to public school — AJ Abate (@aj_abate) January 24, 2019
While the issue of child marriages has come to prominence in Europe since the 2015 migrant crisis, it has recently made headlines in the U.S. after the Associated Press uncovered more than 8,000 cases of the American immigration system being used to attempt to facilitate marriages between adults and children.
A February report by the EPI showed that roughly 50 percent of college graduates have seen their wages remain flat since 2000. The average wage paid to graduates is up by just 8.8 percent, and the top 10 percent of graduates have seen their wages climb by only 15.1 percent since 2000.
Wenzel, 27, makes his living teaching wealthy but uptight German men how to approach women. But this year, he decided to also volunteer his skills to help Germany as it struggles to integrate more than 1 million refugees who have arrived over the past two years, most of them from war-torn Muslim countries with vastly different relations between the sexes.
The couple told ABC News that they spent about $50,000 to get pregnant–from operations to fertility treatments to the IVF treatments.
Sullivan's liberalism allows him to recognize the reality of biology and sex — and of nations and borders — but it does not allow progressives to become liberal moderates.
For those who will not work towards delegitimizing the entire system (aka the State of Israel) that facilitates daily 'brutality' against Palestinians, he intoned a curse, 'The blood of the people of Palestine will be upon them,' the essay states.

Harry once took his military roles very seriously. But now the British tabloid press reports the Royal Marines, who he enjoys the honour of leading, haven't heard from him in months. What is going on?
Mr. Bean's face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar, The New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, The Blue Angel. It said he showed a quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat.
Ultimately, what is most conservative about the film is that the hero, Wachowski, chooses his life in small-town America over a new career opportunity in San Francisco. Through saving Sonic the Hedgehog, he comes to realize that the ordinary things he does for people in his town are more precious than the high drama of police life in the big city.
The story began almost two years ago when McAdams publicly defended a student who was told by a teaching assistant that his Catholic views on man-woman marriage were homophobic and not welcome in her ethics class. For his defense of the student, McAdams was investigated for 17 months by a faculty committee and publicly excoriated by Lovell in his official capacity as Marquette president. Lovell summarily suspended McAdams and banished him from the campus.
The video in question was produced by Christian radio host Michael L. Brown who has previously spoken out against the homo-hatred and ugly rhetoric from some Christian groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church. In the video, Brown states that same-sex relationships are like other sins, but one that Jesus died for. Brown states that homosexuals can be Christian but notes that it has long been a Christian belief that sex only takes place in the marriage of a male and female.
Le Pen wants to lower the retirement age to 60 years old from 62, while Macron wants to unify a complex web of retirement rules for various public and private-sector employees, while maintaining the current retirement age.

(Not that it's better to have the full benevolent attention of the Nanny State turned upon you, as the situation in the inner cities demonstrates. Inter-generational welfare dependence is precisely what the creators of the Great Society promised would not happen, back when they swore the success of their programs would be measured by how many people no longer needed them. Today, defenders of the welfare state insist its success should be measured by how comfortable and sustainable poverty has become.)
After the Reagan administration, Whittlesey became a partner and of counsel with several prominent law firms and served on numerous corporate boards – including Munich Reinsurance, Valassis Communications, Sunbeam, Nestlé USA and Schindler Elevator USA – as well as on institutional and charitable boards. She served as President of the American Swiss Foundation in New York City until 2008 when she became Chairman Emeritus. She received four honorary doctorates and numerous other awards. She was especially touched by having a prize-winning tea rose named for her in 2006.

According to TMZ, the messages also portray Hammer as domineering, and demanding that the women call him daddy, as well as repeatedly mentioning rape, biting, and marking in a sexual manner.
If you want to know how rigged this poll is, check out the underlying numbers…
The court ruling was passed by two judges who argued that is was not uncommon for women to falsely claim they have been assaulted, and said that the Muslim woman reporting the abuse was less credible in her case because she reported the violence to the police rather than attempt to solve it within the Muslim community, Aftonbladet reports.
They said of the Americans during the war that there were three problems with them: oversexed, overpaid and over here. Well, this little bloke, Macklemore, or whatever his name is, is coming over here. Well mate, go home, we don't want you here. The people that will be there at this game don't want you.
GORSUCH: No, Senator. And I'd be delighted to actually clear this up.
The Manif Pour Tous movement reacted to the comments in a press release, saying they would be lodging a formal defamation complaint against Schiappa in court.
Lady Justice Arden had accepted their case on almost every point, she added, saying: We lost on a technicality, that the Government should be allowed a little more time to make a decision. So there's everything to fight for, and much in the ruling that gives us reason to be positive and keep going.

If the medieval past (globally) is being weaponized for the aims of extreme, violent supremacist groups, what are you doing, medievalists, in your classrooms? she wrote. Because you are the authorities teaching medieval subjects in the classroom, you are, in fact, ideological arms dealers.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are also listed as defendants in the suit and are accused of failing to treat him as equal to his fellow United States citizens based solely on whom he chose to marry.

The Bidens, who have been sequestered in Delaware since mid-March because of the Coronavirus, hosted a live stream discussion on how families could adjust to life amid the pandemic. During the introductory portion of the town hall, Jill Biden elaborated on the precautions her own family was taking.
In an article in December 2015, the New York Times lamented that President Obama's full-court press for homosexual rights had sometimes backfired, resulting in increased hostility toward gays rather than greater acceptance.
Communities which support FGM often consider it a prerequisite for marriage. Many also see it as a religious obligation although it is not mentioned in the Koran or Bible.
Through masterful storytelling, character building, Gandolfini's second-to-none artistry, and Chase's ear for the perfect song (which elevates every Sopranos episode), this moment never fails to wreck me.
All candidates who mentioned the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal, expressed support and promised to return to the negotiating table with Iran. Later in the debate — largely thanks to an increasingly acrimonious feud between Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — all posed as enlightened feminists, ready to put taxpayers' dollars to work to make American women's lives better, without acknowledging their vow to almost certainly make Iranian women's lives worse.
Robertson said lowering standards in order to produce more Green Berets goes against a fundamental SOF truth that every Green Beret is taught.
The Islamic State opened an official marriage office in Raqqa in the summer of 2014 to help newly arrived women find jihadi husbands. Upon signing up, the women and young girls could expect a jihadi to arrive at their door and propose.

Although she is handing off her seat to Murphy, Batchelder will continue hearing cases on a part-time time basis instead of retiring, continuing with Jones to set the pace for dozens of new Trump-appointed constitutional conservatives.
And her carefully curated persona stood in contrast to his erratic public moments that often resulted in wild statements and over-sharing tweet storms.

Actually, I hated all three endings.
In an exclusive interview with ABC News' chief anchor George Stephanopoulos ahead of the release of his memoir on Tuesday, Comey described numerous conversation he had with Trump about the contents of the dossier.
In one episode, Tony sums this up brilliantly as a series of distractions until you die.
In July, the Reporter's executive editor also declared abortion supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to be the future of the Catholic Church.
With one same-sex proposal now out on the internet, it should just be a matter of time before we see more of them across the country, he wrote.

The charity said some families use the long school summer holidays to pull children out of Britain and marry them off abroad to strangers.
Junior is also my favorite character in the series. Every line of dialogue is profane poetry, and usually funnier than anything you will hear in a sitcom (I've been farting into the same sofa cushion for eighteen months!)
The two authors at Michigan State University — Matt Grossman and Daniel Thaler — admitted to Breitbart News that attitudes on their openness to change charts may be guided by rational calculations. Grossman told Breitbart News:
Let's finally accept that we are one country and act like we are and make this a better place for everyone. Unity. No decent person opposes that.
In his meeting in Brussels in early February, the outspoken prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments had strong words both for the leaders of European nations and for certain cardinals and bishops who distort the Catholic faith.
The Reversal of Fortune star reportedly told journalists gathered at a press conference Thursday that he wanted to put to bed the brewing controversy that was threatening to dominate his tenure at the prestigious cinematic event.
The bill provides hardworking people who enrich our communities every day and who have lived here for years, in some cases for decades, an opportunity to earn citizenship … The bill creates an earned path to citizenship for our immigrant neighbors, colleagues, parishioners, community leaders, friends, and loved ones—including Dreamers and the essential workers who have risked their lives to serve and protect American communities.
Jones and Batchelder have served as the deeply admired twin conservative matriarchs on the federal bench for more than a quarter century. Several other judges have worn the mantle of unflinching originalists, like Diarmuid O'Scannlain on the Ninth Circuit and David Sentelle on the D.C. Circuit, but with their elegant and maternal demeanors, Jones and Batchelder have stood out as doyennes of the federal bench in a dignified manner reminiscent of the United Kingdom's Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher.
Listen, my beliefs don't perfectly align with Graham's. But when he says something like God put Trump in the Oval Office, I'm content to let it go, whereas Super Evangelical David French sees only a mercenary opportunity, an opening that allows him to abuse his faith as a transaction that might get him on TV or win a retweet from Chris Cuomo, a transaction that puffs him up with a sense of moral superiority.
The statement repeatedly praises the economic migrants who have illegally taken jobs and wages from many millions of Americans, including mother of young children, disabled Americans, ex-convicts, blacks, untrained Americans, and isolated Americans:
It's interesting actually because I'm playing 'Same Love' and they're going through right now trying to legalize same-sex marriage in Australia, so I'm getting a lot of tweets from angry, old white dudes in Australia, Macklemore said.
Another committee member, Issa Zeki, told the daily that a man can make it up to his other wives by spending more nights at their homes after the lifting of restrictions to equal the number spent with each wife.

Mosques have a certain influence on these people, observed Professor Aslan, with 70 per cent saying they attended prayers every Friday, and 55 per cent saying they believed unbelievers would burn in Hell.
Starbucks, too, was also lauded as a company in touch with current LGBT culture, as evidenced by its advert featuring drag queens Bianca del Rio and Adore Delano, while Starbucks's CEO Howard Schultz gained applause from Zappulla for famously [putting] his money where his mouth is by telling a shareholder who opposed the company's vocal support for gay marriage to invest elsewhere.
Worse, he is mocking the faith of religious voters who support President Donald Trump.

For years I've written about mommy bloggers' obsession with BPA, the danger du jour perpetuated by the hysterical, click-seeking women's media. It involves the level of BPA found in water bottles, canned foods, and even thermal cash-register tape. Popular celebrity bloggers like Gwyneth Paltrow and the Food Babe have hyped several inherently flawed studies that blame everything from breast cancer to diabetes on BPA. Unfortunately for the fear-based online media, last week a new study came out that Paltrow, the Food Babe and other wannabe health bloggers can't be too thrilled about – GMO Crops Don't Harm Human Health, Report Says.
In December, a Zogby Analytics survey found black support for Trump is at the highest levels of the year, reported Paul Bedard at the Washington Examiner.
During a June 2016 Pittsburgh campaign speech, Trump called out China specifically over theft of American trade secrets and vowed to remedy trade disputes with tariffs. He specifically cited section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which he used to impose the tariffs on Thursday.
In the afternoon session, Mr. Cohen identified the president's son, apparently incorrectly, as an unnamed Trump Organization executive referenced in the charging documents filed against him by federal prosecutors in New York. The executives were referenced in connection with the plan to reimburse Mr. Cohen for the payment to Stormy Daniels. In the charging document, federal prosecutors said the first executive, Mr. Weisselberg, forwarded an invoice from Mr. Cohen to the second executive, and it was approved. The Journal has previously identified Executive-1 as Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Mr. Cohen testified today that Executive-2 in the charging document was Donald Trump Jr.
By recklessly keeping the nation in a perpetual state of agitation on matters of race, immigration and gender, the SPLC all but guarantees that we will get more fake hate crimes in the future. This will only serve to polarize the nation even further, and it needs to end immediately.
Democrats are calling on President Trump to use his executive authority to reunite the 2,400 separated children with their parents. We are calling on him to resolve many other problems his executive order created. And we are calling on his administration to stop its sabotage of our health care system and work with us on a bipartisan basis to protect and improve it.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded to a question about abortion Wednesday by reminding the country that President Joe Biden was a devout Catholic.
The colonel and Dyess AFB seem actively involved in the business of promoting the social engineering project underway. In July 2014, the Dyess AFB official newspaper published an article from Col. Starr's own public affairs office promoting Progression, acceptance and our LGBT Airmen.
In all seriousness though, Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran has been heavily criticized in the past by people accusing the movement of being a cash grab taking advantage of gullible young conservatives. There are also concerns that the movement, which has members predominantly in their teens and early 20s, would normalize young and underage marriage involving people who may not be mentally, economically, and/or physically ready for a serious life commitment.
The Hollywood star tweeted in September that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 don't compare to the gun deaths that Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is responsible for.
Brilliant performance. Brilliant character. Beyond brilliant writing.
The singer-actress tweeted hysterically back in June about the impending end of the world.
Whereas Unbreakable is deliberately paced and beautifully structured, Glass is ponderous, repetitive, and horribly structured. Almost nothing happens during its bloated 129-minute runtime, except James McAvoy's exhausting and tedious showing off his incredibly-amazingly-awesome acting skills using the split personality of his tiresome Split character, Kevin Wendell Crumb aka The Horde aka The Beast aka please shoot me before he does it again.
This comes from a way of considering religions as a sub-culture rather than an integral part of culture. I fear that this approach, which is the offspring of the Enlightenment, endures to this day, he said.
Stone pondered FBI Director Chris Wray's possible involvement in the FBI raid of his home.
Heard and Depp were married in February 2015 and the actress filed for divorce after just 15 months. The actor previously had a 14-year relationship with French model Vanessa Paradis and was married to Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1986.
Still, Turner-Smith also noted that some black people were not happy with her relationship with a white man.
Police investigators seized the victim's computer in an effort to understand whom she may have been in contact with in the hours leading up to her death. They are also questioning all those who knew Ashley, including her boyfriend, friends, and neighbors, but as yet have not been able to come up with a plausible hypothesis for the murder. People describe the woman as a private person, but friendly and likable, and say they would often see her out walking her pet beagle, Scout.
This was not Prime Minister Orbán's first salvo against gender ideology, with the Hungarian government having already taken steps to defund gender studies and related courses at universities.
At least 150 females, including pregnant women, were executed in Fallujah by a militant named Abu Anas Al-Libi after they refused to accept jihad marriage, said the Ministry. Many families were also forced to migrate from the province's northern town of Al-Wafa after hundreds of residents received death threats.
HR 38—which the U.S. House of Representatives passed on December 6—would rectify this abominable situation by requiring all 50 states to give reciprocity to all citizens with a valid firearm license issued by any other state. It would, of course, like current reciprocal agreements between various states, require the license holder to abide by the laws of the state in which he or she is carrying a firearm. This bill would treat the firearms license in the same manner states now treat driver's licenses and marriage licenses. (Marriage licenses are issued by each state and all are recognized by all 50 states along with the privileges that are afforded by them.)
Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist of Imperial College, London resigned from his role as a senior scientific advisor to the British government Tuesday evening.
For all those who hyperventilate at the unveiling of the latest SPLC hate map, there is an alarming and ever-growing list of fake hate crimes since Donald Trump has been president. Many of these incidents get lavish media coverage when they occur. Significantly less coverage is given when they are later revealed to be the work of politically motivated scam artists.
In an April 7 fundraiser for a gay advocacy group, Buttigieg suggested the Pentagon should accept the core transgender demand that people's legal sex be determined by their sense of gender identity, not by their actual genes and male-or-female body. He said:
Their paper also included a set of charts showing how Democratic and GOP elites show more openness to change than do Democratic voters, GOP voters, and swing-voting independents.
That was a mistake by @BernieSanders. He can argue about whether Biden's plan is strong enough but Paris matters.
British flags and pictures of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle hung all around the Cat & Fiddle Pub early Saturday. It's just a few miles from Markle's childhood schools.
He worked deep into his 70s, in such projects as SundanceTV's Hap and Leonard, the film The Seagull with Elisabeth Moss and Annette Bening and the play Endgame by Samuel Beckett at the Long Wharf Theatre. His last foray on Broadway was in Love Letters opposite Mia Farrow in 2014.

After mounting a campaign for assistance on Twitter from her Bangkok airport hotel, Alqunun was allowed to temporarily stay in Thailand under the care of the U.N. refugee agency, which ruled her claim for asylum valid and referred her case to Australia. Following that decision, Australia's Home Affairs Department said it would consider this referral in the usual way, as it does with all UNHCR referrals.
The study went on to observe that mortality rates for many other groups have fallen since the turn of the century, including Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and most dramatically black Americans, although their death rates remain generally much higher than whites. The study that originally highlighted rising mortality rates in 2015 explained it was really more a matter of the rates for white Americans of recent generations flattening out, while most other groups saw significant improvement over the past 15 years. The improvements have been attributed to successful crusades against smoking, drug abuse, and other unhealthy lifestyle choices, combined with expanded treatment for maladies like HIV.

Ayoub replied; Peace for those who obey Allah and His Prophet. but those who oppose them their [there] is no peace for them. A screenshot of the exchange can be seen below.
What prompts this firing is Mefli's own therapist, Dr. Kupferberg (Peter Bogdanovich) who, in his own underhanded and cowardly way, forces Melfi to confront a study that says sociopaths cannot be treated in therapy. In fact, treating a sociopath only makes them a better criminal.
Stasi has yet to register any outrage over this issue of journalistic ethics.
Morocco produced some alarming results about sexual harassment, with over half of men saying they have sexually harassed a woman, and over 60 percent of women reporting they have been harassed. A higher percentage of female Moroccans (78 percent) agreed that provocatively dressed women deserve harassment than men (72 percent).
At the end of the day, the success of our country comes in large part from our longstanding tradition of encouraging families seeking a better life to leave behind everything they know to begin contributing to the United States. They deserve the opportunity to live a dignified life. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle must act expeditiously to bring this legislation to the floor for a vote to create the modern, compassionate and humane immigration system that our nation deserves.
Two major factors are contributing to the population decline: decades of indoctrination urging families to limit themselves to one child and the inevitable result of that indoctrination in a sexist society, 70 million fewer women than men nationwide. Even if women wanted to have more children, the mass killing of female fetuses has not left enough women of child-bearing age alive to sustain the population.
The media reported the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) considered a bill to outlaw pedophilia as anti-Islamic and blasphemous in February. The bill outlaws underage marriages and recommended harsher punishments for those entering conjugal contracts with minors. CII Chairman Muhammad Khan Sherani said Islamic laws say marriage can be solemnised when a girl attains puberty.
The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. We have a problem, as Ms. Trump has indicated. Others in Washington, DC, should take note.
After a disastrous snap general election result for the Conservatives, which saw the party lose 12 seats and resulted in a hung parliament, a small group of leftists have staged a protest outside Downing Street.
The court decision was heavily criticised by legal experts like the former president of the Swedish Bar Association Bengt Ivarsson who wrote on Twitter: This is one of the most prejudiced and strange judgements I have read. Not completely unexpectedly dictated by two lay judges. Still, no one in charge wants to do something about the lay judge system.
Ms Akhter attempted to file for divorce, which her partner rejected, with Mr Khan saying that they were not legally married, but only under Islamic law.
I think there was a petition today to ban me from playing, he added. I'm gonna go harder.
The left is blacklisting us for referring to biological men as he.
In addition to Javanka's personnel decisions on Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Chris Christie, Michael Flynn, Luther Strange, Gary Cohn and Anthony Scaramucci, Javanka wanted John Kelly made chief of staff, believing he would be loyal to them. When that turned out not to be the case, they decided to get rid of Kelly. He was gone.
It's destroyed my consulting business, explained Stone. I lost my health and life insurance in December, because I could no longer pay the premiums. I had to sell my car. I had a small fund set aside for the college education of my children which I had to liquidate, which had come from the proceeds of my books sales.
With movies trending for more explicit sex, she turned to television to recoup her finances. The Doris Day Show was a moderate success in its 1966-1973 run on CBS.

Other members of the Royal Family have taken their places inside St. George's Chapel, including Harry's uncles Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, his aunt Princess Anne and his cousins Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice.
Laura Keiter, a communications director for Media Matters, said in a statement to TheWrap: Anyone remotely familiar with Tucker Carlson won't be surprised by the misogyny. But what's striking about these clips is that it comes off as so natural and normal for him; it's like you're getting a chance to see who Tucker Carlson really is and what those ideas really mean. The clips provide insight into the misogyny of his current Fox News show.
One of the counselors at the center reportedly told Haridas that no court or police will touch them and that they have been running this business for the last 15 years.

House Democrats have passed the radical Equality Act once again, claiming it will merely amend federal civil rights law to ensure sexual orientation and gender identity are protected classes, even though the Constitution already provides protection for the rights of all American citizens, regardless of their identity group.
8:19 PM: Sanders says we need to learn from the last bailout that the government only cared about Wall Street. Biden claims we have learned this lesson (terrible answer by a candidate who seems like he is also winging a lot of this). Biden's hectoring tone is also not the most reassuring.
Child marriage remains a serious problem in Pakistan, with 21 percent of girls marrying before age 18 and 3 percent marrying before 15, it said. Women from religious minority communities remain particularly vulnerable to forced marriage. The government has done little to stop such forced marriages.
Both organizations claim to advocate for women's rights, but actually now focus primarily on abortion rights and appear to place gender identity above biological sex.

Another case concerned a 13-year-old girl who said she was forced to marry an 18-year-old Iranian over Skype. A 17-year-old boy was also married on Skype after his family found out he had a white girlfriend.
I think that secularity accompanied by a solid legislation guaranteeing religious freedom offers a model for moving forward, he said.
In addition to protesting the illegitimate Supreme Court ruling of last year, and the [lawsuit] threats to religious liberty and freedom of conscience which have arisen in its wake, we will also be standing against the unprecedented and deplorable overreach of the Obama administration in trying to force the radical gender ideology of LGBT extremists on our communities.
On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues; the staff and volunteers working on food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected.
Sachs wrote that the Cairo Plan of Action, which called for universal access to reproductive healthcare including abortion, was one of the most important Millennium Promises, noting that population policy is integral to the overall challenge of sustainable development.
And they have taken 17 individual meet records that previously belonged to 13 different girls, the legal non-profit added.
The problem is, while I think I would win in the end, lawsuits can take a long time, and I think Marquette is willing to spend to fight me, McAdams said to Campus Reform. I would expect a major lawsuit would be well into six figures for them, but they're probably willing to spend it. My lawyers, on the other hand, are working pro bono.
Over the weekend, Vaness Paradis — Depp's girlfriend of 14 years and the mother of his two children — and Lori Anne Allison, to whom Depp was married from 1983 to 1986, defended the actor in separate written statements.
Chinese state media outlets did not address the northeastern outbreak in its coverage of the CPPCC's agenda.

The likely reason why Republicans have declined in popularity among the non-religious is GOP's long habit of identifying itself as a Christian party, he states. The later attempt to add in a Judeo- prefix has done little to stop the bleeding.
The court decision was heavily criticised by legal experts like the former president of the Swedish Bar Association Bengt Ivarsson who wrote on Twitter: This is one of the most prejudiced and strange judgements I have read. Not completely unexpectedly dictated by two lay judges. Still, no one in charge wants to do something about the lay judge system.
Bannon also posited that without Nancy Reagan as First Lady, there for the comfort, aid and really protection of him, it might have been a very different Presidency, would it not?
Despite the law, the LGBTQ community is active in some parts of the country, the Guardian pointed out.

Amid rising migration alongside the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to China, Former President Barack Obama largely ignored the rising blue-collar death toll, according to a March 2019 report by the Washington Post, titled The Fentanyl Failure. The report concluded:
When Malcolm arrived, he found that there was no boy — there was only POPSquad. For the 126th time in two years, the group — an acronym for Prey on Predators — had catfished a man on the internet, posing as an underage teen on hookup apps and luring him into a meetup, this time at an empty home whose owner allows it to be used for the group's stings, according to POPSquad.
Reached out to source close to @Kaepernick7 and asked if he was interested in filling Miami QB vacancy. Was told 'yes, he's training hard and ready to play' could get interesting. La Canfora tweeted on March 15.
So will Michael Sanchez be able to tell his side of the story? He has his own explanations and theories, which seem to focus on, for example, the supposedly nefarious role of de Becker, Bezos' security adviser.
The victims, too, were largely of foreign origin, with the police saying most were Chinese — although they added that a minority are Romanian and UK nationals.
New research suggests that one of the main reasons the damage has been so deep and lasting is that the jobs lost from Chinese imports were not just from companies downsizing or becoming more efficient but from closing manufacturing plants altogether. The paper by four economists — Brian Asquith of the National Bureau of Economic Research and University of California at Irvine's Sajana Goswami, David Neumark, and Antonio Rodriguez-Lopez — finds that the so-called China shock operated mainly through deaths of establishments.
In its analysis of social attitudes revealed by the survey, the newspaper hailed the birth of a new Ireland which is best exemplified by referendum victories in 2015 and 2018 for same-sex marriage and for the removal of most abortion restrictions.
The ambitions of the twice-divorced socialite were thwarted, however, as a proposed marriage to Edward lacked public approval and would have clashed with the new king's role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England.
Xinhua did not discuss the ongoing coronavirus crisis in the nation's northeast. In March, Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the origin city of the Chinese coronavirus, and declared that the outbreak has basically been curbed in China.

GORSUCH: No, this one I — I don't.
The New York Times reported last week:
On Wednesday, Mrs. Trump's Twitter account @FLOTUS posted the following message: I urge you to not be afraid to fail, as failure will never have the power to define you, as long as you learn from it.
GORSUCH: Senator, I'd agree with you it's highly inappropriate.
I'm the first person to go on national television in any administration and say, 'I supported gay marriage,' Biden boasted.
Some of the victims are as young as 13 and they are frequently threatened with violence and emotional blackmail, pressuring them to marry older men they may have never met.
10:40 PM: On CNN, Sanders doesn't quite answer the question when asked if there should be primaries on Tuesday. But he says it doesn't make a lot of sense to have elderly poll workers checking registrations, etc. He points out New York postponed a primary shortly after 9/11 and two states (GA, LA) have already postponed their primaries.
He said: There were people [in Britain] who, in good faith, were sometimes as angry as you are, and they said that the source of all their ills was Europe. It's rubbish! he said, explaining that voters were swayed by Leave campaign buses emblazoned with messages reading that you were going to save something like 36 billion pounds if Britain were to leave the EU.
Having separate boys' and girls' sports has always been based on biological differences, not what people believe about their gender, because those differences matter for fair competition. And forcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics. Connecticut's policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.
8:51 PM: Sanders says this is about leadership and says Biden wrote some of the bill. He says the bankruptcy bill prevented students from getting out of student debt. Sanders says he voted against it in the House and he was right. He says leadership is having the guts to take unpopular votes. Biden seems agitated and snaps and claims he didn't help write the Bankruptcy Bill. Sanders says he's proud of his leadership on many issues and says Joe has come around. Biden seems like someone who is entitled and doesn't like being called out on inconsistencies. In many ways, he's reminding Democrats of what they hate about Trump.
She said she had gone through the foster system herself and realized first-hand how terrible the system is. She lived in over 15 foster homes, group homes, and juvenile hall by the age of 16. These children come into the system through no fault of their own and once removed we would like to believe that the government is going to give them a better place than the one we removed them from. But that is not the fact for many of these children.

This is my life's work. And so I keep working on this about what's changing in America. I'm studying families that go bankrupt. And the credit card companies, half-dozen giant credit card companies figure out that if they can get the bankruptcy laws changed, that what will happen is they can improve their bottom line by just a little by keeping people locked out of bankruptcy, Warren said.  Never mind that there's people are head over heels in medical debts, that they've had job losses that have put them way behind, that they've had a death or divorce in the family, but they've been cheated by credit card companies and mortgage companies. Never mind any of that. Just improve the bottom line for the credit card companies.
The action is set in the fictional rural Idaho town of Green Hills, whose inhabitants are portrayed, for the most part, as ordinary, decent, and tolerant people — if a bit boring. The fact that the hero happens to have an interracial marriage, with veterinarian Dr. Maddie Wachowski (Tika Sumpter), plays no role at all, except — possibly — for Dr. Sumpter's urbane sister, who disapproves of the marriage for reasons that are never quite made clear. But the town simply overlooks race.

our citizenship process should reflect that. So today we are announcing changes to strengthen citizenship, to make for a stronger Australia, stronger citizenship, stronger citizen … before you apply to be a citizen. You will need to have competent English. That is a vital requirement … also, we need to ensure that our citizenship test enables applicants to demonstrate how they have integrated into and engaged with our Australian community, so that they're part of the community. They've lived here as a permanent resident for four years, they speak English, share our values, be integrated. Those are critically important elements. I believe that they will be empowering for applicants. This will be good for the applicants, good for the nation, underlining our Australian values at the very heart of Australian citizenship, Australian citizenship is the foundation of our democracy… these political values are what bind us together. That's what keeps us together in the midst of our diversity.
If there's a thin bead of sweat forming in your upper lip, as you think about all of this, that's okay. Don't feel shame. Shame isn't necessary now. Joe Biden is here.

The corporation acknowledged, however, that Some of the footage which has been released was recorded without our knowledge during this investigation and John Sweeney made some offensive and inappropriate remarks, for which he apologises.
It is just heart rending to think that parents were not able to determine the health care, what they thought was best for their daughter, and the judge actually stepped in and took away their custody, Hartzler said.
One thing I'm not is humble anymore. I'm sick of being humble. I really am, Zeta-Jones said in an interview with British the newspaper The Daily Mirror. So sorry I'm rich, so sorry I'm married to a movie star, so sorry I'm not so bad looking.
The Queen & Slim star also dissed Britain — likely because of Brexit — in an interview with the Sunday Times where she said she intends to look for a home outside the U.S. to raise her children. The seven-months pregnant actress insisted that America is a terrible place to live because the racial dynamics over here are fraught.
After millions of people rose up in sorrow and anger over what was happening, Donald Trump did what he always does. He blamed Democrats for a mess he created and proceeded to use these children as leverage to seek legislation that would enshrine the President's hatred and fear of immigrants into law.
Yelp, Apple, and PayPal all plan to sign an amicus brief encouraging the Supreme Court to rule that refusing service to LGBT people based on religious beliefs is not a First Amendment right, but rather anti-LGBT discrimination.
Unite the Country, which was created by a foreign agent for the government of Azerbaijan in October, spent nearly $1.2 million to underwrite Biden's candidacy. The money was primarily spent on targeted ad buys throughout the month of December in Iowa, where Biden finds himself trailing both Sen.

The inquiry included a broad array of resources: investigative interviews with current and former AMI executives and sources, extensive discussions with top Middle East experts in the intelligence community, leading cybersecurity experts who have tracked Saudi spyware, discussions with current and former advisers to President Trump, Saudi whistleblowers, people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Hurricane Harvey ended its nearly six-day reign over Texas as the now-tropical storm moved ashore in far-southwestern Louisiana Wednesday morning. As many as 30 people are suspected dead.
Last year, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to end FGM in Kenya by 2022. At the time of the announcement, women's rights groups argued that the goal was unrealistic due to many factors in Kenya, such as remote locations, severe poverty, and a high prevalence rate in certain parts of the country.
The number of young girls in Somalia subject to female genital mutilation (FGM) has soared in recent weeks amid lockdown measures imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, according to a report from the children's rights organization Plan International on Monday.

The video was flagged in June 2018 in an internal listserv, Yes at Google, which is run by Google's human resources department, according to those communications and other internal documents, which a source shared with TheDCNF on the condition of anonymity. The listserv has more than 30,000 members and is devoted to policing microaggressions and micro-corrections within the company, according to its official internal description. The internal backlash to the video grew large enough to merit a response from a Google vice president, who said the video would no longer be eligible to run as an advertisement, the human resources team announced to the listserv.

Previous efforts to address problems on the page about communism were also raised by Fox News, noting editor Narssarssuaq had repeatedly added to the communism article a line noting mass-killings have been attributed to communist governments. The line was eventually removed with one editor objecting on the article's discussion page by claiming Stalin was a Christian and therefore it would be like including his acts under the article on Christianity adding, Communism didn't kill these people; Stalin did.

In the wake of the 2005 London bombings on 7/7, huge amounts of public money were funnelled into Muslim advocacy groups, first in the UK, aimed at tackling a form of bigotry largely invented eight years earlier.

The case is also not the first time a woman in Vienna has been the target of rape by multiple asylum seekers.

Mother Teresa had no less of a shrewd trademark–her homespun, blue-striped, white cotton sari. Reported value: about a dollar. She wore it before the beribboned audience in Stockholm who awarded her the Nobel Peace Prize and refused to change from it before her first meeting with the pope, saying, `These clothes are good enough for God.' The pope knelt to kiss her hand and said he felt humbled.

Her 2015 blog post, Three Cheers for White Men, argues that white men have played a role in the development of certain rights enjoyed by women throughout the Western world. In the post, Fulton highlights specifically chivalry and courtly love, the development of marriage into a sacrament valid only if both men and women consented and elements of feminism, which were supported by philosophers like John Stuart Mill.

The Democrats might as well sign a suicide pact, not just for their political future, but for the future of the economy of the United States for all these people to be piling on this Green New Deal, which is a complete and utter ridiculous document. To ban fossil fuels in ten years … first, food production would collapse, second, anybody trying to get food into the cities would fail, because the people on the outside of the cities would capture it so they could have it, and the people on the inside is where it would start. The rot would start in the center of the big cities where people would begin starve to death after they'd eaten all their pets. They would actually start killing and eating each other. It's not just a religion, it's a toxic mix of religion and ideology, of politics and religion. It's just absolutely toxic. … They are against humans. Why would humans be against humans?

We can also add that on January 28, Bezos's newspaper, the Washington Post, dipped a careful toe into this murky pool; its reporter, perhaps mindful of her career, was careful to print both sides of the story: Three people close to AMI [owner of the Enquirer], she wrote, say that Lauren Sanchez's brother Michael Sanchez—a talent manager in Hollywood who had previously placed stories in AMI publications—is the only source for their report on the Bezos affair.

This is why conservative and libertarian critiques of socialism have gotten nowhere. The conservatives and libertarians keep chanting, Socialism doesn't work, and they produce charts and tables to prove it. The socialists glance over the charts and tables and then they clamor for more socialism. They don't care about data because no amount of data can refute a dream. The socialist mantra is, We don't care if it hasn't worked. We will figure out a way to make it work. The critics are focused on yesterday, while the socialists are all about tomorrow. Owen Jones expresses this futuristic hope, A socialist society…doesn't exist yet, but one day it must.

As it happens, in referring to Trump's loyalty I had in mind two episodes. The first was the topic of the week: Omarosa. Why did he stick with such a wretched individual for so long, despite warnings from everyone around him that she was no good? Loyalty to a fault. The second was when the left showed its teeth in his first days in the White House and maliciously attacked Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions as white nationalists and racists and even neo-Nazis. Any other Republican, freshly in office, would have thrown them under the bus, however false the accusations. Trump's fortitude, his refusal to back down under withering fire, is also a character trait, and an admirable one – actually the key to his success where Bush and congressional Republicans had repeatedly failed. Loyalty.

Today, unless you live in a particular state that has signed reciprocity agreements with other states, your right to defend yourself and/or your family may end at the state line. Let that sink in. When you cross a state line, you may lose your right to self-protection. States such as California, Delaware, and New York offer no reciprocity with any other state, leaving all nonresidents defenseless as soon as they cross over that imaginary state line. No other right is treated with such disdain.

If socialism has produced a worldwide record of misery and tears, and if countries must flee socialism to experience prosperity, what then are American socialists up to? Why would they want to import misery and tears? They insist they are not doing this. In a sense, they disavow history, both the political and the economic legacy of all professed socialist regimes. They insist that everyone else got it wrong. They emphasize that at least some of those depressing examples, maybe all of them, were not real socialism.

Much like it appears with Smollett, the SPLC has been crying wolf to excess with its nonstop accusations of hate. The fact is that most Americans just want to live their lives in peace alongside their neighbors, regardless of their color, faith or orientation. It is only when seen through the politically agenda-driven lens of the SPLC and the mainstream media that America looks like a hopeless cauldron of hate and division. Instead of being treated as a watchdog for extremism, the SPLC should be shunned as the irresponsible, hyper-partisan and financially-motivated extremist group it is.
Several changes were made to the code of conduct in response to public criticism, but mostly to clarify the provisions or correct wording rather than significantly changing their effect. One change on a provision for disclosure of personal data added a vague prohibition on sharing information concerning the Wikimedia activity of users outside the projects.

So by now, we can see that we have the makings of a new James Bond-ish saga: The world's richest man, owner of one of the nation's most important newspapers–a man willing to play hardball with the largest metropolis in the U.S., New York City, over a new corporate location, which he will now put elsewhere–now finds himself stalked, and perhaps even hacked, by a prominent tabloid publication–which he reportedly considered buying, as a way of shutting down the story. In the meantime, even as multi-billion-dollar divorce proceedings begin, insinuations and accusations swirl around the president of the United States, as well as an exotically wealthy foreign government. And oh yes: All of this can be further connected, maybe, to the special counsel investigation of Robert Mueller, who seems to be casting a wide international net.

As a result, it seems evident that many people are now happy thinking about some far-flung conspiracy involving big shots in the White House and Riyadh, featuring sidebars in Los Angeles (home of Lauren Sanchez and Michael Sanchez) and New York City (home to AMI).

I marched with many people back in those days and I have reached out to some of my friends who marched with me, and all of them are shocked, Rev. William Owens of the Coalition of African American Pastors (CAAP) told Breitbart News.
In [the video that is still up] he speaks about a system of tricks and lies, and says that Hollywood's Jews have forced aspiring actors into anal sex to get parts, and that former president Barack Obama was under under Jewish influence when he advocated for same-sex marriage, which Farrakhan deemed Satanic. I wonder, will you recognize Satan? I wonder if you will see the satanic Jew and the synagogue of Satan… because Satan has deceived the whole world, he said to the crowd he was addressing as they agreed and applauded. Think about the message that I was blessed by God to give you today. Think about what they [the Jews] are going to say when they have been completely and thoroughly unmasked. Whenever you read that God has told the Jews to hear and obey and they say 'I hear and I disobey,' that's Satan… [the Jews] are openly disobeying God. He [The Jews] will take down the whole world with him.
It–it–it is utterly an amazing coincidence that the two most famous women in the world really, according to surveys, should die within just a few days of each other. And while they were very different, to be certain, they were friends. Princess Diana, in fact, was buried holding a rosary given to her by Mother Teresa. And this weekend their losses seem to resonate with some similar meanings.
This also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance, the president said.
The film was described as Majidi's most religious and is about a man who is fired from his job on an ostrich farm, moves to the big city and becomes a motorcycle taxi driver, and soon becomes consumed with his passengers' lives and is swept up in a world of greed. It is his family that help him restore his caring and generous nature, according to a film synopsis.
Stasi's misleading smears are even more dishonest now that we know a young (early 20s) female reporter for no less than the New York Times/Politico/HuffPost/McClatchy/BuzzFeed secretly shared a bed with a 57-year-old source for years as he selectively fed her, and her various employers, anti-Trump scoops. We have also been told her employers knew of this sleazy relationship.
You can laugh at the predicament of a couple of mobsters trying to shake down a national coffee chain, but the real lesson here comes from the store manager — a corporate eunuch, a company drone who doesn't care because he hasn't built anything and has no stake in the place — which again adds to our sense of having no purpose.
The 51-year-old star has two grown-up children with Cruise, as well as two younger daughters — Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret — with husband Keith Urban.

Displaying the versatility of a virtuoso, Finney portrayed Winston Churchill, Pope John Paul II, a southern American lawyer, an Irish gangster and an 18th-century rogue, among dozens of other roles over the years. There was no Albert Finney-type character that he returned to again and again.
I said, 'Sir, that's up to you. But you'd want to be careful about that, because it might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally, and second, it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen,' Comey said.
Homosexual marriage went from a radical idea in all but the most leftist of circles to the nationwide law of the land in the space of 15 years. Few Republicans can claim as much responsibility for this social change as pro-gay marriage billionaire Paul Singer. He, for example, personally intervened to pressure the New York State legislature to approve the new definition of marriage.

While some people are leaving their relationships because of Trump, others are leaving the country.
I'm worried because if he gets re-elected, it's gonna be very, very bad—very bad on a lot of levels. He's going to be history at one point, though he'd love to be president for life. He jokes about it, De Niro said in an interview with the Daily Beast.

Myth 4: The Equality Act Is Irrelevant to Abortion
Ms Akhtar and Mr Khan both knew that their Sharia marriage was not a legally registered marriage. It became vital for Ms Akhtar that the English divorce court rule in her favour, that the marriage should be recognised as void, and not a non-marriage, Ms Wright said.
The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved, he said last October. Tragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that his life is so messed up. You also don't want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself. That's not right either.
In fact, Robertson did not blame homosexuals for 160,000 murders in the U.S. Robertson was making the rather unremarkable point that chaos follows when the elite embraces the cultural and moral relativism that also justifies changing marriage rules to allow single-sex marriage. Rather than blaming gays, he is blaming a corrupt and unrooted legal and political culture.
The historic church was boarded up after rioters set fires there the day before, in an act which made even many on the Left incredulous.
Queen Victoria's third son Prince Arthur was made Earl of Sussex in 1874 but the title became extinct upon the death of his grandson in 1943.
If there's one thing we can be thankful for, it's that even in a political climate as vicious and divisive as the one we are currently experiencing, we have issues like Sharia that transcend such vitriolic division, and allow us to come together as a melting pot in opposition to it.

Of course we're better prepared, replied Prager, describing religious practice as preparation to deal with suffering. Who's better prepared if a ship sinks — people who have been practicing swimming their whole life or people who don't know how to swim? The religious know how to swim when there's bad stuff.
The nuclear deal handed Iran over $150 billion, which Iran mostly invested in attempting to colonize friendly actors in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq. The money that stayed home, as made clear this week, went largely to suppress protests against the regime heavily attended by women.

By the end of that first season I was hooked … and still am. Just last month, and for the fourth time since 2007, I binged the entire series, all 86 episodes in a few fevered weeks. What a pleasure it is to get lost again in that world, what a joy to revisit those magnificent characters and pick up on a million things I missed in previous viewings. Like a great novel, The Sopranos improves with each viewing, becomes richer, a wondrous buried treasure you never stop uncovering…

Slavery lasted for centuries — even millennia — before it was recognized as a thoroughly wicked and tyrannical regime of human exploitation. Socialism, which dates back to 1917, when Lenin founded the world's first socialist state, has had a much shorter shelf life. It, too, collapsed across the world because it was understood by the people who lived under it to be a form of slavery.

And, as for the Catholics who actually voted for Trump, the Reporter editors chastised them for caring about such things as Supreme Court justices, Catholic school choice funding so low-income children can escape failing public schools, and lower taxes so American businesses can thrive and provide more jobs, and families can provide a home, food, and education for their children without relying on the government.

Again, the Global Times did not explicitly link this measure to China's shrinking birth rate, but Zhang told the outlet, this feminization reflects a sense of escape and the timidity of some young people who fear normal marriage and love, leading to abnormal values placed on love and marriage, and this will eventually cause a decline in the birth rate.

In Minnesota Voters Alliance v.

Buttigieg said, When I was younger I would have done anything to not be gay. When I began to realize what it meant that I felt the way I did about people I saw in the hallway at school or the dining hall at college, I launched in me something I can only describe as a kind of war. And if that war had been settled on the terms that I wished for when I was 15 or 20 or frankly even 25, I would not be standing here. If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would have swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water. It's a hard thing to think about now. It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life if you showed me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife. The reason it's so awful to think about isn't just the knowledge that so many young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality or gender identity do just that, they harm themselves figuratively or literally. But the real reason it's so hard to think about is if I had had a chance to do that, I wouldn't have found my way to Chasten. The best thing in my life, my marriage, might not have happened at all.

Alito said Supreme Court decisions such as Burwell v.

That order, signed on the National Day of Prayer, loosened restrictions on the Johnson Amendment, which had been needlessly silencing clergy since 1954.

This isn't a movie-movie. This is a TV movie, an afterschool special, so simplistic and manipulative…
The bill's authors made clear that gender identity is to take precedence over and replace sex as a protected category. The bill doesn't mention individuals with clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria, or undertaking surgical or hormonal transition, thus making clear that self-declared gender identity would be sufficient to claim protected legal status.
Believing in God doesn't make you a good person, unfortunately. But believing in God does answer the question of where we came from. God made us, that's what believers believe. Once you understand that, it is impossible to think that any one race is inherently better or worse than any other race, because God made every person.

I think it's important for those who don't follow this issue closely to understand what exactly is wrong with the Equality Act. How could conservatives possibly oppose something that protects people against discrimination? That's just awful, right?

Orwell somehow missed this. Interestingly, neither of his two novels offers an economic critique of socialism. There is no economic problem in Animal Farm; the only problem is that the pigs seize power. In 1984, the ruling party creates poverty and scarcity to keep people in line. Great as he is, Orwell confines himself to a political critique; he exposes the totalitarian tendency of socialism. But he never shows how socialism creates this totalitarianism, and he leaves open the possibility of a more benign socialism that avoids it.
Describing marrying into one of the wealthiest, powerful, and respected families on the planet, former U.S. television actress Meghan told the documentary her life was hard and a struggle.
Things improve. Everything's cherry. Nice suburban house. Nice cars. The wife's pregnant. The marriage is solid. But Brad's moral code destroys everything when a deal goes sideways. He could walk away. He could go straight home, resume his life. No one would blame him. Instead, his decency forces him to take the kind of action that drops him into the worst possible situation. On top of seven years in prison, the cartel wants him dead, and this is where things get interesting…

I was shocked to learn of these anonymous and hurtful allegations, said Hefner in a statement reportedly released by his attorney.

Durbin's 1965 reference is to the 1965 immigration law which dramatically expanded the inflow of non-European migrants to the United States. Durbin seems to argue that the 1965 law is a permanent, unreformable, unchangeable birthright that must determine the future identity of the United States, or as he described it earlier, to deny our birthright as a nation is to really defy who we are, what we are and what we will be.
Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich said late Thursday that the U.S. Bishops' statement criticizing Joe Biden for his overt support for abortion was ill-considered and should not have been issued.
He cited Dr. Ben Carson as an example of the sheer determination of an individual to succeed despite being born into a less-than-desirable situation. Clarke said Carson's mother had a third-grade education and swore she would not allow her two sons to end up like her.

In order to make a case for Guilfoyle's termination, Stasi repeatedly misleads her readers (and this includes the headline) with the false claim Guilfoyle is a reporter. By spreading this falsehood, Stasi is able to manufacture a conflict of interest out of whole cloth over the fact that Guilfoyle is in a relationship with someone she is reporting on. This is the foundation of Stasi's piece, and none of it is true.

But now the media are so desperate to excuse Biden's accusers, they're interviewing Democrats to exonerate the Democrat Biden, and they're trashing Reade for — this is not a joke: not returning books and a few unpaid bills, for struggling with her rent and asking to borrow money.

One time, they had sex in his parked car and were interrupted by a police officer.
For example, a May 7 study by two post-graduate professors argued that aversion to social change is strongly predictive of support for Trump at the mass level, even among racial minorities.

I cannot see how this can be allowed when the specific idea of LGBT videos is to allow the creators to feel free to share their content and be comfortable that anti-LGBT advertisers would not be attached to their content, the employee wrote. This seems very counter to our mission, specifically around PRIDE 2018 timeframe. Google's vice president for product management and ads, Vishal Sharma, agreed that the video was too offensive to air as an advertisement. Thank you for raising this very important issue. It means a lot to me personally and those of us working on this across the Ads and YouTube teams. YouTube is an open platform and we support the free expression of creators with a wide range of views, Sharma wrote in his response, which was included in the listserv. But we don't allow advertising that disparages people based on who they are – including their sexual orientation – and we remove ads that violate this basic principle, Sharma continued. After careful and multiple reviews over the course of a few days, our teams decided to remove the ad in question here as it violates our policy. We've communicated this to the advertiser and have been in touch with creators who have been actively engaged on this issue, Sharma added, again expressing his gratitude for the internal feedback.

While this is far from declaring a victory given the persistent risks and challenges ahead, the move on Wednesday marks the biggest step yet for not just Wuhan but the entire world since the outbreak. It is a moment when Wuhan residents can finally shout out to the world: We are back! It is a moment that shows the world that we can beat this common enemy, though we have to pay a huge price. For Wuhan, this means its residents are now allowed to leave the city and others are welcome to visit. It means one of the largest transportation hubs in the nation is open for business again. It means millions of businesses in the city – small and large, service providers and manufacturers – can further pick up the pace to resume their operations. It means Wuhan is finally on the fast track to a full recovery.

It's become sort of politically incorrect to even talk about the differences between men and women, the different things that they bring to a marriage and to a family.

And to complicate things further, the Saudis and the Trump family, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are known to be tight.

Women, if they survive, she said, rarely tell anyone, since they could be shunned from their families and their societies. If a woman becomes pregnant from a rape, her husband will often throw her out of the house, or become abusive towards her and the child.

You find it fun to tell someone that an innocent comment is sexualised — do you know what that would do to my family? Do you know what that would do to my children? Do you know what you are doing to my family? You've no idea what you're doing to my family, he told Sweeney.
According to the Japan Times, decreased tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic has left many Airbnb-style rental properties across Japan empty. Several companies have seized the opportunity to market the vacant apartments as short-term sanctuaries for people who need space from their spouses.

Sweeney also appears to tell Brown, You may not like what I'm about to say but one of my political heroes is the former head of the [Irish Republican Army] — although he seemingly struggles to recall the individual's name, before seeming to settle on Daniel, um, Danny McGuinness.
Perhaps more serious than the alleged indiscretions described above, Robinson also presents what he believes is evidence showing that Sweeney intended to produce a documentary in which former associates were leaned on to paint him in a negative light, and told what to say.
Something else we have just learned, something confirmed by both the New York Times and Argento, is that Bourdain knew Argento had settled an underage sexual assault claim against her for $380,000 in November of 2017, just one month after Argento helped launch the #MeToo movement.

But Raskin took this sham to a new low of unconstitutionality when he argued that there is no First Amendment defense against impeachment. Actually, the Constitution is a 100 percent defense against impeachment. That goes to the heart of what impeachment is about.
Trump, of course, has long sniped at Bezos and the newspaper he bought in 2013, the Washington Post. Trump believes the Post is biased against him and his presidency and, furthermore, that Amazon has been getting a sweetheart deal on shipping rates from the U.S. Postal Service. Meanwhile, Trump is known to be close to David Pecker, the chief of American Media Inc. (AMI), publisher of the Enquirer.

Buttigieg is a gay Episcopalian veteran in a party torn between identity politics and heartland appeals. He's also a fresh face in a year when millennials are poised to become the largest eligible voting bloc. Many Democrats are hungry for generational change, and the two front-runners are more than twice his age.
Police contacted me and told me that someone has driven a white van into the carpark of our office and it has been loaded with gas cylinders and then it has been detonated, Shelton told the Telegraph. He added that none of his staffers were in the building at the time of the explosion.
The sisters told the paper that ahead of signing the deal – which wasn't endorsed by the Jordanian Ministry of Religion – the grooms said they would have a religious wedding in their home country, but disappeared shortly thereafter.
Has Trump kept his promises to his supporters? Has he stayed the course he set for himself of making America great again? That loyalty is the character trait that matters most in a leader, and should matter most in any assessment of Trump. He has taken great personal risks and incurred great personal costs. His reputation for example, was pretty good before he ran against Democrats and their media, who fueled an epidemic of hate portraying him as a racist and neo-Nazi.
Police have arrested a number of people for a range of money laundering and modern slavery offences after a series of raids on brothels and related addresses in Westminster.
NBC is not only on its high horse condemning as vigilantes those inspired by NBC's own To Catch a Predator; the far-left network is attempting to excuse an alleged child predator by presenting him as The Homecoming King Next Door led astray by those very same vigilantes.
So basically #Allied is the new Mr and Mrs Smith #Brangelina — Andrés Rosenberg (@aarosenberg) September 21, 2016
Murder is murder, whether it be for cultural excuses or others. The term 'honour killing' is a euphemism for a brutal murder based on cultural beliefs which have no place in Britain or anywhere else in the world.
Voice of America has details on some other cases processed by the United Nations-backed Khmer Rouge tribunal, noting that the tribunals are pushing for clear decisions and expedited outcomes, in part because both the accused and surviving victims have aged so much.
They know they've been brainwashed, said Thabet, adding that terrorists easily attract children with promises of money, weapons, and status.
The Republican governor vetoed House Bill 757, a bill aimed to protect faith-based believers from being forced to participate in gay weddings, saying it was discriminatory.
In 2015, around 20 per cent of mixed marriages in France involved a citizen of another European country, and 16 per cent united a French national with a spouse with citizenship of a country that's not in Asia, Europe, or Africa.
He spoke of American jobs and production of advanced goods in technology. We cannot allow China to cheat and to steal their way into a position of dominance in these industries.
But Kadib al Ban, the perky Syrian with the flowery pick-up lines, remained somewhat unconvinced.
It's a sorry continuation of the hyper-partisanship they've been engaging in, he added, noting that one year ago, 14 Democrats and one Independent had voted to confirm Pompeo as CIA director.
Interestingly, information on the activity has now been removed from the University of Michigan website, perhaps as result of the embarrassment it caused.

Describing the alleged physical abuse of the young girl, Mr. Heywood added:
In recent years, she spent much of her time advocating for animal rights. Although mostly retired from show business since the 1980s, she still had enough of a following that a 2011 collection of previously unreleased songs, My Heart, hit the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The same year, she received a lifetime achievement honor from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Friends and supporters lobbied for years to get her an honorary Oscar.
Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.
Another Houston area educator, Oscar Perez, 44, was accused of molesting a third grade girl in the Clear Creek school district over incidents that allegedly happened in 2009. The Galveston County Sheriff's Office arrested the McWhirter Elementary teacher and charged him with continued sexual abuse of a child. Houston's KPRC 2 (NBC) reported the alleged victim, now in high school, told police investigators Perez purportedly sexually assaulted her when she stayed after school for STAAR test tutoring.
Then on March 4, the Times jumped in with a piece headlined, How Jeff Bezos Went to Hollywood and Lost Control. The story wasn't that bad, and yet still, perhaps the Times is enjoying the spectacle of the owner of the rival liberal national newspaper paper suffering some. As the Times put it, Mr. Bezos is at the center of an honest-to-God melodrama, full of salacious revelations, family betrayals and international intrigue.
I must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender, he said in a statement.
For example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions postpuberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained, the authors explained.
Just a week prior to Baltz's Washington Post article criticizing bias against women on political articles, Fox News released a report noting significant ideological bias on Wikipedia, something Baltz claims is less of an issue. One of the articles Baltz criticized for not citing enough women, the article on socialism, was found by Fox to be whitewashed of atrocities committed by self-proclaimed socialist governments. This included the socialism article praising the technological achievements of the Soviet Union, while referencing the excesses of Stalin's regime without elaborating. A section about Asia left repressive actions in China under Mao unmentioned but did mention Indonesia's anti-communist mass-killings.
The Pakistani government did not amend or repeal blasphemy law provisions that have provided a pretext for violence against religious minorities and have left them vulnerable to arbitrary arrest and prosecution, the report said.

On December 7, 2020, the U.S. State Department designated Nigeria for the first time as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC), the short list of the world's worst violators of religious freedom.

Francis DeBernardo, the director of a nominally Catholic LGBT group called New Ways Ministry, published a statement attacking the Pope for his comments, accusing him of being out of touch with reality for his reliance upon so-called 'gender theory' and 'ideological colonization.'

[Omar] told supporters after the election that she would cut ties with E Street Group, headed by her husband Tim Mynett, to avoid any perceived issue, but the sponsors of the legislation said that the problem is bigger than any single candidate. The Oversight for Members and Relatives Act would prohibit candidates for federal office from compensating spouses who work on campaigns and require disclosure of any direct or indirect payments made to spouses or immediate family members, including children, parents, siblings and in-laws. At least two top Democrats could be predisposed to support the measure: A similar measure sponsored by Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat, was approved by the House in 2007 with the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
(AP) On Hadra al-Faqira's wedding anniversary, just weeks after she gave birth to a daughter, her husband walked out and took a second wife.
Durin's reference to a 'major federal agency' likely refers to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services which declared February 22 a shift in focus away from serving foreign customers, and dropped the nation of immigrants rhetoric from its mission statement. Instead, Trump's appointee stressed a focus on Americans' priorities and assimilating immigrants:
She followed with The Thrill of It All, playing a housewife who gains fame as a TV pitchwoman to the chagrin of obstetrician husband James Garner. The nation's theater owners voted her the top moneymaking star in 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1964.

Moody said in states like New England where the economies are weaker, and not vibrant, people lose hope. And when they lose hope, they look for other things to fill that void and, unfortunately, that's been opioids and now heroin and now fentanil, which is 100 times stronger than heroin.

The Taliban has grown extremely wealthy over the past few years, banking huge profits from illegal drugs, illegal mining operations, extorting taxes from the parts of Afghanistan they control, collecting hefty financial donations from supporters in the Middle East, and partnering with the criminal Haqqani Network. They also receive heavy financial support from governments like Russia and China.
The remedy against discrimination and contempt for women, he added, is not obtained by denying the biological and psychological identity of men and women, but through conversion to the recognition that both man and woman are primarily human persons with the same dignity, both created in the image of God.

The incident, Fraser said, left him depressed and miserable. He says didn't go public because he didn't want to let the alleged assault become his narrative.
As it happens, in referring to Trump's loyalty I had in mind two episodes. The first was the topic of the week: Omarosa. Why did he stick with such a wretched individual for so long, despite warnings from everyone around him that she was no good? Loyalty to a fault. The second was when the left showed its teeth in his first days in the White House and maliciously attacked Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions as white nationalists and racists and even neo-Nazis. Any other Republican, freshly in office, would have thrown them under the bus, however false the accusations. Trump's fortitude, his refusal to back down under withering fire, is also a character trait, and an admirable one – actually the key to his success where Bush and congressional Republicans had repeatedly failed. Loyalty.

He becomes the second governor to enter the sprawling field, after Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) announced last week and is trying to cast himself as a pragmatist who can also take on President Donald Trump. Though as governor Hickenlooper prided himself for staying above partisan fights, he has argued his record as a former governor and big-city mayor distinguishes him from a broad field of Democratic hopefuls who are backing ambitious liberal plans on health care, taxes and the climate.

Opponents often claim that Erdogan and his Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party are attacking the republic's secular foundations, claims dismissed by the government.
I thought [white working-class voters] did rebel by electing Donald Trump, I mean it's in some sense they were a lot of people … they're the people who have been done very badly over a long period of time. They don't seem to be well represented … The Democratic Party seems to have abandoned working-class people, and you know it's a form of an alliance between the educated elite and the [non-white] minorities … So we do need a political realignment, I think, which gets a real voice for working-class people again.
The following is not a small deal: Bourdain's popular show aired on the far-left CNN, a cable channel obsessed with bringing President Donald Trump down over payoffs to silence two adult women for alleged consensual affairs that happened over a decade ago; and here is one of CNN's biggest stars reportedly involved in a payoff to cover up the alleged assault of a minor…?

I think it's important for those who don't follow this issue closely to understand what exactly is wrong with the Equality Act. How could conservatives possibly oppose something that protects people against discrimination? That's just awful, right? The problem is that the Equality Act wouldn't protect people in need of protection as much as it would fundamentally change civil rights law for the worse.

Yes, it appears that Team Bezos—a team that includes the Post—have decided that Michael Sanchez is the leaker; in other words, Bezos and his people blame Michael, not Lauren, for the original leaks. Actually, many reports hold that Lauren was involved, too, if only through carelessness; it's been reported that she showed some embarrassing material to her friends, and as they say, loose lips sink, well, you know.
By the mid-1980s, Greenpeace had drifted from the original concept of green and peace — meaning environment and people, [to] save civilization from nuclear war — so we cared about people and had a humanitarian orientation as well as an environmental one. That was the marriage of green and peace, but by the time the eighties came along, the peace had kinda got lost and all it was was save-the-whales and save-the-earth, and now humans were being characterized as the enemies of nature, as if there's too many of us and there shouldn't be so many and people shouldn't have children — and all this stuff that's still coming up with AOC, now, telling people that maybe they shouldn't have children because the world's coming to an end.

Hunter, whose work in Ukraine was central to the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, also has a 18-month-old child with Lunden Roberts, an Arkansas native and one-time stripper. The child's existence was revealed last year when Roberts filed a paternity suit against Hunter in Arkansas civil court. The lawsuit, which came around the same time as Hunter's marriage to Cohen, quickly made headlines after it emerged that Roberts had gotten to know the younger Biden while working at a Washington, D.C.-based gentleman's club.

In effect, Biden was saying: I have never been a 'moderate,' and I am a 'progressive,' which used to be understood as 'liberal.' But today, the definition of 'progressive' has become 'socialist.'

Vince Vaughn plays Brad — sorry, Bradley — a retired boxer, drug dealer, and substance abuser who goes straight until straight nearly costs him the thing he loves most: his wife (Jennifer Carpenter). A miscarriage and barely tolerable existence on a tow-truck driver's salary (a job he just lost) has undermined the marriage to where she's having an empty sexual affair.

Comey recalls telling the president the FBI was investigating it as quickly as possible, and that he had told Congress that Trump was not personally under investigation, to which the president repeatedly told him, We need to get that fact out. Two weeks later, on April 11, Trump called Comey again to check on his request to get out that he is not under investigation, Comey writes. He seemed irritated with me, Comey recalls. I have been very loyal to you, very loyal. We had that thing, you know, Trump told him, according to the book, apparently referring to the loyalty dinner.
While acknowledging that it is a sensitive subject, Klemm claimed that the U.S. Supreme Court had resolved the legal problem over gay marriage, stating that it is unconstitutional and illegal to deny civil marriage to same-sex couples.
This may be good dirty politics but it is very, very poor statesmanship.
All it was is I saw Tony Abbott and I'd had half a skinful and I wanted to nut the c***.
And what does it say about NBC that the only public shaming victims NBC News wants to defend are not those who have been annihilated by the Humor Vigilantes or the Ten-Year-Old Tweet Vigilantes or the Rodeo Mask Vigilantes or the You're Fired for Opposing Gay Marriage Vigilantes, but those who apparently showed up at a house to have sex with a child?
Everyone has a right to express their opinion. The opinion that I expressed yesterday was that the NRL had made a poor call in doing what they did, Abbott told reporters when he explained his position.

Trump has offered to amnesty 1.8 million 'DACA' illegals in exchange for a four-part reform — construction of a border wall, closure of border legal loopholes, ending the visa lottery and gradually ending chain-migration around 2030. Durbin has led the opposition to Trump's push, and also pushed his unpopular policies of amnesty, immigration, and diversity throughout the debate. On January 15, for example, Durbin told reporters:
This very grave crisis cannot be properly addressed and resolved unless and until we call things by their true names, he said. This is a crisis due to the scourge of homosexuality, in its agents, in its motives, in its resistance to reform.
These two diverging headlines are the latest in a long skein of allegations and insinuations stemming from the steamy news of photos and texts that ran in the National Enquirer back in January 2019. According to the Guardian, it was international skullduggery, involving the leader of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and perhaps the Israeli digital firm NSO; the allegation is that the Saudi royal and the Israeli company jointly conspired to hack Bezos's phone. (The Saudi government immediately denied the accusation, as did NSO.)
I believe that God created us all so that means he created me to be this way, writes Kaden, who was born female but identifies as a 'demi-boy'.
Prince Harry has every right to want to balance his responsibilities between the Royal family and his wife and young family, one highly decorated Army figure remarked in comments to The Telegraph — But first and foremost Harry was a commissioned officer who pledged allegiance to the Queen and the Queen is his grandmother, so when push comes to shove, Queen and country come first.

Despite pushback from Swedish legal experts against sharia law in this case, demographic trends suggest that Sweden will become one-third Muslim by the year 2050 and makes the prospect of continued legal challenges inevitable.
The actor — whose career skyrocketed after 1997's box office hit George of the Jungle, and continued to rise for more than a decades with starring roles in the Mummy franchise, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and 2014's animated hit Nut Jobs — tells a story of abuse that has resonated in the wake of the MeToo and Time's Up era that has seen several powerful male Hollywood figures be accused of sexual harassment or assault.

Former President Bill Clinton says his high-profile affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was one of the things during his presidency that he did to manage my anxieties, according to The Daily Mail.
There's that Mail piece from 2016, when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was '(almost) straight outta Compton' – at the time Markle's mother lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA. Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with 'racialised forms of crime', ie gangs. That's one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the difference in Harry and Meghan's social backgrounds. If Harry had been dating a white working-class woman from Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.
HOPE Not Hate official Nick Lowles has since stated that Robertson retracted these allegations, however, and claimed Tommy Robinson was aware of this retraction before he aired his documentary in Salford — and that the matter has now been passed to lawyers.
To sum up: a) Trump Jr. was not identified in the charging document and b) there is no criminal conspiracy, as Ocasio-Cortez alleges.

Under this decision, 100,000 black American voters in one state legislative district would have the same voting power as 10,000 white American voters in another district with 90,000 non-citizens. Even though total population is the same in both districts, voting power is radically different.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: A– and at the time, did you know it had been financed at the beginning from President Trump's– by President Trump's political opponents? JAMES COMEY: Yes, I– I was told at some point that it was– the effort had originally been financed by a Republican source to develop– material– opposition research on Donald Trump. Then after the Republican nominating process ended, the effort was taken up and funded by a Democratic aligned group trying to get opposition research on Trump. I never knew which– who the groups were, but I knew it started with Republicans paying for it and then Democrats were paying for it.
If the Equality Act were to become federal law and public school curricula become further entwined with sexual orientation and gender identity ideology, Planned Parenthood is well-positioned to further its presence in public schools and take advantage of an additional avenue to promote both sexual orientation and gender identity ideology as well as the organization's hormone treatment services. In other words, additional sexual orientation and gender identity curricula could become yet another marketing tool for America's abortion giant.
Salon Magazine has accused the Republican Party of being out of touch with post-Christian America, warning the GOP that if it doesn't renege on its alliance with Christianity, it will soon become irrelevant.
The VA told me they lacked the experience to treat me in 2014 as I was transitioning to female, he said as well. When I did get seen I felt like they were attacking my childhood. I became paranoid they were going to try and kill my service connected rating, my livelihood.
The head of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna, said in a letter to the committee that their request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages.

Newsom will govern a state that is not only deeply divided between rich and poor, but in which the rich half is barely aware that the rest of the state is so far behind, or that California faces staggering long-term financial problems, thanks to the concentration of self-regarding media and culture industries in wealthy coastal enclaves.

The editorial staff of the left-wing National Catholic Reporter fussed and fumed that Catholic supporters of President Donald Trump have blood on their hands after the violent chaos that erupted at the U.S. Capitol Wednesday.
You need to go back all the way to the 1970s. We don't think necessarily the [decline in] material welfare is the direct cause [of the deaths], but [it is the] lack of a stable job, a good job. It brings a loss of community, of marriage. of meaning and status in life, and we think it is those effects that … help us to better understand why these [economic changes] might lead to long term deaths from these causes.

Sanders unforced error on 60 Minutes still haunting him. But Sanders now talks about how China has reduced poverty over the last 40-50 years.
If you look close enough, if you look past the sophistication and her progressive platitudes about race and poverty, you will find the same unfeeling sociopath. Meadow is basically her mother, a woman desperate for status, respectability, and STUFF. During Carmela's era, those things came from being a housewife and Catholic. Meadow's era requires symbolic acts of activism and a profession.

Since the nineties, ceaseless lobbying within media and government circles by the 'Islamophobia' industry has been hugely successful. Especially, by organisations that profit from pretending that rude social media posts constitute actual 'attacks' against Muslims.
The BBC noted China's birth rate hit a 70-year low in 2019, three years after the end of the one-child policy. This is commonly attributed to a lack of government financial support for young couples to have the families their government suddenly desires, after years of threatening to destroy their lives if they dared to have a second child, but as the Global Times story suggested, there is growing concern that the male-female imbalance may have created a demographic log jam that cannot be cleared with government subsidies.
In both cases, the enterprise is driven by lust for money and lust for power, the libido dominandi that Augustine warns about. In principle, no less than in practice, socialism is the ideology of thieves and tyrants. As for the people who fall for the temptation, they are connivers attracted by the rip-off scheme. But they end up a suckers, because the scheme is not designed to benefit them. We cannot persuade the thieves and tyrants, but we should try to reach the conniving suckers, to show them a better way to get ahead, and we need an effective battle plan to finally and ultimately defeat the socialists.
All I can say is, I hope he's going to be happy — because whenever I saw those photographs, or those films, of the Duke of Windsor, living in the Bois du Boulogne with Wallis Simpson, he didn't look very happy to me.
There is no indication that Badmos is a police chief as reported by some news outlets. Nigeria media described her as a spokeswoman for the country's federal police.
The Equality Act could lead to changes in school curricula, such as texts that affirm and promote controversial sexual orientation and gender identity viewpoints. The Equality Act could also be used to override states that have prohibited sexual orientation and gender identity curricula. Where states have conversely mandated sexual orientation and gender identity curricula, parents and schools do not have access to opt-out options.
De Niro added: The only other president who served a third term was Roosevelt because he was in a war, and this fool would go and start something. This was what Marty Scorsese was saying, and I said, 'Marty, I never thought of that. I never thought he'd go for a third term if there was a war or something.'
The acceptance of our bodies as God's gift, Francis wrote, is vital for welcoming and accepting the entire world as a gift from the Father and our common home, whereas thinking that we enjoy absolute power over our own bodies turns, often subtly, into thinking that we enjoy absolute power over creation.
Look I'm not a Never Trumper, and I think people get obsessed to the point where they cannot give him credit for the good things he has done. Bush said, even though he is a resident of the swing state of Florida and did not vote for Trump in 2016.

Fox also interviewed economics professor Bryan Caplan regarding the slanted coverage of communism and socialism on their Wikipedia pages, notably the omission of atrocities carried out by communist governments.
I woke up and discovered, to my horror, that Trump had won. She didn't hide her horror from those close to her. After Trump was elected, a friend in Kennebunkport gave her a Trump countdown clock as a joke. The red, white, and blue digital clock displayed how many days, hours, minutes and seconds remained in Trump's term. She parked it on the side table in her bedroom, next to the chair she would sit in to needlepoint or watch television. She liked the countdown clock so much that when the Bushes returned to Houston that October, she brought it with her. It sat on her bedside table, where she could see it every day. It was there to the day she died.
The president of the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, noted Biden's position on abortion in a statement released Wednesday.
Another woman said they live in ancient times, while yet another lamented the fact that they lack electricity and drinking water.

Given the narrowness of the margin separating all of the candidates, Biden has launched a fullscale effort to catapult into first place ahead of the February caucuses. Unite the Country appears to be following suit, as evidenced by its heavy spending campaign.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act will be committed to the memory hole, and we will then experience a catastrophic loss of religious freedom in America, and, as a result, every American, those who believe and do not believe, will suffer the consequences. I urge the American people to speak with great force and clarity to Congress to stop H.R. 5, the Inequality Act:

Philip later joined the Royal Navy as an officer cadet in 1939 and enjoyed a varied career during the Second World War, serving in several roles including the first lieutenant of a destroyer.

The movie is also hypocritical. It closes by telling us a white person probably killed the girl McMillian's accused of killing. Probably. So to hammer its point home with the hammiest of hammy hands, Just Mercy hurls a murder accusation it's not sure of.

In May 2015, Senior Airman James Rogers told the Abilene Reporter-News that the Pride Alliance is constantly involved across Dyess and occasionally in the Abilene community as a whole. We're the first LGBT support group on Dyess, he told the Reporter-News. The atmosphere of acceptance, from Col. Starr to the new Airmen Basics has been great. They've put an emphasis on changing. You can see with us out here, we're here because we have the support to be out here.

Janet Jackson with her husband, the Qatari billionaire Wesam Manna… she tweeted. Here she is pregnant already… Thank Allah for fixing things between them… Just give me a bit of luck and throw me into the sea.
Disability checks and means-tested benefits cannot support a lavish lifestyle. But they can offer a permanent alternative to paid employment, and for growing numbers of American men, they do. The rise of these programs has coincided with the death of work for larger and larger numbers of American men not yet of retirement age. We cannot say that these programs caused the death of work for millions upon millions of younger men: What is incontrovertible, however, is that they have financed it—just as Medicaid inadvertently helped finance America's immense and increasing appetite for opioids in our new century.
Prior to his announcement about his return to use of his male birth name, Shupe's Twitter account was locked by the social media giant.
Look, I like gays as much as the next red-blooded heterosexual Dad. Some of my best friends are gay, one of them, unfortunately, being Milo. Plus, I was an enthusiastic instigator of homosexual acts at my prep school – I virtually invented it – so I know what it's all about. I like gay clubs, gay music, gay culture. At Glastonbury just now, I queued up to join the Meat Market gay club where a handsome youth in drag at the entrance patted me down and affectionately squeezed my testicles while my wife looked on. In fact, if I didn't prefer girls I would DEFINITELY be gay myself.

You can laugh at the predicament of a couple of mobsters trying to shake down a national coffee chain, but the real lesson here comes from the store manager — a corporate eunuch, a company drone who doesn't care because he hasn't built anything and has no stake in the place — which again adds to our sense of having no purpose.
What Sopranos creator David Chase did accomplish, though, was nothing less than to crack the artistic code for a medium that was well into middle age.
They are both 'law' in the sense they represent and communicate a set of 'norms' that operate at both individual and a community level, the book explains. A portion of the textbook identifies the benefits of ending monogamous relationships and notes how sharia law does not recognise the minimum age in marriage.

Trump's unilateral actions are thuggery, a complete violation of every international rule, said Sachs, a supporter of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. This is truly what we are facing. I'm sorry to say it, it's my country and I'm not very happy to say it, but it's an imperial power in decline and it's a dangerous country right now and it will be absolutely dangerous if Trump wins re-election.
Romance on the High Seas had been designed for Judy Garland, then Betty Hutton. Both bowed out, and Day, recommended by songwriters Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne, won the role. Warner Bros. cashed in on its new star with a series of musicals, including My Dream Is Yours, ″Tea for Two and Lullaby of Broadway. Her dramas included Young Man with a Horn, with Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall, and Storm Warning, with Ronald Reagan and Ginger Rogers.
The actress also added: I think that's the basis for a long-lasting marriage, if you really want to do such a thing … I would say better to stay friends and we don't have enough time to talk about the sexuality of all. I was very open about all of that and so was he.
However, Health Minister Greg Hunt, also speaking before the U.N.'s decision, said: If she is found to be a refugee, then we will give very, very, very serious consideration to a humanitarian visa.
It's funny, the hunting story I think goes to how polarizing he could be. Because if you think of the two, I think, foundational Scalia hunting stories, one is, as you remember, he was out hunting with Dick Cheney while there was a case pending at the court that involved Dick Cheney. And there were calls for his recusal, and it was really, I think, a dramatic example of how he liked to pal around with people who were Washington players. sometimes edging right up against the ethics rule.

A Rasmussen poll found black likely voter approval of Trump at 34 percent, and an Emerson Poll showed 34.5 percent approval by black likely voters:
Ma now seems to be picking up the work the Communist Party began three years ago to maintain a stable national population. China imposed a two-child policy in 2016, expecting a massive population boom from parents longing to expand their families. Instead, the annual birth rate fell from 17.9 million children in 2016 to 17.2 million in 2017. Some estimates project that the birth rate could drop to as few as 16 million by next year. Communist Party central planners expected the birth rate to rise to 20 million by 2017.
President Trump was at his wife's side late Monday night. White House staff confirmed that Mrs. Trump is in good spirits and is recovering.
Rather than finding common-sense, narrowly tailored ways to shield LGBT-identifying Americans from truly unjust discrimination, the bill would act as a sword — to persecute those who don't embrace newfangled gender ideologies, he said of the Orwellian Equality Act.
Crain has requested child support from Daniels and the sharing of their property assets. While the restraining order is in effect, Daniels' unsupervised access to their daughter will be restricted. Daniels is currently touring America's strip clubs.
So I don't believe any of that stuff. At the highest level, I had to get out of Greenpeace at that point because my fellow directors were all pushing this narrative about humans being the enemies of the Earth. It's way too much like Original Sin for me, where all the other life is good and only the humans are bad, and I just do not buy that. We're from nature, just like all the other species are, and humans are mostly good. A few bad people make a big difference, it's true, but people are mostly good and mostly try to be good. So I didn't buy that.
Basically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend, he explained in a 2001 interview. I stopped working on TV for a year.
Anger over the murder has swelled on social media amid reports that authorities were given repeated warnings that Ashrafi would be in danger if forced to return home. As the legal guardian of the victim, the father does not qualify for Islam's qisas exception, which allows for lighter sentences in cases of retributive justice. However, he still faces a meager ten years in prison for carrying out the atrocity.
Once that line jumps over racism, what's next? What will the government tell us is WrongThink next?
(Not that it's better to have the full benevolent attention of the Nanny State turned upon you, as the situation in the inner cities demonstrates. Inter-generational welfare dependence is precisely what the creators of the Great Society promised would not happen, back when they swore the success of their programs would be measured by how many people no longer needed them. Today, defenders of the welfare state insist its success should be measured by how comfortable and sustainable poverty has become.)

Grenell (pictured above, left) has declined to comment on the story and has not mentioned any such nomination on social media, where he is very active. A White House official contacted by the Washington Examiner also could not confirm the nomination.
They are widely-held views likely related to underlying personality differences and political predispositions … I agree that they are related to the preference for social stability, which can be quite rational.
Chick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, Duquesne Student Senator Niko Martini remarked in a statement to The Duquesne Duke. I think it's imperative [that] the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.
Dr Kovács also expressed concern that seemingly laudable provisions of the Convention requiring signatories to take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that gender-based violence against women may be recognised as a form of persecution and allow gender-based asylum claims are intended to pave the way for more bogus asylum applications by illegal migrants, rendering it yet another attempt by pro-migration groups to find a way to force the issue of migration.
Last year, the 31-year-old actress also lashed out at First Daughter Ivanka Trump after she posed for a photo with evangelical pastor Jim Garlow, sharing a post referencing his belief marriage equality is a satanic plot to destroy the image of God.
In fact, if anything, the trend that has seen Britain happier than ever to accept greater diversity in relationships has accelerated in recent years.
Over the past year, Malaysian authorities have also banned books promoting moderate interpretations of Islam, censored inappropriate popular film and music, and imposed blasphemy laws on society as a whole.

The inaction on FGM and reference to nuances would appear to be broadly in line with the officer's previous statements on such crimes under his National Police Chiefs' Council brief.
Not even two children are sufficient to rise above the 2.1 births per woman threshold of stable population growth; many families with three or more children are needed, and this is difficult to achieve if young people delay marriage and family in favor of professional and financial success. Reversing a plunge as steep as China's, with such a huge excess of males in the population, probably cannot be achieved by simply offering larger subsidies to defray the cost of raising children.

The new photograph, taken last week, shows the Duke standing straight unsupported with his hands clasped informally behind his back. Britain's long-lived Royals have chalked up a number of records between them — the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen have had the longest Royal marriage in British history, and the Duke is the longest-serving Royal consort ever. Queen Elizabeth II is the longest-reigning monarch in British history, and is the longest-reigning monarch in the world now alive.
Clearly, the current resident of the White House who for months has repeatedly and deliberately lied about nonexistent election fraud, and who, even as Confederate-flag wielding thugs strolled throughout the Capitol, is guilty of inciting violence in his morning speech on the Ellipse. Later in the day, he would express love for what can only be described as domestic terrorists.
He said today America's economic debate is based on a valueless financial self-interest and a view of Americans as simply consumers. He warned there are immense consequences to this view.
Grenell, who is possibly the most high-powered openly gay diplomat in the world, has a forthright style and robust social media presence similar to President Trump.

That wasn't enough for Aurthur, who made a point of noting that Fixer Upper has not yet included a gay couple in each of its first three seasons:
Endemic unemployment and poverty are said to be major contributing factors.
To some extent, Turnbull's flip towards pro-Australian position is designed to help his pro-business wing of the party from Abbot's pro-Australian wing of the party, and from the growing support being given to Pauline Hanson's nationalist One Nation Party, which is skeptical about Islam's ability to integrate into Australian society. In 2016 and before, Turnbull repeatedly endorsed immigration, invited additional refugees, and told the parliament in October 2016 that everyone sitting in this chamber and every Australian is a beneficiary of the diversity that is at the heart of our nation … the most effective weapon against the [Muslim] terrorists is an inclusive nation.
At the close of 2016, the Centers for Disease Control reported that the overall U.S. life expectancy dropped for the first time since 1993, with the under-65 demographic hit particularly hard. The 1993 dip came at the height of the AIDS epidemic.

The proposal, which means same-sex couples from any Anglican Church can now request a wedding at a Scottish Episcopal Church, was backed on Thursday at the annual meeting of its General Synod in Edinburgh.
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lamented the collapse of the nuclear deal, initially refusing to affirm if he would work to ensure that Iran does not procure a nuclear weapon. He then claimed that overturning an agreement Iran was openly violating would bring Iran closer to joining the nuclear club.

At the time the mass killings page was unlocked, the introduction to the page listed various figures for the extent of mass killings in the tens of millions, including the Black Book of Communism's range of 85 million to 100 million deaths. However, since the page was unlocked, the introduction has been considerably shortened to remove any mention of casualty figures in the millions, instead stating simply that estimates vary widely on the subject. A previously small sub-section questioning the inclusion of devastating famines occurring under communist-led governments was also considerably expanded with material mostly disputing the attribution of famines to specifically communist policies.

This week, Rubio denied any role in the dossier's creation, telling CNN, As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn't and I'll tell you why: I was running for president. I was trying to win.

ROME — Exposing the errors of gender theory is of the utmost urgency for the future of humanity and of Christianity, a Dutch cardinal told an assembly of Catholics in Rome Thursday.
Because, damn it, they were fighting for the near-impossible on a wing and prayer. Unlike Remain, they didn't have the full resources of the government, the European Union, the big banks, the corporations, the trade unions and the BBC behind them.

Since 2000, roughly 600,000 blue-collar white Americans have died as their traditional workplaces have shut down and their traditional civic supports– marriage, sports clubs, churches — have shriveled amid the loss of good jobs, said Deaton's co-author, Anne Case.
We have had the normal trolls on social media and even had death threats sent to our Canberra office over the year but I am very concerned someone would do this, he said. It is a relief the building was unoccupied at the time and we are all very thankful our staff are all safe.
I believe women should be allowed to make the decision, but I also think the church is right to say it's a sin. Because sin is actions that harm us. Lying harms us, Irons told The Guardian in 2016.
As Israel noted, the legislation would force the term sex in the Civil Rights Act to mean pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and the last of these — related medical conditions — has already been interpreted to include abortion by both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Cardinal Cupich, a persistent critic of President Trump during his four years in office, issued his own separate statement warmly welcoming President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. In the statement, Cupich refrains from mentioning issues where Biden's platform directly contradicts Church teaching, such as abortion, school choice, gender issues, and religious liberty.

The ST cited reports that the couple has visited a fertility clinic in Germany because Sultan Muhammad's first marriage was childless and he is desperate to start a family. Muhammad seemed quite healthy and vigorous otherwise, with a penchant for extreme sports such as off-road driving, horse riding, football, and endurance challenges.
NBC is not only on its high horse condemning as vigilantes those inspired by NBC's own To Catch a Predator; the far-left network is attempting to excuse an alleged child predator by presenting him as The Homecoming King Next Door led astray by those very same vigilantes.
Marx is not the only progressive Cardinal in Germany. Cardinal Archbishop of Cologne Rainer Maria Woelki has repeatedly expressed his pro-mass migration stance and slammed the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) which is against the building of minarets in German cities.
In the best case scenario, Pope Francis will see the error of his ways, and spend the rest of his pontificate undoing the damage he's wrought. Failing that, he should imitate the example of Pope Benedict XVI and admit that he can no longer lead the Church. He should resign, and open a political institute based in Buenos Aires. Something tells me George Soros would fund it.
The bill's authors made clear that gender identity is to take precedence over and replace sex as a protected category. The bill doesn't mention individuals with clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria, or undertaking surgical or hormonal transition, thus making clear that self-declared gender identity would be sufficient to claim protected legal status.

Things improve. Everything's cherry. Nice suburban house. Nice cars. The wife's pregnant. The marriage is solid. But Brad's moral code destroys everything when a deal goes sideways.

The concept of gender identity is a steamroller obliterating the significance of male and female in our language, relationships, laws and spaces. Under the Equality Act, gender identity determines access to public accommodations, a category the act redefines to include just about everywhere.

Many observers predict a tougher tenure for Newsom, partly because they predict a dire economic future for the country as a whole — a common theme for mainstream media pundits in recent weeks, driven partly by the gyrations of the stock market but also, undoubtedly, by a desire to see the Trump administration fail, in defiance of the data on job creation and economic growth.
But as they dig into the whole life of a 56-year-old woman and come up with a handful of petty dust, what none of these media smear merchants dare reveal to their gullible readers is the seven pieces of corroboration Reade has, or the nine additional accusers Biden has.

Tulsi Gabbard herself is quoted in a 2000 press release from The Alliance for Traditional Marriage. In it, she attacks gay rights activists who were opposed to her mother Carol's bid for the state's board of education. Tulsi Gabbard's anti-gay efforts continued after she became a state representative. Shortly after Gabbard announced her presidential ambitions Friday, her testimony at a hearing opposing a civil unions bill in 2004 resurfaced. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.

In other words, as a religious charity, while we lawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefs, we do not discriminate in who we serve. We have provided billions of dollars of medical care and supplies, food and water, and emergency shelter without any conditions whatsoever. Our Christian faith compels us—like the biblical Good Samaritan—to love and serve everyone in need, regardless of their faith or background.
Iran allows the marriage of nine-year-old girls based on these same hadiths, and recent attempts in Pakistan to prevent child marriage were stopped by the Council of Islamic Ideology who deemed it blasphemous and un-Islamic.

Hollywood elites continued to engage in unhinged histrionics over President Donald Trump in 2019, ratcheting up their hysterical rhetoric to new comic heights.
His folksy demeanor lent itself to plenty of jokes and caricatures, like the series of photos of Biden eating ice cream that exploded on social media. But Obama seemed fonder of the internet meme based on photos of him and Biden buddying it up.
By this possible reckoning, Bezos raised serious allegations about the Saudi government, that Israeli company NSO, the National Enquirer, and the Trump administration. And maybe possibly, in so raising those allegations, Bezos legally defamed someone.

The head of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna, said in a letter to the committee that their request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages.

Unlike the World Baseball Classic, whose heritage rule allowed countries to field players who were merely eligible for citizenship, the Olympics requires its participants to be full-fledged citizens of the countries they represent.

She followed with another impressive film, Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, starring her and James Stewart as an innocent couple ensnared in an international assassination plot. She sings Que Sera, Sera just as the story reaches its climax and viewers are beside themselves with suspense.

Naturally, none of this gets through to Carmela. This wise man didn't tell her what she wants to hear, so she shops around until someone does tell her what she does want to hear — that she is trapped in this life (she loves) by her sacred marriage vows. Sadly, this rationalization comes from a Catholic priest.

If the Pentagon is forced to accept the claim that gender (not the bright line of biology) decides a person's male or female sex, then progressives will have won a huge victory in their campaign to erase the public's immense variety of helpful civic practices and laws which help men and women manage their competitive and cooperatives lives together. Those non-government rules — marriage, dating, sports leagues, privacy, and much else — are based on the recognition that women and men are legally equal and also different and complementary.
Africans largely regard homosexuality as a deviation from their cultural, traditional and religious inclinations, Pulse noted.

That has been instilled into American students, it's often American parents that feel that is the only viable path. So you have kids going into school racking up enormous amounts of student debt that they'll often take decades if there ever able to pay it off without a skill, if they ultimately graduate. So I think opening up the prism and saying there are many different pathways. It depends what you want in your life and taking the stigma away from those who choose alternative pathways who choose technical schools, vocational education. At the end of the day, it's about connecting workers with their passion, with their jobs. There's very little opportunity for somebody who wants to the vocational route, the technical route because all the money pushes you into a four-year college system.
Conservative congressmembers filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and now hope to prohibit enriching relatives through the campaigning process.

So far, the media continues to provide cover for Biden's candidacy by painting him as a centrist Democrat and by ignoring his many campaign gaffes. The fact is that many of Biden's positions are just as damaging and harmful to the Constitution and American freedom as Sanders's would be.

• Historic tax cuts will not only save Americans thousands of dollars on their annual returns, but has already created jobs and caused many employers to give employees bonuses. Cruz, who campaigned on abolishing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), praised the new tax law passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.
You could make similar arguments for public officials who exercise their Second Amendment right to bear arms, or their Fourteenth Amendment rights to travel to another state (like, for example, Florida – which seems to be controversial these days). There could be legal arguments made against those officials, who could assert those constitutional rights as protecting their actions. But if the First Amendment is not a defense against impeachment, neither is it a defense of the rights guaranteed by another constitutional amendment.
Ma's remarks triggered some outrage on social media given his promotion of the strenuous 996 schedule, which many noted leaves little time for family life, much less sex. In response to the controversy, an Alibaba spokeswoman issued a statement saying that Ma offered lighthearted life and marital advice to 102 newlywed couples, saying the key to a successful marriage is to forget the negatives and embrace the positives of each other and that the value of love, unlike coding, can't be measured or calculated.
Prager continued, I am absolutely convinced that a subtext here is that secular people fear death more. And we don't want to die any more than anyone. I love life. I love my family and friends. I love everything I do. I'm crazy about life, but I don't fear death. I believe there's an afterlife. I don't think this is all there is. Clearly, if you think this is all there is then you will fear losing it more than the guy who thinks this isn't all there is.
Virgil wrote on April 5, 2019, and again on April 20 that Bezos's escalated allegations were, indeed, sensational and astounding—if that is, they were true. Still thinking of Bezos's resemblance to Bond-villain Blofeld, Virgil added that the story could well be remembered as some fantastic tale, like something that Ian Fleming might have written for his character James Bond.
This argument is playing into the hands of the enemy, for there is nothing that makes liberals bigger in their underpants than using free market philosophy as a stick with which to beat their right-wing enemies.

That's the exact opposite of what fashionable liberals have told us for generations now: marriage is a silly formality, there's nothing special about marriage between men and women, the nuclear family is obsolete, it's monstrous for society to expect women to sacrifice their career ambitions to focus on raising kids, and single parenting is every bit as good as the traditional family (with a little help from Big Government to cover for Dad's missing paycheck). Those who warned about the dangers of family breakdown three decades ago were relentlessly mocked for their obsession with outmoded, overrated, narrow-minded family values.

Twitter apparently found Shupe in violation of its rules against hateful conduct.
And unfortunately, McAvoy is the star of Glass, which means Willis and Jackson inexplicably disappear for very long periods of time.
Also writing for Al-Watan, columnist Fahd Al-Ahmari took a slightly different view, claiming polygamy poses health threats, particularly to the husband. The reason for this is he is now expected to provide for several families at once – both from a financial and emotional aspect. She brings proof of her claim, noting a 2015 study conducted at a Saudi hospital and medical research center that showed men with multiple wives suffer from heart problems four times more than the rest of the male population.
In fact, even the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights weighed in, deploring the situation and demanding an investigation of Saudi Arabia's supposed hack. (Yes, the hacking case might seem to be more of a technical issue than a human rights issue—and the U.N. might not seem credible for its expertise on human rights, either—but that's a topic for another time.)
One of the most contentious is FGM so let me start there. FGM is sanctioned by Islam. Fact. There are several hadiths which justify it. You can read these here, but I shall recount just one which should be enough to ring a few bells: Abu al-Malih ibn `Usama's father relates that the Prophet said: Circumcision is a law for men and a preservation of honour for women.' Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167.

After decades of imposing a brutal one-child policy where the communist regime routinely forced women to kill illegal fetuses and still blacklists children born without the blessing of the state, Beijing has found a lack of appetite among Chinese couples for becoming parents. Communist Party chief Xi Jinping has attempted to change the tide of population decline by expanding the policy to two children, but rather than triggering a baby boom, the national fertility rate fell.
Describing his experience within the U.S. conservative movement, Grenell said: I watched it from a front-row seat going from people privately telling me 'I'm with ya' to not being able to say it publicly or there were times at Republican Conventions that if you were seen as too good of a friend with Rick Grenell well you probably were gay.

At the same time, the boundless opportunity represented by the pursuit of the American Dream doesn't look so boundless anymore. The lower-middle-class man no longer fears hunger and deprivation, nor does he see a glittering prize to reach for with extraordinary effort.

Why does the word 'homosexuality' never appear in recent official documents of the Holy See? asked Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò in a recent symposium. This is by no means to suggest that most of those with a homosexual inclination are abusers, but the fact remains that the overwhelming majority of abuse has been inflicted on post-pubescent boys by homosexual clerics.
First, I support wholeheartedly the movement to address women's rights and to protect them from harassment at home and in workplace. Second, I applaud the legislation for same-sex marriage where it has been attained. I hope that such enlightened legislation will continue to spread.

The underlying fight in the immigration debate is the nature of the United States, said Durbin, who wants the United States to be a nation of immigrants, not a nation of Americans. He told NPR:
So it dawned on us today that maybe we ought to stop playing all these stupid media clips every night. It's like watching the town drunk throw up on himself over and over again. Obviously, it's repulsive and shocking. It's hard to turn away. But can you really be surprised by it?
In particular, the petition cited Senator Cornyn's votes for Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Devos as secretary of education, and yes on requiring a photo ID to vote in federal elections and a ban of same-sex marriage. It also mentioned that he voted no on continuing federal funds for declared 'sanctuary cities,' and on expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program.

Whittlesey graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1963 and clerked with Judge Francis Van Dusen of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania when, according to her biographer, historian Thomas Carty, 95 percent of judges and lawyers were men. At odds with left-wing feminists for much of her career, she is nevertheless credited with first popularizing the aphorism that Ginger Rodgers did everything Fred Astaire did backwards and in high heels.
Faraji said of his female ninjas, The truth is that its lethal power is undeniable.

Throwing up on themselves is what town drunks do. If you keep watching them as they do it, maybe after a while, you are part of the problem. Maybe so. In any case, we flipped off CNN and decided to check out Joe Biden's speech for ourselves. And it was interesting, actually, both for what it said and for what it didn't say.
A six-justice majority has extended homosexual rights to same-sex couples by ordering the state of Arkansas to allow a non-related or same-sex spouse be named as the second parent on a child's birth certificate, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer.
Good grief, Buttigieg is openly blaspheming God by blaming God for his sin.
An inspirational headline overlaid a picture of Buttigieg and husband Chasten: First Family — The unlikely, untested and unprecedented campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, it read.

While left-wing activists have been highlighting Biden's treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court hearings and his past opposition to school busing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) this week perhaps signaled that Biden's rivals will begin to focus what could be Biden's true Achilles' heel—his past support for big banks and credit card companies.
In contrast to Biden and his business-backed policies, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on January 19 that Americans and their job should get a higher priority than immigration changes.

I have never met Professor Kim; perhaps she does not attend the meetings of the Medieval Academy. But what I know from what she has written about me is this: Professor Kim wants you to be afraid. I don't. I want – like Mary – for you to know that you are loved and that God so loved the world that he gave his Son in sacrifice that the world might be remade. How should you signal that you are not a white supremacist if you teach the medieval western European Christian past? Learn some f*cking medieval western European Christian history, including the history of our field.**
As Israel noted, the legislation would force the term sex in the Civil Rights Act to mean pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and the last of these — related medical conditions — has already been interpreted to include abortion by both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

The Princess of Wales had a fairy tale life that went sour, and then was cut short. Mother Teresa had a life out of biblical scripture that grew rich in years and reverence. Mother became one of the most revered persons of the modern world by shunning much of what the modern world reveres–money, things, even the good things good people often want: comfort and security. Mother Teresa believed human beings didn't suffer from poverty, but became richer by it. She told those who sought her out to ask, What can I do to help? – Give until it hurts.

Studies and analyses have previously identified a left-wing bias on Wikipedia, including a Harvard study cited in Fox's report. However, corporate media have generally praised Wikipedia for its reliability in recent years and many have relied on it as a source to the point of copying from it extensively, while conservative media such as Fox News and Breitbart itself have been increasingly purged from the site. Wikipedia has also been found to shape scientific literature and business decisions.
For example, a May 7 study by two post-graduate professors argued that aversion to social change is strongly predictive of support for Trump at the mass level, even among racial minorities. That language suggests that acceptance of social change is the proper position for voters to take, regardless of the proposed change.
But most of the criticism of the first article came not just from Christians, but also from BuzzFeed's own readers and from many of Aurthur's peers in the media. As one BuzzFeed reader wrote in response to the first article: This is a tired, forced witch hunt. You are inciting a wave of negative attention on this couple for something that indirectly links to them. That's not journalism, it's petty bullsh*t.

First, I support wholeheartedly the movement to address women's rights and to protect them from harassment at home and in workplace. Second, I applaud the legislation for same-sex marriage where it has been attained. I hope that such enlightened legislation will continue to spread. Third, I supported wholeheartedly the right of women to have an abortion should they so decide.

Margaret Iuculano, of the American Conservative Union, spoke of rampant poverty within the foster system. On any given day, over 400,000 children are being raised by our government. In 2015 alone, over 670,000 children spent time in the foster care system, Iuculano said. She noted that over half of those children in the 2015 statistics were people of color. These are alarming numbers and, I don't know about you, but I don't think the role of government is to raise children.

Brokaw also told Bannon that Nancy Reagan's influence on her husband may have contributed to his administration's foreign policy successes:
This is not the first time sharia law has become the focus of debate in a Western country. As Breitbart News reported, Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, has called sharia the most brutal and extreme system of governance ideology on the face of the Earth. It is misogynistic. It is anti-Semitic. It is anti-infidel. It is anti-gay. It is anti-free speech.

Ma's remarks triggered some outrage on social media given his promotion of the strenuous 996 schedule, which many noted leaves little time for family life, much less sex. In response to the controversy, an Alibaba spokeswoman issued a statement saying that Ma offered lighthearted life and marital advice to 102 newlywed couples, saying the key to a successful marriage is to forget the negatives and embrace the positives of each other and that the value of love, unlike coding, can't be measured or calculated.

NSPCC Chief Executive Peter Wanless commented: Forcing a child to marry shows a complete lack of regard for their feelings, thoughts or ambitions. We must be clear that, regardless of cultural expectations, this is a crime and an abuse of human rights.
The new photograph, taken last week, shows the Duke standing straight unsupported with his hands clasped informally behind his back. Britain's long-lived Royals have chalked up a number of records between them — the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen have had the longest Royal marriage in British history, and the Duke is the longest-serving Royal consort ever. Queen Elizabeth II is the longest-reigning monarch in British history, and is the longest-reigning monarch in the world now alive.
The remedy against discrimination and contempt for women, he added, is not obtained by denying the biological and psychological identity of men and women, but through conversion to the recognition that both man and woman are primarily human persons with the same dignity, both created in the image of God.
We thought about how to announce our two miracles to the world. Everything we could think of fell short of doing them justice. Doing ourselves justice, for every trial and tribulation we have been through these past years. Taking out these needles by the handful to take this photograph was… surreal. Half way through my hands started to quiver, my breath got short, and I had to stop. I sat down, looked at it and started to cry. Not because I was sad about what it took to get here, but because it was a representation of my world, our world, for the past over two and a half years staring back at me. There was a lot of pain, hope, and fear behind each of these needles. Each one representes [sic] a different day, a different path, a different emotion. It's a lot to take in. After a good cry, the more I looked at it, the more the needles started to blur together. Now all I see are these tiny onesies that so perfectly sum up our journey: Worth the wait. And wait, and wait, and wait.

While you cannot compare Mother Teresa's life of service with Princess Diana's occasional missions of charity, looking through the pictures of their lives this week, you're struck by the way each of them reached out, in a way both loving and lovely, to touch hurt with their hands–caressing and comforting those suffering from biblical diseases, like leprosy and age-old poverty, and modern afflictions, including AIDS, land mines, and homelessness.

His first marriage, lasting from 1995 to 2004, was to a British socialite named Jemima Goldsmith who was hounded for her family's Jewish ancestry while living in Pakistan, as the UK Telegraph put it. She converted to Islam before marrying Khan and remains active in Middle Eastern politics and charity efforts. Her enthusiastic message of congratulations to her ex-husband for winning the prime minister's post was reportedly very well-received in Pakistan.
Virgil wrote on April 5, 2019, and again on April 20 that Bezos's escalated allegations were, indeed, sensational and astounding—if that is, they were true. Still thinking of Bezos's resemblance to Bond-villain Blofeld, Virgil added that the story could well be remembered as some fantastic tale, like something that Ian Fleming might have written for his character James Bond.

Like the Ridgemans, I'm a white person who was once forced by economic circumstance to live, work, and go to school for more than two years in a mostly black ghetto. I promise you there is no shortage of black people who will warn a white person against such a thing. You see, it simply doesn't matter that 99.99 percent of your neighbors are good people. All it takes is one bully to single you out for your skin color.
At the time the mass killings page was unlocked, the introduction to the page listed various figures for the extent of mass killings in the tens of millions, including the Black Book of Communism's range of 85 million to 100 million deaths. However, since the page was unlocked, the introduction has been considerably shortened to remove any mention of casualty figures in the millions, instead stating simply that estimates vary widely on the subject. A previously small sub-section questioning the inclusion of devastating famines occurring under communist-led governments was also considerably expanded with material mostly disputing the attribution of famines to specifically communist policies.
He further stated that Muhammad was the assistant to a Christian preacher named Waraqa Bin Nofal.

If the GOP would just sell its soul and dump its religious constituency, Sheffield suggests, things would go a whole lot better. This includes a full embrace of same-sex marriage and other positions at odds with Biblical morality, in the name of political expediency.
For Marion, the base of the Front National is conservative, Catholic, and traditionalist, and she has opposed gay marriage and abortion to a much greater extent than her aunt.

In order to combat this perceived bias, Baltz states he spent 2020 editing Wikipedia to create or expand articles about female political scientists and increase citations to women on political articles. Under the name Astrophobe on Wikipedia, Baltz claims to have created 264 pages about female political scientists. Reviewing several articles he claimed, many seem to push the boundaries of notability standards on the site, which require significant coverage in secondary sources, evidence of a major impact on an academic field, or holding prominent posts at major academic institutions. One article cited much of its contents to the academic's own work.

And while Sheffield rightly notes that atheists overwhelmingly vote Democrat, he comes up with the unlikely conclusion that Republicans should slough off their historical friendliness with religion in order to keep up with social trends. In other words, Republicans should repeat the Democrats' mistakes of alienating the pro-life community, religious believers, and traditional families in the hopes of pandering to the relatively small group of religiously unaffiliated.
The Veep star posted a rallying call in October for Democrats to win back four seats in Virginia's state legislature, declaring that such a result would ensure that women finally have equal rights in the U.S. constitution.
A Facebook post by the Houston HBCU read:
After Utah authorities announced that they would not criminally prosecute the Browns for violating this state law, on April 11, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the Browns do not have standing to challenge the polygamy statute because they cannot be injured by a law the government says will not be enforced against them.
Public school groups have not been shy about sounding the alarm on this case, HuffPo states, predicting that it could have a devastating effect on education and play a major role in disintegrating the U.S. doctrine of the separation of church and state.
Shyamalan, who is a terrific director, just can't stop trying to regain his crown as the King of Breathtaking Twist Endings, and so we get two here that… Well, considering how bad Glass is, the promise of a sequel and the expanding of the Unbreakable universe feels more like a threat.
The department is headed by a strongly anti-abortion former congressman, Tom Price, she continued. Charmaine Yoest, former head of Americans United for Life, the intellectual powerhouse of the anti-abortion movement, is an assistant secretary and Teresa Manning, a former lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, is in line to be a deputy assistant secretary.
I didn't want to contend with how that made me feel, or it becoming part of my narrative. I became depressed, the actor said. I was blaming myself and I was miserable—because I was saying, 'This is nothing; this guy reached around and he copped a feel.' That summer wore on—and I can't remember what I went on to work on next.

Okay, it's a true story, so maybe all that happened. But it's handled with such spoon-fed, heavy-handed pomposity, you can't help but roll your eyes, especially when a racist German Sheppard tries to attack a black woman.
According to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty, the College asserts. Conditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.
[We plan to] revise the idea that a home is a safe place for children and women, presidential aide Shahnaz Sajjadi reportedly told local media. Crimes that happen against women in society are less than those that happen in the homes.
The ideology's claim that the state must enforce a new right to gender identity also means that the state must ignore and often dismantle many civic rules that evolved to help the two distinct sexes — men and boys, women and girls — meet their legally equal, but different and complementary, needs. For example, the transgender ideological demand means that single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms must opened up to people of the opposite sex, regardless of age, and without any verification of created gender identity.
In the meantime, The Daily Beast reports that also on January 31, Michael Sanchez filed suit against Bezos alleging defamation. And on February 3, Jeff Bezos counter-sued, formally accusing Michael Sanchez of extortion. That's a heavy legal concept, extortion. Interestingly, the Saudis don't seem to be accused of being involved here. The absence of the Saudis, we can observe, supports the idea that the elaborate scenario of Saudi involvement, was just a red herring–a diversion–thrown on the trail by Team Bezos, as a way of shifting attention from a simpler scenario of a family feud.
The elderly couple's hasty escape forced them to leave various possessions behind, including a wallet and wedding ring. The couple later was able to safely return to collect their valuables.

Invoking the days of slavery in the United States, he said love helped those in captivity persevere.
Yet socialism has somehow entered the mainstream of political debate. Suddenly, almost out of nowhere, we have these strange socialist characters — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Bernie Sanders — and a whole political party that seems magnetically drawn toward the socialist camp. This development by itself is surpassingly strange, because socialism is arguably the most discredited idea since slavery.
Good grief, we just elected a black president for two terms, we just brought black unemployment to a record low, and the entire country was repulsed by what happened to George Floyd, most especially President Trump… But people are still rioting.
He campaigned for president on promises to jumpstart the economy by lifting many tariffs, lowering taxes and attracting foreign investment. He promised to solve a long-standing New York court fight with creditors in the U.S. who Fernandez called vultures and has refused to negotiate with, which kept Argentina on the margins of international credit markets.
Who can forget the story of Bezos, and of siblings Lauren and Michael Sanchez? That story blew up Bezos's marriage; he settled with his now ex-wife for $35 billion, a matrimonial record.

The Supreme Court made it clear twenty years ago that if public universities wish to force students to pay student activity fees, then those universities have an affirmative duty to ensure that the funds are distributed in a viewpoint neutral manner—not by a simple majority vote. But the officials at Georgia Tech have done the opposite. They force students to fund other students' expression through the student activity fee, but students may only access those funds through a system that permits, and in some cases demands, viewpoint discrimination.

After years of denial, it is now widely known that the opening of the U.S. market to Chinese imports was devastating, inflicting deep and lasting damage to many areas in the U.S. Regions most exposed to competition from China not only lost manufacturing jobs, they saw overall employment decline and never recovered. Areas with higher exposure have also been shown to have more people relying on food stamps and disability payments, more people addicted to opioids, lower rates of marriage, higher rates of political polarization, and higher rates of incarceration.

Catholic League President Bill Donohue, however, saw it differently and asked Friday who is actually guilty of inciting riots?
Yet in the real world, the political collapse of socialism was brought about by its economic failure. This was certainly true in the Soviet Union, where Gorbachev's rescue efforts — glasnost and perestroika — failed spectacularly, first bringing down the Soviet empire, then the Communist ruling party, and finally the socialist system itself. China, too, abandoned socialism for its economic shortcomings. And look how poorly socialism is faring in Zimbabwe, Cuba and Venezuela today. So how can one adopt socialist ideas once again without considering the economic track record of socialist regimes?
Friday, managing director of the Tadwein Gender Research Center, Amel Fahmy, commented that unless there is true criminalization of the practice, it will continue.

The nonsense Jeb spewed, especially when you look back at the Bush family history (which I will get to), beggars belief.
They were always prepared to help deliver that, not just on a substantive point of view, but also in a kind of metaphorical way. So when they went out in public, they had a patina, more than a patina, of glamour about them, and she kept that up after we lost the President. At the [Reagan] Library, for example, she would be always introduced as the former First Lady of the United States. They had ruffles and flourishes played. The whole setting at the library, I think, is a real tribute to their personal tastes, but also to the place of the Presidency in our lives, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or a Tea Party member or whatever. You go in there and you have a sense of the majesty of the office, if you will, and I mean that in a pragmatic sense, not in the royal sense.
A wedding cake, even one without an inscription, is an artistic expression by the person making it, Kern County Superior Court Judge David Lampe said Monday in a ruling denying a state agency's request to require the bakery owner, Cathy Miller, to comply with California's antidiscrimination law. The state asks this court to compel Miller against her will and religion to allow her artistic expression in celebration of marriage to be co-opted to promote the message desired by same-sex marital partners, Lampe said. The right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment outweighs the state's interest in ensuring a freely accessible marketplace. … Cathy would never discriminate against anyone who walks through her bakery's doors, said Charles LiMandri of the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund, a religious conservative nonprofit. She will gladly serve anyone, including same-sex couples. But Cathy will not use her artistic talents to express messages that conflict with her sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage.

LONDON, Feb 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Girls in Britain as young as 11 are being forced into marriage via the internet while others are being secretly wed over the phone, two charities said on Monday.
In 2011, post-graduate voters split their vote 46 percent Democratic to 33 percent Republican. In 2017, that split widened to 53 percent versus 26 percent after non-college voters showed that they strongly backed Donald Trump in 2016. That switch shows blue-collar voters were turning away from the Democrats' elite-boosting policies of imposed civic variety — or diversity — plus cheap blue-collar labor via immigration, favoritism for sexual minorities, funding for urban growth, and deference to unelected international government.
The Bay State's Senate president Stanley Rosenberg, 68, said he will step aside from his leadership role temporarily given an investigation into accusations by four men of sexual misconduct by his same-sex husband, Bryon Hefner, 30.
There was no question how the Chinese did it. The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. Under Mao, factories were nationalized and the land of the peasants was expropriated. Mao targeted traders and businessmen — the bourgeoisie — attempting in his own words to destroy the property owning class by killing at least one landlord in every village via public execution. Mao's Great Leap Forward, announced in 1958, accelerated the collectivization of farms; in fact, all private farming was banned. The result was the greatest man-made famine in history.
Grant also asked, Why are there so many abortion clinics near African-American communities?

The woman is out on bail, staying at a safehouse, after being charged with extra-marital sex and prevented from returning to England. Advocates say she may be stuck in Dubai for months, and if convicted faces punishments that range from caning to being stoned to death.
The pope does not believe in trickle-down economic theory, he does not believe, as many of my more conservative colleagues believe, that if we give more tax breaks to the rich, and we deregulate Wall Street, and deregulate industry, that somehow all of the benefits about the regulation will filter on down to ordinary people, Sanders said in a separate interview in February 2016.
The legislation stems from a case in which federal prosecutors charged two Detroit doctors and a physician's wife in April for allegedly performing genital cutting procedures on girls as young as seven years old.

Most importantly, the worst Trump is guilty of here (and he's not) is a campaign finance violation. Democrats and Dirty Cops in the Justice Department want us to believe the payoff should have been listed on Trump's campaign finance reports as a campaign expense. Even if that were true (and it's not), the worse case scenario is the campaign being hit with a fine.
The bishop said, according to canon law, ministers cannot refuse sacraments to persons who opportunely ask for them, while children cannot be held responsible for the situation of their parents.
According to Meretzki, the new bone is very much alive. It can be strengthened, and it can grow along with the patient, a particular point of interest when it comes to regenerating children's bones. Elderly patients, as well as patients suffering from osteoporosis, infections, cancer, or trauma accidents, could find themselves with new bones up to seven times stronger than an original bone. Cleft palates, currently treated with a series of surgeries spanning over years, could be healed in infancy.
According to a National Bureau of Statistics Report, the sex ratio at birth in 2015 was 113.5 males born for every 100 females born, a disproportion that could only be achieved through sex-selective abortion. Years of such sex-selective favoring of boys has resulted in an estimated 33 to 37 million more males living in China than females. This imbalance is fueling sex trafficking from multiple nations into China for forced marriage or commercial sexual exploitation to help fill the gender gap.

Vince Vaughn plays Brad — sorry, Bradley — a retired boxer, drug dealer, and substance abuser who goes straight until straight nearly costs him the thing he loves most: his wife (Jennifer Carpenter). A miscarriage and barely tolerable existence on a tow-truck driver's salary (a job he just lost) has undermined the marriage to where she's having an empty sexual affair.
The vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife, Ellen Page explained. If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.
These two diverging headlines are the latest in a long skein of allegations and insinuations stemming from the steamy news of photos and texts that ran in the National Enquirer back in January 2019. According to the Guardian, it was international skullduggery, involving the leader of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and perhaps the Israeli digital firm NSO; the allegation is that the Saudi royal and the Israeli company jointly conspired to hack Bezos's phone. (The Saudi government immediately denied the accusation, as did NSO.)

During another segment, Carlson recalls a story regarding a teacher who had allegedly molested a 13-year-old student nearly 30 times in one week. In response, the shock jock asks Carlson if he was physically capable of enduring such unwanted advances or do you take your hat off to this kid? Carlson replied: So my point is that teachers like this, not necessarily this one in particular, but they are doing a service to all 13-year-old girls by taking the pressure off. They are a pressure relief valve, like the kind you have on your furnace.
And there are plenty of those children, even though subsidized birth control is readily available. Teens and twentysomethings simply aren't bothering to use it, because they know their families and the government will take care of accidental children, and besides, a semi-accidental pregnancy might provide them with some emotional purpose in life.
Last week, LGBTQ lobbying group Accountable for Equality launched an attack on Graham and his Samaritan's Purse Christian outreach organization, accusing him and his group of putting New Yorkers' lives on the line by urging Christians who hold to one man-one woman marriage to join the effort to help those affected by the coronavirus crisis.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT REGARDING COMMENCEMENT: Texas Southern University's number one priority is student success and completion. We are proud to announce that 1,138 students have completed their academic journey and are now positioned to compete on a national level. Commencement exercises are special moments for our students, their families and the entire University. Every consideration is made to ensure that our students' graduation day is a celebratory occasion and one they will remember positively for years to come. We asked Senator Cornyn to instead visit with our students again at a future date in order to keep the focus on graduates and their families. We, along with Senator Cornyn, agree that the primary focus of commencement should be a celebration of academic achievement.

To back up his claims, Sheffield cites the 2014 Pew Research study finding that 23 percent of Americans say they're unaffiliated with any religious tradition, up from 20 percent just three years earlier.
The [loss of the] endorsements were really the least of my concerns, Bryant told GQ. Was I afraid of going to jail? Yes. It was twenty-five to life, man. I was terrified. The one thing that really helped me during that process—I'm Catholic, I grew up Catholic, my kids are Catholic—was talking to a priest. It was actually kind of funny: He looks at me and says, 'Did you do it?' And I say, 'Of course not.' Then he asks, 'Do you have a good lawyer?' And I'm like, 'Uh, yeah, he's phenomenal.' So then he just said, 'Let it go. Move on. God's not going to give you anything you can't handle, and it's in his hands now. This is something you can't control. So let it go.' And that was the turning point.
The root of the addiction comes from the hopelessness that people feel in towns like Elyria, said Grodell.

REPORTER: Mr Vice President, you said two weeks ago that you said you were the most progressive person in the Democratic Party — BIDEN: No, I said liberal. I didn't say progressive. REPORTER: You said progressive, sir. BIDEN: Well, here's the point. That's changing too. For my whole career, I wish had been labeled in Delaware for the seven times I ran as a moderate. I was never labeled as a moderate. And if you look at my record with the ACLU, if you look at my record with all of the traditional liberal organizations, I' have never walked away from — I'm not sure when everyone else came out and said they are for gay marriage, I'm not sure when everyone else came out and talked about a lot of things I talked about. But my point is, is the definition of progressive now seems to be changing. That is, Are you a socialist? Well, that's a real progressive. Or you believe in, whatever. So I was talking about up until this last time around the traditional judgments of whether or not you were, quote, a liberal, was whether or not — what your positions on race were; on women; what's your position on LGBT community; what's your positions on civil liberties, you know. I'll stack my record on those things against anybody who'se even run, who's running now, or who will run. REPORTER: But sir, are you suggesting the party is moving too far to the left?
Vani means child marriage, which is common in Pakistan to build and strengthen alliances, settle disputes or pay off debts. Pakistani law does not allow children to marry under the age of 16, but most avoid the law and marry off their children. Police rarely intervene in these family matters.

To be sure, there are fringe groups in our country that truly espouse hatred, and they deserve to be marginalized. Fighting groups such as the Ku Klux Klan several decades ago gave the SPLC stature and credibility. Sadly, the SPLC has squandered that heritage by now acting as a left-wing thought police bully, hurling the hate group slur at people and organizations who simply have different political views.
The next turning point was the financial crisis of 2007-8. Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had already moved to the left after losing reform referendums in 2005. He was unequal to the task of managing the fallout from the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed, leaving the state in fiscal crisis and undermining voters' confidence that Republicans offered a responsible alternative to Democratic profligacy.

Disability checks and means-tested benefits cannot support a lavish lifestyle. But they can offer a permanent alternative to paid employment, and for growing numbers of American men, they do. The rise of these programs has coincided with the death of work for larger and larger numbers of American men not yet of retirement age. We cannot say that these programs caused the death of work for millions upon millions of younger men: What is incontrovertible, however, is that they have financed it—just as Medicaid inadvertently helped finance America's immense and increasing appetite for opioids in our new century.
Stoning for adultery occurs under Islamic law for a reason that you may by now be able to guess: it was endorsed by Mohammed. There are several Islamic sources to back this up. I will recount just one part of Sahih Bukhari 3:50:885 which reads: Allah's Apostle said, By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death. Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah's Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death.
With numbers like this, how did His Fraudulency only rate a 49 percent approval rating?

So there we had it, from both Bezos and de Becker: Yes, Michael Sanchez was a lowlife—in the wake of the leak, he and his sister were estranged, wrote de Becker—but the Saudis, too, were lowlifes, if not worse.
[Y]ou don't really want that kind of world that he's painting she said prior to the 2016 presidential election.
He noted, for example, that the Convention defines 'gender' as 'socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for women and men' — which puts it at odds with the Hungarian constitution, which defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman.
Gay Star News similarly wrote that Samaritan's Purse may be able to force volunteers to refuse treatment to LGBT+ people.
Broglio's words echoed similar expressions on gender ideology penned by Pope Francis in his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si'. In it, the Pope condemned the relativism at the heart of gender theory and urges those struggling with gender identity issues to accept their bodies as God made them.
With Father's Day around the corner, it's a perfect time to remember the important role men play in our kid's lives. https://t.co/qJ4e4Wk1wV — Focus on the Family (@FocusFamily) June 16, 2017
The worst forms of socialism proved not only totalitarian, but also murderous to an unprecedented degree. In the Soviet Union alone, socialist regimes killed some 20 million of their own citizens and enslaved tens of millions of others. The Chinese socialists, in the period known as Mao's Cultural Revolution, killed another 20-25 million. The Nazis murdered in comparable numbers, including Jews and gypsies and other occupied peoples, Poles, Russians, Eastern Europeans and others. Orwell's description from 1984 seems appropriate here: A boot stamping on a human face.
Hannah, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, is from a Pakistani heritage Muslim family. Her cousins began to abuse her after they took a recording of her smoking a cigarette and blackmailed her, aged ten, into performing sexual activities or else they would tell her strict Muslim parents.
Reade continues to behave like a woman with nothing to hide, while Biden hides his Senate papers and counts on the media to turn an unreturned book into conclusive proof his alleged victim is just another one of those crazed, lying, gold-digging harpies standing in the way of a powerful, old white man's rightful place in the world.
Dan Squires QC, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, who has responsibility for equalities within Government, told the court that a decision had been taken within Government to see how legislation extending marriage for same-sex couples planned out before offering civil partnerships up to heterosexual couples.
See Ernie, you've got nothing to worry about, everything is positive! reads the cheeky but dark caption above the photo.
Many other plausible theories could be advanced as to why the Republican Party lost the last two elections, none of which would involve its supposed over-dependency on the Christianity of its base.
During his presidential campaign, now-President Donald Trump made clear that he supported the United Kingdom's Brexit vote to leave the European Union. The day after the June 23 Brexit vote, then-candidate Trump compared the vote to the upcoming presidential election in the U.S. and attributed the U.K. vote to leave the EU, and prospectively the U.S. presidential vote, in large part to people's desire to control borders and block illegal immigration.
Her 2015 blog post, Three Cheers for White Men, argues that white men have played a role in the development of certain rights enjoyed by women throughout the Western world. In the post, Fulton highlights specifically chivalry and courtly love, the development of marriage into a sacrament valid only if both men and women consented and elements of feminism, which were supported by philosophers like John Stuart Mill.
Women routinely bear the brunt of Iran's violent repression of protesters. The face of the 2009 green revolution, a pro-democracy movement crushed by then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was Neda Agha-Soltan, a 26-year-old woman shot in broad daylight amid the protests. Other protesters recorded the shooting and her expiration, outraging the world.
When the Department of Health declined to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed as parents, respondents filed suit in circuit court seeking a declaration that petitioner's refusal to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed violated their constitutional rights, as well as a declaration that certain statutory provisions were unconstitutional. Respondents also sought to enjoin enforcement of petitioner's policy against naming both spouses on the birth certificate under these circumstances and an order requiring petitioner to issue corrected birth certificates naming both spouses.
Moore noted how his fellow Greenpeace directors, at the time of his departure, did not have scientific credentials or backgrounds.
TMZ initially reported the arrest, which occurred at New Jersey's Gateway National Recreation Area, earlier this month. The report drew heavy backlash, particularly due to the fact that Springsteen appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Jeep, in which the left-wing rocker urged Americans to meet in the middle.
Dumbarton is on the north bank of the River Clyde in Scotland and Kilkeel is a small fishing town in Northern Ireland's County Down.
In April of 2012, the Iranian regime had temporarily revoked the press credentials for Reuters news agency after they ran a headline suggesting the it was training female Ninjas to be assassins. The original headline read, Thousands of Female Ninjas Train as Iran's Assassins. It was later changed to Three Thousand Women Ninjas Train in Iran. Nearly one year later, in March of 2013, Iran reinstated its credentials.
The group's February 14 campaign will aim at convincing young Muslims to never date another person, or immediately either break up with or marry the person they are currently dating. According to Coconuts, the group is organizing talks on relationships, sexual health, and religion for their Indonesia Without Dating Day on Friday.
In mid-May, Your Pearland News reported that the superintendent of PISD, Dr. John Kelly said, It has been the position of Pearland ISD administration that children whose parents declare them 'transgender' must go to the bathroom for the sex indicated on their birth certificate. Such student(s) have also been allowed to use a private bathroom (such as in the nurse's station) if they are so inclined.
George W Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite philosopher and credited Billy Graham with changing his life. Jimmy Carter taught Sunday School. Cmon, pastor and author Daniel Darling wrote on Twitter.

He estimates that net migration could be cut by 100,000 a year just through this simple policy in a post-Brexit Britain.
I think it is fair to say that Biden is sincere in a version of liberal Christianity, but the most religiously observant in a half century? Not even the most religiously observant liberal in that stretch (Carter), the Washington Examiner's Jim Antle tweeted.

In the new exposé, Martel accuses the Catholic Church of hypocrisy for opposing gay marriage and adoption when so many of its own clerics are active homosexuals.
They have chosen financial self-interest and ideological division over country, said Rubio, who added it increasingly feels like a democracy of the fittest.
The data was requested in 2017 by Johnson and then-Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee's top Democrat. Johnson said it took a year to get the information, showing there needs to be a better system to track and vet the petitions.

In the new ad for Mately — a New York City-based service that offers discreet and convenient testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases — the two iconic puppets look over the results of what is apparently their own test for diseases.
Breitbart News reached out to Facebook for comment on Glazov's latest suspension but has yet to receive a response at the time of the writing of this article.
The era he hopes to end is that of Fernandez and her late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner who rewrote Argentina's social contract and dominated the nation's political scene with a mix of patronage, charisma and withering attacks on opponents. Fernandez battled international creditors, had strained relations with Washington and allied her country with late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro.
It's funny because this is a guy who spends all day, every day, meticulously designing flowers out of icing — his whole life is gay, okay? Kimmel said.
Just last month, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman admitted that his company worked with the SPLC to identify, and to blacklist, conservatives. Google has also worked with the SPLC to flag content on its platforms, as has Facebook. Giant corporations like Apple, and Hollywood celebrities like George Clooney, have continued to pour donations into the SPLC's coffers: the embattled organization reportedly enjoys a massive half-billion-dollar endowment.
These victims of 'camps' in BBC reports cannot offer evidence for their claims. The Western media has a notorious record on factual accuracy in its reporting — for example, making traffic jams a sign of 'oppression,' The Global Times claimed, without elaborating on what the traffic jams comment was a reference to.
After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce following our separation last summer, the former couple said in a joint statement to People magazine Tuesday. We have the utmost respect for each other and remain close friends.
Since Trumpism was truly born in California, perhaps there's hope for the Golden State after all.
I'm a practicing Catholic, Biden states in his vision for Catholic Americans, and adds, I believe faith is a gift. And the first obligation we all have is, 'Love your God,' the second one is, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' … 'Treat people with dignity.' Everyone's entitled to dignity, that's a basic tenet in my household.
Stone recalled last Friday's events when he was arrested by FBI agents at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with a CNN production team in tow.
However, the Daily Mail now reports having spoken to sources who believe Meghan's long-term plan is to bring Prince Harry with her to Los Angeles, where her mother Doria Ragland still lives, after Donald Trump is no longer U.S. President.
All works of fiction must now reflect core socialist values and abide by moral norms.
He said the government is spending too much money and not achieving much of anything. I bet I could cut that [money spent] in half and still get the same results, he said, asking what Milwaukee Public School (MPS) is doing with $1.2 billion a year. You know what the budget is for the entire City of Milwaukee, 600,000 people? $1.3 billion. So you have to ask yourselves, what is MPS doing with that $1.2 billion; almost as much as it takes to run an entire city? He said, horrible graduation rates, horrible truancy rates, a growing education gap between black students and their counterparts, failing math scores, failing reading scores, among other things.
The strange antidote is one of several unflattering details to have emerged regarding O'Rourke's past since officially launching his campaign last Thursday. In recent days, the candidate confirmed to Reuters that he was a member of a controversial hacker group the Cult of the Dead Cow while he was a teenager. He also admitted to penning a murder fantasy at 15-years-old in which he imagined mowing down children out jealousy for their happiness. O'Rourke was also forced to apologize on Friday for quipping during a campaign stop that he is only partly involved in raising his children.
Sullivan is a gay liberal who led the push for single-sex marriage. But he is not an anti-America progressive. He has supported the border wall and recognizes the political extremism of the Democrats' see-no-problem policies towards immigration:
TEL AVIV – Saudi Arabia has recently become embroiled in a debate over the idea that polygamy can provide a solution to the problem of single women in the kingdom, with some proponents saying men should take three wives – a single woman, a widow, and a divorcee – thus alleviating the burden of spinsters on society.
Only a few weeks ago several gay advocacy groups sent a letter to the conference demanding that any hope for BYU be quashed at the outset because of the school's Mormon-based religious stance on homosexuality.
Prager responded: Did you read anything else that I wrote? He accused Apter of cherry-picking quotes — and taking talking points from elsewhere.
More than 500,000 migrants have entered Italy in the last three years, leading even center-left politicians to speak of an unsustainable situation.
Durbin's record of political support for abortion constitutes obstinate persistence in manifest grave sin, the bishop said, quoting a stipulation in Canon Law for withholding Communion from a Catholic.
In Sveen v. Melin, they will decide whether it violates the Constitution's Contracts Clause for a state to pass a law invalidating a previous contract where the private parties agreed to a marriage-related contract before that new law was enacted.
The event opened with a minute of silence for those who have died of Chinese coronavirus in the country and the health workers who sacrificed their lives in the fight against the epidemic. The Global Times, another communist outlet, noted that dictator Xi Jinping participated in the minute of silence and applauded the incident as an extraordinary event, though moments of silence for those killed by what studies have shown to be a preventable pandemic have occurred around the world.
And let's not forget Amazon Alexa, which counts as a kind of in-house spy machine; that's a piece of work that Bond author Ian Fleming never thought of, perhaps because his fellow Brit, George Orwell, already had. Alexa has been accused of many things, and, also, indisputably, it has a creepy laugh that goes off at weird times.
1. The establishment of Black Voices for Trump:
He said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were being diluted or rolled back and that in 34 countries rape within marriage was still legal.
I love and respect all people for who they are and their opinions. but personally, I will not support gay marriage.✌❤ — Israel Folau (@IzzyFolau) September 13, 2017
Like Judge Edith Jones on the Fifth Circuit, Batchelder has been a generation-long anchor for her Sixth Circuit on adhering to the original public meaning of the Constitution, regardless of political pressures or opinion polls. She was considered for the Supreme Court in 2005 – as Jones was in 1990 – but by all accounts was genuinely relieved when President George W. Bush picked Samuel Alito for the seat, preferring small-town life in Ohio to living in the nation's capital.
The president reflected in the interview on his trip with the first lady to Alabama to visit victims and pay respects to the 23 who died in the tornado. The tornadoes were horrible, but she wanted to go, and I said, 'Good, let's go,' Trump said, referring to Mrs. Trump. We went to pay our respects; it was a horrible thing. One woman lost ten people in her family because I saw all the people who were affected.
The Australian government has taken the lead from President Donald Trump in the race to improve vetting of immigrants who may hold hostile Islamic attitudes, and to reform wage-slashing guest-worker programs like the H-1B white-collar outsourcing visa.
The truth (which is available with a few keystrokes to anyone with integrity) is that Guilfoyle is an opinion pundit for Fox News. Also, her relationship with Don Jr. is not a secret. Therefore there is no conflict of interest, there is no reporting, there are no ethical issues.
The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may redirect funds from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to charitable groups such as Samaritan's Purse and the Red Cross, the New York Post reported Thursday.
In February, O'Donnell led a protest outside the White House ahead of the president's first joint address to Congress.
In October of 2017, McGowan spoke of Messick in glowing terms to the New York Times. While it was Messick who unwittingly set up the January 1997 meeting with Weinstein that would end in a rape accusation, McGowan told the Times that after she told Messick of the incident, She held me. She put her arms around me.
• Cruz cited the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as the U.S. Supreme Court justice, who now can make a fifth conservative vote.
11:55 PM: Biden's team does not seem ready for prime time:
Gynecologists Kavita Shah Arora and Allan Jacobs said procedures that slightly changed the look of a girl's genitalia without damaging them were comparable to male circumcision or cosmetic procedures in Western countries like labiaplasty.
Conservatives in the Arab world are not eager to allow the band to perform. Last year, authorities in Jordan decided to ban a concert by the band at a famous Roman amphitheater in the kingdom, claiming that the band's songs oppose Jordanian morals.
If the conviction is not successfully appealed, the migrants could face possible deportation, though it is not guaranteed. A migrant who raped an elderly woman last year in Austria was not deported despite being convicted of his crime.
Graham said he and Samaritan's Purse do not object to criticism of their Christian beliefs, since it is part of life in a country that cherishes freedom of speech and religion:
Some netizens supported the celebrities' choice, saying that raising children should not be automatically tied to marriage, the Times noted, referring to online users of Chinese social media. The Communist Party strictly regulates opinions on its social media platforms, meaning the support for the two celebrities would only appear on the sites if the government wished it to.
Macron, however, has said he would not look to prohibit head scarves, and has pledged to speed up the review process for asylum requests to a maximum of six months, including appeals.
Clarke, who has served 40 years in law enforcement, said By the time these individuals get to us, there's only one thing we can do: There's one thing cops do and cops do it well. We lock people up. That's what we are designed to do, to separate dangerous people from law-abiding society.
The AFP documents included: references to an email from a girl who wrote she was being held against her will and being forced to marry; a situation report with allegations of a forced marriage at the end of the school year; and a human trafficking referral of a girl who was forced to travel outside of Australia and then exploited.
I would add that a civil union of this type (one which is not equated to marriage) should be as inclusive as possible, and not be restricted to two people of the same sex in a presumed sexual relationship.
CNA also cited a letter by Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio who, in 2017, was serving as prefect of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts and provided the views of the Holy See on the issue of baptisms of children of same-sex couples.
The Democrats chosen to participate in CNN and the Des Moines Register's presidential debate on Tuesday wanted to make very clear to the world: They like women.

On Monday, O'Rourke boasted his campaign raised more than $6 million in the first 24 hours. The record-breaking $6.1 million collected last week came without a dime from political action committees, corporations or special interests, O'Rourke spokesman Chris Evans tweeted. The figure is just above what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reported for his first day as a 2020 candidate.
One of the Centre Party's leading members in Solna, Magnus Persson, said he had spoken with Aldebe saying she had defended her ruling. Persson added that such rulings were not welcome in the Centre Party.
One of the specific complaints was that the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC), commonly referred to as Q-course, was restructured so that there were no physical barriers to earning the coveted Green Beret.
Elsewhere, at the University of Arizona, Residence Life sponsors a privilege walk race which encourages participants to become critical of their personal privileges associated with race. It also has a long list of questions ranging from whether one calls the police when trouble occurs to whether one's native language is English.
Well it was, in the truest sense of the word, a deeply emotional relationship, but also very pragmatic. I was just saying on the air a few moments ago that I thought their thespian training, their Hollywood background, helped them in politics, because they were conscious of the fact the country wanted something grand in the Presidency, Brokaw said. He also noted that:
Friends of Ashley's continue to express their hope that the murder investigation is less torturous than the high-profile case of Meredith Kercher, a British exchange student who was murdered in Umbria in 2007, suffering multiple stab wounds in the attack.
He also explained why he had not attended the Academy Awards in Los Angeles even when he was nominated for the film world's top prize.

BuzzFeed has not let up on Christian TV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines, with reporter Kate Aurthur implicitly warning the hosts of HGTV's Fixer Upper that they will receive more bad press unless the show features a same-sex couple.
Five Mexican nationals, members of a notorious international criminal enterprise that forced young women and underage girls from Mexico and Central America into prostitution in the United States, received stiff prison sentences.
During one of his attacks on Pence, Buttigieg actually said the following:
The district has been devastated by the virus, but also devastated by poverty for the last 25 years, so the question is where were these people when the Diaz's were here? Shienkopf said. Who is standing up to scream about it? Diaz keeps proving he's the one that can yell the loudest, so that gives him some standing.
These so-called 'flexible tariffs' are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth – protectionism and uncertainty. Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster. I will immediately draft and introduce legislation to nullify these tariffs, and I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.
The 30-page booklet, a copy of which was delivered to every Scottish church on Tuesday, asks ministers to consider using gender-neutral language for God as part of a range of measures to make their congregation more inclusive for individuals who identify as transgender.
Part of why Baltz claims this is a problem is the fact studies suggest Wikipedia can shape scientific literature. He claims groups underrepresented in academia tend to be missing at an even higher rate on Wikipedia and together this means Wikipedia does not just passively reflect biases. It amplifies and reinforces them. Baltz further criticizes Wikipedia claiming only 20 percent of political scientists with articles are women when 30 percent of political scientists are reportedly women. He raises a similar issue with nearly half of articles on political scientists being Americans.
An MP belonging to French President Emmanuel Macron's La Republique En Marche! (LREM) has compared members of a pro-traditional marriage movement to radical Islamic terrorists.
Many Americans still believe that political parties should ultimately be guided not just by pragmatism and polls, but by deeply held convictions concerning the common good, justice, truth, and the welfare of all citizens.
Fact: By adding sexual orientation and gender-identity rules to the Civil Rights Act's Title IV on desegregation of public education, the Equality Act could pave the way for K–12 federal courts to require sexual orientation and gender-identity curricula the same way they required black history curricula …
The Chinese Foreign Ministry and government-run newspapers in the country launched a campaign Thursday to discredit women who have testified to being raped and tortured in Communist Party-run concentration camps, referring to them as criminals and actors.
Reagan's foreign policy was strongly opposed—not only by Democrats, who ferociously opposed it, but by the establishment wing of his own party, Whittlesey told the American Conservative of her time in the White House. He was called a warmonger and a cowboy.

He played the father of Chris Farley's titular character in the 1995 comedy Tommy Boy.
The challenges for Binta, whose name was changed to protect her privacy, were even greater because her pregnancy was caused by someone in her extended family.
This has proven to be too much for a slew of Hollywood big-wigs: We pride ourselves on running inclusive companies, and while we have enjoyed a positive partnership on productions in Georgia we will plan to take our business elsewhere if any legislation sanctioning discrimination is signed into state law.

Chinese state media insisted all necessary precautions have been taken while sticking to the Communist Party line that the coronavirus has been effectively wiped out in Wuhan. The Global Times celebrated the hustle and bustle of crowds returning to Wuhan's streets, writing fondly of energy, laughter, and constant intimate arguments filling the air as the naturally chirpy and rambunctious people of Wuhan emerged from quarantine.
Yes I know I was nice about him immediately after his resignation speech. But that was three days ago when I was still in shock over the Brexit result. Now I've had time for a bit more reflection, I can see his disgraceful, petulant, arrogant behaviour for what it is.
8:25 PM: Sanders says the crisis (keeps saying Ebola but means corona) exposes the cruelty of America's economy. He says multimillionaires will get through this but half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. He says the lesson to be learned is we have to move aggressively to address the fragility of economy and how unjust it is that so few have so much.
Spann claimed that her marriage to her daughter was allowed under the law because she lost custody of her children many years ago and her name is not on their birth certificates.
There is no minimum age for a contract of marriage, but it should not be consummated if that would cause harm to the putative spouse, the book reads. Whilst some have argued that there may be reasons for changing marriage laws to include polygamous marriages… there have not been any proposals for any legislative amendment proposed by the Muslim communities in our Common Law jurisdictions.
• Natasha Mwansa, 18, is from Zambia where she lobbies against child marriage, founded the Natashs Mwansa Foundation and is the youngest recipient of the Worth Health Organization's Global Health Leaders Award.

Prosecution and conviction of suspects are not based on imagination rather it is based on evidence otherwise it will be treated as hearsay which is not admissible in court, Badmos proclaimed, according to the Guardian in Nigeria.
Hate groups are on the rise! That was the message from breathless reporting on the new hate map by media enthusiastic to advance the SPLC's narrative. Why are hate groups allegedly on the rise? One reason might be that the SPLC has watered down the definition of a hate group to the point where anyone advancing a traditional or pro-American position is deemed guilty.
The left is blacklisting us for referring to biological men as he.
The National Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) estimates there are as many as 137,000 victims of FGM throughout the United Kingdom.
When you were named after Margaret Court, it seemed like the right thing to do, Navratilova wrote in her open letter to Court Arena. After all, Rod Laver already had the big stadium, and Court is one of the all-time greats. I had long ago forgiven Court for her headline-grabbing comments in 1990 when she said I was a bad role model because I was a lesbian.
Cool, seeing a proposal for Michael & Jake on #Bulls center court. Crowd cheers! — Cheryl Raye Stout (@Crayestout) December 9, 2016

When I got up there, she said, 'It's dangerous. Get back down again,' he commented, adding, I asked 'How much do you love me?' She said, 'More than you know.'
Alqunun's father arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday, but his daughter refused to meet with him.
Telling the Court of Protection that the woman's father had spent his daughter's money for his own purposes and with no intention of repaying her, the judge said the woman was unquestionably married under the influence of her father.
The left is especially incensed that Robertson believes that marriage is based on men and women rather than whatever is preferred by five judges on the Supreme Court. He cited 7,000 years of marital history as proof and also cited Scripture. This is a belief held by at least half of the adults in the United States and an overwhelming number of countries around the world.
I could not think of a more dangerous person to head up the Office of Civil Rights at HHS, JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Human Rights Campaign said, according to Yahoo. Once again, Donald Trump is declaring war against our community by appointing anti-LGBTQ people at all levels of his administration.
The Washington Times reported on the bill:
It is now clear exactly who Court is: an amazing tennis player, and … a homophobe. Her vitriol is not just an opinion. She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too). She is demonizing trans kids and trans adults everywhere, Navratilova added.
To date, only one forced marriage case in England has led to a prosecution.
I would start negotiations [with Iran] again, she promised. And I won't take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting — Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage believes Prince Harry has let the side down, and compared his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to Wallis Simpson, another American divorcee whose relationship with the Royal Family brought down a king.
The change.org petition asked those reading it: Please recall that Coretta Scott King urged Congress to block the 1986 nomination of Jeff Sessions for federal judge, saying that allowing him to join the federal bench would 'irreparably damage the work of my husband.'
The archbishop noted that marriage is unique because it is the only institution that connects children to their mothers and fathers, and therefore is presumed to be a sexual relationship.
The left seems to delight in misunderstanding Robertson. None more so than when Robertson supposedly used the calendar to show that Jesus was God.
The tractor plowing the field behind Johnny Sack's new home is a beautiful touch:
Late in life, Whittlesy continued to be active and relevant on the national political stage, endorsing the Republican ticket in 2016 and writing numerous op-eds, largely counseling restraint and prudence in U.S. foreign and domestic affairs. She served as a bridge between the Reagan Revolution and the Trump Revolution 36 years later. As co-chair of Reaganites for Trump, she pushed for the resumption of Reagan's core agenda. A practicing Roman Catholic, she also served as a member of the Trump campaign Catholic Advisory Group.
The women in the video proceed to ridicule questions that articulate concerns about coercion over the wearing of the garment, and oppressive practices within Islam. At one point early in the video, one woman sardonically comments: Ninja is not the trend at the moment, it's more of the terrorist one.
Marlow asked about reconciling worldly suffering with belief in God. Why does God allow this to happen, and how would you describe it to people who do feel like they've been abandoned in times like this?
Princess Diana was born into privilege, married into and even died in opulence. She spent most of her life in comfortable pursuit of `good things'.

The throne has little practical power but great ceremonial importance, including the king's role as symbolic head of Islam in Malaysia.

Fox News cites the Wikipedia articles on socialism and communism as examples of leftist bias. While both delve into leftist theory, they also covered each ideology's history almost completely ignoring the brutality and authoritarianism of many proclaimed socialist or communist regimes. Regarding the Soviet Union, one section states Soviet rule saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century with only a brief mention of the excesses of Stalin's regime not mentioning the famines and mass-killings it entailed. On Asia, Mao's reign in China is essentially unmentioned, while mentioning Indonesia's Suharto killing hundreds of thousands to suppress leftists.

Another way in which this year will likely be different is the length of the sessions, which could be shortened to one week.

So it is with the socialists. They are on a grand quest, and they refuse to look back. The insist that they are the champions of a moral ideal. The only way to refute them is to refute their moral ideal, to expose their dream as a nightmare, to capsize their utopia. Normally people try to defeat utopia by showing it is a fantasy. But this is inadequate, because a fantasy continues to hold its appeal even when it is exposed as a fantasy. So we have to expose the socialist utopia not as an illusion but rather as a racket.

What's more, Trump did not base his presidential campaign on championing his libertine past, on bragging about his adultery, on reveling in his sin.

This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, complained Soledad O'Brien, prompting Dorsey to apologize by responding, You're right. Completely forgot about their background.
There is simply no credible case to be made that Megan Markle's departure from Britain has anything to do with 'racism.' On the contrary, both the Royal Family and the British public have been at pains to make this brash newcomer welcome, despite her weapons-grade sense of entitlement and her apparent unwillingness to do more than the barest minimum to fit in either with Royal protocol or the duties that come with the privilege of her newly acquired wealth and her rank by marriage.

Let's move on to forced marriage. Child marriage is rife in the Muslim world, and it is not, as some suggest, simply a consequence of extreme poverty.

Perhaps the major reason that the White Death has been so baffling for the experts is that they can't believe that their benevolent government programs are playing a central role in this national catastrophe.

As for the violence that left five dead, the court evangelical simply shrugged it off: We knew he had flaws when he ran for office in 2016. There is absolutely nothing Christian about that. With blasphemous preachers like Graham blessing Trump's Big Lie and pretending antifa was behind the attack, it's no wonder the failed coup featured crosses and Jesus saves banners and flags. Graham and the religious right must be held accountable for their deadly dishonesty. Graham gets away with his hatred and conspiracy-theories by hiding behind the humanitarian work of Samaritan's Purse and his late father's name. It's time for Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) to realize that by propping up Franklin's unchristian extremism, they are abandoning their Gospel missions, undermining democracy, and helping incite white-nationalist sedition.

Some of the most interesting, and horrible, passages of Bailey's account concern the demise of families. Young people in their 20s and 30s are described as strung out and walking around like zombies instead of working and raising their children. Their parents failed to pass along parenting skills, and the moral imperative to use them. Instead, the cycle of drug addiction is the most likely inheritance for kids to get from their families. Evidently, almost half the children in the country are living with someone other than their biological parents—often grandparents or other family members, stepping in to raise the children of broken homes. Seventy-seven percent of these children live in households where no one has a job.

I used to be a feminist, but I gave it up so I could speak out for women's rights. Even before the intersectional, how many genders are there? lunacy took over, feminism was filled to bursting with types who think men are misogynists who all secretly want to rape us (this despite the fact that men are among the greatest supporters of women's rights) and a happily married mother is some kind of traitor.

Sure, there is a socialist temptation, and this is the same temptation that some cult leaders and TV evangelists hold out to their gullible audience. They offer the temptation of paradise, freed from the normal drudgery and travails of life, with manna dropping into their laps from heaven. This is pretty much what the socialists promise, too. The main difference is that the televangelist promises these wonders in the next life; the socialist in this one. All you are expected to give up is your ownership of yourself, including your right to keep what is yours, your personal autonomy and dignity, and your independence of mind.
Secular people lack a built-in community relative to the faithful, added Prager.
