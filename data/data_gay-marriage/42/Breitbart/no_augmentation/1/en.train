{"original": "a washington post article published this week criticizes bias in political science articles on wikipedia. however, rather than attacking the left-wing bias afflicting political articles, the author argues instead the problem is articles not citing enough female authors and academics. the author, samuel baltz, boasted of trying to fix this bias by expanding coverage of women in political articles, while otherwise celebrating wikipedia's political and ideological neutrality in its coverage.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "baltz, himself a political scientist, stated wikipedia is widely praised for its success in spreading reliable information about political events. he further claimed misinformation is largely suppressed on breaking news events. while praising the site's impressive record of political and ideological neutrality in his piece, baltz also claimed, it has serious biases in its coverage of political topics. those biases, baltz claimed, include focusing too much on wealthy countries and too little on women. such a narrative is consistent with other corporate media, who praise wikipedia as a tool against fake news yet routinely criticize its diversity issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the main instances of bias baltz identified is many articles on political topics, such as the electoral college, citing men more than women to an extent he claims is disproportionate to their representation in the political science field. he stated of the dozen academic citations on the electoral college's wikipedia page, only one had a woman as the primary author. baltz also criticized the article on democracy, stating only 10 percent of the works in the article's further reading section listed a woman as the first author. he cited similarly low percentages for articles on conservatism (11 percent), socialism (3 percent), and dictatorship (0 percent).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "part of why baltz claims this is a problem is the fact studies suggest wikipedia can shape scientific literature. he claims groups underrepresented in academia tend to be missing at an even higher rate on wikipedia and together this means wikipedia does not just passively reflect biases. it amplifies and reinforces them. baltz further criticizes wikipedia claiming only 20 percent of political scientists with articles are women when 30 percent of political scientists are reportedly women. he raises a similar issue with nearly half of articles on political scientists being americans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "like most of the series' characters, junior is an archetype — the bitterly insecure old man staring death in the face; the miserable prick all too aware that the only thing that awaits him is sickness and death. he has no family to comfort him, no faith to guide him, so all he can do is rage and complain and spread his misery.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the story began almost two years ago when mcadams publicly defended a student who was told by a teaching assistant that his catholic views on man-woman marriage were homophobic and not welcome in her ethics class. for his defense of the student, mcadams was investigated for 17 months by a faculty committee and publicly excoriated by lovell in his official capacity as marquette president. lovell summarily suspended mcadams and banished him from the campus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a report from the investigating faculty committee was just released and recommended mcadams be suspended without pay through the fall 2016 semester. but lovell has gone beyond what the faculty committee recommended and has demanded that mcadams apologize and take responsibility for subsequent email attacks on the teaching assistant. lovell gave mcadams ten days to do this or face the revocation of his tenure and termination of his 39-year employment with marquette.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "mcadams believes that lovell is particularly incensed that the faculty committee did not follow his recommendation that mcadams be fired but rather recommended only suspension and that the committee did not recommend that mcadams confess his crimes as a condition of reinstatement, something mcadams refers to as compelled speech and compared earlier to the inquisition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i am to be suspended even though the committee conceded there is not rule against criticizing how others conduct their classes, no rule against criticizing students, no rule against identifying students of linking to their own blogs, and the post i wrote was not vituperative or rude. if that can cause a tenured professor of thirty-nine years to be suspended or fired, it is hard to imagine how any faculty member could know when he or she is free to speak.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "under the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act passed by congress in 1996, unlawfully present aliens are ineligible for state or local public benefits. the only exception to this federal law is when a state affirmatively provides for such eligibility to illegal aliens, which states may do only through the enactment of a state law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the california state legislature passed statutes granting such tuition benefits to california state university students and california community college students, but it was forbidden to do so for university of california students. under the california constitution, the uc board of regents is entirely independent of the state legislature in policy matters, so there is no lawful way for the california legislature to allow or require the university of california to provide public benefits to illegal aliens.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in march 2015, the superior court ruled that the uc board of regents policies themselves (and not the state statutes) are the state laws that affirmatively provide the benefits to uc students in satisfaction of federal law and dismissed the lawsuit. in november 2015, judicial watch filed its opening appellate brief with the california court of appeal, second appellate district, arguing that the trial court wrongly read extra words into congress' statute. specifically, the brief argues that the federal statute in question does not say 'state law or administrative rule, regulation or policy.' it says 'state law.' this means an enactment of the state legislature.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "yet socialism has somehow entered the mainstream of political debate. suddenly, almost out of nowhere, we have these strange socialist characters — alexandria ocasio-cortez, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, bernie sanders — and a whole political party that seems magnetically drawn toward the socialist camp. this development by itself is surpassingly strange, because socialism is arguably the most discredited idea since slavery.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "slavery lasted for centuries — even millennia — before it was recognized as a thoroughly wicked and tyrannical regime of human exploitation. socialism, which dates back to 1917, when lenin founded the world's first socialist state, has had a much shorter shelf life. it, too, collapsed across the world because it was understood by the people who lived under it to be a form of slavery.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we see the connection between socialism and slavery in all the important works on socialism. friedrich hayek's critique of socialism is appropriately titled the road to serfdom. george orwell depicted the tyrannical dimension of socialism in his two immortal novels animal farm and 1984. using both the techniques of fiction and nonfiction, alexander solzhenitsyn in a series of works — the gulag archipelago, one day in the life of ivan denisovich — depicted soviet socialism as a vast network of slave camps stretching from europe to the farthest reaches of asia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "slavery in its classic form has been abolished worldwide, although enslavement in other forms — sex trafficking for instance—continues as a gruesome relic of this barbaric practice. even so, no serious person today could advocate the return of slavery! how ridiculous it would be to hear someone say, the failures of slavery were all failures of implementation. this time we're really gonna make it work!", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet here we have socialism in america attempting a comeback, and on precisely those terms: this time we're gonna get it right. serious people advocate it; there is a sustained cultural push to apotheosize it; a major political party is pushing aggressively toward it. how is this possible? apparently socialism means never having to say you're sorry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "socialism has proved to be a living hell pretty much everywhere it has been tried. it has been tried pretty much all over the world. let's not forget that within about a century since marx wrote, and less than half a century since the bolshevik revolution, some 60 percent of the world's people were living under governments that embraced some form of socialism. at once time, josh muravchik writes, it was the most popular political idea ever invented, arguably the most popular idea of any kind about how life should be lived or society organized.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the biggest socialist experiment was the soviet bloc, an orbit of countries including the soviet union, poland, yugoslavia, albania, czechoslovakia, hungary, romania and east germany. prior to the soviet occupation of its eastern region, germany tried its own distinct version of socialism, national socialism or nazism for short, for 12 years, from 1933 to 1945. in asia, vietnam, laos, cambodia, north korea and china experimented with socialism. in south america, cuba, nicaragua, bolivia and venezuela tried it. most of africa went socialist in the aftermath of colonialism: angola, ghana, tanzania, benin, mali, mozambique, zambia and zimbabwe. i count here 25 experiments in socialism, all ending in unmitigated disaster.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the worst forms of socialism proved not only totalitarian, but also murderous to an unprecedented degree. in the soviet union alone, socialist regimes killed some 20 million of their own citizens and enslaved tens of millions of others. the chinese socialists, in the period known as mao's cultural revolution, killed another 20-25 million. the nazis murdered in comparable numbers, including jews and gypsies and other occupied peoples, poles, russians, eastern europeans and others. orwell's description from 1984 seems appropriate here: a boot stamping on a human face.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "socialists today disavow this historical record, insisting that these were authoritarian forms of socialism that they have no intention of copying. while socialism may have been the economic program of communism and early fascism, modern socialists seek to dispense with the tyranny and merely keep the economic program. yet it's worth stressing that socialism wasn't merely a political failure; it was also an economic failure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "orwell somehow missed this. interestingly, neither of his two novels offers an economic critique of socialism. there is no economic problem in animal farm; the only problem is that the pigs seize power. in 1984, the ruling party creates poverty and scarcity to keep people in line. great as he is, orwell confines himself to a political critique; he exposes the totalitarian tendency of socialism. but he never shows how socialism creates this totalitarianism, and he leaves open the possibility of a more benign socialism that avoids it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet in the real world, the political collapse of socialism was brought about by its economic failure. this was certainly true in the soviet union, where gorbachev's rescue efforts — glasnost and perestroika — failed spectacularly, first bringing down the soviet empire, then the communist ruling party, and finally the socialist system itself. china, too, abandoned socialism for its economic shortcomings. and look how poorly socialism is faring in zimbabwe, cuba and venezuela today. so how can one adopt socialist ideas once again without considering the economic track record of socialist regimes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rarely in history is there is a chance to actually compare social systems to see which one works better. one might compare the plantagenet kings of england with the tang dynasty in china, but even if we line up the dates we are talking about two completely different societies: different people, different culture. consequently, england's superiority and china's inferiority — or the other way round — can hardly be attributed to their rival systems of government, since so many other factors could be involved.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the case of socialism, however, we have two perfect test cases: north and south korea, and east and west germany. the perfection of these examples comes from the fact that we are dealing with the same people, same background, same culture, merely two rival economic systems. north korea is socialist; south korea capitalist. east germany was socialist; west germany capitalist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when the results came in, they were decisive. at reunification the per capita gross domestic product in socialist east germany was just about one third of the capitalist west german level, with other measures of economic performance displaying a similar chasm. even the poorest part of west germany, schleswig-holstein, was two and a half times as wealthy as the richest east german region, saxony. to this day, the eastern part of germany gets nearly 15 percent of its gross domestic product in net transfers from the western part of germany.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the korean example is even more telling, in part because the separation of the two societies has lasted longer and continues to this day. south korea now is more than 20 times richer than north korea, a difference manifested in virtually all indicators of human welfare. south koreans are obviously freer than north koreans but they also seem happier than north koreans; have you ever seen a north korean smile? south koreans are also taller, healthier and live about 12 years longer than north koreans. every year many thousands of north koreans risk their lives seeking to escape to south korea.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "how did the change come about? it came about through economic liberalization, otherwise known as free market capitalism. and how did india decide to move in that direction? it was not inspired by the indians reading adam smith. rather, indians looked across the chinese border and saw that millions of once-impoverished peasants now lived in clean homes and nice apartments. the chinese now shopped in well-stocked grocery stores. they drove new cars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there was no question how the chinese did it. the people's republic of china was founded in 1949. under mao, factories were nationalized and the land of the peasants was expropriated. mao targeted traders and businessmen — the bourgeoisie — attempting in his own words to destroy the property owning class by killing at least one landlord in every village via public execution. mao's great leap forward, announced in 1958, accelerated the collectivization of farms; in fact, all private farming was banned. the result was the greatest man-made famine in history.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then, in 1966, mao launched his cultural revolution, an attempt to erase all remaining capitalist and traditional elements from chinese society. the communist red guard enforced a purge of all dissidents. mao issued his famous book of quotations, the little red book, that became a central part of the curriculum of every school. chinese citizens were expected to have a copy of mao's writings with them at all times. even so, maoist socialism represented a disastrous alloy of deprivation, starvation and tyranny.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the change came in the late 1970s, when the chinese, under deng xiaopping, abandoned the socialism of mao for its own brand of capitalism. in doing so the chinese inaugurated a new experiment in social organization. call it totalitarian capitalism. the chinese did not relinquish their communist dictatorship; rather, they married dictatorial political control to free market liberalization. some say it was an awkward marriage, yet in economic terms, it worked.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the indians decided to follow in the economic path the chinese had marked out. large parts of the indian economy are still government regulated, but the trend for three decades now has been away from that, toward privatization, deregulation, economic liberalization. and india too has seen spectacular results. technological capitalism has realized gandhi's dream of wiping millions of indian tears. as for indian socialism, the leftist writer pankaj mishra frets that it shows no signs of revival.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if socialism has produced a worldwide record of misery and tears, and if countries must flee socialism to experience prosperity, what then are american socialists up to? why would they want to import misery and tears? they insist they are not doing this. in a sense, they disavow history, both the political and the economic legacy of all professed socialist regimes. they insist that everyone else got it wrong. they emphasize that at least some of those depressing examples, maybe all of them, were not real socialism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how coherent is this idea of real socialism? if an economic idea fails once or twice or even three times, one can still insist it was a fine idea that was merely implemented poorly. but if an idea fails 25 times, all over the world, everywhere it has been tried, without even one counterexample of a socialist regime that works well, it strains credulity to insist that there is still some undiscovered form of socialism, heretofore unattempted, that will finally prove its viability. yet another go at socialism now feels like elizabeth taylor's eighth marriage, a triumph of hope over experience.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so why doesn't the failed track record of socialist regimes deter the socialists of today? what keeps socialism alive for them? the answer is: the socialist dream! yes, there is a socialist dream just as there is an american dream. and evidently the socialist dream is one that survives all empirical refutation. no purely empirical argument—and no set of economic arguments—is sufficient to send socialism to its grave.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is why conservative and libertarian critiques of socialism have gotten nowhere. the conservatives and libertarians keep chanting, socialism doesn't work, and they produce charts and tables to prove it. the socialists glance over the charts and tables and then they clamor for more socialism. they don't care about data because no amount of data can refute a dream. the socialist mantra is, we don't care if it hasn't worked. we will figure out a way to make it work. the critics are focused on yesterday, while the socialists are all about tomorrow. owen jones expresses this futuristic hope, a socialist society…doesn't exist yet, but one day it must.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so it is with the socialists. they are on a grand quest, and they refuse to look back. the insist that they are the champions of a moral ideal. the only way to refute them is to refute their moral ideal, to expose their dream as a nightmare, to capsize their utopia. normally people try to defeat utopia by showing it is a fantasy. but this is inadequate, because a fantasy continues to hold its appeal even when it is exposed as a fantasy. so we have to expose the socialist utopia not as an illusion but rather as a racket.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the trump angle seemed possibly pertinent, because he and the post had long been at odds over the post's caustic coverage of him. and the saudi angle seemed relevant because the year before, in 2018, jamal khashoggi, a saudi-born columnist for bezos's post—or, as wiseguys call it, the bezos post—was apparently murdered inside the saudi consulate in istanbul, turkey.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "then, the following month, march 2019, de becker—the man whom bezos had hired as his security consultant—himself published a piece, boldly bannered, bezos investigation finds the saudis obtained his private data. de becker acknowledged that michael sanchez had gotten hold of bezos's saucy cell-phone stuff, but in addition, de becker declared, our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the saudis had access to bezos' phone, and gained private information.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so there we had it, from both bezos and de becker: yes, michael sanchez was a lowlife—in the wake of the leak, he and his sister were estranged, wrote de becker—but the saudis, too, were lowlifes, if not worse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in other words, in the bezos/de becker telling, the whole messy saga was more than just what it seemed to be at first—that is, a sorry tale of infidelity, indiscretion, and perhaps intra-family treachery. instead, maybe it was more of a spy-thriller epic: an international conspiracy, reaching from the saudi capital of riyadh, to the enquirer's offices in manhattan, to the president in the white house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "virgil wrote on april 5, 2019, and again on april 20 that bezos's escalated allegations were, indeed, sensational and astounding—if that is, they were true. still thinking of bezos's resemblance to bond-villain blofeld, virgil added that the story could well be remembered as some fantastic tale, like something that ian fleming might have written for his character james bond.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet once again, to say that the allegations are sensational and astounding is not the same thing as saying that they are true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so there the matter sat, for nearly a year. the post has continued to pursue the khashoggi story, peppering the trump administration with criticism of its still warm relationship with saudi arabia. indeed, the post worked with other journalistic and activist groups to further chorus the criticism of the saudi government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then as we have seen, this january 21 came a new eruption—that guardian story, citing a technical report, damning the saudis, from a firm called fti consulting, which had been retained by bezos. that guardian piece was followed by a flood of other stories in the main stream media, all of which echoed, at least at first, the basic bezos/de becker storyline, namely that michael sanchez notwithstanding, the saudis are the real nogoodniks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in fact, even the united nations office of the high commissioner for human rights weighed in, deploring the situation and demanding an investigation of saudi arabia's supposed hack. (yes, the hacking case might seem to be more of a technical issue than a human rights issue—and the u.n. might not seem credible for its expertise on human rights, either—but that's a topic for another time.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the post, of course, covered the resurgent saudi story heavily, and on january 23, the newspaper put its weight behind a ponderous editorial, which sought to weave together many strands of suspicion, including not only of trump and the saudis, but also of white house aide jared kushner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet then came the next turn of the news cycle, as the quality of fti's technical forensics came under challenge. on january 24, the wall street journal published an article headlined, bezos hack report puzzles cyber experts. in the journal's careful—and no doubt well-lawyered—language, the fti tech report relied heavily on circumstantial evidence to make the case that a whatsapp account associated with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman was probably used to hack into the iphone of mr. bezos. the story quoted experts who relayed, the audit left several major technical questions about the incident unexplained and in need of more examination.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, the israeli newspaper haaretz went even further, headlining its piece, the question isn't whether nso hacked jeff bezos' phone—but whether it was even hacked at all. the article quoted one expert as saying, there is zero information and 100 percent conjectures. we don't know if there was even an infection, we simply suspect it. there is zero information that allows us to determine if it is nso, nsa [u.s. national security agency] or the paranoia and fears of jeff bezos.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so now the narrative tide turned, as still more tech experts challenged the fti findings. thus that january 21 guardian story, the one that kicked off this renewed flurry, started to look a little, uh, questionable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then, as a kind of capper, later in the day, on january 24, came that latest journal article, the one we saw earlier, the one that reported, federal prosecutors in manhattan have evidence indicating jeff bezos' girlfriend provided text messages to her brother that he then sold to the national enquirer for its article about the amazon.com inc. founder's affair, according to people familiar with the matter.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in response, what say the parties in question? as the journal put it, ms. sanchez didn't respond to requests for comment. an attorney for mr. bezos declined to comment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "amidst these no comments, we might surmise this much: if it's the case that lauren sanchez simply gave, or otherwise transferred, the naughty bezos items to her brother michael—and prosecutors seem to have evidence that it was just a simple hand-off— then it's harder to believe that the saudis, or that israeli company, or any other larger force, were also involved.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "indeed, if we apply the timeless wisdom of ockham's razor (if everything else is equal, then choose the simpler explanation), we are left with an uncomplicated case of pillow talking—make that pillow-texting—gone wild.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we can also add that on january 28, bezos's newspaper, the washington post, dipped a careful toe into this murky pool; its reporter, perhaps mindful of her career, was careful to print both sides of the story: three people close to ami [owner of the enquirer], she wrote, say that lauren sanchez's brother michael sanchez—a talent manager in hollywood who had previously placed stories in ami publications—is the only source for their report on the bezos affair.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "okay, so that's not so good for team bezos, the idea that the saudis had nothing to do with the hack. then the post added, covering itself, at least a little, with the big boss, but the bezos investigation, as echoed by the u.n. report, asserts that it has evidence of a saudi hack of his phone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we might also add that on january 31, the guardian–which seems to be bezos's go-to journalistic outlet–reported that in 2019, the fbi interviewed bezos about his allegations of a hack, as part of, the newspaper said, a larger investigation of that israeli company, nso. so while it's possible that team bezos is just blowing more smoke, it's also possible that there's some fire there, somewhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the meantime, the daily beast reports that also on january 31, michael sanchez filed suit against bezos alleging defamation. and on february 3, jeff bezos counter-sued, formally accusing michael sanchez of extortion. that's a heavy legal concept, extortion. interestingly, the saudis don't seem to be accused of being involved here. the absence of the saudis, we can observe, supports the idea that the elaborate scenario of saudi involvement, was just a red herring–a diversion–thrown on the trail by team bezos, as a way of shifting attention from a simpler scenario of a family feud.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as the new york post reported on february 6, michael sanchez's lawsuit against bezos suggests that he had been conspiring with his sister lauren–who is now, he suggests, engaged to bezos–back in 2018 to leak the news of the romance. and so the idea that he leaked the story to the enquirer is all just a big misunderstanding.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so at least for now, maybe we're back to square one on this story—which is to say, the basic facts as they could be known back in january 2019. that is, bezos did things he shouldn't have done; his actions were harmful to his personal dignity and professional reputation. moreover, his deeds cost him his marriage and that $35-billion divorce settlement. and yes, perhaps amazon's suitability for sensitive government contracts–especially contracts involving the cia and similar institutions—might need to be examined.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as for whatever might have been done by, or happened to, lauren and michael sanchez, well, there are probably laws about that. and yet the violations, while perhaps egregious, are still in the larger scheme of things small potatoes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet at the same time, there's a more serious possibility at play here. much more serious. big potatoes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that is, it's possible that bezos knew, or should have known, that he was just in the midst of a stinky situation, and yet as part of a sort of cover-up, he chose to escalate his accusations, as a way of, in effect, changing the subject away from himself as an adulterer, and toward others alleged to be aggressors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by this possible reckoning, bezos raised serious allegations about the saudi government, that israeli company nso, the national enquirer, and the trump administration. and maybe possibly, in so raising those allegations, bezos legally defamed someone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "moreover, it also seems obvious that bezos stirred up an international hornet's nest. using the big megaphone afforded to him by his enormous fortune and clout, bezos has potentially jeopardized american security relationships in the middle east, as well as perhaps undermined american foreign policy overall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in fact, given what we know of bezos's behavior, and misbehavior, virgil thinks it's a fair question to ask: whether or not any entity connected to bezos should be entrusted with state secrets. that question would, in fact, be a good one for congress to take up in oversight hearings. in particular, perhaps we should examine why amazon web services, bezos's cloud-computing company, is allowed to be a major player in the cloud-computing space, including for american national security agencies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so yes, let's investigate all this. let's find out if this was just a sordid affair that got amplified globally, because bezos wanted to drown out the noise of his own misbehaving. let's find out if bezos is a victim of global heavyweights—or just of his own hot-bloodedness.", "augmented": []}
