{"original": "Many of Brazil's youth are turning towards conservatism amid multiple corruption scandals and economic decline under leftist rule, a BBC report detailed on Monday.\\n\\nThe report was published before a pivotal Supreme Court decision all but eliminated the socialist candidate for the presidency Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from the campaign for the October election. The court affirmed that Lula could be arrested after being twice convicted of corruption and money laundering.\\n\\nThe BBC highlights the case of the high-profile feminist activist Sara Winter, who used to protest by chaining herself to fences over what she perceived to be Brazil's misogynistic culture and high levels of sexual violence.\\n\\nSix years after having an abortion, Winter went through a political transformation in which she refound the Catholic Church and gained new perspectives on the sanctity of life.\\n\\nI was so happy because I felt that God was giving me a second chance to be a mum, she told the outlet. I decided to come back to the Church and I think I can help women much more with conservative politics than feminism.\\n\\n[I spent] five years being the most popular feminist in Brazil and I did nothing for women, she continued. I just spent this time talking about abortion and legalizing drugs and communism and I called that empowering myself.\\n\\nWinter is now one of many people supporting the right-wing populist candidate Jair Bolsonaro in the country's upcoming presidential elections.\\n\\nAmong many positions, Bolsonaro has proposed reversing the country's ruling on same-sex marriage, banning abortion, reintroducing the death penalty, loosening gun laws, and chemically castrating those convicted of rape. Bolsonaro has also proposed an increased military presence on Brazil's streets in response to soaring crime, although this has also created fear of nostalgia towards the country's former military dictatorship.\\n\\nHe has courted controversy, being branded as homophobic and racist by some in the media, for several outspoken declarations, including claims his children would not date a black woman because they were brought up in an educated environment. He also told a fellow congresswoman that he would never rape her because she isn't worth it.\\n\\nI know it sounds really awkward, but really, if any woman could see Bolsonaro's policies, she would be in love, like me, said Winter.\\n\\nBolsonaro currently sits second in the polls at 12.3 percent, behind former socialist ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who will now have to serve 12-year prison sentence for his involvement in a government-wide corruption scheme known as Operation Car Wash.\\n\\nLula's successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached in 2016 for allegedly manipulating government budgets to fraudulently attract foreign investors. Rousseff presided over a major economic crisis that saw millions of people take to the streets in protest.\\n\\nBolsonaro has branded himself the Brazilian Trump and, among other similarities, has a large and active social media following. He has 5.2 followers on his Facebook page, while other groups such as the Free Brazil Movement (MBL) are also attracting massive audiences.\\n\\nTalking to El Mundo in January, 17-year-old Bolsonaro supporter Gabriel, who identifies as gay, denied that his candidate is homophobic, claiming that journalists always exaggerate his words and that he is the only person who will put the country in order.\\n\\nWhat's happening is that us gays can't be complaining about everything, always asking preferential treatment, that is what annoys Bolsonaro and myself included, he said.\\n\\nAnother young activist, identified as 21-year-old Fernando Holiday, has also made inroads into conservative politics. Also gay and from a working-class background, he was recently elected as a city councilor in São Paolo for the right-wing Democrats party, he says young people have long been disengaged in Brazilian politics.\\n\\nThe right became synonymous with more conservative politics, irrelevant for minorities, he told the BBC. It also became associated with authoritarian, even nostalgic feelings about the dictatorship, like Bolsonaro.\\n\\nBut I think we bring a wider vision of what the right is, he continued. Not everything fits into a standard box and is determined by rigid rules.\\n\\nThere exists a feeling among an ever-smaller minority in Brazil that I'm that man who could be a dictator, even though I say that in Brazil there wasn't a dictatorship, Bolsonaro was quoted as saying last year, in reference to the country's troubled military past. Thirty percent of young people are with me, and I tell them to talk to their grandparents about how that period was and how it is today.\\n\\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com."}
{"original": "Eight Iraqi asylum seekers have been handed prison sentences of between nine to 13 years by an Austrian court for the gang rape of a German woman in Vienna on New Year's Eve 2015.\\n\\nEight of the nine Iraqi asylum seekers accused of gang raping an intoxicated German woman in Vienna on New Year's Eve in 2015 have been sentenced. The attackers came to Austria between May and December 2015 through the now closed Balkan migrant route and raped the 28-year-old German victim for two hours, Austrian newspaper Die Presse reports.\\n\\nThe attack occurred in an apartment on Rustenschacherallee street in Vienna's second district, home of the famous Prater Ferris wheel and the Pater amusement park. Four of the asylum seekers are said to have found the woman intoxicated and brought her back to the apartment where the nine men took turns having sex with her as she lay defenceless.\\n\\nThe asylum seekers involved were aged between 22 and 48 years old and are mostly all related by marriage or blood. Only one of them, a 27-year-old, gave a comprehensive confession to the rape and received a 10-year sentence. The youngest member of the group, a 22-year-old, received the lightest sentence at nine years.\\n\\nProsecutor Karina Fehringer said the case was clearly rape of a defenceless woman which Judge Petra Poschalko agreed with finding eight guilty counts of sexual abuse. The judgements are not final as the defendants still have an opportunity to appeal the ruling.\\n\\nProsecutor Fehringer said the ordeal was a nightmare for the victim and that she had been the victim of a two-hour torture. She also noted how only one of the men had actually shown any sort of remorse for their actions.\\n\\nThe asylum seekers claimed in their defence the 28-year-old woman had given them mixed signals which the prosecutor slammed asking if intoxication meant automatic consent to the men. The lawyer for the victim also told the court that as a result of the incident, the woman now has problems with intimacy and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.\\n\\nIf the conviction is not successfully appealed, the migrants could face possible deportation, though it is not guaranteed. A migrant who raped an elderly woman last year in Austria was not deported despite being convicted of his crime.\\n\\nThe case is also not the first time a woman in Vienna has been the target of rape by multiple asylum seekers. Shortly before the first round of the Austrian presidential election last year, a woman was attacked and raped in a bathroom near the Prater park – the same district as the New Year's Eve attack.\\n\\nFollow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart.com"}
{"original": "The nation's shift to the left under President Joe Biden is coming at breakneck speed and the impact of his far-left policies is not limited to the executive branch or even the breadth of federal agencies. Biden's impact could also spread across the nation's federal courts.\\n\\nThe 24 judges so far who are claiming senior status, whereby they may step away from the bench to allow for a replacement while still collecting their salary and work a reduced case load, include three U.S. District Court judges in the California Bay Area: Phyllis Hamilton, the district's chief judge, and William Alsup – both Clinton appointees – and Jeffrey White, appointed by Republican President George W. Bush.\\n\\nIncluding judges who had already taken senior status or retired before the 2020 election, more than 70 vacancies await Biden, the majority on the trial level district courts.\\n\\nIn 2017 when Donald Trump was replaced Barack Obama in the White House, 16 of the 25 federal judges taking senior status were Republican appointees. In 2009, after Obama succeeded Bush, 14 of the 26 who took senior status had been appointed by Democrat presidents.\\n\\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported on the developing story, which included one judge who claimed his decision had nothing to do with partisan politics. Reporter Bob Egelko wrote:\\n\\nBut it seems like no coincidence that, out of 24 federal judges who have taken senior status or announced intentions to do so since election day, 17 were appointed by Democratic presidents. Most of them were eligible for senior status during Donald Trump's presidency but chose to wait.\\n\\nThe Chronicle profiled some of these judges:\\n\\nDan Polster has been a federal judge in Ohio since 1998, when his nomination by President Bill Clinton was confirmed by the Senate. He is presiding over more than 2,700 lawsuits by local governments and Indian tribes who accuse pharmaceutical companies of contributing to drug abuse in their distribution of opioid painkillers. He has drawn praise from both of Ohio's senators, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown. Now Polster, 69, is one of more than two dozen federal judges who are taking senior status, allowing them to reduce their caseloads while creating vacancies for President Biden to fill. Those who have spoken publicly have denied any partisan motives — understandably, since they remain on the bench — but Polster alluded to the need for the judiciary to show strength in a time of turmoil.\\n\\nI've always been proud to be a judge, but never more than in the past year, when our branch stood up big time — it doesn't matter who appointed you, Democrat or Republican — under some real stresses to our democracy, Polser said.\\n\\nAs one unidentified Ninth Circuit judge told the Los Angeles Times after the November election, Clinton judges across the country have just been holding on for a Democratic president who could appoint their successor.\\n\\nCarlos Lucero, a 1995 Clinton appointee to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, and author of a ruling striking down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage in 2014, a year before the Supreme Court issued a similar ruling nationwide, is also on the list.\\n\\nIt seemed like the right time to take senior status, Lucero, who has been eligible since 2008, said in an email.\\n\\nSome news from the senior judges did seem connected to Biden winning the election:\\n\\nCongratulations on becoming our new president, Alsup, who lives in San Francisco, said in a letter dated Jan. 21.\\n\\nI feel it is time now for me to 'go senior,' said Alsup, 75, a Clinton appointee in 1999 who had been eligible for senior status since 2013.\\n\\nAlsup has written some noteworthy rulings, including one in 2018 that prevented Trump from abolishing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program created by Obama that allowed young undocumented immigrants to work legally in the United States, the Chronicle reported.\\n\\nJudge White, however, said his decision is about family, not politics.\\n\\nI've been working full tilt for a number of decades, White, 75, said in an interview. I feel like the time has come where I can cut back a little bit, enjoy life with my family.\\n\\nI can't speak for others, White said, adding he would continue to work. There's no political implication to what I did.\\n\\nBut one expert sees a definite election connection.\\n\\nIn this particular election, there were more (judges) who were waiting to see how it turned out than I've ever seen in 40 years, because things have been so polarized, Jeremy Fogel, a former federal judge in San Francisco and currently executive director of the Berkeley Judicial Institute at UC Berkeley Law School, said.\\n\\nTrump appointed 54 appeals court judges in four years, one less than Obama's eight-year total, including 10 to the traditionally liberal Ninth Circuit.\\n\\nTrump's selections have also swung majorities in three other circuits, the Second in New York, the Third in Philadelphia, and the 11th in Atlanta, from Democratic to Republican appointees, the Chronicle reported. Those changes might be reversed if some veteran judges took senior status and remained on the court alongside Biden appointees confirmed by the Democratic-controlled Senate.\\n\\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com"}
{"original": "The Chinese Foreign Ministry and government-run newspapers in the country launched a campaign Thursday to discredit women who have testified to being raped and tortured in Communist Party-run concentration camps, referring to them as criminals and actors.\\n\\nBeijing has repeatedly attempted to smear survivors of its elaborate concentration camp system in far-west Xinjiang province as actors who have made a living somehow out of accusing China of human rights atrocities, providing no evidence for those claims. The Communist Party has also spent years attempting to discredit Dr. Adrian Zenz, one of the top researchers working on compiling evidence of genocide against the Uyghur people and other majority-Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.\\n\\nThe latest attacks on those accusing China followed a harrowing BBC exposé in which survivors of the concentration camp system said they were regularly subject to gang rape and tortured by being raped with electric batons, among other atrocities. Some of those sharing their experiences with the BBC included guards and prisoners forced to help the guards by disrobing and tying women up in torture chambers prior to their gang rape. Nearly all of those testifying said that a common characteristic of the concentration camps was that everyone inside could hear the screams of agony of those being tortured while they awaited their turn.\\n\\nPrior to the publication of the BBC story on Wednesday, concentration camp survivors, including some who also spoke to the BBC, had accused China of using the concentration camps to enslave Uyghurs, force them into communist indoctrination to erase their culture and religion, forcibly sterilize women, and kill their infant children.\\n\\nThe Chinese government has repeatedly denied all charges. Beijing has confirmed the existence of the concentration camps, but refers to them as vocational training centers where poor minority people learn job skills. The Chinese government has also boasted of liberating Uyghur women from being baby-making machines by forcibly sterilizing them.\\n\\nOn Friday, the Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, published a graph with the names of some of those speaking to the BBC on the record, referring to them as actors playing victims from Xinjiang who frequently appear in Western media.\\n\\nThese victims of 'camps' in BBC reports cannot offer evidence for their claims. The Western media has a notorious record on factual accuracy in its reporting — for example, making traffic jams a sign of 'oppression,' The Global Times claimed, without elaborating on what the traffic jams comment was a reference to.\\n\\nThe newspaper accused the World Uyghur Congress, a human rights advocacy group dedicated to awareness of China's genocidal policies against the Uyghur people, of recruiting actors in an attempt to overthrow the Chinese government.\\n\\nThe separatist organizations usually choose females, as women and their tears would touch readers and arouse sympathy, the propaganda outlet claimed. It accused the World Uyghur Congress of being generally believed to seek the fall of China.\\n\\nThe article then went on to name several of the women in the BBC report and claim that Chinese documentation did not show that those who claimed to be forcibly sterilized endured such an attack. It went on to claim that the BBC provided almost no information to prove the authenticity of the testimonies. Contrary to that claim, the BBC did indicate that some of its witnesses had documents, including travel documents, that indicated that those testifying were in the places they claimed to be when they experienced what they denounced. The anonymous concentration camp guard who spoke to the BBC, for example, provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp, according to the report.\\n\\nThe Global Times concluded by quoting alleged netizens, anonymous users of Chinese government-controlled social media, insulting the report.\\n\\nA netizen called 'Phil C' mocked the BBC and wrote that 'BBC must be pretty poor & budget tight 4 NOT able to afford more expensive 'supermodel' to go into this fake dazzling headline!! [sic], the Global Times relayed. 'Damn! This face photo has been used multiple times practically for ALL functions.., battered wife, farmer, war victim, janitor, beggar, & now…'\\n\\nSimilar to the Global Times' attempts to defend the Chinese concentration camps, the Foreign Ministry insisted Thursday that the Communist Party — responsible for the deaths of 45 million people during the Great Leap Forward alone — had a long history of respecting human rights. Spokesman Wang Wenbin urged reporters to watch a Chinese propaganda showcase called Xinjiang Is a Wonderful Land that allegedly discredited the BBC report.\\n\\nAfter the founding of the PRC [People's Republic of China], we have achieved unprecedented progress in women's liberation and development, Wang alleged. Women of all ethnic groups enjoy political rights, rights relating to culture and education, rights of labor and social security, rights relating to property, right of person, and rights relating to marriage and family.\\n\\nWang also named several of those in the BBC story and claimed they were actors. Of one woman, Zumrat Dawut, he claimed that she was not forcibly sterilized by allegedly signed a consent form for a tubal ligation.\\n\\nThis woman has become an actor and a tool for anti-China forces' attacks on and hyping up of Xinjiang, Wang said.\\n\\nThe Chinese government has previously accused concentration camps victims of murder and rape, claiming their complaints were not false because they were actors, but because they were fugitives. Beijing has provided no evidence for those claims.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

The most important statement from his Super Tuesday speech came when Biden called for unity with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in order to defeat Donald Trump.\\n\\nAmericans taking stock of the Democratic race are not unfamiliar with apparent differences between Biden and Sanders. The primary race is not over, but Democrats are coalescing around Biden as their most electable candidate and with the common goal of landing a Democrat in the White House.\\n\\nBiden and Sanders have far more in common on abortion, religious liberty, gun rights, health care, immigration, economic policy, and education than what the media has portrayed. Biden, the so-called moderate, and Sanders, the democratic socialist, are really two sides of the same Democratic coin.\\n\\nSo far, the media continues to provide cover for Biden's candidacy by painting him as a centrist Democrat and by ignoring his many campaign gaffes. The fact is that many of Biden's positions are just as damaging and harmful to the Constitution and American freedom as Sanders's would be.\\n\\nSimply put, a Biden presidency would be a major setback and defeat for Americans who want to protect the unborn, defend religious liberty, maintain a robust economy, recognize the right to bear arms, and promote American peace through strength at home and abroad.\\n\\nBiden would reverse the Hyde amendment, which has been law since 1976, which prohibits taxpayer-funded abortion advancing a big government agenda of abortion-on-demand with devastating consequences on children in the womb.\\n\\nIn addition, the former five president declared that he would put former Texas congressman and presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, a staunch advocate of gun control, in charge of gun policy. Biden later argued with a factory worker in Detroit, Michigan, who was defending the Second Amendment. The video of their exchange went viral.\\n\\nBiden has promised to sign the deceptively-named Equality Act, which would enable big government to interfere with private businesses, non-profits, private colleges, and churches that continue to affirm and uphold traditional views on marriage and sexuality.

They may also end the filibuster for ordinary legislation, ensuring that destructive regulation would prevail without any bipartisan consensus.\\n\\nDemocrats like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-Ny), and Biden, who represent the old-guard establishment wing of the Democratic Party want the same big-government policies that Sanders does, just without the socialist label.\\n\\nIt is apparent to anyone watching this race closely that they do not represent the values and interests of most Americans. Whether Biden or Sanders, conservatives need to be wary that unfettered, permanent big government control over life and liberty would be certain.\\n\\nRyan Helfenbein is the Vice President of Communications and Public Engagement at Liberty University and Executive Director of the Falkirk Center for Faith & Liberty."}
{"original": "A professor at Flinders University in Australia recently published an academic journal article that highlights the horrors of heterosexuality.\\n\\nHeather Brook of Flinders University in Australia published a paper this week for the academic journal Feminist Theory in which she wrote about the horrors of heterosexuality.\\n\\nThe larger aim of this endeavour is to theorise heterosexuality in more accurate ways, and to seek out understandings of heterosexuality (including its historical relationship with heteronormative marriage) which acknowledge its horrors without foreclosing hope for its future, the paper's summary reads.\\n\\nBrook describes heterosexuality as an issue that needs to be fixed. So far I have suggested that in feminist, gender and sexuality studies, heterosexuality is a problem, and a problem resistant to any easy solution, she wrote.\\n\\nBrook suggests heterosexuality could benefit from queering.\\n\\nI have argued that heterosexuality cannot be easily queered, as if with a theoretical silver bullet, partly because its meaning relies on a dichotomous and aligned contrast between hetero and homo; straight and queer, Brook wrote.\\n\\nIn a section of the paper under the heading, The Trouble with Heterosexuality, Brook argued that heterosexuality is often seen as a singular experience. On the other hand, queer identifies are seen as diverse and fluid. Queer identities are seen as provisional, fluid and contingent, but heterosexuality – or, at least, institutionally buttressed, mainstream heterosexuality – is more often perceived to be steadfastly monolithic, she wrote.\\n\\nBrook's Flinders University profile explains that her research often centers around issues of heterosexuality and gender.\\n\\nShe has many research interests, including gender (in general); heterosexuality and heteronormativity; embodiment (including health and illness); film studies (especially feminist film and media studies), social theory (especially feminist theory), prisons, illicit drug use, education and pedagogy., the site reads."}

Having ended his 13-year professional naval career to become a full time working Royal in 1952, the Duke had served the nation, Empire, and Commonwealth in that capacity non-stop for 65 years.\\n\\nWishing a very happy 99th Birthday to His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh! pic.twitter.com/LGrRPjezkS — The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@KensingtonRoyal) June 10, 2020\\n\\nPrince Philip has only rarely been seen in public since his retirement, and especially rarely since the arrival of coronavirus when he and the Queen isolated in Windsor Castle. The Duke did release a statement in support of medical workers and others in April, when he said: I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic…\\n\\nOn behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues; the staff and volunteers working on food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected.\\n\\nThe new photograph, taken last week, shows the Duke standing straight unsupported with his hands clasped informally behind his back. Britain's long-lived Royals have chalked up a number of records between them — the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen have had the longest Royal marriage in British history, and the Duke is the longest-serving Royal consort ever.

Aged just 18 months old, the infant Philip was carried onto a Royal Navy warship for evacuation loaded in a cot made from an orange box, the official account of his life relates.\\n\\nPhilip later joined the Royal Navy as an officer cadet in 1939 and enjoyed a varied career during the Second World War, serving in several roles including the first lieutenant of a destroyer.

{"original": "Even after Trump won the presidency, Jared Kushner was embarrassed by his father-in-law, according to Vicky Ward's terrific new book, Kushner, Inc.: Greed. Ambition. Corruption. The Extraordinary Story of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump .\\n\\nIn a speech to hundreds of New York bankers and businessmen on Dec. 16, 2016, Jared admitted that Trump was easy to hate from afar. But not to worry, he said, Trump wouldn't be keeping his campaign promises — especially on immigration.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne banker who heard the speech was appalled, shocked by Jared's arrogance in thinking he could control the president.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoke's on him. Turns out Jared was right. He does control Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd what a blessing that's been.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Jared's idea to fire FBI Director James Comey. If Trump hadn't followed that advice, there would have been no independent counsel.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was also Jared and Ivanka's idea to hire Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. (Ivanka was adamant, saying Flynn gets anything he wants.)\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Trump hadn't hired Manafort and Flynn, the independent counsel investigation would have been over in about a week.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven Trump's opponents warned him about the man Javanka said should have anything he wants. Ward reports:\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama gave Trump two pieces of advice: One was that the biggest problem he would face as president was the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. The second was a warning against hiring Flynn: 'He'll cause you nothing but problems.'\\n\\nTrump's supposedly loyal kids give him worse advice than the ex-president whom Trump tormented during his presidency.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven Trump's plethora of Goldman Sachs aides were horrified by Jared's decision to fire the FBI director just as congressional Democrats were gearing up their Russian collusion nonsense.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Goldman Sachs alum Dina Powell got wind of Comey's coming dismissal, she told Jared that firing the Director would be a huge political mistake. A self-assured Jared brushed her off, saying, No, no, this is what should be done. The guy is not on our team.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt least Jared's string of disastrous decisions hasn't harmed his self-confidence. The hits keep coming!\\n\\n\\n\\nJared wanted Chris Christie fired. He was fired. (Jared insists this had absolutely nothing to do with Christie being the U.S. attorney who put Jared's criminal father in prison.) All of Christie's proposed hires were jettisoned along with him. Whoever they were, they couldn't be worse than Trump's actual White House staff.\\n\\n\\n\\nJared brought in Goldman Sachs' Gary Cohn to be Trump's National Economic Council director — which would be like Malia Obama demanding that Obama hire me as his White House economic adviser.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, I've got mixed feelings on Cohn. On one hand, he is credited with blocking Trump's promise to end the carried interest loophole (and many other items on the MAGA agenda).\\n\\n\\n\\nBut on the other, Cohn is all over Ward's book, trashing both Jared and Ivanka, e.g.:\\n\\n\\n\\n— Cohn felt Jared was not looking at the practical challenges, Ward writes. He was more impressed by famous names.\\n\\n\\n\\n— Cohn also sneered that Ivanka thinks she's going to be president of the United States. To her, this is like the Kennedys, the Bushes, and now the Trumps.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump should have read Jared the snake poem before he hired Cohn. (You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.)\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly in the administration, Jared demanded that Trump endorse the widely unpopular establishment Republican, Luther Strange, in the 2017 special Senate race in Alabama to replace Jeff Sessions.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike night follows day, Trump suffered a humiliating defeat. It turned out Alabamians preferred anyone to Strange. First they voted for a nut in the primary, and then for a Democrat in the general.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlways trust Jared.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one but Jared could have turned over Sessions' U.S. Senate seat in the reddest state in the Union to a Democrat. Oddsmakers would have said it was impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut with Jared's sound counsel, Trump did it. He took Sessions out of the Senate, then delivered the seat to a Democrat. Trump is like a guy who breaks up a marriage — and then dumps the wife.\\n\\n\\n\\nJared and Ivanka were also the brain trust behind hiring Anthony Scaramucci.\\n\\n\\n\\nIvanka brought Scaramucci into the White House without telling anyone, Ward says. She went to her father and said, He'd be a great communications director.\\n\\n\\n\\nScaramucci was the White House communications director for a glorious 11 days, before imploding in an obscenity-laced rant to The New Yorker.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to Javanka's personnel decisions on Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Chris Christie, Michael Flynn, Luther Strange, Gary Cohn and Anthony Scaramucci, Javanka wanted John Kelly made chief of staff, believing he would be loyal to them. When that turned out not to be the case, they decided to get rid of Kelly. He was gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey wanted Steve Bannon fired. He was fired.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this rate, it's only a matter of time before Jared gets rid of Trump. No wonder the media like him so much."}

Capehart goes on to say that there is a conservative cabal actively working the levers of power to block their rights.\\n\\nMining material from the LGBT lobby group Freedom for All Americans (FFAA), Capehart says there has been a coordinated attack on LGBT persons under the guise of defense of religious liberty in America, such as Indiana's so-called religious freedom law.\\n\\nThe FFAA created a chart, conveniently reprinted by the Post, blacklisting the Christian leaders most active in opposing same-sex marriage and affirming the rights of Americans to conscientious objection when asked to do something they consider morally wrong.\\n\\nThe essay attacks Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) as one of the hubs of this coordination, as well as the National Christian Foundation (NCF), the Family Research Council (FRC) and Liberty Council, accusing them of aggressively working to chip away at the equal rights of LGBT Americans.\\n\\nThe piece also stoops to an ad hominem attack on Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple last year, citing her religious beliefs that compelled her not to cooperate in sanctioning such a relationship.\\n\\nIn his remarkably prescient 2015 dissent in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito predicted that after the Court's woeful decision proponents of a traditional understanding of marriage would be pilloried despite the Court's assurances that rights to freedom of conscience would be respected.\\n\\nAlito prophesied that Obergefell would be used to hurt Americans who may not share a contemporary view of marriage as a malleable, plastic arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons.\\n\\nIt will be used, he wrote, to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.\\n\\nBy comparing traditional marriage laws to laws that denied equal treatment for African-Americans and women, Alito continued, the majority sets up a vast number of Americans for terrible harassment and abuse.\\n\\nThe implications of this analogy will be exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent, he wrote.\\n\\nPerhaps recognizing how its reasoning may be used, the majority attempts, toward the end of its opinion, to reassure those who oppose same-sex marriage that their rights of conscience will be protected.\\n\\nWe will soon see whether this proves to be true. I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools, he wrote.\\n\\nIf the Washington Post piece is any indication, Alito's forecasted storm is already on the horizon.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "Professor Neil Ferguson is currently the most reviled, scorned and mocked man in Britain.\\n\\nSuch a pity, though, that it's for all the wrong reasons…\\n\\nDo not leave your home unless you absolutely HAVE to… shag a Soros-backed left-wing anti-capitalist climate activist. — Richard Delingpole (@DickDelingpole) May 6, 2020\\n\\nYes, of course, it's hilarious and ironic that the scientist responsible for Britain's lockdown policy should be caught breaking his own rules in such spectacular fashion: enjoying nocturnal visits from his left-wing activist mistress Antonia Staats, taking a break from her £1.9 million South London home where she lives in an open marriage with her SOAS academic husband and children.\\n\\nYes, absolutely, Ferguson has more than earned his new nicknames: Professor Pantsdown; the Bonking Boffin.\\n\\nYes, indeed, it's an outrage of hypocrisy that while sternly preaching one thing – lockdown; extreme social distancing – Ferguson should be practising quite another with his younger, punch-above-his-weight mistress. (She's 38; he's 51).\\n\\nEven so, this is surely akin to Al Capone being done for tax evasion rather than for the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre.\\n\\nBeing an arrogant, sexually incontinent, hypocrite is a fairly venial slip, after all, when compared to destroying the world's fifth-largest economy – and with it the livelihoods, job prospects and prosperity of a nation of 65 million people.\\n\\nNo, obviously, Ferguson cannot be blamed entirely for the massive economic and social damage being inflicted on the UK as a result of his discredited Imperial College study. Equally culpable, clearly, are the government ministers and advisors who decided to use it as justification for Britain's lockdown.\\n\\nBut let's not pretend that Neil Ferguson is an innocent in all this. Few men in recent British history, I would argue, have done more long-term damage to their country. It's about time this was recognised by two important groups: by the politicians who, up till now, have been taking him seriously as their guru; and by the general populace, a significant portion of which has been terrified by his doom-laden prognostications into a hysteria out of all proportion to the nature of the actual threat posed by coronavirus.\\n\\nFerguson, let us not forget, has a long track record of failure\\n\\nThis goes back at least as far as 2001 when his predictive modelling during the Foot and Mouth crisis was used to justify the slaughter of millions of healthy animals and which cost the UK economy at least £10 billion.\\n\\nFerguson's modelling then (and since) has been heavily criticised by experts as not fit for purpose.\\n\\nHis track record, indeed, is so poor that if he'd worked in the private sector he'd now be unemployable.\\n\\nLuckily for Ferguson, he has benefited from being a public-sector employee and from being therefore unsackable.\\n\\nHow else would you explain the fact that in 2020, he is still the government's go-to epidemiological modeller – despite the fact that his models have so consistently got it wrong?\\n\\nFerguson's form, as LockdownSceptics notes, is not impressive:\\n\\nIn 2005, Neil Ferguson told the Guardian that up to 200 million people could die from bird flu. Around 40 million people died in 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, he explained. There are six times more people on the planet now so you could scale it up to around 200 million people probably. The final death toll from avian flu strain A/H5N1 was 440. (That's 440 people, not 440 million.)\\n\\nIn 2002, the same Professor Ferguson predicted that mad cow disease could kill up to 50,000 people. Thankfully, it ended up killing less than 200.\\n\\nHe won't even release the original code used for the Imperial College modelling that predicted 500,000 deaths from coronavirus – and which frightened Boris Johnson into his U-turn on lockdown.\\n\\nIn mid-March this year, when the UK government – and also, to an extent, the Trump administration – were jolted into lockdown by Neil Ferguson's shock report, they did at least have the excuse that Ferguson's projections might be plausible.\\n\\nThat excuse, though, is becoming increasingly threadbare.\\n\\nA bigger issue than Professor Ferguson's private life is the accuracy of his model. When applied to the Swedish policy it forecast 40,000 deaths by now, over 15 times the reality. — David Davis (@DavidDavisMP) May 5, 2020\\n\\nDavid Davis – still one very few Conservative MPs to speak out against government policy – is right.\\n\\nAs Fraser Nelson reports here, there is now real-world evidence to demonstrate that Ferguson's modelled assumptions are wildly inaccurate.\\n\\nAn Uppsala team, feeding Imperial's parameters into its own study, agreed. The modelling envisaged Sweden paying a heavy price for its rejection of lockdown, with 40,000 Covid deaths by 1 May and almost 100,000 by June. The latest figure for Sweden is 2,680 deaths, with daily deaths peaking a fortnight ago. The virus, it turns out, has been spreading at a fraction of the speed suggested. So Imperial College's modelling – the same modelling used to inform the UK response – was wrong, by an order of magnitude.\\n\\nHow much more clear evidence do we need before Boris Johnson's flailing administration accepts what ought to be blindingly obvious?\\n\\nNeil Ferguson's Imperial College model is about as reliable as chicken entrails or tea leaves. Any country that uses it as the basis of national policy is betraying its electorate and riding for a very hard fall.\\n\\nNew cartoon! Neil Ferguffson caught not quite believing what he preaches. #lockdown for us but not for @neil_ferguson pic.twitter.com/6ibRfmWWxw — Josh (@Cartoonsbyjosh) May 6, 2020\\n\\nBut perhaps the sex scandal will finally achieve what remorseless logic, hard evidence and falsified computer projections have failed to do.\\n\\nIt will give the Boris Johnson administration – and other administrations, including Donald Trump's and South Africa's regime – the excuse they need to reconsider the credibility of the man by whose alleged expertise they have set so much store.\\n\\nWould you buy a soiled computer model from Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson?\\n\\nI certainly wouldn't."}
{"original": "A bill that would ban mental health professionals from helping gender-confused children and adolescents feel comfortable with their biological sex is being pushed by radical transgender activists in Massachusetts.\\n\\nTitled An Act Relative to Abusive Practices to Change Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Minors, the bill states:\\n\\nUnder no circumstances shall a licensed professional advertise for or engage in sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts with a patient less than 18 years of age.\\n\\nAndrew Beckwith, the president of Massachusetts Family Institute (MFI), testified Tuesday against the bill, asserting it would remove the ability of children and their parents to receive desired counseling from licensed mental health professions to help address unwanted sexual attractions and gender confusion.\\n\\nBeckwith added the legislation places mental health professionals in precarious ethical dilemmas because they would be forced to choose between violating the law and violating their ethical obligations for client treatment.\\n\\nAs Fox25 in Boston reports, two prior attempts to pass the measure in the Bay State stalled in committee. Similar bills banning so-called conversion or reparative therapy have recently passed in both Connecticut and Rhode Island.\\n\\nState Rep. Kay Khan (D), who introduced the legislation in Massachusetts, says the bill will protect young people.\\n\\nThis practice is harmful to the mental and physical health of minors, she said. We want to make sure they're in a healthy and medically-sound situation that doesn't foster an environment of prejudice and discrimination.\\n\\nTaylor Fogarty, a libertarian lesbian who writes about feminism and politics, however, says bans on reparative therapy are tragic.\\n\\nChildren who are feeling dysphoric in their gender should see a therapist, she told Breitbart News in an interview. I don't think the point of that therapy should be to confirm that delusion. Transgenderism is a dysphoria.\\n\\nFogarty continues:\\n\\nIn any other case in which you see people feeling uncomfortable or horrified or unfamiliar in their own body, it's a form of dysphoria. Children should be able to see a therapist to help them ease this dysphoria. Laws against conversion therapy are setting up children to be miserable and to never get them the help they need because mainstream media is telling them they're trans.\\n\\nAccording to a press release at MFI, a number of therapists and other professionals testified against the bill.\\n\\nH.1190 is in fact child abuse, said David Pickup, a licensed marriage and family therapist and expert on reparative therapy. He said the bill would violate the rights of heterosexual children to receive therapy specifically for unwanted homosexual feelings caused by sexual abuse from pedophiles.\\n\\nDr. Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, submitted a statement in which she warned of other health risks associated with the measure:\\n\\nHB 1190 requires therapists affirm young children with gender dysphoria as transgender which guarantees minors will be permanently sterilized under the guise of treating a condition that would otherwise resolve in up to 95% of them with therapy that either affirms biological sex or promotes watchful waiting. This is criminal.\\n\\nAccording to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty, the College asserts. Conditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.\\n\\nThough supporters of the legislation claim it will decrease the risk of suicide for LGBT youth, MFI points to the case of Walt Heyer, who underwent gender reassignment surgery in the late 1980s.\\n\\nSix years into my life as a woman, I attempted suicide, he said. Thanks to some extensive and effective psychotherapy my transgender feelings dissipated completely. After eight years of living as a woman, I joyfully returned to my male gender over twenty years ago.\\n\\nYouth Trans Critical Professionals — a group of self-described left-leaning, open-minded, and pro-gay rights professionals say it is risky to affirm young people who claim to be transgender and provide them with hormonal and surgical treatments to change their bodies.\\n\\nOur concern is with medical transition for children and youth, say Youth Trans Critical Professionals on their website. We feel that unnecessary surgeries and/or hormonal treatments which have not been proven safe in the long-term represent significant risks for young people.\\n\\nThe professionals express alarm that, because of the current trendiness of being transgendered, many young people have decided they are a member of the opposite sex simply as a result of binges on social media sites. They describe a process of transgender activists recruiting these young people for their cult.\\n\\nThere is evidence that vulnerable young people are being actively recruited and coached on such sites to believe that they are trans, the professionals say.\\n\\nDespite such potential mental health problems associated with gender confusion, children who claim to be the opposite sex are now no longer legally permitted to see a therapist to get stabilizing conversion therapy in some states. Youth Trans Critical Professionals sees such state prohibitions as dangerous since they may block the process of critical thinking and evaluation of the young person regarding the reasons why he or she desires to become a transgender member of the opposite sex.\\n\\nWhile the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans, argue the professionals. This would mean we can't ask why; we can't explore underlying mental health issues; we can't consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can't look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion."}

As one can imagine, it is incredibly difficult to respond to allegations by unnamed and unidentified individuals that involve an extended period of time, particularly in the current environment.\\n\\nThe news report stated a couple of the alleged victims were worried about reporting the incidents for fear of hurting Rosenberg, whose progressive priorities they admire.\\n\\nIn December 2014, the Globe had interviewed Rosenberg over reports that Hefner had mocked outgoing state Senate president Therese Murray, and had boasted to other senators about his influence with Rosenberg on key decisions.\\n\\nRosenberg then told the newspaper he had learned of some of Hefner's behavior by other senators and had admonished his partner.\\n\\nVery clearly, very specifically, he's not involved in making any of the decisions, Rosenberg said. All personnel decisions, all the chairmanships, are going though the normal internal processes."}

{"original": "Former FBI Director James Comey stated it wasn't necessary to inform President Donald Trump that the infamous dossier had been paid by Trump's primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\\n\\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC News' chief anchor George Stephanopoulos ahead of the release of his memoir on Tuesday, Comey described numerous conversation he had with Trump about the contents of the dossier.\\n\\nYet, Comey repeatedly failed to tell Trump that the dossier was produced by the controversial Fusion GPS political opposition research outfit and funded by the DNC and Clinton's campaign.\\n\\nComey first briefed Trump about the dossier claims at a pre-inauguration intelligence briefing at Trump tower. Stephanopoulos asked Comey whether he informed Trump about the dossier's political origins and whether Trump had a right to know.\\n\\nHere is a transcript of that portion of the interview:\\n\\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell him that the Steele Dossier had been financed by his political opponents? JAMES COMEY: No. I didn't– I didn't think I used the term Steele Dossier, I just talked about additional material. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Did he– but did he have a right to know that? JAMES COMEY: That it'd been financed by his political opponents? I don't know the answer to that. I– it wasn't necessary for my goal, which was to alert him that we had this information. Again, I was clear on whether it's true or not, it's important that you know, both because of the counterintelligence reason and so you know that this maybe going to hit the media.\\n\\nEarlier in the interview, Comey admits that he knew about the dossier's questionable funding when he was first told about the document's charges the summer before the election:\\n\\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: A– and at the time, did you know it had been financed at the beginning from President Trump's– by President Trump's political opponents? JAMES COMEY: Yes, I– I was told at some point that it was– the effort had originally been financed by a Republican source to develop– material– opposition research on Donald Trump. Then after the Republican nominating process ended, the effort was taken up and funded by a Democratic aligned group trying to get opposition research on Trump. I never knew which– who the groups were, but I knew it started with Republicans paying for it and then Democrats were paying for it.\\n\\nComey describes numerous other talks with Trump about the dossier contents, including a Jan. 11 phone call; a one-on-one White House dinner on Jan. 27; and two subsequent phone calls from Trump.\\n\\nAt the dinner, Comey pushed back against Trump's suggestion of probing the claim inside the dossier that he had Russian prostitutes perform a golden shower romp in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013. This while Comey was aware – but still kept to himself – that the document was funded by Trump's main political opponents.\\n\\nComey relates in his book that Trump brought up the topic of the dossier: He may want me to investigate it to prove that it didn't happen. And then he says something that distracted me because he said, you know, 'If there's even a 1 percent chance my wife thinks that's true, that's terrible.'\\n\\n'And I remember thinking, 'How could your wife think there's a 1 percent chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow?' I'm a flawed human being, but there is literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true. So, what kind of marriage to what kind of man does your wife think [that] there's only a 99 percent chance you didn't do that?\\n\\nComey quoted Trump ask saying, I may order you to investigate that.\\n\\nComey, however, writes that he urged the president to approach the possibility of an investigation with caution.\\n\\nI said, 'Sir, that's up to you. But you'd want to be careful about that, because it might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally, and second, it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen,' Comey said.\\n\\nComey had still other chances to inform Trump about the highly questionable origins of the dossier.\\n\\nIn March, Comey writes that Trump called him up to complain that the Russia investigation was a cloud impeding his ability to govern, drawing attention again to the golden showers allegation.\\n\\nFor about the fourth time, he argued that the golden showers thing wasn't true, asking yet again, 'Can you imagine me, hookers?'  Comey writes of the call. In an apparent play for my sympathy, he added that he has a beautiful wife and the whole thing has been very painful for her. He asked what we could do to 'lift the cloud.' \\n\\nA Washington Post characterization of Comey's memoir reported:\\n\\nComey recalls telling the president the FBI was investigating it as quickly as possible, and that he had told Congress that Trump was not personally under investigation, to which the president repeatedly told him, We need to get that fact out. Two weeks later, on April 11, Trump called Comey again to check on his request to get out that he is not under investigation, Comey writes. He seemed irritated with me, Comey recalls. I have been very loyal to you, very loyal. We had that thing, you know, Trump told him, according to the book, apparently referring to the loyalty dinner.\\n\\nBesides knowledge of the dossier's financing, a four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority documented that after dossier author Christopher Steele was terminated as an FBI source a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally corroborated.\\n\\nStill, Comey saw fit not only to officially brief Trump on the matter, but also to cite the questionable document inside a FISA court application on October 21, 2016 to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer campaign foreign policy adviser. Comey signed three more FISA applications also citing the dossier.\\n\\nThe GOP memo documents how the FISA applications did not mention the financing from Clinton's campaign or the DNC, and the documents also left out the role of Fusion GPS in producing the dossier.\\n\\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

{"original": "The prominent African Cardinal Robert Sarah said in a recent address in Belgium that by forgetting its Christian roots the West is committing suicide, because a tree without roots is condemned to death.\\n\\nIn his meeting in Brussels in early February, the outspoken prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments had strong words both for the leaders of European nations and for certain cardinals and bishops who distort the Catholic faith.\\n\\nNot only is the West losing its soul, but it is committing suicide, because a tree without roots is condemned to death, Sarah said. I think the West cannot renounce its roots, which have created its culture, its values.\\n\\nThe signs of this suicide are everywhere, the Guinean cardinal declared, and all boil down to a loss of the sense of the dignity of the person as well as a loss of respect for God and his laws.\\n\\nThere are chilling things happening in the West, he said. I think that a parliament that authorizes the death of an innocent, defenseless child commits a serious act of violence against the human person.\\n\\nWhen abortion is imposed, especially in developing countries, saying that if they do not accept it, they will receive any more aid, it is violence, he continued.\\n\\nThis is all to be expected, he said, since the West has also lost its sense of the divine.\\n\\nWhen one has abandoned God, one abandons man, one no longer has a clear vision of man, he said. There is a great anthropological crisis in the West today. And this leads to treating people as objects.\\n\\nThe cardinal said that some Church leaders are also at fault in this suicide of the West, accusing certain high-ranking prelates from opulent nations of perverting Christian doctrine regarding life and marriage.\\n\\nHigh-ranking prelates, especially from opulent nations, are working to bring about changes in Christian morality concerning absolute respect for life from conception to natural death, the problem of the divorced and civilly remarried, and other problematic situations, he said.\\n\\nThe great drift became evident when some prelates or Catholic intellectuals began to give 'a green light for abortion' or 'a green light for euthanasia' I their speeches and writings. Now, from the moment that Catholics abandon the teaching of Jesus and the Magisterium of the Church, they contribute to the destruction of the natural institution of marriage as well as the family and it is now the entire human family that finds itself fractured by this new betrayal on the part of priests, he said.\\n\\nCardinal Sarah has been called the standard bearer for Catholic orthodoxy and was the world's youngest bishop in 1979, when Pope John Paul II summoned him for episcopal ordination at only 34 years of age.\\n\\nHe is now one of the most important cardinals in the Church, and his name often comes up on the short list of papabili—or papal candidates to eventually succeed Pope Francis.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "Pastor Ruben Diaz Sr., a Trump-supporting Democrat on the city council in New York's 18th Congressional District, has raised the concern of progressive party members after tossing his hat in the ring to run for the 15th district's open House of Representatives seat.\\n\\nAccording to feature in Newsweek:\\n\\n[Diaz is] a flamboyant, cowboy hat-wearing New York City councilman who immediately distinguished his views when he announced his run in 2019, saying I am the opposite of AOC in the South Bronx. And that has national Democrats, opponents and progressives like Planned Parenthood and LGBT groups in a panic because the 77-year-old minister has a history of making inflammatory statements about homosexuals and strongly opposes abortion because of his religious beliefs. He would instantly become Donald Trump's favorite New York congressman, strategist Eric Koch of anti-Diaz super PAC Bronx United told Newsweek, adding that Diaz Sr. would be an unreliable Democratic vote in the House caucus.\\n\\nNewsweek also wrote about Diaz's son Ruben Diaz Jr., who is a Bronx borough president, is said to be popular, and has sometimes publicly disagreed with his father, including when dad invited Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to visit the Bronx.\\n\\nBut the consensus is that his son is a political plus for the Reverend, Newsweek reported.\\n\\nThe 15th District borders the district represented by Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2012 Barack Obama got almost 97 percent of the vote there, Newsweek reported.\\n\\nDiaz Sr. is Puerto Rican in his historic Puerto Rican New York neighborhood where evangelicals and seniors make up his political base.\\n\\nJennifer Blatus, a political strategist who interned with Diaz Jr., said in the Newsweek report:\\n\\nHe has always had a great constituent service mechanism. He's really good at connecting with the community, he knows who his base is, he knows how to reach them, his son is wildly popular, they have the same name and half the people that vote for him might think they're voting for Rubencito.\\n\\nBut insiders told Newsweek that Diaz senior is popular, stands out in a field of ten, and would probably win the seat if the election were held today.\\n\\nOne of his opponents calls that possibility a cruel irony.\\n\\nThere's a cruel irony that a Trump Republican could represent the most Democratic district in America, Ritchie Torres said.\\n\\nNewsweek reported:\\n\\nWhile outside groups bristle at Diaz Sr.'s place in the modern Democratic Party, they don't get a vote in the community where he has devoted his time and resources for decades. Diaz, who said he was a victim of anti-black discrimination while in the Army, was addicted to drugs and pleaded guilty to heroin and marijuana possession in 1965 before finding salvation in Jesus Christ, ministering to people who also needed to turn their lives around, and opening senior centers in the Bronx in the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nThe Diaz name has value not just because his son is the borough president, but because it has been a fixture in that community both politically and spiritually, Hank Shienkopf, who is a veteran of New York politics since 1969, Newsweek reported.\\n\\nDiaz Sr. has been at the center of controversy over the years, according to Newsweek, including for saying that the city council was controlled by the homosexual community last year.\\n\\nIt was also apparently a controversy that Diaz Sr. did not endorse Michael Bloomberg or Democrat Fernando Ferrer in the mayoral race in 2005 because their support for abortion and same-sex marriage meant, he said, they have nothing to offer me, according to the Bible.\\n\\nAnd the leftists in his own party are gearing up to attack Diaz Sr. Newsweek reported:\\n\\nA national coalition launched by Victory Fund last week, which backs LGBTQ candidates and supports Torres, included NARAL Pro-Choice America, Latino Victory Fund, Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and Human Rights Campaign to raise the alarm that Diaz Sr. wants to represent a district they argue has politically moved away from him.\\n\\nBut while the coronavirus has hit the district hard, it might help Diaz Sr. win given that lockdowns have made all campaigns virtual.\\n\\nThe district has been devastated by the virus, but also devastated by poverty for the last 25 years, so the question is where were these people when the Diaz's were here? Shienkopf said. Who is standing up to scream about it? Diaz keeps proving he's the one that can yell the loudest, so that gives him some standing.\\n\\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}

A truthful accounting of events has replaced the deceit that allowed me to become America's first legally non-binary person.\\n\\nShupe acknowledged achieving the first non-binary sex designation was a win for the radical LGBTQ lobby. Now, however, he said he has corrected his legal record and LGBT advocates are no longer able to use my historic non-binary court order to advance their toxic agenda.\\n\\nI am and have always been male, he said. That is my biological truth, the only thing capable of grounding me to reality.\\n\\nHe added the non-binary sex designation is fraud and legal fiction based on pseudoscience.\\n\\nI was indoctrinated to believe that I had this thing called a gender identity and that suppressing it was causing my mental health problems, he added. It was all a lie.\\n\\nIn January 2019, Shupe released a public announcement in which he declared he had resumed his biological male sex designation.\\n\\nHe wrote:\\n\\nI believe that gender identity is a fraud perpetrated by psychiatry, the likes of something the United States and other nations hasn't experienced since the lobotomy era. As a result, I have returned to my male birth sex. On January 25, 2019, in the State of Florida, the Marion County Department of Motor Vehicles in Ocala, Florida issued me a male driver's license. Ocala, Florida has been my home since July 2018. In the days ahead, I will be taking further steps to restore my birth sex to male more formally. In my thirty plus year marriage, I am the husband. To my daughter, I am her Father. I no longer identify as a transgender or non-binary person and renounce all ties to transgenderism. I will not be a party to advancing harmful gender ideologies that are ruining lives, causing deaths and contributing to the sterilization and mutilation of gender-confused children. My history-making and landmark sex change to non-binary was a fraud based on the pseudoscience of gender identity. I am and have always been male.

{"original": "What may come as a shock to some of the staunchest liberals in California — who wear their Trump resistance as a badge of honor — is that California was the birthplace of Trumpism, according to Politico writer Scott Lucas.\\n\\nLucas called into Breitbart News Daily Show, hosted by Alex Marlow, on Monday, and for about 14 minutes, one of the most conservative radio hosts and one of the most liberal political journalists had an extremely good conversation—one that was both insightful and respectful.\\n\\n(Something lacking in the current political climate.)\\n\\nMarlow and Lucas attended Berkeley together — where they battled on blogs and in the school paper — and still talk occasionally to this day. Lucas recently penned a piece for Politico entitled, How California Gave us Trumpism—and Marlow asked him how it was received.\\n\\nIn response, Lucas quoted a conservative friend from high school, who was a contestant on The Apprentice and knew Donald Trump a little: Scott, I feel like this piece does a really, really good job of understanding sort of how I see the world, seeing things through my eyes.\\n\\nAnd that sort of sums up Trump's appeal.\\n\\nHe saw the world through the eyes of the tired, the forgotten, the everyman — who'd been left behind.\\n\\nIn California, conservatives are the truest of true believers, whose isolation has made them all the more ardent about their beliefs. According to Lucas, it was that environment that gave birth to Trumpism, described by Lucas as the marriage of 'Constitutional Conservatism' coming out of the Claremont Institute with a sort of 'Entertainment Populism' coming out of Breitbart.\\n\\nWhen asked who were some of the names who sparked what Lucas later in the interview calls an important intellectual moment, more than 80% of the names are likely familiar to Breitbart's audience:\\n\\nSteve Bannon, former Breitbart CEO, now chief strategist to President Trump;\\n\\nStephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner from Santa Monica, now White House policy adviser;\\n\\nMichael Anton, now a high-level National Security Council aide, raised in Northern California;\\n\\nJulia Hahn, Bannon's fellow Breitbart alum, who is now an aide in the West Wing, and who grew up in Los Angeles, where she attended the prestigious Harvard-Westlake School;\\n\\nAlex Marlow, the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News and another Harvard-Westlake alum, the website that has become the primary media vehicle for Trump's populist nationalist agenda.\\n\\nOne name that came up later would bring the entire discussion full circle — and that was none other than Andrew Breitbart himself, who Lucas noted embodied both schools of thought. Breitbart was on a Lincoln Fellowship at the Claremont Institute when he launched the website that would bear his name, and later help launch one of the most unlikely presidencies in modern times.\\n\\nWhat is 'California Trumpism'?\\n\\nLucas says, 'Trumpists' are people who think California — and by extension the United States — are in decline…that there's something wrong, something's on the downslope, and they're very willing to say that, point it out, try to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\nFor Lucas, there are two seminal moments in the rise of Trumpism. First, the publication of Michael Anton's The Flight 93 Election — in which Anton, under an alias, lays out the perfect case for why a Trump-like figure can only arise as a Phoenix from the ashes of a corrupt, California-like Republic — and the tragic murder of Kate Steinle, the beautiful 32 year-old woman cut down in the prime of her life by an illegal alien set loose on the streets of San Francisco by liberals' sanctuary policy.\\n\\nLucas was very open about the way he and other liberals were taken by complete surprise by Trump's election — something that many conservatives in California understood intuitively was a foregone conclusion once Trump made it clear he would stand and fight like Reagan did, instead of cutting and running like the Mitt Romney wing of the party. But unlike most liberals, Lucas admitted that he believes it is important to understand how we got here, instead of simply demonizing Trump and his supporters.\\n\\nWe're all in this country together, we're all in this state together — who are you people? Lucas asks, rhetorically. What do you think?\\n\\nHe answers his own question early in the interview:\\n\\nIt seems a very important intellectual moment in bringing together these sort of two strands of Conservatism that have emerged in Southern California. On the one hand, this idea from the Claremont Institute — that the United States was founded as sort of an expression of ancient political theory coming from Aristotle and people like that. And that we're in serious trouble with the rise of Progressive Liberal Government in the 20th Century. And on the other hand, sort of Andrew Breitbart's idea that culture is ahead of politics — that you had to create a media vehicle that sort of spoke to people where they are — and bring them along politically after that. And it struck me that was very obviously the formula for Trump…\\n\\nLucas decried the violence and death of free speech in Berkeley (the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement'): It's very disheartening to see people [on the far left and the far right] who'd rather punch each other than talk to each other when they have political disagreements.\\n\\nWhen asked by Marlow if life is going to get better or worse for conservatives in California, Lucas had a warning.\\n\\nCalifornia is always a decade or two ahead of the United States — and…as goes California, so, too, very often goes the United States…. He suggested that progressive leftism was likely going to take over the rest of the nation in that time.\\n\\nNot likely in places like Texas or the heartland of this country, at least not anytime soon.\\n\\nMaybe there's another takeaway…\\n\\nSince Trumpism was truly born in California, perhaps there's hope for the Golden State after all.\\n\\nTim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and author who is doing a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.

{"original": "ROME — Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs went on a tirade against President Donald Trump at a Vatican meeting Wednesday, insisting that his reelection would be absolutely dangerous.\\n\\nMr. Sachs said the Trump administration has bullied other nations into supporting its policies, reported Edward Pentin of the National Catholic Register.\\n\\nIt's pure politics top to bottom which has nothing to do with anything meritorious other than the idea of temporary advantage in some geopolitical contests and contexts, said the left-wing economist.\\n\\nTrump's unilateral actions are thuggery, a complete violation of every international rule, said Sachs, a supporter of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. This is truly what we are facing. I'm sorry to say it, it's my country and I'm not very happy to say it, but it's an imperial power in decline and it's a dangerous country right now and it will be absolutely dangerous if Trump wins re-election.\\n\\nThe Vatican has a close, ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Sachs, one the world's foremost proponents of population control, and brought him to Rome as a special invitee for the pan-Amazon Synod of Bishops last fall.\\n\\nIn his 2008 book Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet, Sachs argued for legalizing abortion as a cost-effective way to eliminate unwanted children when contraception fails.\\n\\nAbortion, he wrote, is a lower-risk and lower-cost option than having unwanted children born into the world.\\n\\nThe legalization of abortion reduces a country's total fertility rate significantly, by as much as half a child on average, he wrote approvingly, while criticizing America's Mexico City Policy, which denies funding to NGOs that perform or promote abortions.\\n\\nParticularly in Africa, Sachs wrote, abortion should be legalized and family planning programs made to cater to adolescents as well as to married households.\\n\\nSachs was also the lead architect of the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals and pleaded for countries to include sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in the scheme, after they were initially left out, which eventually led to their inclusion over and against objections from the Holy See and the United States.\\n\\nSachs wrote that the Cairo Plan of Action, which called for universal access to reproductive healthcare including abortion, was one of the most important Millennium Promises, noting that population policy is integral to the overall challenge of sustainable development.\\n\\nSachs also ushered in the Sustainable Development Goals when the Millennium Development Goals expired at the end of 2015. The U.N. agenda encapsulates 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets, some of which directly contradict the Catholic Church's core beliefs regarding human life.\\n\\nWe are committed to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, the agenda declares, in reference to contraception and abortion.\\n\\nIn Wednesday's address, Mr. Sachs also accused the Trump administration of threatening multilateralism by operating with complete lawlessness, while blocking every multilateral initiative since 2017.\\n\\nMultilateralism is not under threat in most of the world, Sachs said, but it is under threat because of the United States.\\n\\nUnder Trump, the U.S. has been dismantling the international system, Sachs warned, while urging his hearers to stand up to the relentless U.S. daily pressure on multilateralism.\\n\\nIn recent years, the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences has fostered a special relationship with the Democrat party in the United States, frequently inviting its representatives to speak at its assemblies.\\n\\nIn 2015, the Pontifical Academy had eleven U.S. speakers for a Vatican workshop on climate change and the role of local governments, all of whom were members of the Democrat party.\\n\\nTen mayors of American cities along with California Governor Jerry Brown were invited by the Vatican to address the event, but no Republicans were present.\\n\\nThe ten U.S. mayors attending the event were Bill de Blasio of New York, Charlie Hales of Portland (OR), Marty Walsh of Boston, Ed Murray of Seattle, Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, Betsy Hodges of Minneapolis, Matt Appelbaum of Boulder, William Bell of Birmingham, Sam Liccardo of San José, and Ed Lee of San Francisco.\\n\\nGovernor Jerry Brown, who as a young man considered becoming a priest and spent time in a Jesuit seminary, now opposes the Church on multiple matters, including abortion, gay marriage, and a host of LGBTQ issues.\\n\\nThis unprecedented gathering of global leaders is a wake-up call to face up to the common threats of climate change and human exploitation, Brown stated.\\n\\nOn that occasion, the Vatican also tapped Jeffrey Sachs to help organize the workshop, who said at the time that Pope Francis was extremely excited about Mayor de Blasio coming.\\n\\nIn 2016, the Pontifical Academy invited Bernie Sanders to speak to its members, an invitation Sanders attributed to the close alignment of his political message with that of Pope Francis.\\n\\nI think the Vatican has been aware of the fact that, in many respects, the pope's views and my views are very much related, Sanders told the Washington Post.\\n\\nHe has talked in an almost unprecedented way about the need to address income and wealth inequality, poverty and to combat the greed that we're seeing all over this world, which is doing so much harm to so many people, he said.\\n\\nThe pope does not believe in trickle-down economic theory, he does not believe, as many of my more conservative colleagues believe, that if we give more tax breaks to the rich, and we deregulate Wall Street, and deregulate industry, that somehow all of the benefits about the regulation will filter on down to ordinary people, Sanders said in a separate interview in February 2016.\\n\\nThat is a direct critique of conservative politics, and of course he's going to be attacked for that, Sanders said.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

{"original": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence held a joint press conference with European Council President Donald Tusk on Monday in which Pence affirmed United States commitment to the European Union while also raising questions as to whether the U.S. supports the European Union's freedom of movement.\\n\\nIn the joint press conference with Tusk, Vice President Pence stated in part:\\n\\nSaturday, as President Tusk said, I was pleased to address the Munich Security Council to speak about the importance of the strategic alliance [inaudible] … entered the bond so many years ago in the North American Treaty Organization. But the president did ask me to come here, to Brussels, to the home of the European Union, and deliver an additional message, so today it is my privilege on behalf of President Trump to express the strong commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union. Whatever our differences, our two continents share the same marriage, the same values, and above all, the same purpose — to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. And to those objectives, we will remain committed. This has been European Union's goal since before its formal founding in 1993. What began as a modest Western European trade agreement in 1951, freedom of movement, has grown into a commitment to the four freedoms — the freedom of movement, goods, capital, services and people, the common currency, and common approach to foreign and security policy.\\n\\nPence continued speaking of the history of the European Union (EU). He moved to speak of U.S. and EU economies and reaffirm our commitment to a free, fair and flourishing economies that undergird our success and a cooperation in achieving that. Maintaining and strengthening our economic vitality will require hard but necessary choices.\\n\\nPence also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting terrorism, mentioned the Islamic terror bombings on Brussels that killed more than 30 people, then called on the European community to intensify efforts to fight radical Islamic terrorism alongside the United States. This will require greater coordination and intelligence-sharing among EU member states and between the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he said.\\n\\nSpeaking of Russian aggression, Pence said, In addition to confronting terrorism together, clearly, we must stand strong in defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nations in Europe.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported that in the week leading up to the vice president's meetings in Brussels and affirmation of U.S. commitment to the EU, in a conversation with a German diplomat, White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon described the EU as a flawed construct. He cited three confidential sources that had been briefed on the meeting.\\n\\nThe sources stated that Bannon conveyed favor for bilateral relations with Europe. One White House official claimed to Reuters a more brief version of the interaction between Bannon and German ambassador to Washington Peter Wittig than the three other sources. The three sources reportedly described Bannon's message to the diplomat as favoring strong nationalist movements. One of the three described the White House position on the EU as not seeing an unraveling of the EU as having grave consequences.\\n\\nThe vice president spoke at the Munich Security Conference in the days before his visit to Brussels as part of his first trip abroad since taking office. Last week, the conference chairman, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, called on Pence to affirm during his visit that the U.S. supports the EU and was not aiming to break up the organization, according to Reuters.\\n\\nPence made the trip to the security conference on behalf of President Trump. A senior White House policy adviser previewed the trip last week, promising an overarching message of reassurance. In his speech to conference participants, he brought this promise from President Trump: We will stand with Europe today and every day; we are bound together by the same noble ideals – freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law.\\n\\nAt Monday's joint press conference, Pence stated, The United States commitment to the European Union is steadfast and enduring. President Tusk, President Trump, and I look forward to working together with you and the European Union to deepen our political and economic partnership.\\n\\nDuring his presidential campaign, now-President Donald Trump made clear that he supported the United Kingdom's Brexit vote to leave the European Union. The day after the June 23 Brexit vote, then-candidate Trump compared the vote to the upcoming presidential election in the U.S. and attributed the U.K. vote to leave the EU, and prospectively the U.S. presidential vote, in large part to people's desire to control borders and block illegal immigration.\\n\\nUSA Today quoted Trump as stating, All over the world [people are] angry. They are angry at the borders. They are angry over people coming into the country and taking over.\\n\\nIn late January, European Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, who vehemently opposes Brexit, said, We have a third front undermining the European Union, and it is Donald Trump, who has joined [the far-Right parties] from across the Atlantic. He has talked fairly favorably of other countries wanting to break away from the EU and that he hoped for disintegration from European Union, according to the Telegraph.\\n\\nIn the Monday press conference, President Tusk emphasized a particular portion of his meeting with Vice President Pence, saying, I asked the vice president directly if he shared my opinions on three key matters: the international order, security, and the attitude of the new American administration towards the European Union. Tusk continued, In reply to these three matters, I heard today from Vice President Pence three times 'yes.' After such a positive declaration, both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach.\\n\\nRequest for comment from the vice president on whether the State Department had a role in statements made at Monday's joint Pence-Tusk press conference returned no comment by the time of this report.\\n\\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana."}

But because Stasi is a Trump-hating leftist, and the establishment media have no ethical or professional standards, Stasi still has a job.\\n\\nIn her Tuesday column for the far-left Daily News, Stasi called on Fox News to fire Guilfoyle for dating Donald Trump Jr.\\n\\nStasi also said the Puerto Rican Guilfoyle would be better off picking grapes.\\n\\nAfter her racial attack on Guilfoyle went viral, Stasi claimed in a tweet she had [a]bsolutely no idea that Kimberly Guilfoyle is half Puerto Rican…and my column was in no way meant as a slur.\\n\\nAbsolutely no idea that Kimberly Guilfoyle is half Puerto Rican…and my column was in no way meant as a slur. Nonetheless I will change that reference online. I'm just surprised anyone would have assumed such a stereotype b/c someone is half-Latina. So sorry for misunderstanding — Linda Stasi (@lindastasi) June 13, 2018\\n\\nThis, of course, is the same explanation sitcom star Roseanne Barr presented in her defense late last month after being fired from her ABC show, Roseanne. In a tweet, Barr compared former-Obama White House advisor Valerie Jarrett to an ape. Barr, however, said she had no idea Jarrett is black. Barr was still disgraced and fired.\\n\\nStasi's claim of ignorance regarding Guilfoyle's Puerto Rican heritage lacks credibility for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nTo begin with, Stasi is dishonest and unethical.\\n\\nIn order to make a case for Guilfoyle's termination, Stasi repeatedly misleads her readers (and this includes the headline) with the false claim Guilfoyle is a reporter. By spreading this falsehood, Stasi is able to manufacture a conflict of interest out of whole cloth over the fact that Guilfoyle is in a relationship with someone she is reporting on. This is the foundation of Stasi's piece, and none of it is true.\\n\\nAlong with the headline, here are the falsehoods: [emphasis mine]\\n\\nFox Should Fire Reporter Kimberly Guilfoyle, Who Can't Possibly Stay Neutral While Dating a Trump Kid Now that Kimberly Guilfoyle is reportedly having sleepovers with Donald Trump Jr., the Fredo Corleone of the Trump boys, while she's reporting on him, his father, his father's sex scandals, and the Mueller investigation, what Fox News — that fair and balanced network — should do is bust her down to courtroom reporter. Or fire her. That's what the sex-scandal-plagued news network must do to maintain even the slightest shred of journalistic integrity. She can't report on the most powerful family in the country while dating one of them.\\n\\nThe truth (which is available with a few keystrokes to anyone with integrity) is that Guilfoyle is an opinion pundit for Fox News. Also, her relationship with Don Jr. is not a secret. Therefore there is no conflict of interest, there is no reporting, there are no ethical issues.\\n\\nStasi's misleading smears are even more dishonest now that we know a young (early 20s) female reporter for no less than the New York Times/Politico/HuffPost/McClatchy/BuzzFeed secretly shared a bed with a 57-year-old source for years as he selectively fed her, and her various employers, anti-Trump scoops. We have also been told her employers knew of this sleazy relationship.\\n\\nStasi has yet to register any outrage over this issue of journalistic ethics.\\n\\nThe other reason Stasi's Roseanne Barr Excuse stretches credulity is based on the columnist's admitted knowledge of Guilfoyle's personal life.\\n\\nStasi spends a couple hundred words slashing Guilfoyle's romantic life (which laughably boils down to OMG an attractive, successful single woman maybe dated that guy last year and is dating this guy now — that's two guys in two years!), so how are we supposed to believe Stasi is unaware of Guilfoyle's most well-known relationship, her five-year marriage to former-Mayor Gavin Newsom (D-CA), a relationship where Guilfoyle was famously celebrated as the first Latina First Lady of San Francisco.\\n\\nWhat's more, there is the undeniable fact the left believe they have a moral duty to make examples of those they see as race and gender traitors, as runaways from the Democrat Thought Plantation.\\n\\nStasi likely believes she has an obligation to put a Puerto Rican woman (who dares support Trump) in her place — which is in the fields picking grapes where she is not a threat to Democrats.\\n\\nStasi's column not only adds to the legacy of a Democrat Party that, for centuries, has used everything, from slavery to segregation to the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, to terrorize and bully people of color who threaten their political power, it also adds to the establishment media's ongoing legacy of doing the same.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

We live art ninja as a philosophy of life, helps us to endure the hardships of everyday life, to be patient, strong and disciplined, an Iranian woman and ninja in training named Melika said in an interview with El Mundo. It is a spiritual art. We're not looking to fight anyone outside the classroom.\\n\\nAccording to El Mundo, Iran currently has 4,000 female ninjas who train with sabers. That number is growing.\\n\\nIn April of 2012, the Iranian regime had temporarily revoked the press credentials for Reuters news agency after they ran a headline suggesting the it was training female Ninjas to be assassins. The original headline read, Thousands of Female Ninjas Train as Iran's Assassins. It was later changed to Three Thousand Women Ninjas Train in Iran. Nearly one year later, in March of 2013, Iran reinstated its credentials.\\n\\nAkbar Faraji, a ninja master of nearly 30 years, trains these women. Since under Islamic law, male and female relations are strictly forbidden outside of marriage, Faraji told El Mundo that he has designed tools that allow [him] to teach them the art ninja without touching them. he explains.\\n\\nSeveral of the women have reportedly been approached by Iran's police forces to potentially join, but rejected the offer. Similarly, Faraji said he had been asked to provide a training video to show the Iranian military how to fight. He declined, citing his disassociation from political or religious organizations.\\n\\nFaraji said of his female ninjas, The truth is that its lethal power is undeniable. They learn to climb walls, jump walls and fences without being seen, to hide in the mountains and capable of slicing the neck rival without making a sound, he told El Mundo. However, I must be very sure that my students will not use the techniques of ninjutsu. To hurt anyone or sneak into someone else's house formed not to kill them, but they can maul someone in a second.\\n\\nOne of his students named Fariba said the training has helped her protect herself against a man who tried to harass her in the street.\\n\\nIran's state-run Press TV ran a segment on these women warriors several years ago:\\n\\nIranian women have been barred from attending sporting events, including the first-ever I Run Iran marathon.

{"original": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Countries that have banned female genital mutilation (FGM) should allow less invasive practices such as small surgical nicks to girls' genitalia as a compromise, two American gynecologists said on Monday.\\n\\nBut campaigners against FGM strongly criticized the proposal, saying it would undermine global efforts to eradicate the internationally condemned ritual.\\n\\nAt least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM in over 30 countries, according to U.N. estimates.\\n\\nThe ancient practice usually involves the partial or total removal of a girl's external genitalia. In some cases the vaginal opening is also sewn up.\\n\\nBut some communities practice less invasive rituals such as pricking or nicking the clitoris.\\n\\nThe U.S. gynecologists, writing in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that permitting more minimal procedures could allow families to uphold cultural and religious traditions while protecting girls from more dangerous forms of cutting.\\n\\nCommunities which support FGM often consider it a prerequisite for marriage. Many also see it as a religious obligation although it is not mentioned in the Koran or Bible.\\n\\nBut FGM can cause a host of physical and psychological problems.\\n\\nGynecologists Kavita Shah Arora and Allan Jacobs said procedures that slightly changed the look of a girl's genitalia without damaging them were comparable to male circumcision or cosmetic procedures in Western countries like labiaplasty.\\n\\nLaws against mild modifications were culturally insensitive and supremacist and discriminatory towards women, they wrote in the specialist journal, which is published by the British Medical Journal.\\n\\nBEHIND THE TIMES\\n\\nFGM is practiced in a swathe of African countries, pockets of Asia and the Middle East, as well as by diaspora communities living in the West.\\n\\nThe gynecologists suggested that global attempts to stamp out FGM with legislation had failed and may by driving the practice underground.\\n\\nWe are not arguing that any procedure on the female genitalia is desirable, they said. Rather, we only argue that certain procedures ought to be tolerated by liberal societies.\\n\\nThey said the term female genital mutilation should be replaced with the less emotive female genital alteration (FGA) to avoid demonizing important cultural practices.\\n\\nBut experts on medical ethics, commenting on the proposal, said procedures to modify girls' genitals could not be compared to male circumcision because they are designed to control women and curb their sexual desire.\\n\\nThey also predicted that legalizing more minimal procedures would generate a litany of legal, regulatory and medical problems.\\n\\nGlobal campaigners against FGM said doctors should challenge harmful social norms, not condone them.\\n\\nAny form of FGM is a violation of a child's rights, said Adwoa Kwateng-Kluvitse, head of global advocacy at the charity FORWARD which campaigns against FGM in Africa and Europe.\\n\\nWhy would you put a little girl through that? There should be no medicalization of FGM. They (the gynecologists) are completely behind the times.\\n\\nThis is very different to male circumcision. With male circumcision there is no intention to attenuate sexual desire, control sexuality or enforce chastity.\\n\\nRights group Equality Now said the medicalization of FGM remained one of the biggest threats to its elimination.\\n\\nIt said FGM prevalence rates had fallen significantly in many countries and that properly implemented laws had been very effective in countries like Kenya.\\n\\n(By Emma Batha; Editing by Ros Russell)"}

Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.\\n\\nThe archbishop's statement reflected the bishops' ongoing vocal concern over Biden's full-bore support for Planned Parenthood, his opposition to school choice, his attacks on the Little Sisters of the Poor, his support for gender transition even for minors, his promises to repeal legislation protecting U.S. taxpayers from financing abortion domestically and abroad, his promotion of same-sex marriage, and other related issues, all of which fly in the face of Catholic teaching.\\n\\nIt's time for Pope Francis to order an apostolic visitation to investigate what has gone wrong with an organization that began during World War I as a model of cooperation and national audacity and is now a symbol of division and national embarrassment, the Reporter editors pronounce, apparently without irony.\\n\\nThe editors also protest the fact that the bishops praised Trump for his pro-life efforts, suggesting that such praise was undeserved.\\n\\nWorse even, Gomez and other conference officials took part in an April conference call with Trump where the (former) liar-in-chief called himself the 'best [president] in the history of the Catholic Church,' the editorial declares.\\n\\nThe Reporter's diatribe against the bishops follows on its recent call for retribution against pro-life Catholics who voted for Trump, demanding they sever their relationship with white Catholic nationalism.\\n\\nThis is, of course, the same paper that last summer proclaimed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the future of the Catholic Church, noting her frequent references to Catholic values and her passion for justice.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

Hijrah refers to a holy journey, in this case the young reader's sacred journey to join the ISIS caliphate.\\n\\nThe document, organized by a table of contents, includes everything from learning first aid, keeping physically fit, learning Arabic to all kinds of advice for newcomers on preparing for their trip, reports The Foreign Desk.\\n\\nThere is a special section of advice for women, including al-Britani's assurances that women can violate the Islamic laws against traveling without the required male companionship for the holy purpose of joining the caliphate.\\n\\nAs for that important advice to underaged militants about how to clue Mom and Dad in on their new lives as murderous savages, al-Britani wisely suggests keeping it quiet until the young recruit is safely in Syria.\\n\\nAlthough your parents are the closest of people to you, you do not want to jeopardise your hijrah by telling them where you are going, he explains. There are two options you can have either inform them when you are on the borders of Turkey and Sham about to enter or once you are here in Sham. Both have their pros and cons, and one can decide for himself when they wish to tell their parents. (Sham is another name ISIS uses for its territory.)\\n\\nAl-Britani tells young recruits to trust only a few older people who can provide money and other assistance for the journey to jihad, and touchingly suggests they take a last look at your parent's faces before departing for the caliphate, so you will always remember this once you are here.\\n\\nIf the youthful targets of ISIS brainwashing think their life in the caliphate will allow them to escape all those rules and chores their parents hassle them with, they should think again. The Supermarket Jihadi's most notorious previous publication was a fiery rant against rude, angry, messy, lazy Arabs. Among other things, he criticized their childish behavior and poor table manners.\\n\\nHe has also offered Muslim girls advice on how to catch the eye of a jihadi and reel him in for marriage, in a monograph entitled Hijrah Advice for Sisters Marrying Mujaahideen from Twitter.

{"original": "The amnesty plan pushed January 20 by President Joe Biden includes a few cursory mentions of American families while championing the demands of migrants, employers, and investors.\\n\\nThe U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 establishes a new system to responsibly manage and secure our border, keep our [migrant] families and [border] communities safe, and better manage migration across the Hemisphere, says the statement introducing the plan.\\n\\nThe plan mentions families 15 times, nearly all of which refer to foreign families:\\n\\nKeep families together. The bill reforms the family-based immigration system by clearing backlogs, recapturing unused visas, eliminating lengthy wait times, and increasing per-country visa caps. It also eliminates the so-called 3 and 10-year bars, and other provisions that keep families apart. The bill further supports families by more explicitly including permanent partnerships and eliminating discrimination facing LGBTQ+ families. It also provides protections for orphans, widows, children, and Filipino veterans who fought alongside the United States in World War II. Lastly, the bill allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join family in the United States on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.\\n\\nThe plan mentions work and workers 16 times, nearly all of which refer to foreign workers:\\n\\nProtect workers from exploitation and improve the employment verification process. The bill requires that DHS and the Department of Labor establish a commission involving labor, employer, and civil rights organizations to make recommendations for improving the employment verification process. Workers who suffer serious labor violations and cooperate with worker protection agencies will be granted greater access to U visa relief. The bill protects workers who are victims of workplace retaliation from deportation in order to allow labor agencies to interview these workers. It also protects migrant and seasonal workers, and increases penalties for employers who violate labor laws.\\n\\nThe statement repeatedly praises the economic migrants who have illegally taken jobs and wages from many millions of Americans, including mother of young children, disabled Americans, ex-convicts, blacks, untrained Americans, and isolated Americans:\\n\\nThe bill provides hardworking people who enrich our communities every day and who have lived here for years, in some cases for decades, an opportunity to earn citizenship … The bill creates an earned path to citizenship for our immigrant neighbors, colleagues, parishioners, community leaders, friends, and loved ones—including Dreamers and the essential workers who have risked their lives to serve and protect American communities.\\n\\nThe plan does not mention jobs — but it does include one reference to Americans' wages.\\n\\nThe statement says the amnesty will allow — but not require — federal agencies to set policies that raise wages for foreign workers to prevent unfair competition with American workers.\\n\\nBut those protection policies have already been established by President Donald Trump's regulations — and the Biden team is expected to discard the regulatory protections.\\n\\nMoreover, the amnesty bill would cut Americans' wages by dramatically increasing foreign competition. For example, the bill would spike competition for Fortune 500 jobs by allowing all foreigners with STEM PhDs to get citizenship.\\n\\nOverall, the bill offers to dramatically expand corporate revenues, real-estate values, and Wall Street stocks by supercharging the chaotic flow of foreign consumers and workers into American' jobs, home, and communities:\\n\\nGrow our economy. This bill clears employment-based visa backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and eliminates per-country visa caps. The bill makes it easier for graduates of U.S. universities with advanced STEM degrees to stay in the United States; improves access to green cards for workers in lower-wage sectors; and eliminates other unnecessary hurdles for employment-based green cards. The bill provides dependents of H-1B visa holders work authorization, and children are prevented from aging out of the system. The bill also creates a pilot program to stimulate regional economic development, gives DHS the authority to adjust green cards based on macroeconomic conditions.\\n\\nIn contrast to Biden and his business-backed policies, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on January 19 that Americans and their job should get a higher priority than immigration changes. Before we deal with immigration, we need to deal with COVID, make sure everyone has the chance to find a good job, and confront the threat from China, Rubio said in his statement.\\n\\nAmnesty advocates respond to the criticism by insisting that Americans will gain some moral benefit as their jobs and wages are diverted to blue-collar migrants, foreign graduates, and Wall Street.\\n\\nFor example, Mark Zuckerberg' FWD.us group declared that the Biden amnesty is Vital to Restoring the U.S.' Moral Leadership. The statement from the investor group continued:\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the success of our country comes in large part from our longstanding tradition of encouraging families seeking a better life to leave behind everything they know to begin contributing to the United States. They deserve the opportunity to live a dignified life. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle must act expeditiously to bring this legislation to the floor for a vote to create the modern, compassionate and humane immigration system that our nation deserves.\\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans tell pollsters that the federal government should ensure Americans have decent jobs before allowing companies to import more foreign workers.\\n\\nThe polls show Americans' deep and broad opposition to cheap labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into the jobs needed by young and old Americans.\\n\\nThe multi-racial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based opposition to cheap labor migration co-exists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950's Nation of Immigrants claim.\\n\\nIn December, the Washington Post reported on the economic free-fall faced by Flaviana Decker in Rubio's Florida:\\n\\nHer job waiting tables at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort had sustained her through the painful end of her marriage and the struggles of being a single parent to two teenage girls, one of whom is autistic and struggles with basic motor skills and speaking. Throughout the summer and fall as lawmakers were fighting over an economic relief bill and the number of coronavirus cases was climbing, Flaviana was scouring the Disney fan blogs for glimmers of hope that the tourists might be returning. But the once famously long lines at Disney World remained short even as Orlando's free food lines, packed with laid-off hotel and theme park workers, grew longer. All the while Flaviana's unemployment checks shrank from more than $800 a week in July to $247 a week in October, which didn't even cover her rent. … The hardest parts for Flaviana were accepting the reality that her Disney job was gone; that the modest middle-class life that she had built was no longer sustainable; that she wouldn't be able to provide Victoria, a bright and imaginative teenager whose autism made everyday tasks difficult, with the classes and therapists that enabled her to learn and share her thoughts and feelings. … As Trump's prospects dimmed in the days after Election Day, Flaviana held on to the faint chance that he might somehow prevail. Her hopes were dashed on Nov. 7 when she glanced at her phone and saw the election was being called for Biden. She took a deep breath and then swallowed hard. A tear streaked her cheek.\\n\\nThe public's preference for civic solidarity is decent and rational.

The three-time Superbowl champion was married to former Cowboys publicist Rhonda Worthey for 11 years and has two daughters from that marriage.\\n\\nIn Hellbent Bayless wrote:\\n\\nI had heard the rumor since 1991. An off-duty Dallas police officer who traveled with the Cowboys and worked security at their hotels first told me that 'the word on the street' was that Troy Aikman was gay. Over the next four years, I heard the rumor from two more police officers who worked around the team (and I know they mentioned it to team officials). One officer told me Aikman 'was supposed to be' having a relationship with a male member of a country-western band.\\n\\nThe number one overall draft pick in 1989 was none too happy that Fox Sports decided to bring Bayless into the broadcasting fold. To say I'm disappointed in the hiring of Skip Bayless would be an enormous understatement,  Aikman told Sports Illustrated.\\n\\nAikman, who was hired by Fox in 2001 as a provider of color commentary for the NFC telecasts, thinks the network made a bad decision in hiring Bayless, who he considers unworthy of the job. He even singles out Fox Sports president of national networks Jamie Horowitz, holding him responsible for hiring the longtime ESPN sportswriter and sports talk host.\\n\\nClearly, Jamie Horowitz and I have a difference of opinion when it comes to building a successful organization, he explained. I believe success is achieved by acquiring and developing talented, respected and credible individuals, none of which applies to Skip Bayless.\\n\\nBayless told Davis that he has tried to contact Aikman and even wrote him a note, saying, I'm dumbfounded by this that you have any issue with this book. I would have thought you would have loved this book. He added, I would be happy to sit down with him today and talk to him.\\n\\nPerhaps Aikman, who hasn't agreed to any such sit-down meeting, may be dumbfounded that Bayless would even ask."}

Or so claims a particularly ludicrous opinion piece in the New York Times.\\n\\nBlack Britons know why Meghan Markle wants out, is the headline.\\n\\nIt goes on:\\n\\nHer treatment has proved what many of us have always known: No matter how beautiful you are, whom you marry, what palaces you occupy, charities you support, how faithful you are, how much money you accumulate or what good deeds you perform, in this society racism will still follow you.\\n\\nThe piece's author Afua Hirsch is an author and academic with a track record of race-baiting polemic.\\n\\nBorn a child of privilege into an upper-middle-class family, privately educated, blessed with good looks, intelligence and an Oxford University degree, Hirsch is an implausible poster child for black victimhood.\\n\\nAfua Hirsch knows why Meghan and Harry are leaving — it's the racism, obviously. But if that's true, why move to a country where the Prime minister regularly dresses up in black face https://t.co/2gLNMnvna9 — Toby Young (@toadmeister) January 9, 2020\\n\\nYet this is how she has chosen to make her career – first with a misery memoir Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging, much admired by progressive critics of a self-hating white persuasion, later writing articles for the Guardian.\\n\\nIn 2017, she outdid herself by arguing that Nelson's Column should be torn down from London's Trafalgar Square because it was an 'offensive' monument created, she claimed, by 'white supremacists.'\\n\\nShe now teaches journalism at the University of Southern California.\\n\\nBut not the kind of journalism, clearly, that pays much regard to facts.\\n\\nThere is simply no credible case to be made that Megan Markle's departure from Britain has anything to do with 'racism.' On the contrary, both the Royal Family and the British public have been at pains to make this brash newcomer welcome, despite her weapons-grade sense of entitlement and her apparent unwillingness to do more than the barest minimum to fit in either with Royal protocol or the duties that come with the privilege of her newly acquired wealth and her rank by marriage.\\n\\nHirsch's entire argument is based on desperately strained inference and heavy-hinting innuendo, finding needless offence where none could possibly have been intended.\\n\\nSome of these examples are shot down here by Tom Slater at Spiked:\\n\\nThere's that Mail piece from 2016, when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was '(almost) straight outta Compton' – at the time Markle's mother lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA. Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with 'racialised forms of crime', ie gangs. That's one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the difference in Harry and Meghan's social backgrounds. If Harry had been dating a white working-class woman from Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.\\n\\nAnother favourite is that weird throwaway line Rachel Johnson wrote, in a laudatory piece on Markle, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some 'rich and exotic DNA' to the pale Windsor bloodline. That's more cringey than racist.\\n\\nAs I've written before, most Britons were not even aware of Megan Markle's mixed-race heritage until she and her supporters and publicists started banging on about it. No one cares because Britain is a country largely comfortable with race and black people are well integrated.\\n\\nMeghan Markle's departure from the UK has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with her insistence on acting like a spoilt, unaccountable Hollywood princess in a country that takes a dim view of spoilt, unaccountable Hollywood princesses."}

{"original": "Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan was sworn in on Saturday. He did not make the best impression on local media, which pronounced him poorly tailored and chuckled at his inability to follow protocol or pronounce some of the Urdu words in his oath of office. His wife Bushra Bibi, on the other hand, made a major fashion statement by wearing a white niqab.\\n\\nAl-Arabiya on Thursday reported a mixture of enthusiastic praise for Bushra Bibi's outfit and reservations about the image she projects of Pakistan as a regressive Islamist state:\\n\\nPhotos of Bushra Bibi were circulated on social media networks with many describing her as the bringer of joy for Pakistan. However, her burqa stirred controversy as some criticized her for choosing to wear it because it affects the image of Pakistani women in the world. Journalist and activist Sameera Khan said on Twitter: She has every right to wear what she wants but as the wife of Pakistan's leader, she represents all Pakistani women. When the international community sees Pakistan as a regressive state that oppresses women, this is not the greatest representation of Pakistani women, she also said, adding: Nowhere in the Quran does it mandate covering everything but the eyes. Twitter user Azfar replied to Sameera and said: So what? She should take off her veil and drop some inches in her cleavage like yourself just to show the western world? How is that a representation of freedom and progressive society??\\n\\nSome observers felt too much was being read into Bushra Bibi's wardrobe choice, while others noted that even wearing a niqab was not good enough to square her with the most hardline Muslim critics, who assailed her for wearing makeup and nail polish.\\n\\nThe swearing-in ceremony was the first public appearance for Khan's wife since their wedding in February. It was the third marriage for Khan, a cricket star formerly known as a playboy.\\n\\nHis first marriage, lasting from 1995 to 2004, was to a British socialite named Jemima Goldsmith who was hounded for her family's Jewish ancestry while living in Pakistan, as the UK Telegraph put it. She converted to Islam before marrying Khan and remains active in Middle Eastern politics and charity efforts. Her enthusiastic message of congratulations to her ex-husband for winning the prime minister's post was reportedly very well-received in Pakistan.\\n\\nKhan's second wife Reham, formerly a BBC weather presenter, was married to him for less than a year, and their divorce was much less amicable. Reham dropped a book just weeks before the election accusing Imran Khan of being a drug-addicted bisexual who sank into depravity under the influence of his first wife and her active Zionist friends and fathered numerous illegitimate children with Indian women.\\n\\nKhan responded by musing to reporters that getting married to her was the biggest mistake of my life.\\n\\nKhan's new wife, often known as Bushra Maneka using the surname of her first husband, is widely described as his spiritual adviser. She is a practitioner of the mystical Sufi branch of Islam.\\n\\nI did not catch a glimpse of my wife's face until after we were married. I proposed to her without seeing her because she had never met me without her face being covered with a full veil. The only idea I had of what she looked like came from an old photograph I had seen in her house, the prime minister told the UK Daily Mail in a July interview.\\n\\nKhan added that during his club-hopping days as a sports star, it would have been unthinkable if someone had told me I would marry someone whose face I hadn't seen … I would have thought they were mad.\\n\\nAlthough some worried Khan's burqa-clad wife could signal a turn toward repression for Pakistan, the new prime minister was applauded on Wednesday for lifting all political censorship in state-run media outlets and providing them with complete editorial independence.\\n\\nKhan ran on a platform of reducing corruption and scaling back the power of government. His deregulation of the media happened so fast that it took even his supporters by surprise. Am I having an LSD flashback? one Pakistani asked on Twitter after seeing news about opposition politicians on state TV for the first time in years.\\n\\nThe Times of India optimistically noted that Khan seems to be easing up on the anti-American and anti-India rhetoric he used during the campaign when he complained America has been forcing Pakistan to fight the War on Terror on its behalf while India scapegoats him as a villain from a Bollywood film.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as the TOI notes, Pakistan's military has at least as much to say about foreign policy as the prime minister does, and Pakistan's drift into China's orbit could be difficult to reverse even if Khan wants to. The Indian paper suspected Khan will find the Chinese to be an overbearing partner whose pockets are not as deep as they previously led Pakistan to believe."}
{"original": "In my column last week about books women should read, I mention the book Spin Sisters by Myrna Blyth. Spin Sisters gives readers an insider's view (similar to Bernie Goldberg, author of the liberal media exposé Bias) of the members of the female media elite, a Girls' Club of editors, producers, print and television journalists with similar attitudes and opinions who influence the way millions of American women think and feel about their lives, their world, and themselves. Blyth doesn't mince words and places blame squarely on the women at the top.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, the growing online media market for women is using the same tactics traditional media does: fear. Before there was online click bait, women's magazines used the fear factor to grab women's attention. A couple examples:\\n\\nThe Poison That Hid in Our Home (Redbook)\\n\\nMattresses akin to kerosene (Good Morning America)\\n\\n5 Down-There Diseases You Don't Know About (Glamour)\\n\\nDangers Lurking in Your Water Bottle (KIFI, Wyoming)\\n\\nFor years I've written about mommy bloggers' obsession with BPA, the danger du jour perpetuated by the hysterical, click-seeking women's media. It involves the level of BPA found in water bottles, canned foods, and even thermal cash-register tape. Popular celebrity bloggers like Gwyneth Paltrow and the Food Babe have hyped several inherently flawed studies that blame everything from breast cancer to diabetes on BPA. Unfortunately for the fear-based online media, last week a new study came out that Paltrow, the Food Babe and other wannabe health bloggers can't be too thrilled about – GMO Crops Don't Harm Human Health, Report Says.\\n\\nShockingly, more and more evidence is coming out about celebrity and mommy bloggers being wrong. Perhaps Breitbart readers don't take them seriously, but millions of women do. Recently, Think Progress (yes, you read that right) questioned Gwyneth Paltrow's scientific prowess. They interviewed Timothy Caulfield, author of Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything? When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash, about the celebrity pseudoscience culture. From the interview:\\n\\nOne of the things that infuriates me is this idea that we shouldn't want to eat food that has ingredients we can't pronounce or spell. Have you seen that old Breyers commercial, with the little kids trying to read what's in their ice cream? And the idea is Breyers is better because of how simple the words are. Like the only thing you should ever consume is a thing a child can read. It goes to the chemical fallacy that we shouldn't eat any chemicals at all. Little do they know that they live in a universe made up of chemicals. That is one of those ploys that plays to our intuition. If you look up the chemicals that make up an apple, it can sound pretty scary. There's so many myths that people can leverage. They'll find a substance that is cancer-causing in huge doses and then say you shouldn't be consuming any of it, ever. I find the Honest Jessica Alba thing very frustrating: It's built of guilt, fear, and pseudoscience. I've seen quotes associated with her in which she claims autism and ADHD and childhood cancers are caused by all toxins that exist in this world, toxins that her products don't have. But now she's being sued, so.\\n\\nPaltrow's media profile brings together both the fear factor and one other aspect that thrives in women's online media: the myth of Pinterest perfection. Every day millions of women log into Pinterest and see perfectly organized laundry rooms, mudrooms, and DIY projects that require more patience than paint. Last week, one popular blogger decided she had enough. From Motto:\\n\\nJosi Denise became a mommy blogger in 2013, building up her American Mama blog until it reached tens of thousands of monthly readers, generating the mother of three thousands of dollars in some months. But the blog came to an abrupt end late last week, when Denise had a crisis of conscience and quit. In a splenetic rant on her new namesake blog (which is worth reading in full), Denise said much of the content posted to her mommy blog — and countless like it online — was garbage. She has deleted many of those posts, she said, Because, like 90% of the fake nonsense I used to share on the internet as a mommy blogger writing about my fake life and oh-so-happy marriage, they are pure b——t.\\n\\nThe quest for the perfectly organized life is what suckers in millions of readers. Next thing you know they're taking science and political lessons from women who don't know much about either. The solution isn't to dismiss their huge audience, but to engage that audience. Let the left continue to treat women like one-dimensional insta-victims. Conservatives and libertarians need to offer an alternative women's media that encompasses lifestyle, pop culture, AND political news. That's just what I did."}
{"original": "I used to be a feminist, but I gave it up so I could speak out for women's rights. Even before the intersectional, how many genders are there? lunacy took over, feminism was filled to bursting with types who think men are misogynists who all secretly want to rape us (this despite the fact that men are among the greatest supporters of women's rights) and a happily married mother is some kind of traitor.\\n\\nThe kind of people, in other words, who nobody in their right mind could possibly get along with.\\n\\nWhile I will always speak out for women to maintain our just civil rights, I do want Sharia Watch to spend significantly more time on freedom of speech (we will run an autumn campaign 'Islam Kills Free Speech') and the impact of Islam on children, but before I do, I intend to spend the summer doing something very important – informing the ludicrous feminists of today of something they desperately need to know: Islam Kills Women.\\n\\nIslam Kills Women is a joint effort between Sharia Watch UK and Examine-Islam.org It aims to do one thing and one thing only, show the world just why it is that women are treated so utterly appallingly in every Muslim society on earth.\\n\\nAs well as producing articles from various writers and information packs and videos, I will challenge every feminist organisation in Britain to debate me, so that they can attempt to prove me wrong. When they realise that they cannot do this, I invite them to stand alongside me at the culmination of this campaign – a protest rally to be held outside Parliament on August 20th.\\n\\nIslam kills women not only physically – although of course it does – but it kills the spirit of far greater numbers. From birth, girls are degraded and humiliated, most often by their own mothers. These girls accept their status and then pass it on to their own daughters in an endless cycle of what can only be described as evil.\\n\\nOften forced in to marriage, forced to live with domestic violence, and enslaved under a system of 'honour', life can be sheer misery for girls unfortunate enough to have been born in to Islam. To top it off, many will have their clitoris cut off so that sex will be painful and they can suffer the further humiliation of incontinence and other side-effects.\\n\\nAll of this, but all of it, is maintained and sustained and justified by Islam. That is a matter of fact. I will prove it right now.\\n\\nOne of the most contentious is FGM so let me start there. FGM is sanctioned by Islam. Fact. There are several hadiths which justify it. You can read these here, but I shall recount just one which should be enough to ring a few bells: Abu al-Malih ibn `Usama's father relates that the Prophet said: Circumcision is a law for men and a preservation of honour for women.' Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167.\\n\\nWhile it is true that some Islamic scholars have condemned FGM, many others promote it and use hadiths to do so. The Muslim Brotherhood for example pushed for FGM when it took over Egypt, and in moderate Indonesia, where somewhere between 80 and 100 per cent of girls suffer this mutilation, 100 per cent of women interviewed believed it to be an Islamic obligation. According to 'Stop FGM Mid East' the practice did not exist in Indonesia until the introduction of Islam.\\n\\nLet's move on to forced marriage. Child marriage is rife in the Muslim world, and it is not, as some suggest, simply a consequence of extreme poverty. The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, for example, has endorsed it on Islamic grounds for the simple reason that Mohammed married a six year old, therefore it must be permissible.\\n\\nThe relevant hadith is this: The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death) (Bukhari 7.62.88)\\n\\nIran allows the marriage of nine-year-old girls based on these same hadiths, and recent attempts in Pakistan to prevent child marriage were stopped by the Council of Islamic Ideology who deemed it blasphemous and un-Islamic. The chairman of the council helpfully explained: Parliament cannot create legislation that is against the teachings of the Holy Quran or Sunnah.\\n\\nStoning to death sounds just too terrible to be true. It sounds like something from pre-history that couldn't possibly be happening today, but it is – in one kind of society only, Islamic society. It is a punishment used almost exclusively on women accused of committing adultery. I say 'accused' because that is all it takes, she has no defence.\\n\\nRemember that under Islamic law, a woman's word is worth half of a man's, so if her husband accuses her, her denial is worthless and she will be found guilty on his word alone. This is brilliantly illustrated in the hard-to-watch movie 'The Stoning of Soraya M', a true story about the stoning of a young mother in Iran on the word of her husband only; he simply wanted rid of her. Her father and sons joined in with the stoning.\\n\\nStoning for adultery occurs under Islamic law for a reason that you may by now be able to guess: it was endorsed by Mohammed. There are several Islamic sources to back this up. I will recount just one part of Sahih Bukhari 3:50:885 which reads: Allah's Apostle said, By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death. Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah's Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death.\\n\\nDomestic and honour violence can be banded together as I believe they emanate from one verse of the Koran – Sura 4, verse 34, which reads: Men have authority over women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.\\n\\nCould this verse be any clearer? Women must obey and if they don't, you may use violence against them. This can, and in practice does, justify all kinds of horrors against women. It is very clear that if the men in her family don't approve of her conduct, they can beat her for it.\\n\\nI have not even scratched the surface. The oppression of women in Islamic countries is by far the cruellest in the world. No other major societies treat their women in this way and that is not an unfortunate coincidence, it is the direct result of these and many other teachings in Islamic scripture.\\n\\nWith all of this evidence in front of them, my challenge to British feminists is this: will you admit the truth in what I have written, and do you want this religion to have more or less influence in countries where women have fought and died for their freedom?\\n\\nIf, like me, you want to see a religion like this have zero influence, will you stand with me and oppose its import via mass immigration as Sharia Watch and Examine Islam intend to do on August 20th?\\n\\nMy guess is that you will not.

{"original": "A new United Nations survey of male attitudes toward gender equality finds precious little appetite for it across the Middle East.\\n\\nMale attitudes towards the role of women in the workplace and at home, and of their participation in public life, were stereotypically sexist in the study of views in Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco and Palestine, writes the UK Guardian in summarizing the report.\\n\\nEgypt scored the lowest on the report's Gender Equitable Men scale and is the source of the most striking headlines. For example, CNS News reports that 70 percent of Egyptian men approve of female genital mutilation. For that matter, 56 percent of Egyptian women also voiced approval for the hideous procedure, which is illegal but not unheard-of, in much of the world.\\n\\nEgyptian men also supplied 90 percent agreement with the statement that a man should have the final word about decisions in the home, and 58.5 percent of Egyptian women agreed. Only 31 percent of Egyptian men thought married women have the same rights to work outside their homes as men. 93 percent of men thought a husband should know where his wife is at all times. 96 percent thought a wife should agree to sex whenever her husband desires it.\\n\\n53.4 percent said there are times when a woman deserves to be beaten. 90 percent agreed that a woman should tolerate violence to keep the family together. Roughly 45 percent of Egyptian men said they had been violent to their wives.\\n\\nOnly 25.7 percent of male Egyptian respondents said that women should have the same freedom to access sites on the Internet as men.\\n\\nEgyptian women were significantly more supportive of women's rights on most of these questions, although one point of agreement concerned women at work. While women were over twice as likely as men to say that women should have the right to work, they largely agreed that it was more important for men to work when jobs were scarce and that marriage was more important for women than a career.\\n\\nInability to find work was a major source of shame, anxiety, and depression for men.\\n\\nThe survey noted that younger men and women, especially younger women, were more likely to support gender equality. Of the regions surveyed, Egypt scored lowest on the Gender Equitable Men scale, while Lebanon scored the highest.\\n\\nMorocco produced some alarming results about sexual harassment, with over half of men saying they have sexually harassed a woman, and over 60 percent of women reporting they have been harassed. A higher percentage of female Moroccans (78 percent) agreed that provocatively dressed women deserve harassment than men (72 percent).\\n\\nThe survey, which was conducted by UN Women and a non-profit organization called Promundo, involved 10,000 respondents in Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, and the Palestinian territories.\\n\\nMohammad Naciri, regional director of Arab States UN Women, looked for optimistic signs in the report. Amidst the stories of men's violence against women, we found stories of men's caregiving in the home. For every story of a man who compelled his daughter to marry against her will, there were stories of men who empowered their daughters, he said.\\n\\nThe patriarchy works for the very small minority who are on the top of that pyramid, lead researcher Shereen El Feki told the BBC. For the rest down below, lots of women, but also from the results of the survey, many, many men, life is very tough.\\n\\nPromundo CEO Gary Barker told Reuters that everywhere else we have done these research… young men typically have more progressive views that their fathers and the older generation.

{"original": "In a predictable return to the media mentality that was used to protect President Predator Clinton in the '90s, the corporate media are publishing one desperate hit piece after another to smear Joe Biden's sexual assault accuser, Tara Reade.\\n\\nThe media are not at all interested in the fact Reade has seven — seven! — pieces of corroborating evidence to back up her allegation Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 — which is seven more than Christine Blasey Serial Liar had.\\n\\nThe media are not at all interested that nine other women have accused Biden of sexual misconduct — including female Secret Service agents who claim Biden exposed himself to them.\\n\\nThe media are not at all interested in the fact Biden is engaging in a cover up of his Senate papers, the very papers where an eighth piece of corroboration might be found — the sexual harassment complaint Reade says she filed against Biden, the complaint that she says got her fired from his Senate office.\\n\\nAnd the fake news media are certainly not at all interested in the litany of #MeToo promises they made last year to ensure us the 1990s, that horrible era where the media relentlessly smeared all of Bill Clinton's victims, would never happened again. Because…\\n\\nHere we go again.\\n\\nAfter the New York Times' exoneration of Biden was debunked by a ton of corroborating evidence that was proved the Times had in fact not completed an exhaustive investigation; after the Associated Press's lies smearing Reade were debunked, and even after PBS made a chauvinist fool of itself trying to portray the fact it uncovered even more Biden victims as exoneration, the media are still at it. But now the media are so desperate to excuse Biden's accusers, they're interviewing Democrats to exonerate the Democrat Biden, and they're trashing Reade for — this is not a joke: not returning books and a few unpaid bills, for struggling with her rent and asking to borrow money.\\n\\nWorse, the media are not only interviewing Democrats, they are interviewing Joe Biden Democrats, his own peeps, the people who worked for him.\\n\\nAre you kidding me?\\n\\nThe far-left CNNLOL is the best example of this. If you read their extensive hit piece against Reade, the fake news outlet spoke to Stacey Lentz, who worked as a receptionist for then-Sen. Kent Conrad in the early '90s. But CNN doesn't tell you Conrad was a Democrat, a colleague of Biden's.\\n\\nCNN spoke to Ben Savage, who worked in Biden's office from 1993 to 1996[.]\\n\\nCNN spoke to Melissa Lefko, a staff assistant in Biden's office in the early 1990s[.]\\n\\nAnd here's my favorite part:\\n\\nIn recent interviews with CNN, 10 former Biden staffers who worked in Biden's Senate office at the same time as Reade said they were never aware of any issues related to sexual harassment, let alone sexual assault, involving their former boss. Biden never had even the hint of this kind of reputation, they said, in a town where it was well-known which male elected officials had such reputations.\\n\\nTen Biden peeps, y'all.\\n\\nWell, case closed.\\n\\nThe taxpayer-funded welfare queens at PBS did the same, talked to countless members of the Biden Posse, only PBS came up with even more instances of Biden's inappropriate behavior, but wrist-flicked those away as no big deal because Orange Man Bad.\\n\\nThe far-left Politico wants us to believe Reade is lying because a couple of people say she was a bad tenant.\\n\\n'Manipulative, deceitful, user': Tara Reade left a trail of aggrieved acquaintances, the Politico smear job reads.\\n\\nA number of those who crossed paths with Biden's accuser say they remember two things: She spoke favorably about her time working for Biden, and she left them feeling duped. The Politico sub-hed reads.\\n\\nPolitico opens with 11 paragraphs on Reade's dispute with a former landlord.\\n\\nPolitico then spends a half dozen paragraphs on Reade's apparent struggle for money. Did you know this monster tried to hide her car so it wouldn't be repossessed?\\n\\nBut that's not her worst sin. Get a load of this crack reporting…\\n\\nIn another instance, Reade came by the ranch desperately seeking $200 to pay the rent, [Lynne] Hummer said. On the way to Reade's house, Hummer said she didn't notice that Reade texted her and upped her request from $200 to $350.\\n\\nOMFG, Reade bumped her request for a personal loan from $200 to $350. How evil. But I have a question…\\n\\nIf Ms. Hummer was on her way to Reade's house, one can assume it was to loan Reade the money, but nowhere does Politico report whether Reade paid Hummer back or not, so I think it's safe to assume Reade did pay the loan back and Politico decided not to report that.\\n\\nThis is the one I can't quite get over:\\n\\nHummer also alleged Reade called a veterinarian to the ranch to service her personal horse, leaving Hummer to pay a $1,400 bill.\\n\\nIf Reade called the vet, only Reade can be held accountable for the bill. Don't tell me, I spent 17 years in boiler rooms collecting debts. What a ridiculous allegation.\\n\\nThen Politico reaches all the way back to 2008 to find another disgruntled landlord, who is offered 12 paragraphs to share his harrowing story about how Reade ruined his floors before he was forced to evict her.\\n\\nSomeone named Kelly Klett is given nine paragraphs to describe how Reade struggled to pay her rent and failed to return some books.\\n\\nYou don't need me to tell you what a pathetic hit job this all is — digging up a handful of people (who are probably Democrats) out of the whole life of a 56-year-old woman, a single mother fleeing from what sounds like a nightmare of an abusive marriage. There was certainly a restraining order involved.\\n\\nAs far as all this talk about Reade speaking in a positive way about Joe Biden, how many victims of Harvey Weinstein not only spoke highly of him but went back to work for him? Speaking highly of a powerful abuser is not the exception, it's the norm.\\n\\nBut as they dig into the whole life of a 56-year-old woman and come up with a handful of petty dust, what none of these media smear merchants dare reveal to their gullible readers is the seven pieces of corroboration Reade has, or the nine additional accusers Biden has.\\n\\nReade continues to behave like a woman with nothing to hide, while Biden hides his Senate papers and counts on the media to turn an unreturned book into conclusive proof his alleged victim is just another one of those crazed, lying, gold-digging harpies standing in the way of a powerful, old white man's rightful place in the world.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Doris Day, the honey-voiced singer and actress whose film dramas, musicals and innocent sex comedies made her a top star in the 1950s and '60s and among the most popular screen actresses in history, has died. She was 97.\\n\\nThe Doris Day Animal Foundation confirmed Day died early Monday at her Carmel Valley, California, home. The foundation said she was surrounded by close friends.\\n\\nDay had been in excellent physical health for her age, until recently contracting a serious case of pneumonia, resulting in her death, the foundation said in an emailed statement.\\n\\nWith her lilting contralto, wholesome blonde beauty and glowing smile, she was a top box office draw and recording artist known for such films as Pillow Talk and That Touch of Mink and for such songs as Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera) from the Alfred Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much.\\n\\nBut over time, she became more than a name above the title: Right down to her cheerful, alliterative stage name, she stood for a time of innocence and G-rated love, a parallel world to her contemporary Marilyn Monroe. The running joke, attributed to both Groucho Marx and actor-composer Oscar Levant, was that they had known Day before she was a virgin.\\n\\nDay herself was no Doris Day, by choice and by hard luck.\\n\\nIn Pillow Talk, released in 1959 and her first of three films with Rock Hudson, she proudly caught up with what she called the contemporary in me. Her 1976 tell-all book, Doris Day: Her Own Story, chronicled her money troubles and three failed marriages, contrasting with the happy publicity of her Hollywood career.\\n\\nI have the unfortunate reputation of being Miss Goody Two-Shoes, America's Virgin, and all that, so I'm afraid it's going to shock some people for me to say this, but I staunchly believe no two people should get married until they have lived together, she wrote.\\n\\nShe never won an Academy Award, but Day was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004, as George W. Bush declared it a good day for America when Doris Marianne von Kappelhoff of Evanston, Ohio decided to become an entertainer.\\n\\nIn recent years, she spent much of her time advocating for animal rights. Although mostly retired from show business since the 1980s, she still had enough of a following that a 2011 collection of previously unreleased songs, My Heart, hit the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The same year, she received a lifetime achievement honor from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Friends and supporters lobbied for years to get her an honorary Oscar.\\n\\nBorn to a music teacher and a housewife, she had dreamed of a dance career, but at age 12, she suffered a crippling accident: a car she was in was hit by a train and her leg was badly broken. Listening to the radio while recuperating, she began singing along with Ella Fitzgerald, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words.\\n\\nDay began singing in a Cincinnati radio station, then a local nightclub, then in New York. A bandleader changed her name to Day, after the song Day after Day, to fit it on a marquee.\\n\\nA marriage at 17 to trombonist Al Jorden ended when, she said, he beat her when she was eight months pregnant. She gave birth to her son, Terry, in early 1942. Her second marriage also was short-lived. She returned to Les Brown's band after the first marriage broke up.\\n\\nHer Hollywood career began after she sang at a Hollywood party in 1947. After early stardom as a band singer and a stint at Warner Bros., Day won the best notices of her career with Love Me or Leave Me, the story of songstress Ruth Etting and her gangster husband-manager. She initially balked at it, but the 1955 film became a box-office and critical success.\\n\\nShe followed with another impressive film, Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, starring her and James Stewart as an innocent couple ensnared in an international assassination plot. She sings Que Sera, Sera just as the story reaches its climax and viewers are beside themselves with suspense. The 1958 comedy Teacher's Pet paired her with an aging Clark Gable as an idealistic college journalism teacher and her student, an old-school newspaper editor.\\n\\nBut she found her greatest success in slick, stylish sex comedies, beginning with her Oscar-nominated role in Pillow Talk. She and Hudson were two New Yorkers who shared a telephone party line and initially hated each other.\\n\\nShe followed with The Thrill of It All, playing a housewife who gains fame as a TV pitchwoman to the chagrin of obstetrician husband James Garner. The nation's theater owners voted her the top moneymaking star in 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1964.\\n\\nHer first musical hit was the 1945 smash, Sentimental Journey, when she was barely in her 20s. Among the other songs she made famous were Everybody Loves a Lover, ″Secret Love, and It's Magic, a song from Romance on the High Seas, her first film.\\n\\nCritic Gary Giddins called her the coolest and sexiest female singer of slow-ballads in movie history.\\n\\nRomance on the High Seas had been designed for Judy Garland, then Betty Hutton. Both bowed out, and Day, recommended by songwriters Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne, won the role. Warner Bros. cashed in on its new star with a series of musicals, including My Dream Is Yours, ″Tea for Two and Lullaby of Broadway. Her dramas included Young Man with a Horn, with Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall, and Storm Warning, with Ronald Reagan and Ginger Rogers.\\n\\nHer last film was With Six You Get Eggroll, a 1968 comedy about a widow and a widower and the problems they have when blending their families.\\n\\nWith movies trending for more explicit sex, she turned to television to recoup her finances. The Doris Day Show was a moderate success in its 1966-1973 run on CBS.\\n\\nDisillusionment grew in the 1960s when she discovered that failed investments by her third husband, Martin Melcher, left her deeply in debt. She eventually won a multimillion-dollar judgment against their lawyer.\\n\\nShe had married Melcher, who worked in her agent's office, in 1951. He became her manager, and her son took his name. In most of the films following Pillow Talk, Melcher was listed as co-producer. Melcher died in 1969.\\n\\nIn her autobiography, Day recalled her son, Terry Melcher, telling her the $20 million she had earned had vanished and she owed around $450,000, mostly for taxes.\\n\\nIn 1974, Day won a $22.8 million judgment against Jerome B. Rosenthal, her lawyer and business manager, for mishandling of her and Melcher's assets.\\n\\nTerry Melcher, who died in 2004, became a songwriter and record producer, working with such stars as the Beach Boys. But he was also famous for an aspiring musician he turned down, Charles Manson. When Manson and his followers embarked on their murderous rampage in 1969, they headed for the house once owned by Melcher and instead came upon actress Sharon Tate and some visitors, all of whom were killed.\\n\\nDay married a fourth time at age 52, to businessman Barry Comden in 1976. She lived in Monterey, California, devoting much of her time to the Doris Day Animal Foundation."}

It's real.\\n\\nWelcome to Room 101, where you cannot leave until you believe the things the State demands you believe.\\n\\nBack in May, a video went viral of a white woman calling the police about a black birdwatcher, who did nothing illegal or menacing. He did nothing wrong, and she made an issue of his skin color, as Breitbart News reported.\\n\\nThe man merely asked the woman to put her dog on a leash. She responded by saying she would tell the police there's an African-American man threatening my life. Apparently, she thought using the term African-American made her racism okay. And, yes, of course she's a diehard Democrat.\\n\\nAccording to the Hill, she had originally been charged with filing a false police report, but — get this — the charge was dismissed after she finished an educational program that focused on racial biases.\\n\\nYep, the city sent her to racial reeducation camp. If that doesn't frighten you enough, read this:\\n\\nThe prosecution offered the program as an alternative restorative justice resolution designed to educate and promote community healing instead of a punishment. Cooper's therapist said the five sessions were a moving experience and her client learned a lot, Illuzzi-Orbon said.\\n\\nBefore I go any further, let me clear about a couple of things… First off, the black man in question clearly did nothing wrong. Secondly, this woman clearly used his skin color as a threat, which is an obvious and unacceptable act of racism. No question.\\n\\nWhat is also unacceptable, though, and not a little terrifying, is the government threatening you with criminal prosecution if you do not take classes that will teach you to think and believe in the way the government deems appropriate. That is flat-out blackmail and right out of 1984.\\n\\nThe woman already lost her job over the uproar, but she still should have been charged with filing a false police report, because that was her crime.\\n\\nNonetheless, it is not a crime, and should not be a crime, to be a racist. As ugly and evil as racism is, what you personally believe, what personal opinions you hold, are up to you. You have the right to be a racist asshole in this country, and the government should not be in the business of threatening people unless they agree to be trained to think a certain way.\\n\\nBecause most people revile racism, it is easy to say that when it comes to racism this is okay. But it's not.\\n\\nOnce that line jumps over racism, what's next? What will the government tell us is WrongThink next?\\n\\nWhat inappropriate beliefs will the government reeducate us on next?\\n\\nWill those of us who know Global Warming is a hoax be next? How about those of us opposed to same-sex marriage or who refuse to buy into the madness that a man can magically transform into a woman?\\n\\nThe sad truth is that those are not rhetorical questions. We all know that once the public is slow-boiled into believing racial reeducation camps are okay, we'll accept more.\\n\\nFifteen years ago, gay marriage was inconceivable. Look at what we've accepted since. The Supreme Court, by fiat, made gay marriage the law of the land. You can get blacklisted and become unemployable for opposing same-sex marriage or for refusing to believe a woman can magically transform into a man. And it's deemed appropriate to allow a mentally ill guy in a dress to share a locker room with your daughter.\\n\\nOh, and we're also allowing ourselves to be locked down and shoved in masks without much complaint or any real proof it makes any real difference.\\n\\nIt's terrifying the things so-called Americans tolerate.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

He destroyed my household when he started another.\\n\\nAlthough Israel outlawed polygamy decades ago, it's widespread in the impoverished Bedouin sector.\\n\\nIsrael is now trying to end the old custom, for the first time prosecuting suspected Bedouin polygamists. But many Bedouins, who complain of systematic neglect and discrimination by successive Israeli governments, see only a ploy to curb their population growth and criminalize their community members.\\n\\nThe Justice Ministry's director-general Emi Palmor, who spearheads the campaign, says she's determined to enforce the law but is trying to do so with input from the community. She said she has spent two years researching the issue and discussing solutions with Bedouin activists.\\n\\nThe Bedouin community is the only place in this country where polygamy is legitimate, out loud, exposed, and no one is ashamed, she said. It's a delicate issue, but it has to end.\\n\\nCritics of the campaign, including Bedouin women opposed to polygamy, mistrust the government's motives and the timing of the campaign. It's simple: polygamy means more Bedouin children, and that means more demographic concerns from a Zionist perspective, says human rights lawyer Rawia Aburabia.\\n\\nThe Bedouins, descendants of nomadic tribes, are part of Israel's Arab minority of 1.8 million, or about 20 percent of Israel's population. Some 240,000 live in the southern Negev Desert, many in makeshift encampments lacking electricity, sewage or running water.\\n\\nMost Bedouins fled or were forced out of what is now Israel during the 1948 War of Independence. Israel did not recognize their land claims, and many of those who remained live in unrecognized villages, deprived of basic services and vulnerable to government eviction orders and home demolitions, said community activist Yousef Abu Jafar.\\n\\nAround 20 to 30 percent of Bedouin men practice polygamy, according to government figures, with the rate climbing as high as 60 percent in some villages. Bedouin polygamy takes many forms, from several wives cohabitating under the same roof to men picking up and moving on to second wives without looking back.\\n\\nIslam permits a man to take up to four wives, but the practice varies greatly among different Muslim communities, often depending on education and income.\\n\\nAl-Faqira, 47, was married off by her family at age 16. After eight years and four children together, her husband left her, saying his family preferred he take a younger, wealthier wife. For the past decade, he has refused to see her or their children, now in their twenties, claiming they are no longer his business, she said.\\n\\nAl-Faqira said her children have fallen into drugs and street crime. She claimed that fierce competition with her husband's second wife has led to physical assaults on her family. Her husband's polygamy, she said, unleashed violence into my life.\\n\\nPolygamy has been linked to domestic violence, psychological disorders and deepening poverty. The custom has contributed to lowering Bedouin girls' average age of marriage to 18 and driving up their school dropout and unemployment rates to 85 percent and 80 percent, respectively, experts say.\\n\\nPalmor's committee, formed in 2016, seeks to crack down on the practice through expanded police enforcement alongside anti-polygamy education in Bedouin schools and funding for programs that boost women's employment.\\n\\nOver a dozen indictments have been issued, and in November, the first conviction for polygamy was handed down. The defense sought community service for the man, who took a second wife after his first fell ill. The prosecution is pressing for 18 months in prison. The sentence is expected soon.\\n\\nPalmor said these new efforts coincide with Israel's development plans for the Negev. We're starting to invest in southern Israel and we realized if we want to build industry and army bases and make the south grow, the progress must include the Bedouin, she said.\\n\\nIsrael approved an $800 million redevelopment project in 2017 as it moved two huge military bases into its vast southern desert. The project also pledges to provide the Bedouins with jobs, education and new infrastructure.\\n\\nBut many Bedouins say they have yet to see benefits, and claim promises of development only provide cover for efforts to uproot communities from their ancestral lands. For years, Israel has tried to resettle the Bedouins into recognized villages or custom-built cities.\\n\\nThe Bedouins have resisted these transfers, viewing them as land grabs that fly in the face of their traditions and clear the way for construction for Jews.\\n\\nWe're always hearing about billion dollar budgets but we only see more demolitions, more police, and more Jewish settlements, said Bedouin lawyer Khalil Alamour.\\n\\nShefa al-Sana, a Bedouin social worker who helps women affected by polygamous marriages, said that despite a common goal, she doesn't trust the government. She pulled out of Palmor's committee, worried its emphasis on law enforcement would further marginalize the Bedouins.\\n\\nPolygamy is not a random crime. It's a problem of ego and ignorance, men who have been stripped of their land needing women to treat as property, she said.\\n\\nCompounding suspicions has been the inclusion of Regavim, a pro-settler group invited to present research to Palmor's committee. It has framed the fight against polygamy as a way of stemming the expansion of Bedouin villages.\\n\\nPalmor dismissed accusations that her plan is politically motivated, pointing to support she has garnered from some Bedouins, most notably the human rights attorney Insaf Abu-Shareb.\\n\\nAbu-Shareb has remained in Palmor's committee, despite a backlash of Bedouins accusing her of betraying her community.\\n\\nWe've been waiting for 70 years, and the longer the government does nothing, the harder polygamy becomes to change, she said. If I want the situation of Bedouin women to improve, I need to work with them."}

In 2016, she resigned from a leadership position on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to support Sen.

{"original": "U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue is committing his agency to religious freedom following President Donald Trump's executive order last week to vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.\\n\\nA policy statement released by Perdue this week states:\\n\\nToday, I want to reestablish this Department's commitment to safeguarding every American's First Amendment rights, particularly the right to free speech and the right to free religious exercise. USDA is committed to protecting both. I expect each and every USDA employee to uphold their fellow Americans' First Amendment freedoms. Whether we are inspecting private businesses for compliance with food safety laws or protecting our public lands for recreation, cultivation, and preservation, we must set the example of our Nation's highest ideals. Doing so is not optional, and it is not discretionary: It is one of the crucial reasons why we exist.\\n\\nFreedom of expression flourishes in a climate of mutual respect and tolerance, Perdue added.\\n\\nFamily Research Council (FRC) president Tony Perkins and his staff say Perdue is doing his part to ensure a new day for religious freedom.\\n\\nFor Christians, who've lived under the anti-faith cloud of Obama, it's encouraging to see Secretary Perdue move so quickly to communicate that the USDA is under new management, FRC explains, noting the case of Don Vander Boon, a Christian and private owner of the West Michigan Beef Company, who was threatened two years ago with a shut-down of his business by USDA inspectors because his break room contained an article promoting traditional marriage mixed in with others about the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage decision (see video below).\\n\\nVander Boon said USDA inspectors – who worked daily in his meat-packing facility – removed the article about traditional marriage and confronted him with it in his office, threatening to pull out of his facility, a situation that would immediately cause his business to shut down.\\n\\nThe case is still awaiting resolution, but FRC states Perdue's newly released statement will lead to unequivocal actions to protect and preserve religious freedom.\\n\\nFRC's Perkins – who referred to Trump's executive order as a significant first step to defending religious liberty – is also hoping Perdue's statement will serve as encouragement to other conservatives and constitutionalists who are apprehensive about the order, given the situation that a more robust draft of the order was first leaked to leftwing media in February.\\n\\nThe Nation reported the February draft would have create[d] wholesale exemptions for people and organizations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.\\n\\nAlliance Defending Freedom (ADF) – which has represented the Vander Boon family – expressed concern about how much Trump's final executive order would actually accomplish.\\n\\nFirst, no specific relief is offered to families like the Vander Boons in Michigan, who were threatened with the effective closure of their family-run business for simply expressing a religious point of view on marriage that differed from that of the federal government, ADF senior counsel Gregory Baylor originally noted in a statement reported by Christian News.\\n\\nOn Thursday, however, ADF senior counsel Jeremy Tedesco said in a statement, Alliance Defending Freedom is encouraged that Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has issued a policy statement declaring his commitment to protect 'the right to free speech and the right to free religious exercise' for Americans who interact with the USDA.\\n\\nADF continues:\\n\\nWe are hopeful that this commitment will translate into immediate relief for our clients, Donald and Ellen Vander Boon, who are facing ongoing censorship of their religious speech at the hands of USDA officials. It is a grave injustice when the government forces Americans like the Vander Boons to choose between running a business and expressing their religious beliefs. Secretary Perdue can act now to correct this injustice for the Vander Boons and Americans like them who work with the USDA, and we hope that he will.\\n\\nFRC notes that it is at the cabinet level that Trump's executive order will have its greatest impact.\\n\\nFor example, the order authorizes Attorney General Jeff Sessions to issue guidance on federal religious liberty law for all federal agencies. Religious freedom has been seen as a priority for the Sessions-led Department of Justice.\\n\\nSimilarly, Trump has appointed freedom of conscience and religious liberty defender Roger Severino to head the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\\n\\nLGBT rights advocates condemned Severino's appointment.\\n\\nI could not think of a more dangerous person to head up the Office of Civil Rights at HHS, JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Human Rights Campaign said, according to Yahoo. Once again, Donald Trump is declaring war against our community by appointing anti-LGBTQ people at all levels of his administration.\\n\\nAdditionally, Trump appointed pro-life advocate Dr. Charmaine Yoest to be assistant secretary of public affairs for HHS.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood – the nation's largest abortion vendor – criticized that appointment:\\n\\nSomeone with history of promoting #AlternativeFacts shouldn't be in an @HHSGov position that informs the public. https://t.co/ypPlHQ2ywG — Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) April 28, 2017\\n\\nWriting at the New York Times last week, Emily Bazelon said HHS is getting an anti-abortion makeover.\\n\\nThe department is headed by a strongly anti-abortion former congressman, Tom Price, she continued. Charmaine Yoest, former head of Americans United for Life, the intellectual powerhouse of the anti-abortion movement, is an assistant secretary and Teresa Manning, a former lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, is in line to be a deputy assistant secretary.\\n\\nOf course, the majority of Americans don't think that protecting the First Amendment is even close to outrageous — but the fact that liberals do proves why this order is necessary! explains FRC. We couldn't be happier that Secretary Perdue took the president's words to heart and set to work righting the wrongs done to businesses like the Vander Boon's."}
{"original": "China's state-run Global Times reported Tuesday that Shanghai is exploring a pilot program in which the government helps women who wish to have children but are not in a position to have them to freeze their eggs for future use.\\n\\nThe proposal follows years of panic at the highest levels of the Communist Party over China's declining birth rate, which has continued to plummet despite dictator Xi Jinping easing the repressive one-child policy that governed Chinese families in 2015. The Mao-era one-child policy made it illegal for a woman to have more than one child, resulting in mass forced abortions, sterilizations, and infanticides.\\n\\nThe Chinese Communist Party has boasted the anti-childbirth policy prevented 400 million births, a toll that includes both abortions and killings of infants. A significant percentage of those whose lives were prevented were girls, resulting in a devastating sex imbalance in the Chinese population that has contributed to the decline in the birth rate.\\n\\nThe Global Times described the proposed egg freezing program as a particular help for women who have undergone treatment for cancer, which often leads to infertility. The plan is reportedly the brainchild of attorney Qin Suo, a professional woman who gave birth at an advanced maternal age. The propaganda newspaper identified Qin as a local government official in addition to her day job as a lawyer.\\n\\nThree political advisors in Shanghai proposed to set up a public frozen egg bank in a pilot exploration scheme to help women in need, especially cancer patients who might lose fertility after receiving medical treatment, the Times narrated. [T] he political advisors suggested setting up a public egg bank and carrying out centralized management on frozen eggs to raise efficiency.\\n\\nThe outlet quoted Qin as stating that the United States considers freezing women's eggs a standard medical service and that China has much to gain from following that example. Among the hurdles the program would face is the fact that the Communist Party in Shanghai strictly regulates who has access to egg-freezing, limiting the list to couples with a history of infertility and cancer patients who expect to preserve their fertility before undergoing surgery or chemotherapy. Most preservation of eggs is not freezing in China, however, which means most expire after five years, the newspaper noted.\\n\\nChinese state media have been advocating for the Communist Party to implement programs that not just repeal limitations on having children, but actively incentivize couples to do so given the dire state of the country's birth rate. The latest available data show that 14.65 million babies were born in China in 2019, a record-low in this century and a number last documented in China in 1961, at the height of Mao-era persecution and poverty. A scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Yi Fuxian, called that number seriously overestimated and claimed the true number of births that year was closer to 10 million.\\n\\nA growing population is necessary for a healthy economy, given that older citizens retire or otherwise exit the workforce, leaving vacancies that need to be filled. Experts expect that the 2020 birth rate will be significantly lower than 2019's given the extreme coronavirus lockdowns that China implemented nationwide and the crisis status of many of its hospitals, in which overcrowding could result in an increase in infant or maternal mortality.\\n\\nChinese experts believe that the nation's population will begin to decline in 2028.\\n\\nChina Daily, another state-run propaganda newspaper, warned in December that simply allowing a couple to have a second child does not mean they will have one, as the costs of raising children, escalating housing prices and mounting career pressures on women dampen couples' desire to have more children.\\n\\nThe development will have wide social and economic implications. For instance, if the country's labor productivity has not reached a certain level, the decrease in working-age population means the decline of national wealth, China Daily noted. On the other hand, the increase in the elderly population will raise the burden on the economy and society. In fact, some provinces are already struggling to meet the pension demands.\\n\\nThe Chinese Communist Party, it urged, must help improve people's livelihoods to encourage expanding families.\\n\\nThe Global Times this week highlighted, in a bizarrely positive fashion given the general disposition of the Party on the topic, the revelation by two Chinese celebrities that they had secretly had a baby together out of wedlock.\\n\\nSome netizens supported the celebrities' choice, saying that raising children should not be automatically tied to marriage, the Times noted, referring to online users of Chinese social media.

{"original": "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg landed a TIME magazine cover — and a glowing review.\\n\\nAn inspirational headline overlaid a picture of Buttigieg and husband Chasten: First Family — The unlikely, untested and unprecedented campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, it read. And, after recounting a time when Buttigieg was harassed by a man wearing a devil costume, the writer asserted that some Americans might see the 2020 Presidential candidate as someone who might just be the man to vanquish America's demons. It continues:\\n\\nButtigieg is a gay Episcopalian veteran in a party torn between identity politics and heartland appeals. He's also a fresh face in a year when millennials are poised to become the largest eligible voting bloc. Many Democrats are hungry for generational change, and the two front-runners are more than twice his age.\\n\\nButtigieg is gaining perception as a young, progressive, charismatic answer to Trump, and it is a reputation with which he seems very comfortable. If the substance of your ideas is progressive, but there's mistrust about them among conservatives, you have three choices, he told the magazine:\\n\\nOne is to just change your ideas and make them more conservative. The second is to sort of be sneaky and try to make it seem like your ideas are more conservative than they are. And the third, the approach that I favor, is to stick to your ideas, but explain why conservatives shouldn't be afraid of them.\\n\\nAnd neither TIME nor Buttigieg himself were shy about making a direct comparison:\\n\\nIn many ways, Buttigieg is Trump's polar opposite: younger, dorkier, shorter, calmer and married to a man. His success may depend on whether Democrats want a fighter to match Trump, or whether Americans want to 'change the channel,' as Buttigieg puts it. 'People already have a leader who screams and yells,' he says. 'How do you think that's working out for us?'\\n\\nThe 4,100-word piece dives into Buttigieg's childhood, military service, and marriage. He is fighting an almost unprecedented battle against other major Democrat contenders for the Oval Office. Suffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos told Fox Buttigieg leads Biden, Sanders, and every other Democrat among LGBTQ households — an important demographic for grassroots support and a network of generous and loyal donors.\\n\\nWith former vice president Joe Biden as the clear front runner according to recent polls, it remains unclear whether Buttigieg has the ability to mount a real challenge for the nomination, and displace his chief rival: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

It scared me.\\n\\nErnst said she began a downward spiral of sleep and weight loss after discovering email exchanges between her husband and another woman last summer. I rapidly lost 17 pounds about 13 percent of my body weight. My staff had to cancel two days of my appointments because I couldn't function, the lawmaker wrote.\\n\\nErnst also said she turned down President Donald Trump after interviewing to be his running mate.\\n\\nThen-President-elect Trump interviewed Ernst at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in July 2016, as he was considering potential running mates. Ernst told reporters later that she made clear she was interested in continuing to serve Iowa in the Senate, to which she was elected in 2014 after serving as a state senator and county official. The president eventually chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) as his running mate.\\n\\nErnst called her withdrawal from consideration a sacrifice for the good of the relationship with her husband, a retired Army Airborne Ranger whom she said was not supportive of her fast-rising political career.\\n\\nI continued to make sacrifices and not soar higher out of concern for Gail and our family, Ernst said. Meanwhile, he hated any successes I had, and would belittle me and get angary [sic] any time I achieved a goal.\\n\\nGail not only denied the allegations, but shot back one of his own. Joni had a sexual affair with one of her own soldiers while deployed from '03-'04. I caught her secretly emailing him from our home after the deployment, he said. Further, Gail accused the senator of very bizarre behavior after he asked for a divorce, which included sending emails from his account under his name.\\n\\nThe senator publicly addressed the allegations while speaking at a town hall in Cedar Falls, Iowa, on Wednesday,\\n\\nI am a survivor, she told attendees. What I want people to understand is that I am the same person as I was last week. You just know more about what's inside of me now.\\n\\nIn recent days, the 48-year-old said she will seek re-election for her seat in 2020.\\n\\nI'm seeking re-election. I'm going to do it as a single woman, Ernst said. People know my situation now. What I can do is be honest about what happened. And I can move forward. The problem is now I've been outed when I was not ready to talk about it. But now maybe it forces me to talk about it.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "The rising rates of suicides, drug overdoses, and other Deaths of Despair can spread from blue-collar white Americans to the broader group of poor Americans who hold low wage college degrees, says Angus Deaton, one of two professors who detected the post-2000 epidemic.\\n\\nIncreasingly, people with a B.A. [degree] are being threatened by these things too, Angus Deaton said in a May 4 interview by the Economic Policy Institute.\\n\\nCapitalism is working for the educated elite, and it's just not working for anyone else, and the [civic] danger is that the educated elite is going to get smaller and smaller, and eliter and eliter, Deaton told the EPI. He continued:\\n\\nI thought [white working-class voters] did rebel by electing Donald Trump, I mean it's in some sense they were a lot of people … they're the people who have been done very badly over a long period of time. They don't seem to be well represented … The Democratic Party seems to have abandoned working-class people, and you know it's a form of an alliance between the educated elite and the [non-white] minorities … So we do need a political realignment, I think, which gets a real voice for working-class people again.\\n\\nSince 2000, roughly 600,000 blue-collar white Americans have died as their traditional workplaces have shut down and their traditional civic supports– marriage, sports clubs, churches — have shriveled amid the loss of good jobs, said Deaton's co-author, Anne Case.\\n\\nThe 600,000 blue-collars died from opioids, fentanyl, alcoholism, suicide, and other Deaths of Despair, while the death rates for college graduates remained flat, she said.\\n\\nThe death toll was smaller than the much-publicized 675,000 dead from AIDS from the 1980s, Princeton economics professors Deaton and Case write in their new book, Deaths of Despair. The toll, they write, is the equivalent of three full 737 MAXs falling out of the sky every day [for three years], with no survivors.\\n\\nWe think that the long term labor market decline for less-educated workers has a lot to do with this story, Case told EPI:\\n\\nYou need to go back all the way to the 1970s. We don't think necessarily the [decline in] material welfare is the direct cause [of the deaths], but [it is the] lack of a stable job, a good job. It brings a loss of community, of marriage. of meaning and status in life, and we think it is those effects that … help us to better understand why these [economic changes] might lead to long term deaths from these causes.\\n\\nAmid rising migration alongside the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to China, Former President Barack Obama largely ignored the rising blue-collar death toll, according to a March 2019 report by the Washington Post, titled The Fentanyl Failure. The report concluded:\\n\\nThe fentanyl crisis represents an extraordinary public health challenge — and requires an extraordinary public health response, the experts wrote [in March 2016] to six administration officials, including the nation's drug czar and the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The administration considered the request but did not act on it. The decision was one in a series of missed opportunities, oversights and half-measures by federal officials who failed to grasp how quickly fentanyl was creating another — and far more fatal — wave of the opioid epidemic. … On Jan. 11, 2017, in the waning days of the administration, Obama delivered his annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. Four years after the epidemic began in Rhode Island, the White House called fentanyl a national crisis.\\n\\nSince 2017, Trump has accelerated efforts to curb the fentanyl epidemic, and he has reduced the inflow of blue-collar illegal immigrants. The efforts have helped push up wages and employment for blue-collar Americans, and also to push down the drug deaths and to slow the suicide rates.\\n\\nBut Trump has not been able to boost salaries for lower-skilled college graduates, even before the coronavirus crash.\\n\\nA February report by the EPI showed that roughly 50 percent of college graduates have seen their wages remain flat since 2000. The average wage paid to graduates is up by just 8.8 percent, and the top 10 percent of graduates have seen their wages climb by only 15.1 percent since 2000.\\n\\nWe're now seeing that wage stagnation and inequality trends are even impacting people with a bachelor degree, said Thea Lee, EPI's president told Case and Deaton. Increasingly, recent college graduates are taking jobs that do not require a bachelor's degree, and we also see when we look at the 10-year forecast from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that much of the new job creation doesn't actually require a B.A.\\n\\nSalary levels for college graduates have been held down by a flood of roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa workers, including the approximately 900,000 H-1B workers who are resident in the United States.\\n\\nPolitical pressure from native-born Americans and many legal immigrants is pushing President Donald Trump to gradually reduce the inflow of legal immigrants, even after he has successfully blocked large-scale illegal migration from Mexico. On April 22, Trump announced curbs on legal immigration and directed his agency chiefs to draw up plans for cutbacks to the visa worker programs by late May.\\n\\nBut many Fortune 500 companies and investors strongly back Congress's policy of inflating the labor supply with migrants and visa workers. To block Trump, they have now launched a hard-nosed lobbying campaign and a soft-focus P.R. campaign in cooperation with various allies, including left-wing groups and former President George W. Bush. The campaign is also supported by Mike Bloomberg and by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\\n\\nFor example, Bloomberg's media company uses the H-1B program to import many immigrant software experts and journalists. This inflow helps Bloomberg to minimize the payroll he offers to American graduates and journalists.\\n\\nMany American graduates say the vast foreign worker population blocks young Americans from getting starter jobs at Fortune 500 companies, reduces salaries for millions of U.S. graduates, and degrades Americans' professional careers into a series of unstable monthly gig contracts.\\n\\nThe supply of subsidized foreign white-collar labor also allows business school executives to degrade the workplace authority and free speech of innovative American professionals, to subordinate the development and reliability of technology to the priorities of foreign workers and also to subordinate technological quality to the demands for quarterly profits by U.S. and Indian CEOs and investors.\\n\\nThe coronavirus crash is helping to widen the growing gap between the Internet-using elites and the Americans who must work in shared spaces, Deaton said.\\n\\nThis educated elite like us, you know — we can sit at home and look into our Zoom screens all day, sheltered safely. We're probably more productive than we've ever been. And we get paid. So the coronavirus] is certainly widening this gap between the people who were subject to deaths with despair [and] it's not a white [only] problem here. I mean this is a problem for all working people.\\n\\nEPI report shows how the Labor Dept. acts as a labor broker for 53,000 companies who import cheaper contract-worker graduates via the H-1B program.\\n\\nThe losers are US grads & families who see their salaries & careers converted into big Wall St gains#H1Bhttps://t.co/G2ivYxUcSs — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) May 5, 2020\\n\\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC, or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart.com."}

During the introductory portion of the town hall, Jill Biden elaborated on the precautions her own family was taking.\\n\\nWe have three children, and we have six grandchildren, the former second lady said, with her husband adding their grandchildren ranged from seniors in law school to little infants.\\n\\nThe number, though, is inaccurate. The Bidens, in fact, have seven grandchildren in total. Two are from their late-son Beau's marriage to Hallie Olivere, while five are from their son Hunter's various relationships. The latter's youngest offspring are likely the little infants, Joe Biden invoked during the town hall.\\n\\nThe fifth of Hunter's children, a boy, was born on March 28 to Melissa Cohen, a South African filmmaker. The couple, who reside in a $12,000-per-month rental in the Hollywood hills, wed in May 2019 after knowing each other for less than a week.\\n\\nHunter, whose work in Ukraine was central to the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, also has a 18-month-old child with Lunden Roberts, an Arkansas native and one-time stripper. The child's existence was revealed last year when Roberts filed a paternity suit against Hunter in Arkansas civil court. The lawsuit, which came around the same time as Hunter's marriage to Cohen, quickly made headlines after it emerged that Roberts had gotten to know the younger Biden while working at a Washington, D.C.-based gentleman's club.\\n\\nAlthough he initially denied paternity, a DNA test proved that Hunter was the child's father. After that major revelation, the lawsuit was settled, with Hunter agreeing to pay a monthly undisclosed amount for child support, as well as providing healthcare for the baby.\\n\\nIt is unclear exactly which of these two children Jill Biden seems to have overlooked on Sunday. It is not, however, the first time one of the Bidens has failed recognize all of Hunter's offspring. Last year, when Hunter's lovechild with Roberts was first confirmed via DNA, the former vice president refused to discuss the child, choosing instead to mock a reporter for broaching the topic.\\n\\nSince then, neither Joe Biden or his wife have commented on or acknowledged Roberts and the child. This was exhibited as most recently as March 27—one day before Hunter's child with Cohen was born—when the former vice president took part in a CNN town hall on the Coronavirus.\\n\\nEvery single day I speak to all five of my grandkids, Biden told CNN's Anderson Cooper when discussing how he, himself, was dealing the national quarantine.

{"original": "Veteran Hollywood film director Woody Allen says he should be a poster boy for #MeToo, given his decades of experience in the film industry, and praised the anti-sexual harassment movement.\\n\\nI'm a big advocate of the #MeToo movement, Allen said during an interview with Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos on Monday. I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it's a good thing that they're exposing them. But you know, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years.\\n\\nI've worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all, Allen continued. I've always had a wonderful record with them.\\n\\nThe Manhattan director was recently the subject of a decades-old sexual assault allegation by his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow, who accused him of molestation when she was seven years old. Allen has vehemently denied the allegations, while also receiving backing from his other adopted child Moses Farrow.\\n\\nThe 82-year-old filmmaker has also long-been subject to criticism over his marriage to his 47-year-old step-daughter Soon-Yi Previn, who was adopted by Farrow during her first marriage to actress Mia Farrow.\\n\\nHowever, Allen maintains that he is bothered by being linked to disgraced Hollywood figures like Harvey Weinstein and the many industry elites accused of sexual misconduct.\\n\\nI think in any situation where anyone is accused of something unjustly, this is a sad thing, Allen said. I think everybody would agree with that… Everyone wants justice to be done. If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that's a good thing.\\n\\nWhat bothers me is that I get linked in with them.

When I began to realize what it meant that I felt the way I did about people I saw in the hallway at school or the dining hall at college, I launched in me something I can only describe as a kind of war. And if that war had been settled on the terms that I wished for when I was 15 or 20 or frankly even 25, I would not be standing here. If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would have swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water. It's a hard thing to think about now. It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life if you showed me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife. The reason it's so awful to think about isn't just the knowledge that so many young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality or gender identity do just that, they harm themselves figuratively or literally. But the real reason it's so hard to think about is if I had had a chance to do that, I wouldn't have found my way to Chasten. The best thing in my life, my marriage, might not have happened at all. My marriage the thing I can't even talk about without going into cliches like talking about how my world went from black and white to color the moment we held hands near the end of our first date.\\n\\nHe continued, How dark the thought that the man that I admire and care about and love sharing with the rest of the country and more importantly share one day with raising children might not have been part of my life at all. Thank God there was no pill, thank God there was no knife. People talk about marriage equality as a moral issue. And it certainly is a moral issue as far as I'm concerned, it's a moral issuei because being married to Chasten has made me a better human being. It has made me more compassionate, more understanding, more self-aware and more decent. My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God.\\n\\nHe added, Speaking only for myself, I can tell you that if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade.

{"original": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — As a baseball-crazed kid growing up in Miami, Danny Valencia dreamed of playing in the Major Leagues. The thought of heading to the Olympics, for a foreign country no less, never crossed his mind.\\n\\nBut after nine years and nearly 100 homers in the big leagues, that's the next surreal step for the 35-year-old Valencia, who recently became an Israeli citizen thanks to his Jewishness and is now the star player in Team Israel's improbable run to the Tokyo Games. Baseball is returning to the Olympics after being dropped for 2012 and 2016 and Israel is one of six teams vying for the three medals.\\n\\nIt's pretty cool to be playing in the Olympics, he told The Associated Press at a team event in Tel Aviv. For it to come about the way it did, especially for my mother who is a practicing Jew and very pro-Israel, it just meant a lot to her. So, to do this, especially at the end of my career, it is like the icing on the cake. \\n\\nIt's even more of a dream fulfilled for the small baseball community in Israel, comprised mostly of American immigrants, and which has languished for decades in the country's sporting wilderness. Israel has zero tradition of the American pastime, which is largely derided by locals as an arcane and boring sport.\\n\\nIn Israel, soccer and basketball reign supreme while baseball, long popular among American Jews, has failed to catch on with the rough-and-tumble native-born Israelis who have taken more of a liking to the strategy and hard hitting of American football.\\n\\nOnly about 1,000 kids play baseball in Israel and there is just one regulation baseball field in the country. In 2007, a group of American supporters launched the Israel Baseball League, a semi-professional league comprised almost entirely of foreign players that generated little interest and folded after just one season.\\n\\nBut thanks to a creative outreach campaign to Jewish-American pros, Israel's national team has surged to unthinkable heights.\\n\\nIt started when Israel fielded a qualifying team for the 2013 World Baseball Classic that was skippered by future Detroit Tigers manager Brad Ausmus and included former all-star Shawn Green. In 2017, Israel made the showcase tournament, upsetting South Korea and Taiwan en route to a surprising 6th-place finish.\\n\\nBut even that paled in comparison to the sensation of knocking off the top three European teams before routing South Africa 11-1 in September to earn the Europe/Africa Olympic berth and becoming the first team to qualify after host Japan. Mexico and South Korea, which won the Olympic gold in 2008, have since also qualified with the final two openings to be decided in the coming months.\\n\\nIt's an achievement that Gili Lustig, the executive director of the Israel Olympic Committee, said was nothing short of unbelievable. Extolling praise this week in Hebrew upon the team — nearly none of whose members understood the language — he expressed hope that their Olympic odyssey would finally give the sport its long-awaited boost in Israel.\\n\\nWhat's important is to leverage your participation to grow baseball in Israel, he said. I have no doubt you will represent us well.\\n\\nLustig noted that the 24-member group will represent the first time Israel is sending a team sport to the Olympics since 1976, when it sent a soccer team, and will make the Israeli delegation to Tokyo the country's largest ever.\\n\\nBaseball is one of five sports that were added to the 2020 Summer Olympics. It won't be back in Paris in 2024 but seems likely to return once again for Los Angeles 2028.\\n\\nUnlike the World Baseball Classic, whose heritage rule allowed countries to field players who were merely eligible for citizenship, the Olympics requires its participants to be full-fledged citizens of the countries they represent. Israel grants citizenship to anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent and in recent months the players have been going through the process, providing marriage certificates, letters from rabbis and other proof of their Judaism. Five of the players have Major League experience and others who find themselves outside opening day rosters may join later before the games kick off in July.\\n\\nAmong the former major leaguers on the team are Jon Moscot, Ty Kelly and Josh Zeid.\\n\\nOnce in Israel, they've faced an even greater challenge in drawing interest among a skeptical audience that couldn't tell the difference between a strikeout and a stolen base. Even Israeli President Reuven Rivlin offered his greetings with a caveat while meeting the team during their current week-long promotional visit to the Holy Land.\\n\\nIt's not a secret that I prefer soccer, but you can't ignore your exciting achievement, he told them at his Jerusalem residence.\\n\\nTeam Israel head coach Eric Holtz, himself an American Jew who plans to apply for citizenship, said he is aiming to double the number of local players in Israel within two years of the Olympics. He said his primary mission was to instill our love and passion to the five and six-year-old kids throughout this country and show them what a great game this is.\\n\\nAs for the Olympic Games themselves, he noted that Israel would be an underdog, as usual, but still had a theoretical 50% chance of winning a medal.\\n\\nNobody gave us a shot … and we shocked the world, Holtz said of the qualifying process. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity and we as a team couldn't be prouder to represent Israel.\\n\\n____"}

Sanchez, of course, is the now-estranged brother of Lauren Sanchez, who was, and perhaps still is, Bezos' marriage-busting beloved.\\n\\nAnd so last month, it seemed like a simple enough case closed: Michael Sanchez had gotten his mitts on his sister's cell phone and had sold the titillating material to the Enquirer.\\n\\nYet now De Becker is going much further in his claims. He has evidence, he writes, that the Enquirer knew of the existence of naughty words and pictures before the tabloid got wind of them from Michael Sanchez.\\n\\nAnd how would that be? How would the Enquirer gain such omniscience? As De Becker puts it, The initial information came from other channels—another source or method. And at least one of those other channels, he explains, was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which had somehow hacked Bezos' phone:\\n\\nOur investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos' phone, and gained private information.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia and Bezos have not been on good terms since at least last October, when Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. And as De Becker mentions, Amazon has a large presence in Saudi Arabia, through a subsidiary, Souq.com. So who knows all the possible angles here—after all, not everyone loves Amazon.\\n\\nIn any case, Bezos seems no longer satisfied with pinning the blame on Michael Sanchez; he's now looking to pin bigger targets, including—but not limited to—the Saudi government, the White House, and American Media International (AMI), the parent company of the Enquirer. As De Becker notes:\\n\\nThe inquiry included a broad array of resources: investigative interviews with current and former AMI executives and sources, extensive discussions with top Middle East experts in the intelligence community, leading cybersecurity experts who have tracked Saudi spyware, discussions with current and former advisers to President Trump, Saudi whistleblowers, people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\\n\\nTo put it mildly, all this dot-connecting—true or not, provable or not—is expensive. But then, as De Becker wrote:\\n\\nBezos directed me to spend whatever is needed to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it.\\n\\nAgain, when someone worth $146 billion gives you a blank check, you can do a lot of digging.\\n\\nSo now De Becker continues, My results have been turned over to federal officials. And which federal officials would those be? The Justice Department? The Congress? Both?\\n\\nDe Becker doesn't provide any details, and yet he declares, I intend today's writing to be my last public statement on the matter—although, of course, he could always change his mind. Moreover, Bezos has access to plenty of other investigators, communicators, and litigators, who can help him get his points across. And oh yes, he also owns a well-known newspaper.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that on April 1, the Enquirer denied that any third party (or third country) was involved; according to the tabloid, the leak was all the doing of Michael Sanchez.\\n\\nSo now it will be interesting to see which, if any, federal officials acknowledge that they have been in receipt of De Becker's dossier, and what, if anything, they plan to do with it.\\n\\nYet Virgil is sure we'll be hearing a lot more about this case; one way or another, Team Bezos will make sure of that. Indeed, when it's all over, the original issue—those saucy sexchanges between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez—might be layered over in the public mind with all the new information and allegations that De Becker might have stirred up.\\n\\nAs a result, it seems evident that many people are now happy thinking about some far-flung conspiracy involving big shots in the White House and Riyadh, featuring sidebars in Los Angeles (home of Lauren Sanchez and Michael Sanchez) and New York City (home to AMI). Indeed, just on April 2, one of Bezos' employees, Fred Ryan, publisher of the Post, wrote a tough op-ed for his newspaper headlined, It's been six months since Jamal Khashoggi's murder, and Trump has done nothing—the point being that the Bezos Post is still harping on the connection between the Saudis and Trump. And that's a clear signal—go get 'em!—to investigative reporters, both at the Post and everywhere else.\\n\\nSo it's not hard to envision that the whole skein of events, from Washington to Riyadh to wherever else, could well be remembered as some fantastic tale, like something that Ian Fleming might have written for his character James Bond."}

The students argue that it is unconstitutional for the university to reject their request for student funds on the basis of King's pro-life views.\\n\\nAccording to a report by The College Fix, an act of viewpoint discrimination by Georgia Tech's student government has posed a substantial barrier to an attempt by a group of pro-life students to host Dr. Alveda King on campus.\\n\\nWhen members of the Georgia Tech student government denied the request to fund the event with Dr. King, they admitted that their decision was motivated by their partisan biases. My concern is that if we support this bill, we're supporting a speaker that's said such hateful, dangerous rhetoric, one student government member said, citing concerns about King's opposition to same-sex marriage.\\n\\nIn the lawsuit, the students argue that it is unconstitutional for a public university to refuse to approve a request to use student activity fees on a political basis. The students argue that such funds must be distributed in a viewpoint neutral manner.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court made it clear twenty years ago that if public universities wish to force students to pay student activity fees, then those universities have an affirmative duty to ensure that the funds are distributed in a viewpoint neutral manner—not by a simple majority vote. But the officials at Georgia Tech have done the opposite. They force students to fund other students' expression through the student activity fee, but students may only access those funds through a system that permits, and in some cases demands, viewpoint discrimination.\\n\\nThe Georgia Tech student government regularly appropriates funds for Democratic causes. This year, ir approved a $5,000 fund request for a campus event featuring Democrat Andrew Gillum and $2,760 for a student trip to a Democratic Socialism conference.\\n\\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story."}

{"original": "Two Virginia Bishops have issued a statement condemning Tuesday's pro-infanticide vote by self-declared Catholic senator Tim Kaine.\\n\\nWe are deeply dismayed and astounded that the U.S. Senate has failed to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, reads the joint statement by Arlington Bishop Michael F. Burbidge and Richmond Bishop Barry C. Knestout.\\n\\nRequiring health care practitioners to give the same degree of care to babies surviving abortions as they do to other newborns is a matter of common sense and basic human decency, the bishops said.\\n\\nThe bishops go on to say they are dismayed and outraged that Virginia's two U.S. Senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, voted against this critical lifesaving legislation.\\n\\nMark Warner is a Presbyterian, so he is technically outside of the Catholic bishops' fold, whereas Tim Kaine regularly flaunts his Catholic credentials.\\n\\nAll of the 44 senators who voted against the bill were Democrats and seven of them call themselves Catholics, namely: Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ).\\n\\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Kaine, vice-presidential running mate to Hillary Clinton, repeatedly spoke about his Jesuit high school education, his year as a missionary in Honduras, and his personal faith journey as a Catholic that led him to pursue a career in public service.\\n\\nThe U.S. Catholic bishops, who generally strive to stay away from criticizing politicians, especially in an election year, were unusually vocal in their criticism of Tim Kaine's claims to being a faithful Catholic, citing his open dissent from essential moral teachings of the Church.\\n\\nIn a social media post titled VP Pick, Tim Kaine, a Catholic? Bishop Thomas J. Tobin of Providence noted that Kaine has been widely identified as a Roman Catholic while at the same time he publicly supports 'freedom of choice' for abortion, same-sex marriage, gay adoptions, and the ordination of women as priests.\\n\\nAll of these positions are clearly contrary to well-established Catholic teachings; all of them have been opposed by Pope Francis as well, Tobin wrote.\\n\\nSenator Kaine has said, 'My faith is central to everything I do.' But apparently, and unfortunately, his faith isn't central to his public, political life, Bishop Tobin concluded.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in a column in his diocesan newspaper, Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput also took issue with Kaine for his open dissent from Catholic teaching, along with former Vice President, Joe Biden.\\n\\nThese two prominent Catholics, the archbishop said, both seem to publicly ignore or invent the content of their Catholic faith as they go along.\\n\\nAlthough Tuesday's statement by the two Virginia bishops expresses outrage at the immoral voting of Senator Kaine, they have not gone as far as other bishops who host pro-abortion Catholic politicians in their dioceses.\\n\\nLast year, Bishop Thomas John Paprocki of Springfield barred Senator Dick Durbin from receiving Holy Communion in his home diocese because of his overt support for abortion legislation.\\n\\nDurbin's record of political support for abortion constitutes obstinate persistence in manifest grave sin, the bishop said, quoting a stipulation in Canon Law for withholding Communion from a Catholic.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "Retiring Senator Jeff Flake took yet another swipe at resisting President Donald Trump on Thursday with the announcement that he would seek to nullify the tariffs that Trump signed into being on Thursday.\\n\\nTrump ordered tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and ten percent on aluminum imports as a measure to save U.S. production of the metals. Trump made the move under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 after extensive Department of Commerce research into the issue. The tariffs are being imposed on the basis of economic and national security.\\n\\nFlake was swift to declare his active resistance to the tariffs:\\n\\nThese so-called 'flexible tariffs' are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth – protectionism and uncertainty.

{"original": "OXON HILL, MD — Sheriff David Clarke blamed the nation's crippling cycle of poverty and the myth of mass incarceration of black males on the Democrats and their failed, liberal urban policies which he says have screwed this country up.\\n\\nClarke said while speaking on a panel titled Breaking Bad: What it Takes to Rise Above Circumstances, at the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) on Friday:\\n\\nMass incarcerations, especially of black males, is a myth. Look, the Democrats did this. They have screwed this country up. They screwed it up with failed, liberal urban polices. Clarke added his belief that the Democrats did this because while the country is discussing ways to break the cycle of poverty, they call for more programs, more government intervention, and more spending of your tax dollars.\\n\\nClarke was joined on the panel by Ashley McGuire of The Catholic Association, Margaret Iuculano, of the American Conservative Union, and Dr. Wendy Warcholik and J. Scott Moody, who work on the ACU Foundation Family Prosperity Initiative.\\n\\nClarke, who has served 40 years in law enforcement, said By the time these individuals get to us, there's only one thing we can do: There's one thing cops do and cops do it well. We lock people up. That's what we are designed to do, to separate dangerous people from law-abiding society.\\n\\nHe said when people ask him what has to be done to end crime, he says, Fix the schools. When asked what has to be done to end the cycle of poverty, Clarke said, Fix the schools. What do we have to do to reduce unemployment in these urban centers mainly occupied by blacks and Hispanics? Fix the schools … Education has always been then vehicle to upward mobility in the United States.\\n\\nHe said the government is spending too much money and not achieving much of anything. I bet I could cut that [money spent] in half and still get the same results, he said, asking what Milwaukee Public School (MPS) is doing with $1.2 billion a year. You know what the budget is for the entire City of Milwaukee, 600,000 people? $1.3 billion. So you have to ask yourselves, what is MPS doing with that $1.2 billion; almost as much as it takes to run an entire city? He said, horrible graduation rates, horrible truancy rates, a growing education gap between black students and their counterparts, failing math scores, failing reading scores, among other things.\\n\\nHe cited Dr. Ben Carson as an example of the sheer determination of an individual to succeed despite being born into a less-than-desirable situation. Clarke said Carson's mother had a third-grade education and swore she would not allow her two sons to end up like her.\\n\\nThe Democrats don't want that to happen, Clarke said. You have to depend on us to make it … you have to vote this way because we'll help you out of this plight, and they don't do it.\\n\\nHe said he didn't have a solution but rather a remedy because of the fact that parental responsibility has a great deal to do with this problem.\\n\\nVirtues need to be instilled in young people; a virtue being defined as a redeeming quality. They are not born with them. Things like respect, personal responsibility. He added, the religious education that I had went a long way.\\n\\nClarke said, We've become a very, very secular society and that is not how this country was started. God has been marginalized, God has been pushed out of public square. You can't pray in public. It's amazing, right?\\n\\nAshley McGuire of The Catholic Association said, There's a real attack right now on the religious liberty of adoption agencies and parents and parental rights when it comes to public school. She suggested that parents get involved in their kids' PTAs. She also said a policy issue to watch is the issue of paid family leave, through the conservative approach.\\n\\nShe said society has started to look down upon motherhood and fatherhood and noted that marriage is in the decline:\\n\\nIt's become sort of politically incorrect to even talk about the differences between men and women, the different things that they bring to a marriage and to a family. It's ironic because we know now more than ever before how badly children need mothers and fathers and need them to be married to each other in order to thrive. And yet, we are in complete denial, and even talking about those realities, is politically incorrect.\\n\\nMcGuire said all society talks about is toxic masculinity, while forgoing the critical role that men play as husbands and fathers. Or society says that women who decide they want to put their careers on the back burner to focus on child-rearing have wasted their education. I think we need to reclaim, as positive goods, the differences between men and women and the essential roles of mothers and fathers.\\n\\nMargaret Iuculano, of the American Conservative Union, spoke of rampant poverty within the foster system. On any given day, over 400,000 children are being raised by our government. In 2015 alone, over 670,000 children spent time in the foster care system, Iuculano said. She noted that over half of those children in the 2015 statistics were people of color. These are alarming numbers and, I don't know about you, but I don't think the role of government is to raise children.\\n\\nShe said she had gone through the foster system herself and realized first-hand how terrible the system is. She lived in over 15 foster homes, group homes, and juvenile hall by the age of 16. These children come into the system through no fault of their own and once removed we would like to believe that the government is going to give them a better place than the one we removed them from. But that is not the fact for many of these children.\\n\\nDr. Wendy Warcholik and J. Scott Moody, who work on the ACU Foundation Family Prosperity Initiative, spoke about how societal and economic factors play major roles in the opioid and drug epidemic.\\n\\nI'm here to tell you, as an economist, we can't just focus on the economics, Warcholik said. We have to focus on family formation. We have to focus on health outcomes, obesity, alcohol use, substance abuse, STDs, all of these things that impact our lives and the lives of the people that we love.\\n\\nShe added, and so we've created a model that does just that to create a conversation about those things in our culture that are taboo and we're not supposed to talk about, speaking of the Family Prosperity Index.\\n\\nMoody said, Utah becomes the poster child for why economic and social factors are interrelated … there are not enough young people in our states to maintain current population levels, except in a state like Utah, which is highly successful economically.\\n\\nMoody said in states like New England where the economies are weaker, and not vibrant, people lose hope. And when they lose hope, they look for other things to fill that void and, unfortunately, that's been opioids and now heroin and now fentanil, which is 100 times stronger than heroin.\\n\\nHe said there was recently a bust in Boston where authorities arrested and seized 100 pounds of fentanil, which could have killed the entire population of Massachusetts if it had been dispersed. He added, We need to fix this crisis of hopelessness and we are calling it 'dynamics of despair.'\\n\\nMoody attributed this to the breakdown of the family, decline in religiosity, and over incarceration, and noted that people who are religious are healthier.\\n\\nWareholik said she would like to see more religious communities involved in helping to eradicate the opioid crisis. You can somehow act as a messenger or a mediator to get your church involved in the direct service and get your politicians involved in your church, and that's a really good thing.\\n\\nAdelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

{"original": "In September of 1997, the world lost two of its most famous women – Diana, the former Princess of Wales, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta.\\n\\nThe vast differences between the lives of the two women are obvious. Yet, they died within several days of each other and the fact that Diana was buried following her tragic death with a rosary in her folded hands given to her by Mother Teresa, has led some in the media to reflect on both the contrast and the connection between the two.\\n\\nOn September 7, 1997, NBC Today Show featured Princess Diana and Mother Teresa, with Jack Ford as co-host and Scott Simon of NPR/PBS reporting:\\n\\nFord:\\n\\nBritain and the world said final farewells to Diana in this week in London. And on Friday, the announcement came from Calcutta of another historic loss: the death of Mother Teresa. Scott Simon, of National Public Radio and PBS once worked with Mother Teresa in Calcutta; he joins us this morning.\\n\\nScott, the–the loss of such symbols in one week.\\n\\nSimon:\\n\\nIt–it–it is utterly an amazing coincidence that the two most famous women in the world really, according to surveys, should die within just a few days of each other. And while they were very different, to be certain, they were friends. Princess Diana, in fact, was buried holding a rosary given to her by Mother Teresa. And this weekend their losses seem to resonate with some similar meanings.\\n\\nThe Princess of Wales had a fairy tale life that went sour, and then was cut short. Mother Teresa had a life out of biblical scripture that grew rich in years and reverence. Mother became one of the most revered persons of the modern world by shunning much of what the modern world reveres–money, things, even the good things good people often want: comfort and security. Mother Teresa believed human beings didn't suffer from poverty, but became richer by it. She told those who sought her out to ask, What can I do to help? – Give until it hurts.\\n\\nPrincess Diana was born into privilege, married into and even died in opulence. She spent most of her life in comfortable pursuit of `good things'. The hurt of her unhappy marriage and the pain of her public humiliations only reminded much of the watching world that not even the wealth of the Windsors can buy love.\\n\\nMother Teresa had no less of a shrewd trademark–her homespun, blue-striped, white cotton sari. Reported value: about a dollar. She wore it before the beribboned audience in Stockholm who awarded her the Nobel Peace Prize and refused to change from it before her first meeting with the pope, saying, `These clothes are good enough for God.' The pope knelt to kiss her hand and said he felt humbled.\\n\\nNBC reported that, in reacting to Diana's death, Mother Teresa said just prior to her own passing, You could see that she was very much concerned about the poor people and she wanted to give something, by helping me to help them, and that's a beautiful thing.\\n\\nSimon:\\n\\nWhile you cannot compare Mother Teresa's life of service with Princess Diana's occasional missions of charity, looking through the pictures of their lives this week, you're struck by the way each of them reached out, in a way both loving and lovely, to touch hurt with their hands–caressing and comforting those suffering from biblical diseases, like leprosy and age-old poverty, and modern afflictions, including AIDS, land mines, and homelessness.\\n\\nAnd almost certainly, there will be calls for Mother Teresa to be canonized a saint. Mother herself always rejected such talk. Yet for millions of people living in a century that did much to make us cynical, Mother Teresa was a glimpse of God even agnostics could respect. In our time, she was `the Word of God made flesh.'\\n\\nThe Missionaries of Charity say that Mother Teresa leaves this world owning only two pairs of sandals and two pairs of eyeglasses, a wooden wash bucket, a worn sweater, a well-thumbed Bible, and an olivewood rosary. She was almost as poor as she strived to be.\\n\\nAs Mother Teresa is canonized a saint on Sunday, Stephanie Mann recalls the media frenzy over the death of Diana, and describes her funeral as her canonization. She writes at National Catholic Register:\\n\\nDebate raged about who was to blame for her death after a car crash in Paris: the drunken limousine driver, the paparazzi, or the Royal Family… Diana's funeral, held in Westminster Abbey, included both tradition and innovation, with Sir Elton John singing a special version of Candle in the Wind, originally written about Marilyn Monroe, and her brother's eulogy which attacked the press and criticized the Royal Family. English pomp and circumstance combined with celebrity status. Hundreds of thousands watched the services on screens in Hyde Park and the funeral was carried live on TV and radio. The media tones were hushed and reverential for the people's princess.\\n\\nMann contrasts the coverage of Diana's death and funeral with that of Mother Teresa:\\n\\nMother Teresa of Calcutta had died the day before Diana's funeral, on September 5, 1997. While she was granted the honor of a State funeral in India, ABC News with Peter Jennings chose to have Christopher Hitchens, her most virulent critic, add his commentary to the broadcast of her funeral Mass.\\n\\nShe aptly describes Mother Teresa's funeral on September 13 in an indoor stadium as reverent and orderly…with none of the magnificence of Westminster Abbey.\\n\\nMother Teresa's words upon Diana's death and the princess' burial with the future saint's rosary in her hands inspires Mann to call for prayer for the intercession of the Saint and for the soul of the Princess."}

{"original": "Unbreakable is not only one of my favorite movies from 2000, a pretty good year for movies, it is my favorite movie from director M. Night Shyamalan.\\n\\nUnfortunately, most people didn't agree. Coming off his 1999 blockbuster, even though Shyamalan reunited with star Bruce Willis for Unbreakable, the weak box office meant there would be no sequel for the rare movie that deserved one.\\n\\nUnbreakable is, as Shyamalan himself described, the first act of a superhero origin story told over the course of a feature length film. In nuts-and-bolts terms, Shyamalan took 23 minutes of story and spread it out over 106 minutes.\\n\\nAnd it worked. At least it did for me, and did so beautifully. Unbreakable's pacing isn't slow, it's deliberate and lovely and moving and riveting. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a security guard living in Philadelphia whose marriage is falling apart.

Unbreakable is perfect as a standalone, as one of those movies that allows you to enjoy the pleasant exercise of filling in the blanks using your own imagination.\\n\\nAnyway, the years passed, Shyamalan lost his storytelling mojo and box office prowess, but he still figured out a way to make Unbreakable 2, in a sneaky and admittedly ingenious way.\\n\\nWhereas Unbreakable cost $75 million to produce all those years ago, in 2016 Shyamalan wrote and directed Split for a mere $9 million, and surprised everyone, not only with a $280 million worldwide gross, but a closing scene with Willis's David Dunn that tied his new hit into the Unbreakable universe.\\n\\nAnd so, Glass was green-lit, which completes the promised Unbreakable trilogy, and what a terrible disappointment it is.\\n\\nI wasn't a big fan of Split, but Glass is much worse, even with the presence of Willis and Jackson.\\n\\nWhereas Unbreakable is deliberately paced and beautifully structured, Glass is ponderous, repetitive, and horribly structured. Almost nothing happens during its bloated 129-minute runtime, except James McAvoy's exhausting and tedious showing off his incredibly-amazingly-awesome acting skills using the split personality of his tiresome Split character, Kevin Wendell Crumb aka The Horde aka The Beast aka please shoot me before he does it again.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, McAvoy is the star of Glass, which means Willis and Jackson inexplicably disappear for very long periods of time.\\n\\nWhen the three men do finally meet it's during therapy sessions that are impossibly dull (considering the starpower) and repetitive.\\n\\nThroughout, we're promised a huge skyscraper finale that never arrives. Instead we're treated to an overlong and poorly choreographed battle that includes a ton of exposition and wild coincidences. Oh, and it all takes place in … a parking lot.\\n\\nAnd I hated the ending. Good God, I hate what happened to Dunn and Elijah.\\n\\nActually, I hated all three endings.\\n\\nShyamalan, who is a terrific director, just can't stop trying to regain his crown as the King of Breathtaking Twist Endings, and so we get two here that… Well, considering how bad Glass is, the promise of a sequel and the expanding of the Unbreakable universe feels more like a threat.\\n\\nThis is a movie that completely wastes Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson (which should be a felony) and not only fails to pay off on the two decade promise of Unbreakable, it fails to pay off its own promise.\\n\\nThe Glass Blu-ray (with a ton of extra features) is available for pre-order and hits store shelves on April 16.\\n\\nCorrected McAvoy's name. My apologies. These guys all blend together.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here."}
{"original": "In a Wednesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight, Greenpeace co-founder and former president of Greenpeace Canada Patrick Moore described the ideology of contemporary eco-fascists as against humans. He further lamented the replacement of Greenpeace's former humanitarian ethos with one which cast humanity as the enemies of nature.\\n\\nMoore explained to Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak how Greenpeace's original spirit of celebrating humanity was usurped by an anti-human Malthusian vision:\\n\\nBy the mid-1980s, Greenpeace had drifted from the original concept of green and peace — meaning environment and people, [to] save civilization from nuclear war — so we cared about people and had a humanitarian orientation as well as an environmental one. That was the marriage of green and peace, but by the time the eighties came along, the peace had kinda got lost and all it was was save-the-whales and save-the-earth, and now humans were being characterized as the enemies of nature, as if there's too many of us and there shouldn't be so many and people shouldn't have children — and all this stuff that's still coming up with AOC, now, telling people that maybe they shouldn't have children because the world's coming to an end.\\n\\nLISTEN:\\n\\nMoore recalled his departure from Greenpeace following the organization's adoption of anti-human ideology:\\n\\nSo I don't believe any of that stuff. At the highest level, I had to get out of Greenpeace at that point because my fellow directors were all pushing this narrative about humans being the enemies of the Earth. It's way too much like Original Sin for me, where all the other life is good and only the humans are bad, and I just do not buy that. We're from nature, just like all the other species are, and humans are mostly good. A few bad people make a big difference, it's true, but people are mostly good and mostly try to be good. So I didn't buy that.\\n\\nMoore noted how his fellow Greenpeace directors, at the time of his departure, did not have scientific credentials or backgrounds.\\n\\nWe basically got hijacked by extreme leftists or eco-fascists as they are sometimes referred to today. … We did a lot of good stuff but it went bad, said Moore.\\n\\nGreenpeace's ostensibly environmental cause is a feature of the Democrat Party's advocacy for halting climate change, explained Moore. He highlighted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) proposed Green New Deal as illustrative of the left's toxic mix of politics, religion, and ideology:\\n\\nThe Democrats might as well sign a suicide pact, not just for their political future, but for the future of the economy of the United States for all these people to be piling on this Green New Deal, which is a complete and utter ridiculous document. To ban fossil fuels in ten years … first, food production would collapse, second, anybody trying to get food into the cities would fail, because the people on the outside of the cities would capture it so they could have it, and the people on the inside is where it would start. The rot would start in the center of the big cities where people would begin starve to death after they'd eaten all their pets. They would actually start killing and eating each other. It's not just a religion, it's a toxic mix of religion and ideology, of politics and religion. It's just absolutely toxic. … They are against humans. Why would humans be against humans? Especially when we have developed such an incredible civilization.\\n\\nPompous little twit. You don't have a plan to grow food for 8 billion people without fossil fuels, or get the food into the cities. Horses? If fossil fuels were banned every tree in the world would be cut down for fuel for cooking and heating. You would bring about mass death. — Patrick Moore (@EcoSenseNow) February 23, 2019\\n\\nThe idea that we're killing the Earth is crazy, concluded Moore.\\n\\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\\n\\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik."}

{"original": "Legendary NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw says former First Lady Nancy Reagan, who died Sunday at the age of 94, will be remembered as a very skilled and powerful First Lady who didn't let the seams show.\\n\\nShe had a very subtle touch behind the scenes, Brokaw told host Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News, on Monday morning's edition of Breitbart News Daily, heard daily on Sirius-XM's Patriot Channel 125.\\n\\nI am quite close to a number of people who worked in that White House and they always said 'We knew where the power was, not just with the President, but with Nancy as well.' And she didn't abuse the power. She was very skilled in how she used it, Brokaw added.\\n\\nBrokaw also told Bannon that Nancy Reagan's influence on her husband may have contributed to his administration's foreign policy successes:\\n\\nIt was important for the staff to know not just where she stood on issues, but on personnel as well. I do think that, as a modern First Lady, she had a huge impact on the politics of the White House. I know for a fact that she dialed Ronnie, as she called him, dialed him down on his rhetoric about the Soviet Union because she could see the possibilities of getting something done with Mikhail Gorbachev at that time. And also understood the historic importance of that, if he were the President who could start to unwind the nuclear confrontation.\\n\\nBannon asked Brokaw to expand on how Nancy Reagan was really a partner to him [President Reagan], not in so much policy, but really as the person that he kind of leaned on in very difficult situations.\\n\\nWell it was, in the truest sense of the word, a deeply emotional relationship, but also very pragmatic. I was just saying on the air a few moments ago that I thought their thespian training, their Hollywood background, helped them in politics, because they were conscious of the fact the country wanted something grand in the Presidency, Brokaw said. He also noted that:\\n\\nThey were always prepared to help deliver that, not just on a substantive point of view, but also in a kind of metaphorical way. So when they went out in public, they had a patina, more than a patina, of glamour about them, and she kept that up after we lost the President. At the [Reagan] Library, for example, she would be always introduced as the former First Lady of the United States. They had ruffles and flourishes played. The whole setting at the library, I think, is a real tribute to their personal tastes, but also to the place of the Presidency in our lives, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or a Tea Party member or whatever. You go in there and you have a sense of the majesty of the office, if you will, and I mean that in a pragmatic sense, not in the royal sense.\\n\\nThey were very, very much aware of the importance of symbolism. I think it was helped shaped a little bit by their years, not just in Hollywood, but eight years as Governor of California, Brokaw added.\\n\\nBannon also posited that without Nancy Reagan as First Lady, there for the comfort, aid and really protection of him, it might have been a very different Presidency, would it not?\\n\\nBrokaw agreed:\\n\\nI think that's true. She was, she didn't let this on to him, but she was terrified whenever he went out, because she saw just how vulnerable he was, even with all that protection. He was such an important part of her life from a personal point of view. She was very anxious about it. But they got through it. She didn't show that anxiety to the public, and she was greatly relieved when he was able to leave office on his own two feet, as it were. And then, of course, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and wrote that very, very touching letter to the American people, hand written, and then she went on to live with him in that condition. He had to have her at his side, at night, for example, or he would get agitated, and she was there, and never complained. I had quite a strong personal relationship with her by then, and I would not bring that up, and she would not… there was never a hint of a complaint from her about the life she had been reduced to. A lot of her friends were gone by then, so she didn't have a very active social life. She had a harder time getting around. She had friends in New York. She would come here from time to time, but then she lost most of them. She was a very brave woman through it all.\\n\\nBannon also asked if this old-fashioned marriage [between Nancy and Ronald Reagan], even though he was divorced, is it something that the first couple can have, does the new First Lady have to be too policy oriented or do you think they could actually have this throw-back marriage?\\n\\nI do think that marriage was a reflection of their times, Brokaw responded, adding:\\n\\nAnd when he got divorced [from first wife Jane Wyman], it was very hard for him to accept. He kept thinking for awhile that they would get back together again. But Ms. Wyman, whom I didn't know, but I've heard from others who talked to her, just, he was consumed with politics 24-7. He was the head of the Screen Actors Guild for example. He was very liberal, he was very involved in politics, and then he made the transition to becoming the kind of typical conservative of his time. Divorce in those days was almost a lower s scandale. People didn't get divorced. They covered it up. I think he was very conscious of that. He came out of a strong Protestant background in the Midwest. He was part of that culture. His mother was a huge influence on him.\\n\\nBrokaw agreed with Bannon's assertion that Reagan was kind of the All-American boy.\\n\\nHe was, and he carried that out, Brokaw noted:\\n\\nWhat people forget is that he did grow up under very difficult circumstances. He went to Eureka College [in Illinois], played football, and almost instantly became a big radio star in the Midwest. He worked for WHO, the big radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, and he recreated the Chicago Cubs baseball games. He got a great interest in horseback riding. So he was a glamorous figure by those standards. And then he went to the West Coast to cover the Cubs in spring training, and somebody said to him, 'You ought to take a crack at Hollywood.' And he became a contract player for Universal Pictures. This was all before he was 30. So he had a rocket ride to some considerable success at that time. That would have been in those moments that would have been the American dream fulfilled.\\n\\nYou can hear the full interview here:"}
{"original": "President Joe Biden released a statement Friday urging Congress to swiftly pass the Equality Act, a bill that would eliminate the legal recognition of male and female sex, cater to gender ideology, and designate protection for the unborn as pregnancy discrimination.\\n\\nBiden said:\\n\\nI applaud Congressman David Cicilline [D-RI] and the entire Congressional Equality Caucus for introducing the Equality Act in the House of Representatives yesterday, and I urge Congress to swiftly pass this historic legislation. Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, and this bill represents a critical step toward ensuring that America lives up to our foundational values of equality and freedom for all. Full equality has been denied to LGBTQ+ Americans and their families for far too long. Despite the extraordinary progress the LGBTQ+ community has made to secure their basic civil rights, discrimination is still rampant in many areas of our society. The Equality Act provides long overdue federal civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, locking in critical safeguards in our housing, education, public services, and lending systems — and codifying the courage and resilience of the LGBTQ+ movement into enduring law.\\n\\nThe House is expected to vote on the Equality Act, H.R. 5, next week. The legislation, which would rewrite civil rights law to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes, would likely upend the national culture as Americans have known it.\\n\\nThe so-called Equality Act is legislative malpractice that turns equality on its head, said Ryan Anderson, president of Ethics & Public Policy Center (EPPC), in a statement. It isn't drafted as a shield to protect vulnerable minorities from unjust discrimination, but as a sword to persecute those who do not embrace new sexual and gender ideologies.\\n\\nThe Equality Act is legislative malpractice that turns equality on its head.

Anderson (@RyanTAnd) February 19, 2021\\n\\nAnderson underscored the tremendous impact the legislation will have on the privacy of women and girls, as well as the punitive consequences to which faith-based institutions and organizations will be exposed at its hands:\\n\\nIt sacrifices the equality, safety, and privacy of women, while privileging men who identify as women: If this bill becomes law, they'd have a civil right to spend the night in a battered women's shelter, disrobe in a women's locker room, and compete on a women's sports team—even children at K-12 public schools. Religious institutions fare no better. Religious schools, adoption agencies, and other charities would face federal sanction for operating according to basic biology and mainstream Biblical teaching on sex and marriage. Outrageously, this act exempts itself from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Pope Francis would be treated as the legal equivalent of a Jim Crow segregationist.\\n\\nAnderson noted that any questioning of transgender medical treatments and surgeries would be labeled discrimination if the Equality Act becomes law.\\n\\nAnd any refusal to support or provide abortions would now be treated as 'pregnancy' discrimination, he continued. And no one—not even the act's sponsors—can tell us what would be required under the act to avoid committing 'discrimination' in the case of 'non-binary' gender identities.\\n\\nA new study that examined students who claim to have gender identity issues found that, compared with 45% of students who are comfortable with their biological sex, 78% of gender-disturbed students met the criteria for at least one mental health problem. https://t.co/VzNAYJFNs5 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) August 24, 2019\\n\\nTerry Schilling, executive director of American Principles Project (APP), explained further the Equality Act will make permanent in federal law Biden's executive order on his first day as president regarding Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.\\n\\nSchilling said in a statement:\\n\\nOf course, this has been their goal for a long time, and we know by now the very terrible consequences which will occur if the 'Equality' Act passes. Female athletes will be forced to compete against biological males; women will be forced to share private spaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, and shelters with men; and religious charities will be coerced into violating their beliefs or else be shut down.\\n\\nSchilling warned while the Equality Act sounds virtuous, every member of Congress should recognize that a vote in favor of it is a vote against women, particularly women and girl athletes, as well as a vote against Americans of faith.\\n\\nEvery member of Congress should recognize that a vote for the 'Equality' Act is a vote against women, particularly women and girl athletes, as well as a vote against Americans of faith. Read APP's statement on the Equality Act herehttps://t.co/UdIdJEsizH — American Principles 🇺🇸 (@approject) February 19, 2021\\n\\nJon Schweppe, APP director of policy and government affairs, noted in the last Congress the bill passed the House, 236-173, with eight Republicans voting to approve it. However, at that time, it failed to survive in the GOP-controlled Senate.\\n\\nHe explained further:\\n\\nThis year with Democrats controlling the Senate and the Presidency, the bill has at least a non-zero chance at becoming law. Do 10 Senate Republicans defect to get it past the filibuster? Do the Democrats scrap the filibuster in order to pass one of their biggest legislative priorities into law? Seems unlikely, but the margin is still too close for comfort.\\n\\nSchweppe also warns Americans should not be fooled by the benevolent-sounding title of the Equality Act:\\n\\nI think it's important for those who don't follow this issue closely to understand what exactly is wrong with the Equality Act. How could conservatives possibly oppose something that protects people against discrimination? That's just awful, right? The problem is that the Equality Act wouldn't protect people in need of protection as much as it would fundamentally change civil rights law for the worse.\\n\\nThe intent of the Equality Act may be to promote equality and tolerance — love is love! — but the practical application of it would be to grant biological men the right to impose their will on women, whenever and wherever they want, he observed, adding:\\n\\nAny attempt by a medical professional to encourage a child to identify with their birth sex would be deemed illegal. The long-term result of this, combined with aggressive state statutes, is pretty frightening: parents with kids suffering from gender dysphoria will be forced to provide them with puberty blockers, hormone treatments, and ultimately sex changes, lest they violate the law.\\n\\nFeminists as well recognize the Equality Act as Biden's war on women.\\n\\nThe House will be voting on the Equality Act NEXT WEEK. Urge your representatives to vote NO on ending women's single-sex spaces and accommodations.https://t.co/Lhcy7bnwoB — WoLF (@WomensLibFront) February 17, 2021\\n\\nWomen's Liberation Front (WoLF) said in a post on its website:\\n\\nWhile the Equality Act is being sold on promising good things for women, and on ending unfair treatment of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people—which almost everyone agrees are worthy and important goals—it's poisoned with the destruction of the law's ability to allow any accommodations for women on the basis of sex.\\n\\nWoLF noted as well many Americans may be unaware the Equality Act's gender identity rules would pose a danger to women and children:\\n\\nThe bill's authors made clear that gender identity is to take precedence over and replace sex as a protected category. The bill doesn't mention individuals with clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria, or undertaking surgical or hormonal transition, thus making clear that self-declared gender identity would be sufficient to claim protected legal status.\\n\\nEPPC Fellow Mary Rice Hasson commented on the far-reaching consequences of passage of the Equality Act, warning the measure would extend the federal octopus into almost every aspect of Americans' lives, imposing 'gender identity' requirements that effectively snuff out the sex-based rights of females, endanger parental rights, and silence religious believers in the public square.\\n\\nHasson continued:\\n\\nMake no mistake, if the Equality Act becomes law, children in every public school in America will be sold on a cult concept of the human person—that who we are is self-defined by feelings, regardless of biological sex. Female students will be forced into silence—or required to celebrate—when yesterday's male classmate announces he identifies as a girl and demands to shower in the girls' locker room, compete against her in sports, and claim for himself the hard-won rights of women.\\n\\nThe Equality Act is nothing short of a Pandora's Box which, once opened, will unleash damaging consequences impossible to undo, she warned."}
{"original": "LONDON (AP) — Albert Finney, the charismatic Academy Award-nominated British actor who starred in films from Tom Jones to Skyfall, has died. He was 82.\\n\\nFinney's family said Friday that he passed away peacefully after a short illness with those closest to him by his side. He died Thursday from a chest infection at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London.\\n\\nFinney was a rare star who managed to avoid the Hollywood limelight for more than five decades after bursting to international fame in 1963 in the title role of Tom Jones.\\n\\nThe film gained him the first of five Oscar nominations. Others followed for Murder on the Orient Express, ″The Dresser, ″Under the Volcano and Erin Brockovich.\\n\\nIn later years he brought authority to action movies, including the James Bond thriller Skyfall and two of the Bourne films.\\n\\nDisplaying the versatility of a virtuoso, Finney portrayed Winston Churchill, Pope John Paul II, a southern American lawyer, an Irish gangster and an 18th-century rogue, among dozens of other roles over the years. There was no Albert Finney-type character that he returned to again and again.\\n\\nIn one of his final roles, as the gruff Scotsman Kincade in Skyfall, he shared significant screen time with Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M, turning the film's final scenes into a master class of character acting.\\n\\nAlthough Finney rarely discussed his personal life, he told the Manchester Evening News in 2012 that he had been treated for kidney cancer for five years, undergoing surgery and chemotherapy.\\n\\nHe also explained why he had not attended the Academy Awards in Los Angeles even when he was nominated for the film world's top prize.\\n\\nIt seems silly to go over there and beg for an award, he told the paper.\\n\\nThe son of a bookmaker, Finney was born May 9, 1936, and grew up in northern England on the outskirts of Manchester. He took to the stage at an early age, doing a number of school plays and — despite his lack of connections and his working-class roots — earning a place at London's prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.\\n\\nHe credited the headmaster of his local school, Eric Simms, for recommending that he attend the renowned drama school.\\n\\nHe's the reason I am an actor, Finney said in 2012.\\n\\nFinney made his first professional turn at 19 and appeared in several TV movies, including She Stoops to Conquer in 1956 and The Claverdon Road Job the following year.\\n\\nSoon some critics were hailing him as the next Laurence Olivier — a commanding presence who would light up the British stage. Britain's pre-eminent theater critic, Kenneth Tynan, called the young Finney a smoldering young Spencer Tracy and warned established star Richard Burton about his prowess. In London, Finney excelled both in Shakespeare's plays and in more contemporary offerings.\\n\\nStill, the young man seemed determined not to pursue conventional Hollywood stardom. After an extensive screen test, he turned down the chance to play the title role in director David Lean's epic Lawrence of Arabia, clearing the way for fellow RADA graduate Peter O'Toole to take what became a career-defining role.\\n\\nBut stardom came to Finney anyway in Tom Jones where he won over audiences worldwide with his good-natured, funny and sensual portrayal of an 18th-century English rogue.\\n\\nThat was the role that introduced Finney to American audiences, and few would forget the lusty, blue-eyed leading man who helped the film win a Best Picture Oscar. Finney also earned his first Best Actor nomination for his efforts and the smash hit turned him into a Hollywood leading man.\\n\\nDirector Tony Richardson said his goal for Tom Jones was simply to produce an enjoyable romp.\\n\\nNo social significance for once, he said. No contemporary problems to lay bare. Just a lot of colorful, sexy fun.\\n\\nFinney had the good fortune to receive a healthy percentage of the profits from the surprise hit, giving him financial security while he was still in his 20s.\\n\\nThis is a man from very humble origins who became rich when he was very young, said Quentin Falk, author of an unauthorized biography of Finney. It brought him a lot of side benefits. He's a man who likes to live as well as to act. He enjoys his fine wine and cigars. He's his own man. I find that rather admirable.\\n\\nThe actor maintained a healthy skepticism about the British establishment and even turned down a knighthood when it was offered, declining to become Sir Albert. Finney once said he didn't believe in such honors.\\n\\nMaybe people in America think being a 'Sir' is a big deal, he said. But I think we should all be misters together. I think the 'Sir' thing slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery. And it also helps keep us 'quaint,' which I'm not a great fan of.\\n\\nInstead of cashing in by taking lucrative film roles after Tom Jones, Finney took a long sabbatical, traveling slowly through the United States, Mexico and the Pacific islands, then returned to the London stage to act in Shakespeare productions and other plays. He won wide acclaim and many awards before returning to film in 1967 to co-star with Audrey Hepburn in Two for the Road.\\n\\nThis was to be a familiar pattern, with Finney alternating between film work and stage productions in London and New York.\\n\\nFinney tackled Charles Dickens in Scrooge in 1970, then played Agatha Christie's super-sleuth Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express — earning his second Best Actor nomination— and even played a werewolf hunter in the cult film Wolfen in 1981.\\n\\nHe earned more Best Actor Oscar nominations for his roles in the searing marital drama Shoot the Moon in 1982, co-starring with Diane Keaton, and The Dresser in 1983. He was nominated again in 1984 for his role as a self-destructive alcoholic in director John Huston's Under the Volcano.\\n\\nEven during this extraordinary run of great roles, and his critically acclaimed television portrayal of the pope, Finney's life was not chronicled in People Weekly or other magazines, although the British press was fascinated with his marriage to the sultry French film star Anouk Aimee.\\n\\nHe played in a series of smaller, independent films for a number of years before returning to prominence in 2000 as a southern lawyer in the film Erin Brockovich, which starred Julia Roberts. The film helped introduce Finney to a new generation of moviegoers, and the chemistry between the aging lawyer and his young, aggressive assistant earned him yet another Oscar nomination, this time for Best Supporting Actor.\\n\\nHis work also helped propel Roberts to her first Best Actress Oscar. Still, Finney declined to attend the Academy Awards ceremony — possibly damaging his chances at future wins by snubbing Hollywood's elite.\\n\\nHe went on to star in director Tim Burton's Big Fish and portrayed Britain's wartime leader, Winston Churchill, in The Gathering Storm.\\n\\nFinney also tried his hand at directing and producing and played a vital role in sustaining British theater.\\n\\nThe Old Vic theater said after Finney's death that his performances in plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov and other iconic playwrights throughout the '60s, '70s and '80s stand apart as some of the greatest in our 200-year history.\\n\\nFinney is survived by his third wife, Pene Delmage, son Simon and two grandchildren.

Forcing them to compete against boys isn't fair, shatters their dreams, and destroys their athletic opportunities.\\n\\nADF filed the lawsuit on behalf of Selina Soule, Alanna Smith, and Chelsea Mitchell who have been impacted by the policy – though they are not the only young women affected by it.\\n\\nAs ADF noted, two biological male athletes have taken 15 state championship titles that previously belonged to nine different girls.\\n\\nAnd they have taken 17 individual meet records that previously belonged to 13 different girls, the legal non-profit added.\\n\\nHolcomb said:\\n\\nHaving separate boys' and girls' sports has always been based on biological differences, not what people believe about their gender, because those differences matter for fair competition. And forcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics. Connecticut's policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.\\n\\nLeftwing groups promoting transgender rights groups have spread the false narrative that there is no scientific evidence suggesting biological male athletes have an unfair advantage over biological female athletes.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported, however, a recent study conducted by the Karolinska Institute and Linkoping University in Sweden found biological males — claiming to be transgender women — who were administered a full year of hormone therapy, still maintained muscle mass and strength advantages over biological women.\\n\\nDespite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in TM, the TW were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12 months of treatment, the researchers observed. These findings add new knowledge that could be relevant when evaluating transwomen's eligibility to compete in the women's category of athletic competitions.\\n\\nOur results indicate that after 12 months of hormonal therapy, a transwoman will still likely have performance benefits over a cis-woman [biological woman], they concluded.\\n\\nIn another study published at the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and released in July, three professors — two in bioethics and one in physiology — concluded that male athletes who claim to be female hold an intolerable advantage over biological female athletes.\\n\\nThe study was conducted after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced it would allow transgender women to compete against biological females if their testosterone is below 10 nanomole/liter (nmol/L). However, even that level is significantly higher than that of biological females, the authors said.\\n\\nThey cited research demonstrating that healthy young men did not lose significant muscle mass (or power) when their circulating testosterone levels were reduced for 20 weeks to meet the IOC's guidelines.\\n\\nThe researchers also noted that indirect effects of testosterone will not be altered by hormone therapy.\\n\\nFor example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions postpuberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained, the authors explained.\\n\\nWe conclude that the advantage to transwomen afforded by the IOC guidelines is an intolerable unfairness, stated the professors.\\n\\nWhen Planned Parenthood and NOW were asked – both in November 2019 and Wednesday – about whether they would support the female athletes since there are now two studies showing biological men treated with hormones still have an unfair advantage over women athletes, Breitbart News received no response.\\n\\nBoth organizations claim to advocate for women's rights, but actually now focus primarily on abortion rights and appear to place gender identity above biological sex.\\n\\nWhen we ratify the Equal Rights Amendment we are letting our communities know, our women know — our mothers our daughters, our sisters, our friends — that we believe they deserve to be treated justly and be protected under the law. – NOW VP @ChrisFNunes https://t.co/NRwhtESqs7 — National NOW (@NationalNOW) January 28, 2020\\n\\nOn its website, NOW states it is committed to fighting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in all areas, including employment, housing, public accommodations, health services, child custody and military policies.\\n\\nThe organization adds:\\n\\nNOW is committed to educational efforts that combat the adverse effects of homophobia, promote positive images in the media and ultimately ensure civil rights protection for all.

{"original": "Identity politics have so warped the establishment media's collective hive minds that, just because he was black and gay, NBC News is singing the praises of a 20-year-old man who allegedly sought out a 14-year-old boy for sex.\\n\\nIn a lengthy piece that has to be read to be believed, here is NBC's glowing biography of an alleged child predator:\\n\\n[Alain] Malcolm was tall and handsome. The oldest son of Jamaican immigrants, he wholly subscribed to the idea of the American dream. In high school, Malcolm was vice president of the Future Business Leaders of America club, assistant captain of the tennis and swim teams and a member of the student council and Model United Nations. He started a social marketing business at 15. After graduating in 2016, Malcolm filled his Instagram and Facebook feeds with photos of New York high-rises, bathroom selfies in three-piece suits and links to news articles in which he was featured. He went to community college while working as a junior buyer for a local circuit-board manufacturer and was the subject of a Connecticut Public Television series that profiled recent high school graduates. Earlier this year, he was named one of Litchfield County's 40 Leaders Under 40. Malcolm was also gay, which was difficult growing up in a religious family in Torrington, a sleepy former mill town in the northwest part of the state, friends said. It's not easy to be black, Jamaican, a Jehovah's Witness and gay in Torrington, Connecticut, said Allie Morrissey, a friend of Malcolm's. Starting in high school, Malcolm used apps like Tinder and Grindr to meet men from around the state, friends said. On that October night, he had come to Bristol to meet someone younger, purportedly a 14-year-old boy going on 15, according to a video posted by the digital vigilante group known as POPSquad.\\n\\nAnd here is where things went horribly wrong for Malcolm:\\n\\nWhen Malcolm arrived, he found that there was no boy — there was only POPSquad. For the 126th time in two years, the group — an acronym for Prey on Predators — had catfished a man on the internet, posing as an underage teen on hookup apps and luring him into a meetup, this time at an empty home whose owner allows it to be used for the group's stings, according to POPSquad.\\n\\nNow, I ask you… Ever, in the history of journalism, has an alleged child predator received five glowing paragraphs of hagiography before his alleged crime was detailed?\\n\\nThis POPSquad that NBC News hates so much just happens to be an online version of NBC's own Dateline program, To Catch a Predator, which ran from 2004 to 2007–the idea being to use the Internet to lure child predators out into the open where they are publicly exposed and shamed on camera.\\n\\nOne of NBC's targets also killed himself back in the day, just as Alain Malcolm did in October, just 30 minutes after being confronted with POPSquad's cameras. But now…\\n\\nNBC is not only on its high horse condemning as vigilantes those inspired by NBC's own To Catch a Predator; the far-left network is attempting to excuse an alleged child predator by presenting him as The Homecoming King Next Door led astray by those very same vigilantes.\\n\\nWorse still, what we have here is a major news organization openly lobbying Facebook and other social media groups to blacklist POPSquad and other groups like it.\\n\\nIn fact, NBC actually brags about the blacklisting it has already accomplished through its inquiries:\\n\\nAfter an inquiry from NBC News, Facebook temporarily suspended several predator hunter accounts, removed some individual posts and deleted at least one group entirely. Some groups voluntarily removed their own pages to escape what they saw as a purge. POPSquad appeared to be unaffected.\\n\\nBut, hey, maybe this is a good thing.\\n\\nMaybe NBC News is finally going to use its power for a moral good — to put an end to this disgraceful era of public shaming. From where I sit, this would be a healthy turnabout from a craven media that have spent years championing and emboldening the Woke Fascists who shame, boycott, de-platform, and personally destroy people over jokes, decades-old tweets, offbeat opinions, honest mistakes, and slips of the tongue.\\n\\nOr…\\n\\nIs NBC News only opposed to the shaming of alleged child predators, especially those who hit so many sweet spots on the Identity Politics Checklist?\\n\\nI think we all know the answer to that.\\n\\nOverall, I actually agree with NBC News.\\n\\nPrivate citizens (including Dateline reporters) luring their fellow private citizens into a trap that will ruin their lives by plastering their face all over the world on digital Wanted posters, and doing so without a trial, without the ability to challenge the evidence in the court of public opinion, is wrong.\\n\\nIt was wrong when NBC did it, and it is wrong now.\\n\\nBut what does it say about NBC News that the only form of public shaming, of online vigilantism it wants stopped is this particular form?\\n\\nAnd what does it say about NBC that the only public shaming victims NBC News wants to defend are not those who have been annihilated by the Humor Vigilantes or the Ten-Year-Old Tweet Vigilantes or the Rodeo Mask Vigilantes or the You're Fired for Opposing Gay Marriage Vigilantes, but those who apparently showed up at a house to have sex with a child?\\n\\nIt speaks volumes.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Opposition to Sharia is a human issue.\\n\\nHow beautiful it is to still be able to find common ground with our fellow American citizens, even in such hostile political times.\\n\\nStill, the March Against Sharia drew critics from the usual places, in the ugliest form.\\n\\nThe terrorist-designated group CAIR launched a counter-protest opposing the March against the inhumane practices of Sharia law. Consider this: while so many patriots were marching in opposition to practices such as female genital mutilation, honor killings, and the stoning of homosexuals, CAIR and their ANTIFA thugs were marching to silence them.\\n\\nOne of the Marchers, Lauren Southern, even reportedly had urine thrown on her by a professional counter-protester.\\n\\nIf one group is marching against Sharia, and another group launches a self-described counter-protest, the logical conclusion is that the counter-protest was marching in favor of such barbarism.\\n\\nThis repulsive behavior is nothing surprising given CAIR's terrorist designation by the United Arab Emirates, and their identity as an un-indicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorist financing trial in American history.\\n\\nThose who march in opposition to the medieval practices of Sharia can expect to be labeled Islamophobic by CAIR, their anti-American enablers at the SPLC, and the deceptive media.\\n\\nEven when moderate Muslims like Mohammed, who organized a March in Atlanta, raise their voice in opposition to Sharia, they are attacked mercilessly by radicals, and brainlessly by leftists.\\n\\nBut with an issue like Sharia, most Americans are coming closer together, while the anti-American zealots drift further into the abyss. Good riddance.\\n\\nIf one can't even put their petty political differences aside to stand with the victims of FGM, Honor Killing, or other Sharia-legitimized violence, let them kick dust and expose themselves for the radicals that they are.\\n\\nNo longer will such Sharia sympathizers be able to disguise themselves as human rights activists or social justice warriors.\\n\\nInstead, they will be recognized by the average American only for their hatred of this country, its foundation, its principles, and its protection.\\n\\nThis also holds true for open borders fanatics in the mainstream media, who falsely and deceptively labeled our organization and opposition to Sharia as anti-Muslim, or even white-supremacist. Right, because a group that stands unwaveringly with Israel and has an Arab woman as its President used an openly gay man to organize a march that included Muslims to advance some white supremacist agenda.\\n\\nCommon sense Americans see these allegations for how fantastically stupid they are.\\n\\nThey're fed up with the PC propagandists trying to bully and intimidate everyone into silence who doesn't go along with their suicidal open borders philosophy.\\n\\nIf there's one thing we can be thankful for, it's that even in a political climate as vicious and divisive as the one we are currently experiencing, we have issues like Sharia that transcend such vitriolic division, and allow us to come together as a melting pot in opposition to it.\\n\\nPhotos courtesy ACT for America.\\n\\nBrigitte Gabriel is a terrorism analyst and a two-time New York Times best-selling author of Because They Hate and They Must Be Stopped.

{"original": "Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) son-in-law, with whom she is close, has troubling ties to the Iranian regime, according to a new book by Peter Schweizer.\\n\\nThe book, Profiles in Corruption, reveals progressive leaders' little-known ties to corrupt businesses and governments and discusses the Massachusetts senator in a chapter.\\n\\nThe chapter details the business deals of Warren's son-in-law, Sushil Tyagi, who is married to her daughter, Amelia. Tyagi was born in India but moved to the United States, where he met Amelia while they were both pursuing MBAs at Wharton Business School.\\n\\nWarren and Tyagi are close. She attended his brother's wedding in India, recounting it in her memoir. She and her husband Bruce Mann in December 2009 served as witnesses for a power of attorney corporate document he filed in India.\\n\\nSince his marriage into the Warren family, Tyagi has been involved in a series of curious—even troubling—business ventures around the world, Schweizer writes.\\n\\nTyagi runs Tricolor Films, and in 2008, produced a film called The Song of Sparrows, directed by Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi.\\n\\nThe film was described as Majidi's most religious and is about a man who is fired from his job on an ostrich farm, moves to the big city and becomes a motorcycle taxi driver, and soon becomes consumed with his passengers' lives and is swept up in a world of greed. It is his family that help him restore his caring and generous nature, according to a film synopsis.\\n\\nTyagi was listed as the film's sole producer on a New York Times page, in credits which have now been deleted. A look back at the page's archive revealed that the film was funded by the Iranian government agency that is overseen by Iranian propagandists.\\n\\nSchweizer writes:\\n\\nThe full credits of the film, for some reason, seem to also have been scrubbed from the internet. We obtained a copy by using the Wayback machine and made a startling discovery: the movie's chief investors included none other than the social deputy of the State Welfare Organization (SWO) of Iran (SWO-معاونت اجتماعی سازمان بهزیستی کشور) as well as the Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran. (سازمان فرهنگی و هنری شهرداری تهران) These two investors in the film might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations—but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran states: This organization was founded in 1996 and [does] its activities under the supervision of a board of trustees composed of various cultural institutions such as IRIB and Islamic propaganda organization.\\n\\nThe Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran's page promotes cultural events such as one for school children entitled The Seal of Hostages, attended by several top Iranian officials, according to the book.\\n\\nAnother event is the inherently antisemitic Quds Day on the last day of Ramadan. The organization also arranges marches, as well as organizes posters and other materials, for Quds Day. Its site says, A new plan for the destruction of Israel will be launched, and the Quds Cultural Radio station will be located at the Radio Station. Also, the 'I love the fight against Israel' is distributed among the people.\\n\\nSchweizer notes, Quds Day typically features massive crowds organized by the Iranian government chanting 'death to America' and burning effigies, with full media coverage.\\n\\nHe writes Tyagi's The Song of Sparrows has film credits that read like who's who of prominent Iranian government institutions. For example, there is a thank-you to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force.\\n\\nThis was during a time of heightened U.S.-Iran tensions, when Washington had accused Iran of assisting in the killing of five American soldiers based in Iraq, and the then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had repeatedly threatened that the United States, which he declared a satanic power, and warned that Israel would disappear from the face of the earth.\\n\\nTyagi also produced another film by Majid Majidi, but even less information is available about this film, Schweizer writes.\\n\\nAccording to the book, a now deleted Web page describes Tyagi's production company this way:\\n\\nLeveraging their relationships with studio executives, access to top creative talent, and the high-level support that they enjoy from numerous foreign governments, this Los Angeles–based production company is developing a number of major international-themed projects for feature films, television, and interactive media.\\n\\nIt is not known what foreign governments those might involve beyond Iran.

{"original": "A Fordham University associate professor in theology claims being pro-life means being pro-illegal immigrant children as well.\\n\\nBeing pro-life means protecting children, including ones not yet born, and often requires protecting and supporting their mothers and families too, wrote Charles Camosy in an op-ed at the New York Times.\\n\\nIn an all-too-familiar rant of liberal moral superiority, Camosy said the Trump administration has created a crisis by separating children from undocumented parents. The social ethicist asserted such a crisis is being ignored by pro-life, pro-family organizations.\\n\\nCamosy failed to mention, however, that the Obama administration also separated illegal children from adults at the U.S.-Mexico border – since children are never housed in adult detention centers – using the same barriers, or cages as the Left calls them when the Trump administration is using them.\\n\\nLike many on the Left who seek to minimize the unlawful actions of people who use children as a means to gain entry to the United States, Camosy employed the term undocumented instead of illegal in his column as he criticized pro-life organizations for not taking a stand on the portrayal of the illegal immigrant situation by the left-wing media.\\n\\nGiven their support of the administration, and an unwillingness to speak critically about immigration policy, 'pro-life, pro-family' organizations now risk being tied to these and other horrific practices, Camosy lectured in a sermon to pro-life conservatives.\\n\\nSo why can't the biggest pro-life organizations join these religious leaders in condemning the administration's treatment of children? he asked disapprovingly. Where is National Right to Life? Where is the Susan B. Anthony List?\\n\\nIn case Camosy's tone of moral superiority had not been detected by this point in his column, he added:\\n\\nIf the traditional pro-life movement is to regain credibility as something other than a tool of the Trump administration, it must speak out clearly and forcefully against harming innocent children as a means of deterring undocumented immigration.\\n\\nThe pro-life Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List), responded to Camosy by questioning his claim that he himself is pro-life.\\n\\nMr. Camosy claims to share SBA List's view that abortion is the taking of an innocent human life, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group's president, said in a statement. Yet, not only does he criticize those who are singularly focused upon restoring the first right, the right to live, he fails to pursue strategies in his party to correct the injustice of abortion. Then he exploits the abortion issue, the intentional taking of a human life by using it as a sub-argument in support of all other issues he believes to impugn human dignity.\\n\\nIn fact, Camosy decided in February 2016 that Catholics could, in good conscience, vote for pro-abortion and pro-same-sex marriage Bernie Sanders, since attending to the needs of the poor – which, he argued, Sanders achieved better than the GOP candidates at the time – is, ultimately, the central teaching of the Church and trumps the protection of life in the womb.\\n\\nWriting at American Thinker, Daniel John Sobieski also responded to Camosy's condescension.\\n\\nDemocrats have stooped to a new low by comparing the separation of children from their illegal alien parents as required by current law to the mass murder of the unborn, including the harvesting and sale of fetal body parts, he observed and added:\\n\\nFirst, these are not immigrant children. They are children of illegal alien parents. Second, no innocent children are being physically harmed in any way, certainly not killed in their mother's womb. The Border Patrol is not Planned Parenthood. If illegal alien parents don't want to be separated from their children, how about not crossing the border illegally with them? This comparison is obscene and slanderous. Abortion and Planned Parenthood separate more kids from their families and mothers than the Border Patrol which, by the way, doesn't kill them in the womb. Liberals such as Camosy, whom I assume supports sanctuary cities, offer no sanctuary for the unborn who also seek to avoid violence and murder in what should be the safest safe space in the world — their mother's womb.\\n\\nPro-life individuals, Sobieski argued, can certainly be anti-open borders in an effort to protect U.S. children and their families from MS-13 gangs and the unaccompanied illegal minors whom they recruit.\\n\\nHow is opposing a system that lets MS-13 butchers, rapists, and murders into this country not pro-life? he asked."}

Last year, authorities in Jordan decided to ban a concert by the band at a famous Roman amphitheater in the kingdom, claiming that the band's songs oppose Jordanian morals.\\n\\nIn response, the band released a statement saying that it was determined not to quit or succumb to pressure meant to restrict their freedom of speech.\\n\\nThe mere fact that the concert was held in Cairo, and especially the flying of the gay pride flag, as well as the massive public response, led senior officials in Egypt to address the issue.\\n\\nAnger from conservatives in the media rose as the scandal dominated social media in the country.\\n\\nPresenter Muhamad al-Geyti used his program Sah al-Noum (Good Morning) to attack the band, saying, All the perverts have gathered in Egypt. This whole abomination took place in the country of the Al-Azhar institution.

He supports the band after hosting it on his show, claiming that he supports homosexuality. They are homos and I wonder how the director of the association of musicians approved a performance by this band in Egypt.\\n\\nSenior television presenter Amro Adeeb also addressed the subject on his show Every Day, saying, I know that the homosexuals will curse me. And as long as they are making their voices and their demands heard, I also get to criticize them. I won't let them oppress me just because I, a straight man, criticize the holding of a party for homosexuals in Egypt.\\n\\nReda Rajab, a secretary of the Association of Musical Professionals, said that the association had decided to cancel all future concerts by the band.\\n\\nWe are not a source of oppression, but these kinds of concerts won't be held in Egypt, he said.\\n\\nIn an interview on the television program The Egyptian Street, Rajab said, The association is against all perverted art. We aren't responsible for these concerts. Concerts require the approval of three sources, of which the association is just one. The Work Ministry and General Security Ministry are the other two sources.\\n\\nMembers of Parliament also condemned the concert and the flying of the gay pride flag. MP Abla al-Hawari, representing the Suhaj district in the Egyptian delta, said that if the concert had been held in the delta, the people would have killed those who participated in the concert.\\n\\nThis is a disgrace, all those (men) who wear earrings and are happy about it, he said. The security forces should arrest those who raised the flag of the perverts.\\n\\nIndeed, a few days after the concert, as investigations into the raising of the gay pride flag progressed, Egyptian security forces announced they had arrested the seven participants in the concert who posted on social media that they are proud of their sexual orientation and the flying of the flag.\\n\\nEgyptian media cited security sources as saying, Due to the abomination shown during the concert, a senior team of investigators has been established and intelligence personnel managed to use security cameras at the concert to identify those who displayed these opinions and raised the flag.\\n\\nThe seven were handed over to Egyptian prosecutors.\\n\\nEgyptian MP Mustafa Bakri said that, in his opinion, this wasn't a spontaneous raising of the flag, but a planned assault on Egypt.\\n\\nAccording to Bakri, the incident came as Western countries are pressuring Egypt to accept gay marriage.

Bush), passed away in April of last year at the age of 92 after a years-long fight with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\\n\\nNevertheless, in June of 2016, Trump gave her a heart attack — sorry, I mean, a heart attack.\\n\\nBarbara Bush blamed Donald Trump for her heart attack. It wasn't technically a heart attack, though she called it that. It was a crisis in her long battle with congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease that hit her like a sledgehammer one day in June 2016. An ambulance was called to take her to the hospital. The two former presidents who had been at home with her that day, her husband and her oldest son, trailed in a car driven by the Secret Service. The tumultuous presidential campaign in general and Trump's ridicule of son Jeb Bush in particular had riled her. Angst, she told me. Afterward, Jeb, whose presidential campaign was already history, urged her to let it go, to focus on herself and have faith in the country. There's just a lot of angst among those distressed by President Trump's leadership, Jeb Bush told me, using the same word that his mother had used. So I think one of the solutions is don't watch it; don't obsess. Jeb said, 'Mom, don't worry about things you can't do anything about,'  Barbara Bush recalled. He's right. Just do good, make life better for someone else.\\n\\nThis is an excerpt from Susan Page's upcoming biography, The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty, published Wednesday by the far-left USA Today.\\n\\nAnd it's fake news.\\n\\nAs you can see, the headline debunks itself in the next sentence. On top of that, Bush was 90 or 91 at the time and already sick with COPD … but we gotta sell some books, smear Trump, keep the hate campaign against the president going….\\n\\nThis particular anecdote is also deeply unflattering to Mrs. Bush.\\n\\nBy this time, Jeb(!) had already dropped out of his hapless low-energy bid for the 2016 Republican nomination, so why would a 90-year-old woman who had already been through four decades of the political wringer allow a presidential primary, allow a Donald Trump, allow anything other than a family crisis to discombobulate her to where she had a fake heart attack?\\n\\nThere's more…\\n\\nWhen asked in February of 2018 if she was still a Republican,. She said, I'd probably say no today.\\n\\nAnd then there's this…\\n\\nI woke up and discovered, to my horror, that Trump had won. She didn't hide her horror from those close to her. After Trump was elected, a friend in Kennebunkport gave her a Trump countdown clock as a joke. The red, white, and blue digital clock displayed how many days, hours, minutes and seconds remained in Trump's term. She parked it on the side table in her bedroom, next to the chair she would sit in to needlepoint or watch television. She liked the countdown clock so much that when the Bushes returned to Houston that October, she brought it with her. It sat on her bedside table, where she could see it every day. It was there to the day she died.\\n\\nYou know, I have no idea how I'm going to exit this life. I might be found under a stripper covered in cocaine dust or buried under all the cans of food amassed in my doomsday prepping, but I sure as hell know how I'm not going out — and that's while obsessing to the point of fake heart attacks over politics, or who's president, or glued to the criminal stupidity of cable news.\\n\\nBarbara Bush literally had everything — a fairytale marriage, wealth, success, a place in history, a tight-knit family, countless grandkids and great-grandkids… And still.\\n\\nYou have almost have to feel some pity for someone buried in monetary and familial wealth who still allows a politician to undermine her peace of mind, to in any way affect what should have been the most contented winter years imaginable.\\n\\nHonestly, Barbara Bush always struck me as a much stronger woman than this, someone with poise and self-control. Even more surprising is that she would admit to such a thing. If that were me, I would at least have the self-respect to keep something so embarrassing to myself.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here."}
{"original": "A Washington Post article published this week criticizes bias in political science articles on Wikipedia. However, rather than attacking the left-wing bias afflicting political articles, the author argues instead the problem is articles not citing enough female authors and academics. The author, Samuel Baltz, boasted of trying to fix this bias by expanding coverage of women in political articles, while otherwise celebrating Wikipedia's political and ideological neutrality in its coverage.\\n\\nThe piece comes one week after Fox News reported Wikipedia articles on communism and socialism were whitewashed of atrocities committed by governments that adopted those ideologies. Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger criticized the site's left-wing bias in the same piece stating neutrality was long gone on Wikipedia.\\n\\nBaltz, himself a political scientist, stated Wikipedia is widely praised for its success in spreading reliable information about political events. He further claimed misinformation is largely suppressed on breaking news events. While praising the site's impressive record of political and ideological neutrality in his piece, Baltz also claimed, it has serious biases in its coverage of political topics. Those biases, Baltz claimed, include focusing too much on wealthy countries and too little on women. Such a narrative is consistent with other corporate media, who praise Wikipedia as a tool against fake news yet routinely criticize its diversity issues.\\n\\nOne of the main instances of bias Baltz identified is many articles on political topics, such as the Electoral College, citing men more than women to an extent he claims is disproportionate to their representation in the political science field. He stated of the dozen academic citations on the Electoral College's Wikipedia page, only one had a woman as the primary author. Baltz also criticized the article on democracy, stating only 10 percent of the works in the article's further reading section listed a woman as the first author. He cited similarly low percentages for articles on conservatism (11 percent), socialism (3 percent), and dictatorship (0 percent).\\n\\nPart of why Baltz claims this is a problem is the fact studies suggest Wikipedia can shape scientific literature. He claims groups underrepresented in academia tend to be missing at an even higher rate on Wikipedia and together this means Wikipedia does not just passively reflect biases. It amplifies and reinforces them. Baltz further criticizes Wikipedia claiming only 20 percent of political scientists with articles are women when 30 percent of political scientists are reportedly women. He raises a similar issue with nearly half of articles on political scientists being Americans.\\n\\nIn order to combat this perceived bias, Baltz states he spent 2020 editing Wikipedia to create or expand articles about female political scientists and increase citations to women on political articles. Under the name Astrophobe on Wikipedia, Baltz claims to have created 264 pages about female political scientists. Reviewing several articles he claimed, many seem to push the boundaries of notability standards on the site, which require significant coverage in secondary sources, evidence of a major impact on an academic field, or holding prominent posts at major academic institutions. One article cited much of its contents to the academic's own work.\\n\\nConcluding his piece, Baltz states his efforts only marginally improved the coverage of women on political science topics and increased citations of women even less. He argues more effort is necessary and calls for organized action to expand coverage of women on political topics as well as increase citations of women, noting feminist activist campaigns to increase coverage of women on other topics. While many progressive critics of Wikipedia push for more efforts favoring women citing an alleged gender gap on the site, a study released last year found these campaigns have over-corrected in some areas and tilted content disproportionately towards women.\\n\\nJust a week prior to Baltz's Washington Post article criticizing bias against women on political articles, Fox News released a report noting significant ideological bias on Wikipedia, something Baltz claims is less of an issue. One of the articles Baltz criticized for not citing enough women, the article on socialism, was found by Fox to be whitewashed of atrocities committed by self-proclaimed socialist governments. This included the socialism article praising the technological achievements of the Soviet Union, while referencing the excesses of Stalin's regime without elaborating. A section about Asia left repressive actions in China under Mao unmentioned but did mention Indonesia's anti-communist mass-killings.\\n\\nIn addition to citing similar whitewashing on Wikipedia's communism article, Fox interviewed co-founder Sanger about political bias on the site. He told Fox News, The days of Wikipedia's robust commitment to neutrality are long gone. Sanger further stated: Wikipedia's ideological and religious bias is real and troubling, particularly in a resource that continues to be treated by many as an unbiased reference work. Last year, Sanger published a blog post on Wikipedia's left-wing bias where he analyzed other political articles, such as the pages on Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. In the post, he declared the site's neutrality policy dead on the basis of its left-wing political bias.\\n\\nWhile media dismiss political bias on Wikipedia in favor of attacking it over diversity complaints, numerous studies and analyses have increasingly found evidence for a political bias on the site. Bias has been evident with editors actively supporting Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and Joe Biden's 2020 Presidential campaign. Baltz himself is member of a Black Lives Matter group on Wikipedia, which one administrator with special privileges on the site joined by declaring: You can be one of three things: ally, enemy, or collaborator.\\n\\nRelying on this diversity push, editors last year sparked outcry from family and Christian organizations by banning profile pages from expressing support for traditional marriage. The site's owners also endorsed Black Lives Matter, declaring no neutral stance on racial justice issues. At the same time, they pushed a left-wing code of conduct requiring, among other things, using preferred pronouns on Wikipedia and affiliated sites. The code was approved earlier this month. However, corporate media ignore this increasing left-wing bias and instead rely on Wikipedia as a source of information, even encouraging widespread utilization by Big Tech.\\n\\nT. D. Adler edited Wikipedia as The Devil's Advocate. He was banned after privately reporting conflict of interest editing by one of the site's administrators. Due to previous witch-hunts led by mainstream Wikipedians against their critics, Adler writes under an alias."}
{"original": "The UK Independence Party is bigger than one person. So we have often been told when opponents of the party behind Brexit try to claim it has been a one man band under the leadership of Nigel Farage for so many years.\\n\\nIt's true. Lots of what happens in UKIP could not have occurred without many of the behind the scenes forces, the local councillors, the activists, and back office staff. But lets also face facts: a figurehead like Farage was the driving force behind the party, and the sole, anthropomorphic inspiration for those who pounded the pavements and helped (and are still helping) lead Britain out of the European Union.\\n\\nSo how then, can I write a headline suggesting if one person is denied the opportunity to stand at the General Election on June 8th, that UKIP is finished?\\n\\nVery easily.\\n\\nAnne Marie Waters, who, I reported in 2016, was banned from standing for UKIP in the London elections, is emblematic for Paul Nuttall's party in 2017.\\n\\nA former Labour Party activist, Anne Marie now runs the Shariah Watch organisation, as well as having built the UK branch of the PEGIDA movement. She epitomizes an issue UKIP has always talked a big game on, but rarely ever delivered upon: freedom of conscience.\\n\\nFrom the debacle surrounding same sex marriage — which finds its roots in Deputy Chairman Suzanne Evans's London liberalism — to radical Islam, UKIP has consistently come up short.\\n\\nNow it seems the party will prevent Anne Marie from standing again, for comments she has made about the tyrannical and anti-human rights elements of Islam, found within the Quran.\\n\\nThe official UKIP line is, The nomination was not ratified by the [National Executive Committee]. My official line back is something along the lines of what Nigel Farage once said about the committee.\\n\\nWhy shouldn't she feel free to express this and expect support from her party, unless what she is saying is fundamentally untrue (Spoiler: it's not).\\n\\nThe fact is the UK Independence Party has been pusillanimous on this issue for years. Only Lord Pearson, a friend of the Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders, attempted to grasp the nettle on Islam, Shariah, and the issues emanating from migrant communities whose sons and daughters are not only failing to integrate, but are becoming more and more radical as time passes.\\n\\nWhat does UKIP think is going to happen, if it doesn't take a stand?\\n\\nWill Theresa May, pictured here, take a firm stance against this scourge of theocratic and cultural extremism?\\n\\nDoes someone in UKIP HQ believe Jeremy (Hamas) Corbyn will lead the charge?\\n\\nIf the answer to these questions are No (which they obviously are) then UKIP has a duty to not only stand by someone like Anne Marie Waters — by which I don't mean adopting everything she says as policy, but at least defend her right to express her opinions on the matter — or face certain electoral death.\\n\\nAs she told me, in a report you can find here, The party needs a change in direction if it to survive, and perhaps that change will come after the general election.\\n\\nMy genuine fear is that might just be too late.\\n\\nHow could the party die by sidelining the likes of Anne Marie? Easily. People will begin to view it as politically correct, opportunistic, cowardly, and hypocritical. And frankly, we've already got the Conservative Party for that.\\n\\nRaheem Kassam is the Editor-in-Chief of Breitbart London and tweets at @RaheemKassam"}

{"original": "The Christian Post has denounced the World Council of Churches (WCC) for its historic and current antisemitism, accusing the WCC of blatant fabrication in its description of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\n\\nThe Christian Post's hard-hitting essay Saturday was penned by two guest contributors, Rabbi Abraham Cooper and Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein, both of whom occupy leadership roles at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\\n\\nThe authors accuse Rev. Frank Chikane, moderator of the WCC's Commission of the Churches on International Affairs (CCIA), of calling on Christianity to revert to its worst medieval Jew-hatred in a recent Zoom call.\\n\\nWe need to begin to say to those who support Israel to brutalize Palestinians that the blood of the people of Palestine will be sought from them because they collaborate by allowing this system to continue, said Chikane, a South African Pentecostal pastor.\\n\\nFor those who will not work towards delegitimizing the entire system (aka the State of Israel) that facilitates daily 'brutality' against Palestinians, he intoned a curse, 'The blood of the people of Palestine will be upon them,' the essay states.\\n\\nEvery day people get killed, said Chikane, a declaration described as a blatant fabrication by the two rabbis, unless he means those who are stopped in their attempt to thrust knives into Israeli civilians.\\n\\nIn responding to the controversy, the WCC itself declared that during the Zoom meeting Chikane was speaking in his own personal capacity, not as a spokesperson for the WCC.\\n\\nNonetheless, in their Christian Post article, the rabbis assert that the WCC's anti-Israel policy predates Chikane by decades.\\n\\nThe WCC chose not support the establishment of the Jewish State in 1948, warning instead that its political complexity might invite more global anti-Semitism, they state.\\n\\nThe WCC also blamed Israel for inspiring the fears of its neighbors Egypt, Syria, and Jordan at the time of the Six Day War in 1967 because of Israel's dynamism and possible expansion, they declare.\\n\\nIn the 70s and 80s, the WCC's contempt for Israel continued apace, they add. Regularly, it condemned Israel, while failing to criticize Arab terror attacks.\\n\\nMoreover, the authors insist, while the WCC was busy doubling down on Israel, there was little or no criticisms of the truly brutal regimes in Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, China, and Iran.\\n\\nThe Soviets used influence to ensure that the WCC did not criticize its invasions of Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia, they state.\\n\\nThe rabbis' criticism of the WCC, especially regarding the group's affinity for communist regimes, dovetails with testimony given by the former head of Communist Romania's secret police in 2015.\\n\\nIon Mihai Pacepa, a 3-star general who defected to the United States in 1978, asserted that the Theology of Liberation was the creation of the KGB, who exported it to Latin America as a way of introducing Marxism into the continent.\\n\\nLiberation theology has been generally understood to be a marriage of Marxism and Christianity, Pacepa said. What has not been understood is that it was not the product of Christians who pursued Communism, but of Communists who pursued Christians.\\n\\nPacepa said that Liberation Theology was born of a 1960s top-secret Party-State Dezinformatsiya Program approved by Aleksandr Shelepin, the chairman of the KGB, and by Politburo member Aleksey Kirichenko, who coordinated the Communist Party's international policies.\\n\\nThe program mandated that the KGB take secret control of the World Council of Churches (WCC), based in Geneva, Switzerland, and use it as cover for converting Liberation Theology into a South American revolutionary tool, Pacepa said.\\n\\nThe Soviets were aware that the WCC was the largest international ecumenical organization after the Vatican, he said, representing some 550 million Christians of various denominations throughout 120 countries.\\n\\nIn a curious coincidence, in 1983, Chikane became the general-secretary of the Institute for Contextual Theology, a Christian think-tank inside the South African Council of Churches that promoted Liberation Theology.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

But to be castigated with the same brush that they did Micah Johnson would be the equivalent of me telling you all white people think like Dylan Roof, and that would be deeply offensive. And to allow somebody to say that on air —and to go unchallenged and say that on air because a lot of people want that narrative because it edifies their perspective.\\n\\nHe added, I think there was nothing loving about that situation.

It is ridiculous when you have a person who has set up some of the most heinous things that have happened to black people in this country, and to say something like that every time somebody says something about injustice, they are the terrorists. MLK would be considered a terrorist, Gandhi was a terrorist, Mandela was a terrorist. And all they were trying to do was fight for justice. And to me, when old white men tell black men how to act, that's the most ridiculous thing in the world.

{"original": "Writer-director S. Craig Zahler's Brawl in Cell Block 99 (2017) caught my attention like no movie in a long while. Outside of being a superbly crafted and satisfying grinder, it was the smaller elements that grabbed me, most especially the abortionist.\\n\\nVince Vaughn plays Brad — sorry, Bradley — a retired boxer, drug dealer, and substance abuser who goes straight until straight nearly costs him the thing he loves most: his wife (Jennifer Carpenter). A miscarriage and barely tolerable existence on a tow-truck driver's salary (a job he just lost) has undermined the marriage to where she's having an empty sexual affair.\\n\\nFaced with the intolerable prospect of losing her, Zahler has Bradley make the kind of contradictory decisions that create unforgettable characters. In the most Christian way imaginable he forgives her completely — and in order to save the marriage he returns to drug running.\\n\\nThings improve. Everything's cherry. Nice suburban house. Nice cars. The wife's pregnant. The marriage is solid. But Brad's moral code destroys everything when a deal goes sideways. He could walk away. He could go straight home, resume his life. No one would blame him. Instead, his decency forces him to take the kind of action that drops him into the worst possible situation. On top of seven years in prison, the cartel wants him dead, and this is where things get interesting…\\n\\nThe existential threat held over Bradley is an abortionist, is the horror of having his unborn baby girl, a child he already adores, cut into small pieces and mailed to him. In Cell Block 99, the unborn are not a fetus or a clump of cells, they are a blessed event and in its own pulpy way, we are forced to come to terms with the fact that abortion truly is murder.\\n\\nThere are even smaller things. Bradley's proud to hang Old Glory over his house and on top of being a cool, stoic badass, he listens to Christian rock.\\n\\nFinally, there's Bradley's drug dealer-boss Gil (Marc Blucas), an upper middle-class white guy who, upon introduction, matter-of-factly fires off a series of politically incorrect statements about mineral water being gay and Mexicans always traveling with big families. And yet, Gil doesn't seem to say these things out of a racial malevolence but rather for the pleasure of being an outlaw in a world increasingly ruled by the fascism of political correctness.\\n\\nIn the provincial and increasingly simple-minded world of Hollywood, casual racism is usually the telliest tell of all, its own kind of tired spoiler that predictably informs us that Gil is either a villain or will suffer a comeuppance — because that's what today's Production Code of Political Correctness requires. In the end, though, Gil steps up, and within the context of the situation, is revealed to be both heroic and loyal.\\n\\nWhat a fascinating and surprising choice for Zahler to make.\\n\\nIn most every interview he sits down for, Zahler is pretty much berated over his politics, his non-conformity, his refusal to adhere to the Production Code of Political Correctness. In other words, he's called on the carpet and told to explain himself — Are you now or have you ever been a Republican! But Zahler — God bless him — refuses to answer. Other then confessing to being an atheist Jew, Zahler will only say his films do not express a point of view, that his only goal is to create something compelling.\\n\\nI, for one, believe him…\\n\\nIf you want to bleed art into something bland, the fastest route is through ideological conformity. Audiences are pretty smart these days and after two decades of this shit, we're starting to roll our eyes. As tired of these tells as the rest of us, Zahler has chosen instead to be an artist who surprises, who thrills in ways big and small, who zigs where other artists, either out of fear or a lack of imagination, censor themselves.\\n\\nThreatening our hero with abortion? A character who says racist shit is not a one-dimensional cross burner? A drug dealing protagonist who's also a devoted family man, Christian, and patriot?\\n\\nMore, please.\\n\\nBrawl in Cell Block 99 is so perfectly structured and executed, you'd love it even without Zahler's iconoclastic approach towards his characters, but it's that approach that lifts the movie into something surprising, fascinating, and unforgettable.\\n\\nDragged Across Concrete? Even more so.\\n\\nNormally, I don't read reviews until mine is complete. Only the film should inform my perspective. Unsure I'd have access to Dragged (thankfully it was also released on VOD), I took a peek at what others are saying and came away with one overall impression: while most critics gave it a passing grade, many of these so-called progressives who condemned the film as racist exposed their own latent racism with all their talk about Dragged's two stars.\\n\\nTwo stars?\\n\\nWhat about Tory Kittles?\\n\\nAnyone who watches Dragged and sees only two stars — Vince Vaughn and Mel Gibson — should ask themselves why they're overlooking the magnificent work of Tory Kittles, a black actor every bit as charismatic as Gibson and Vaughn, a remarkable presence who very nearly steals a movie that mostly belongs to his character, Slim.\\n\\nBut let's back up a bit…\\n\\nDragged is not, as its reactionary critics suggest, about white men who fear losing their place in a changing world. A few off-color remarks, a couple of politically incorrect punchlines, and confronting the reality — yes, the reality — of what life is like for a white person in a deteriorating neighborhood with a predominantly black population, is not what Dragged is about. I'll get to all of that in a bit, but let's start with what Dragged really is about … and that's duty to family.\\n\\nSlim comes home from prison eager to go straight until he discovers his mother is back on drugs and hooking while his handicapped younger brother is locked in a bedroom.\\n\\nRidgeman (Gibson) is a 60-year-old cop running out of time to fulfill his patriarchal duty. His ex-cop wife (Laurie Holden) has MS and his daughter is constantly being racially-bullied. He needs money to move before something even worse happens to a little girl on the edge of womanhood.\\n\\nLurasetti (Vaughn) is desperately in love with a professional woman way out of his league and looking for every edge to hold on to her, including an engagement ring he couldn't afford even before the suspension.\\n\\nThe suspension is what drives everything.\\n\\nLurasetti and Ridgeman are caught on video mildly (at least when compared to Rodney King or what we usually see in movies) roughing up a big-time, Hispanic drug dealer. In a terrific scene, their boss (and Ridgeman's former partner — played by the great Don Johnson) explains the sorry ways of a sorry world — a world where the entertainment industry we now call the news media needs a villain, where the handling of every perceived intolerance is done with total intolerance.\\n\\nAt the same time, though, he doesn't let them off the hook. While Ridgeman undoubtedly would have treated a white dealer the same way and is about to be unfairly crucified as a racist by the Roman circus the news media has become, he still went too far and needs to box the compass of his humanity.\\n\\nFurious and desperate, Ridgeman decides We have the skills and the right to acquire proper compensation.\\n\\nLurasetti is not so sure, but he's loyal to his partner and thinking about the kind of future I can offer my girlfriend.\\n\\nSo the long and oddly fascinating stakeout of a drug dealer begins, the idea being to grab a payday that will get them through the suspension and over the speedbump keeping them from a better life.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Slim's making similar moves and a collision between these three characters (who have a whole lot more in common than not) twists a knot in your gut that lingers long after the credits roll.\\n\\nZahler takes his sweet time with everything, an approach that is the opposite of dull. At two hours and forty minutes and almost no action until the last half-hour, he wants us to get to know his characters, even a bank employee (Jennifer Carpenter) so devoted to her newborn baby she can barely return to work after a three month maternity leave (Imagine that — a movie that depicts a professional woman desperate to be home with her baby, to be a full-time mother).\\n\\nAnd in getting to know these characters, we are invited to spend time with realistic people as they are, and to do so without being lectured about the appropriate opinions to hold of them.\\n\\nSome critics are screaming homophobia because Ridgeman and Lurasetti comment on how you can no longer tell if a singer is a man or woman, because Ridgeman jokes about Lurasetti's choice of hair product being gay. Gimme a break.\\n\\nSome critics are angry because Laurie Holden's character admits to feeling guilty, feeling like a racist over what's happening to her daughter and what she fears will happen to her daughter.\\n\\nSome truly stupid critics are screaming racism because Dragged's arch-villain actually is a virulent racist, but these critics are forgetting that he's the, uh, arch-villain — you know, the guy Zahler wants us to hiss. But this racist psycho (whose face we never see) is something more, a way for Zahler to distinguish between actual racism and the complicated realities of the human condition.\\n\\nLike the Ridgemans, I'm a white person who was once forced by economic circumstance to live, work, and go to school for more than two years in a mostly black ghetto. I promise you there is no shortage of black people who will warn a white person against such a thing. You see, it simply doesn't matter that 99.99 percent of your neighbors are good people. All it takes is one bully to single you out for your skin color.\\n\\nZahler deserves credit for reflecting this reality, and I dare anyone tut-tutting him over this perfectly valid artistic choice to test this reality.\\n\\nZahler's most brilliant choice, though — a choice that again forces us to see the difference between shit talk and true racism — is the woman Lurasetti wants to marry: a beautiful, accomplished black woman whose skin color is never mentioned, not even by Ridgeman.\\n\\nIt's also worth mentioning that Zahler isn't paving new ground here, he's merely rewinding his art back to a freer time, to the wonderful era of 70's filmmaking.\\n\\nThe French Connection's Popeye Doyle (Oscar-winner Gene Hackman) and The Stone Killer's Lou Torrey (Charles Bronson), The Taking of Pelham One Two Three's Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), and Across 110th Street's Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) — I could go on and on — all make Ridgeman and Lurasetti look woke.\\n\\nYou see, once upon a time, in that glorious era between the original Production Code and today's increasingly oppressive Production Code of Political Correctness, movies weren't afraid to get real, to offer us characters in all their complexities, to reflect them through a humanist prism — flaws and all. Unlike today, though, this was not done to give insufferably pious storytellers the opportunity to virtue signal; it was done for the sake of art — to create the most compelling and memorable characters possible.\\n\\nThat kind of artistic integrity has nearly been eradicated by the corporate conformists and fascists who seek to rule American culture, so we must pay attention to Zahler, the rare artist with that integrity and an extraordinary gift for storytelling.\\n\\nDragged Across Concrete is utterly hypnotic. I never wanted it to end, and I am going to watch it again today. And then I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and give Zahler's debut, Bone Tomahawk (2015), another look. This time with the attention it deserves.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here."}

Severiano Martinez-Rojas was also sentenced in related case in the Northern District of Georgia, according to the DOJ.\\n\\nTwo years ago, Breitbart News reported Jovan Rendon-Reyes, Saul Rendon-Reyes, Felix Rojas, Odilon Martinez-Rojas and Severiano Martinez-Rojas pled guilty to substantive offenses of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.\\n\\nIn a prepared statement, Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said, These well-deserved sentences reflect the gravity of the human trafficking crimes these defendants committed.\\n\\nWhitaker added, The defendants operated an extensive sex trafficking enterprise that preyed on vulnerable young women and girls, deceiving them with false promises, coercing their compliance, and compelling them into submission through beatings, threats, isolation, and intimidation.\\n\\nAccording to the press release, court documents filed between December 2004 and November 2015 revealed traffickers targeted vulnerable young women, some as young as 14 years old, from impoverished areas of Mexico and Central America. Rendon-Reyes male members often used false promises of love and marriage to lure their victims into sexual slavery where they forced victims to perform as many as 45 sex acts a night and took all of the prostitution proceeds, funneling the money back to Mexico.\\n\\nThese individuals will now face the consequences of their callous criminal actions exploiting women and girls whom they forced into sex slavery for profit, said Derek Benner, executive associate director of Homeland Security Investigations. Investigating human trafficking remains a priority for HSI, whose primary focus is to rescue victims and release them from the grip of their captors.\\n\\nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard Donoghue called the crimes committed by Rendon-Reyes Trafficking Organization members brutal and shocking. He hoped these lengthy sentences would give the victims in this case some sense of justice.\\n\\nThree more defendants who are also Mexican nationals will be sentenced on January 15, according to the press release. They are Jose Gusano Rendon-Garcia, 35; Guillermina Rendon-Reyes, 48; and Francisco Pancho Rendon-Reyes, 30. The court will determine what all those sentenced will pay in restitution.\\n\\nWhitaker credited the successful prosecutions of the Rendon-Reyes crime syndicate to strong partnerships among the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, the New York Office of the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations and their Mexican law enforcement counterparts.\\n\\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Facebook and Twitter."}
{"original": "Legislation proposed in Canada by Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party would seek to ban criticism of transgender people or the gender fluid ideology, with violators facing up to two years in jail when found guilty.\\n\\nThe bill would redefine hate speech under the Canadian Criminal Code as well as the Canada Human Rights act, to include any speech that promotes hatred towards a gender identity or expression.\\n\\nIn a statement issued to commemorate the 'International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia,' Trudeau said As a society, we have taken many important steps toward recognising and protecting the legal rights for the LGBTQ2 community – from enshrining equality rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the passage of the Civil Marriage Act.\\n\\nThere remains much to be done, though. Far too many people still face harassment, discrimination, and violence for being who they are. This is unacceptable.\\n\\nTo do its part, the Government of Canada today will introduce legislation that will help ensure transgender and other gender-diverse people can live according to their gender identity, free from discrimination, and protected from hate propaganda and hate crimes, it continued.\\n\\nThe bill, proposed last week, states that This enactment amends the Canadian Human Rights Act to add gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination.\\n\\nIt seeks to extend the protection against hate propaganda set out in that Act to any section of the public that is distinguished by gender identity or expression and to clearly set out that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on gender identity.\\n\\nRoughly speaking, the transgender ideology claims people's feelings about their maleness or femaleness, also known as gender, should be endorsed by the state. For example, if a women says she feels like a man, she should be treated as a man by the law and by society and by other individuals, according to this viewpoint.\\n\\nThis idea of fluid gender is in contrast to science-backed view that men and women are born into unchangeably male or female bodies, and that society should help boys and girls, men and women, get the best from their bodies by allowing them sexual privacy and sex-specific facilities and sport leagues. This view also argues that people should create civic rules to help cooperation between the two complementary but different, equal and unchangeable sexes. The most important cooperation, for example, is civic support for marriage and childrearing.\\n\\nPro-transgender activists oppose laws and civic culture that promote the existence of the two distinct sexes, which they criticize as the gender binary.\\n\\nCanadian law currently prohibits anti-gay hate propaganda, however, proposed legislation promoting transgender rights by New Democratic Party was rejected last year.\\n\\nPrime Minister Trudeau has previously described himself as a feminist, and has been quoted as saying I'll keep calling myself one until there's no reaction.

We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family.\\n\\nWe have been deeply touched by the incredible outpouring of love and support we have received from close friends, supporters and fans all around the world. Thank you for your compassion and prayers. We have felt your love for Aretha and it brings us comfort to know that her legacy will live on.

{"original": "The immigration debate and the November election are not merely about a border wall or immigration levels, but are about whether the United States is and will remain a Nation of Immigrants, says Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.\\n\\nTo deny our birthright as a nation [of immigrants] is to really defy who we are, what we are and what we will be, Durbin, the Democrats' deputy leader in the Senate, told NPR.\\n\\nBut if America must be a Nation of Immigrants, then Americans and their children cannot have a normal nation or even normal pocketbook politics, said John Fonte, director of Center for American Common Culture at the D.C.-based Hudson Institute.\\n\\nIn Durbin's Nation of Immigrants — including legal and illegal — politics is all about enforced Diversity, Fonte said. The central elite treats people as members of competing identity groups and then balances each diverse group against the others to achieve politicians' goals, such as a desired percentage of women serving as fighter pilots in the U.S. Navy, Fonte said.\\n\\nIn contrast, in a nation of American citizens — both native-borns and assimilated immigrants — people impose their political goals in the normal give-and-take of bread-and-butter politics, in local, state and federal levels, he said.\\n\\nDurbin's Nation of Immigrants claim came during an NPR interview, where he talked about the Democrats' February 15 refusal to accept President Donald Trump's popular amnesty-and-reform offer — and the importance of the 2018 elections in deciding the immigration issue.\\n\\nTrump has offered to amnesty 1.8 million 'DACA' illegals in exchange for a four-part reform — construction of a border wall, closure of border legal loopholes, ending the visa lottery and gradually ending chain-migration around 2030. Durbin has led the opposition to Trump's push, and also pushed his unpopular policies of amnesty, immigration, and diversity throughout the debate. On January 15, for example, Durbin told reporters:\\n\\nI'm focused on one thing — not that meeting [with Trump] — but on making sure that those who are being protected by DACA and eligible for the DREAM Act have a future in America. I am focused on that full time.\\n\\nThe underlying fight in the immigration debate is the nature of the United States, said Durbin, who wants the United States to be a nation of immigrants, not a nation of Americans. He told NPR:\\n\\nIt turned out that this debate was not about a wall. It was about a new immigration policy in America. It was about rejecting the notion that we are a nation of immigrants. Last week, one of our major federal agencies deleted that term, said we no longer want to have that as our mission statement, that America is a nation of immigrants. To deny our birthright as a nation is to really defy who we are, what we are and what we will be.\\n\\nDurin's reference to a 'major federal agency' likely refers to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services which declared February 22 a shift in focus away from serving foreign customers, and dropped the nation of immigrants rhetoric from its mission statement. Instead, Trump's appointee stressed a focus on Americans' priorities and assimilating immigrants:\\n\\nThe American people, through Congress, have entrusted USCIS with the stewardship of our legal immigration programs that allow foreign nationals to visit, work, live, and seek refuge in the United States. We are also responsible for ensuring that those who naturalize are dedicated to this country, share our values, assimilate into our communities, and understand their responsibility to help preserve our freedom and liberty.\\n\\nDurbin slammed Trump's policies without explaining — or being asked by NPR to explain — what is objectionable about Trump's view of America, where borders are deemed vital.\\n\\nA nation WITHOUT BORDERS is not a nation at all. We must have a wall. The rule of law matters. Jeb just doesn't get it. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2015\\n\\nDurbin suggested that the United States' strength is made greater by a huge cross-border inflow of non-European or non-white partway assimilated immigrants — the face of immigration … from many different places … [with] background differences. He said:\\n\\nYou know, [Trump's] goal in changing the face of immigration in America is one that I will never buy into. You know, we have a diverse nation, and that is our strength as far as I'm concerned. We come from many different places, all proud to be Americans, all working together as an American team, if you will. But we do have these background differences. And for this president to say that for the first time in 90 years he wants to dramatically cut legal immigration in America, that is a complete reversal of the policy of immigration that we've had since 1965.\\n\\nDurbin's 1965 reference is to the 1965 immigration law which dramatically expanded the inflow of non-European migrants to the United States. Durbin seems to argue that the 1965 law is a permanent, unreformable, unchangeable birthright that must determine the future identity of the United States, or as he described it earlier, to deny our birthright as a nation is to really defy who we are, what we are and what we will be.\\n\\nThis [November] election, the election of new members to the House and to the Senate, will decide the fate of this issue, Durbin declared.\\n\\nBut Durbin's depiction of American history is simply wrong, and so is Durbin's claim that Americans have no choice in the matter, said Fonte.\\n\\nAmerica is a country created by settlers mostly from the British Isles, said Fonte. Later immigrants assimilated to the settlers' culture, while influencing it to some degree. The Nation of Immigrants claim is utter nonsense, as historical fact, he said.\\n\\nThe Nation of Immigrants claim is also a political slogan which is intended to transform individualist American politics into a battle between identity groups under the supervision of an elite, he said. It is a propaganda slogan, it is agitprop, to promote [the idea of] 'Diversity,' to impose equality of outcomes, instead of the United State's culture of individual freedom, he said.\\n\\nThat focus on enforced variety and equality of outcomes is a spinoff of economic-minded Marxism, dubbed cultural Marxism because it seeks to demolish popular culture — such as families and marriage, idealism, churches, civic clubs –which puts up obstacles to elite rule, he said.\\n\\nDurbin's pitch also includes elements of Italian-style left-wing corporate fascism, which also wanted to classify and organize politics around fixed groups of people, such as business leaders, industrial workers or farmers, Fonte said. Under the rule of government-imposed diversity, people are just clients of the administrative state, not citizens of their country, he said.\\n\\nDurbin's diversity claim is a form of Marxism, of fascist corporatism, of imperial rule — this is how the Ottomans ran their empire, Fonte said. This 'divide and conquer' is how the British Empire worked – you put different tribes [identities] against each other.\\n\\nIn contrast, American culture is built to help Americans, not rulers, Fonte said. Unlike Durbin's claim that 'Diversity is our strength' Americans have favored the idea of E Pluribus Unum … 'Out of Many, One, he said, allowing free citizens to pursue their freedoms in a coherent culture and society.\\n\\nThe choice of citizenship is the middle-ground position, said Fonte, between the extremes of Durbin's elitist combination of Marxism and fascism, and of the libertarians' vision of America as a consumer mall that is governed by contracts between buyers and sellers.\\n\\nSo Durbin's push for a National of Immigrants is a cloaked campaign against the right of a free people to rule themselves — that is really what is at stake here, said Fonte.\\n\\nThat push comes again in November when Democrats will try to block Trump by defeating GOP candidates. I don't know what lies ahead in terms of the midterm elections, Durbin said. But I remind all of my friends who feel as I do about this issue, this election, the election of new members to the House and to the Senate, will decide the fate of this issue.\\n\\nThe NPR interview of Durbin was a softball interview, almost laughable, said Fonte. That is because most journalists are part of the cultural Leviathan … they are on the same cultural page, they've just absorbed this [in college]… it is group-think, it is lockstep.\\n\\nNeither NPR nor Durbin's office answered questions from Breitbart News about the interview.\\n\\nPolls show most Americans support Trump's view of America as a nation of Americans, wrapped in a network of mutual obligations.\\n\\nImmigration polls which ask people to pick a priority, or to decide which options are fair, show that voters in the polling booth put a high priority on helping their families and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech, high-immigration, low-wage economy. Those results are very different from the Nation of Immigrants polls which are funded by CEOs and progressives, and which pressure Americans to say they welcome migrants.\\n\\nDurbin's Nation of Immigrants view also has huge economic implications.\\n\\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market. But the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.\\n\\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people, it floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions."}

{"original": "Faith Whittlesey, President Ronald Reagan's ambassador to Switzerland, who helped popularize the message of the Reagan Revolution and advocated for a staunch, traditional conservatism for decades, passed away Monday at 79.\\n\\nWhittlesey, lately of Delray Beach, Florida, succumbed to a long bout with cancer in Washington, DC, surrounded by family and friends.\\n\\nBorn in 1939 in Jersey City, New Jersey, where her father worked as a railroad billing clerk, she rose to become an advisor — and friend — of government and corporate leaders around the world in the complex arenas of political intelligence and strategy as well a pioneering woman in the legal profession and the conservative movement.\\n\\nWhittlesey graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1963 and clerked with Judge Francis Van Dusen of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania when, according to her biographer, historian Thomas Carty, 95 percent of judges and lawyers were men. At odds with left-wing feminists for much of her career, she is nevertheless credited with first popularizing the aphorism that Ginger Rodgers did everything Fred Astaire did backwards and in high heels.\\n\\nIn 1975, she left Harrisburg and entered local politics, running on a reform ticket for the Delaware County Council. This key county in eastern Pennsylvania then had a population of about 600,000. She won in an upset and subsequently served alternately as chairman and vice chairman until 1979. In 1978, she ran in the Republican primary for Lieutenant Governor and lost to the son of a popular former Pennsylvania governor.\\n\\nWhittlesey was an early supporter of Ronald Reagan's ambitions for the White House. She backed his insurgent 1976 campaign against sitting President Gerald Ford. In Reagan's epoch-defining campaign of 1980, Whittlesey served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Detroit, where she co-chaired the Subcommittee on Foreign Policy and Defense. She then co-chaired Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign for her state and was credited with delivering the crucial eastern Pennsylvania votes. I became fluent in explaining Reagan's foreign policy during that period, Whittlesey told the American Conservative in a 2015 profile. I had to go out into the far reaches of Pennsylvania to explain it to ordinary people.\\n\\nIn this time, Whittlesey was involved in formulating what she called Reagan's core agenda, which in her memoirs she described as:\\n\\n…support for the peaceful defeat of the Soviet Union without commitment of U.S. troops in combat, defense of life, opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment with its hidden agenda of tax-funded abortion and same-sex marriage, decentralized government, lower taxes and reduced government regulation of the private sector, school prayer, defeat of Marxism-Leninism in its various permutations and manifestations, individual Second Amendment rights, the establishment of official diplomatic recognition of the Vatican, support for tuition tax credits for parochial schooling.\\n\\nWhittlesey was twice appointed to the American ambassadorship to Switzerland, first when Reagan took the White House in 1981 and again in 1985, where she continued abroad her role as a communicator for the Reagan Revolution, explaining to a skeptical European diplomatic establishment Reagan's policy of confrontation with the Soviet Union that would eventually lead to the downfall of international communism.\\n\\nBetween these diplomatic terms, Whittlesey became Assistant to the President for Public Liaison, the only woman on President Reagan's 18-member senior White House staff. In Washington, much as she had in Berne, Switzerland, she had to explain the administration's goals to an audience that was often anything but receptive.\\n\\nReagan's foreign policy was strongly opposed—not only by Democrats, who ferociously opposed it, but by the establishment wing of his own party, Whittlesey told the American Conservative of her time in the White House. He was called a warmonger and a cowboy.\\n\\nWe engaged the public, explained Ronald Reagan's policies, she said. But we were just explaining: not trying to influence public opinion, but to let people know that his policies were based on facts, so they could make up their own minds once they heard the facts rationally presented.\\n\\nAfter the Reagan administration, Whittlesey became a partner and of counsel with several prominent law firms and served on numerous corporate boards – including Munich Reinsurance, Valassis Communications, Sunbeam, Nestlé USA and Schindler Elevator USA – as well as on institutional and charitable boards. She served as President of the American Swiss Foundation in New York City until 2008 when she became Chairman Emeritus. She received four honorary doctorates and numerous other awards. She was especially touched by having a prize-winning tea rose named for her in 2006.\\n\\nOne of her proudest accomplishments at the Foundation was establishing the annual Young Leaders Conference Program, in which upcoming political and cultural leaders from the U.S. spend an intensive week in Switzerland discussing ideas and issues with their Swiss counterparts. This program has continued for 28 sessions. Ambassador Whittlesey personally attended every session. As of 2018 the program has more than 1,200 alumni who have helped forge strong bonds between the U.S. and the Swiss.\\n\\nAmbassador Whittlesey remained active in American conservative politics, often advocating positions that were unpopular on the Right at the time, but have, in the age of Trump, found a much wider audience. Perhaps most notably, she was one of the small group of prominent conservatives to oppose the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As the American Conservative wrote in 2015:\\n\\nShe expressed this view one day at the Heritage Foundation's showing of Reagan, a documentary on the president released in 2011. There's a section at the end of the movie, Whittlesey points out, which purports to show why Reagan would've supported the Iraq War. After the viewing, Whittlesey stood up. She said, I had the privilege of working with Reagan for eight years, and I think differently. I don't think Reagan would've supported these wars.\\n\\nLate in life, Whittlesy continued to be active and relevant on the national political stage, endorsing the Republican ticket in 2016 and writing numerous op-eds, largely counseling restraint and prudence in U.S. foreign and domestic affairs.

{"original": "The Heritage Foundation exposed 11 of the most revolutionary demands in the Democrats' so-called Equality Act, which would force Americans to accept the transgender ideology's far-reaching claim that each person's legal sex is determined by their inner feelings of gender identity, not by their measurable biology.\\n\\nHeritage reported:\\n\\nThe proposed Equality Act of 2021 (H.R. 5) would make mainstream beliefs about marriage, biological facts about sex differences, and many sincerely held beliefs punishable under the law. The Equality Act makes discrimination the law of the land by forcing Americans to conform to government-mandated beliefs under the threat of life-ruining financial and criminal penalties. Presented as a bill with commonsense and decent protections against discrimination, H.R. 5 is anything but. The Equality Act politicizes medicine and education and demolishes existing civil rights and constitutional freedoms.\\n\\nThe paper describes the 11 myths pushed by its progressive supporters — and then details the reality behind the progressive myths.\\n\\nMyth 1: The Equality Act Simply Punishes Discrimination Against People Who Identify as Gay or Transgender\\n\\nFact: The Equality Act—introduced as H.R. 5 in the House of Representatives on February 18, 2021—makes mainstream beliefs about marriage, as well as basic biological facts about sex differences, punishable under the law …\\n\\nMyth 2: The Equality Act Preserves Religious Freedom\\n\\nFact: The Equality Act guts the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and threatens constitutional freedoms by eliminating conscience protections from the Civil Rights Act. If enacted, H.R. 5 would force employers, medical professionals, educators, and religious organizations to allow men into women's shelters, pay for or perform sex-change operations, and engage in speech that violates their consciences …\\n\\nMyth 3: The Equality Act Does Not Expand the Scope of Federal Civil Rights Law\\n\\nFact: By expanding the definition of public accommodations under Title II of the Civil Rights Act to include any establishment that provides a good, service, or program, including a store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services, many more individuals and establishments would, in fact, become liable for discrimination claims, including doctors who do not want to perform abortions …\\n\\nMyth 4: The Equality Act Is Irrelevant to Abortion\\n\\nFact: H.R. 5 endangers unborn children. The Equality Act opens the door to taxpayer funding for elective abortions, which the vast majority of Americans oppose, regardless of political affiliation. The bill does not contain any conscience protections for those with moral or religious objections to paying for or performing abortions. It also takes away judicial relief by blocking claims based on the RFRA …\\n\\nMyth 5: The Equality Act Is Good for Women and Upholds Title IX of the Education Amendments Act, Which Prohibits Sex Discrimination Against Girls and Women\\n\\nFact: The Equality Act's changes to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act do not uphold Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act. Gender-identity policies will require biological males to be permitted to participate in female-only activities …\\n\\nMyth 6: Safety and Privacy in Sex-Specific Spaces Will Not Be Diminished\\n\\nFact: All single-sex spaces will be open to both sexes under the Equality Act. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity rules to Title III of the Civil Rights Act on public facilities as well as to public accommodations (Title II) and federal funding (Title VI). This would create a nationwide transgender policy in single-sex facilities …\\n\\nMyth 7: The Equality Act Treats All Students Fairly, Promotes Inclusion, and Cannot Affect School Curricula.\\n\\nFact: By adding sexual orientation and gender-identity rules to the Civil Rights Act's Title IV on desegregation of public education, the Equality Act could pave the way for K–12 federal courts to require sexual orientation and gender-identity curricula the same way they required black history curricula …\\n\\nMyth 8: Doctors Will Not Be Forced to Perform Sex-Change Operations or Prescribe Hormones for Gender Affirmation\\n\\nFact: As a result of the expanding definition of public accommodations, as well as changing federal funding requirements, doctors (and counselors) could be punished for treating gender dysphoria according to their own best medical judgment. Even a referral to another doctor could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act …\\n\\nMyth 9: Parental Rights Will Remain Unchanged\\n\\nFact: The Equality Act's politicization of medicine and education through gender ideology will undermine parental rights. Since most schools will be pressured to comply with sexual-orientation and gender-identity policies, parents will have limited educational choices for their children. Those who do not believe that their daughters should have to compete against biological males in sports …\\n\\nMyth 10: The Equality Act Helps Children in Need of Foster Homes and Adoption\\n\\nFact: The Equality Act hurts vulnerable children by punishing faith-based adoption and foster-care agencies that believe that every child deserves both a mother and a father and that children's bodies should not be irreversibly harmed by hormonal or surgical interventions due to gender dysphoria …\\n\\nMyth 11: The Supreme Court's Decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, Requires the Equality Act's Changes to Civil Rights Law\\n\\nFact: The Equality Act goes far beyond the Supreme Court's 2020 Bostock ruling. While Bostock invented a misguided theory of sex discrimination in employment law, it did not redefine sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity … Because Bostock was limited to employment, it said nothing about schools, sports, or medicine. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity to all of them."}

He also cheered the ban because the female's family members would not know the whereabouts of the woman if she could drive by herself.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia does not have a law that specifically bans females from driving, but women cannot easily obtain a license. Authorities make exceptions for women in rural areas who need a car to perform necessary tasks.\\n\\nA year ago, the government released Mayssa al-Amoudi and Loujain al-Hathloul from jail after 72 days in prison for driving.

{"original": "We lost a member of the Breitbart family last night, legendary actor-comedian Orson Bean — father-in-law of the late Andrew Breitbart. In his last interview with the celebrated actor, Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow said that the news company that Andrew built would not have been possible without Orson Bean. Below is an Associated Press wire on Bean's life and his iconic career.\\n\\nWe will have continuing coverage and tributes in the coming days at Breitbart.com.\\n\\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Orson Bean, the witty actor and comedian, was hit and killed by a car in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was 91.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner's office confirmed Bean's Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a traffic-related fatality. The coroner's office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from local news outlets.\\n\\nA man was walking in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Brian Wendling initially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene. Police were investigating and didn't identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.\\n\\nBean enlivened such TV game shows as To Tell the Truth and played a crotchety merchant on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.\\n\\nHe appeared in a number of films — notably, Anatomy of a Murder and Being John Malkovich — and starred in several top Broadway productions, receiving a Tony nod for the 1962 Comden-Green musical Subways Are for Sleeping. But fans remembered him most for his many TV appearances from the 1950s onward.\\n\\nMr. Bean's face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar, The New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, The Blue Angel. It said he showed a quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat.\\n\\nBorn in Burlington, Vermont, in 1928 as Dallas Frederick Burrows, he never lost the Yankee accent that proved a perfect complement to the dry, laconic storytelling that established him as popular humorist. He had picked the stage name Orson Bean because it sounded funny.\\n\\nHis father, George, was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union and Bean recalled later that his house was filled with causes. But he left home at 16 after his mother died by suicide.\\n\\nIn a 1983 New York Times interview, he recalled his early career in small clubs where the show consisted of me — master of ceremonies, comedian and magician — maybe a dog act, and a stripper. It was a piano player in one such club, he said, who suggested replacing Dallas Burrows with some funny name like Roger Duck — or Orson Bean.\\n\\nBean's quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on To Tell the Truth. The game required the panelists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a national catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said: Will the real (notable's name) please stand up?\\n\\nBean's style appealed to both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, and he appeared on The Tonight Show more than 200 times.\\n\\nBut his early career was hobbled for a time when he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist in the early years of the Cold War.\\n\\nBasically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend, he explained in a 2001 interview. I stopped working on TV for a year.\\n\\nThe blacklist didn't stop him in the theater. Bean starred on Broadway as a timid fan magazine writer in George Axelrod's 1955 Hollywood spoof Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? alongside Jayne Mansfield and Walter Matthau. He also starred on Broadway with Maureen O'Sullivan in Never Too Late and with Melina Mercouri in Illya Darling, based on her hit film Never on Sunday.\\n\\nBean took a break from his career for a time in the 1970s when he dropped out and moved to Australia, where he lived a hippie lifestyle. But he returned to the U.S. and — after a period as a self-described house-husband — resumed his career.\\n\\nI got sick of contemplating my navel and staring up at the sky and telling myself how wonderful it was not to be doing anything, he explained in a 1983 interview with The New York Times.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, he played the shopkeeper Loren Bray on the long-running drama Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. He remained active on the screen in recent years with guest shots in such shows as Desperate Housewives, How I Met Your Mother and Modern Family.\\n\\nMeanwhile, his politics turned more conservative. He became related to a leading right-wing commentator, Andrew Breitbart, when his daughter, Susannah, married him. Breitbart died in 2012 and Steve Bannon, later a top adviser to Donald Trump, took over Breitbart's eponymous website, for which Bean had penned occasional columns.\\n\\nBean wrote a memoir called Too Much Is Not Enough and a book about a non-traditional therapy called Me and the Orgone.\\n\\nHe had already shown his interest in non-traditional thinking in 1964 when he bought a building in Manhattan and opened up a school based on the philosophy of Summerhill, the progressive British school founded by A.S. Neill.\\n\\nI said to myself, we have to start with the children. Why not start a school? he told The New York Times.\\n\\nThat same year, he co-founded the Sons of the Desert, an organization dedicated to comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, with chapters around the world.\\n\\nMore recently, income from Dr. Quinn and other voice and acting work allowed Bean to finance the Pacific Resident Theater Ensemble in Venice, where he appeared with his third wife, actress Alley Mills.\\n\\nHe had a daughter, Michele, from his first marriage to Jacqueline de Sibour, and sons Max and Ezekiel and daughter Susannah from his marriage to Carolyn Maxwell."}

{"original": "The French Catholic bishops have approved the removal of references to the sex of parents on children's baptismal registry forms.\\n\\nIn February 2019, Bishop Joseph de Metz-Noblat of Langres, president of the French bishops' conference Council for Canonical Questions, wrote to the bishops that changes in baptismal documents should be made in order to avoid charges of discrimination, reported Catholic News Agency (CNA).\\n\\nAccording to the report, Father Claude Barthe, editor of Catholic Res Novae, observed that de Metz-Noblat has participated in the process of reworking the baptismal forms since 2013, when same-sex marriage and child adoption were legalized in France.\\n\\nThe increasingly complex situation of families in France makes it extremely difficult to draft Catholic acts, especially regarding baptism, de Metz-Noblat wrote in December 2018, adding concerns about problems of vocabulary.\\n\\nThe bishop said, according to canon law, ministers cannot refuse sacraments to persons who opportunely ask for them, while children cannot be held responsible for the situation of their parents.\\n\\nCNA continued in its report:\\n\\nAs a result, Bishop de Metz-Noblat said he had worked with two other commissions to produce a new baptismal registry formula that will require names and first names of parents or other holders of parental authority, which he wrote would make the simple acknowledgment of one's family situation, without bearing moral judgment on it. The change had now been approved by the bishops' permanent council, Bishop de Metz-Noblat added.\\n\\nHowever, CNA noted that Father Pius Pietrzyk, a Dominican priest who is chair of the pastoral studies department at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, California, said recommendations from a bishops' conference are not binding law.\\n\\nThe bishops' conference, he said, is simply a pastoral engine for the bishops of a certain area to coordinate their pastoral ministry.\\n\\nCNA also cited a letter by Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio who, in 2017, was serving as prefect of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts and provided the views of the Holy See on the issue of baptisms of children of same-sex couples.\\n\\n[T]here is not a specific law with respect to the entry of same sex couples or 'transgendered persons' as parents on the baptismal record, the cardinal reportedly explained. The term 'parents' used by the Church's Canon 877 clearly refers to the father and mother, the man and the woman created by God who are united in the sacrament of marriage.\\n\\nCoccopalmerio also wrote:\\n\\nThe entry of same sex couples or transgendered persons as parents would be contrary to the aforementioned canon and the teaching of Our Lord and of the Church on marriage as God desires it as the union between a man and a woman. If one of the partners is the natural father or mother of the child, it must be mentioned on the record, the other partner cannot be entered.\\n\\nGiven the foregoing instructions, we do not consider it possible to enter on the baptismal record two mothers or two fathers or a 'transgendered father' whose real nature is a woman or a 'transgendered mother' whose true nature is a man, the cardinal concluded.\\n\\nAccording to Barthe, a number of French dioceses will likely ignore the bishops' conference recommendation to remove references to the parents' sex on baptismal documents as each bishop has authority over his diocese.\\n\\nThe Catholic Herald reported some of the criticism of the new recommendation.\\n\\nIt's strange the Church is being advised to adapt to state laws this way – I see no need for it, said Antoine Renard, honorary president of the Federation of Catholic Family Associations. The Church teaches families are created by fathers and mothers, and that other forms are not families. Lesbian and other couples could demand otherwise, but this won't be accepted by the Church.\\n\\nIn an interview with Catholic News Service, Renard also said that while the church could not refuse baptisms, it could require parents seeking the sacrament for their child to commit to raise children according to church rules."}
{"original": "DORTMUND, Germany (AP) — The subject was pickup lines, and Germany's Mr. Flirt offered a few examples to his class of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. I really love the scent of your perfume, he suggested. You have a beautiful voice. He invited his students to take a stab.\\n\\nEssam Kadib al Ban, 20, raised his hand. God created you only for me, he said, then tried another: I love you. Can I sleep over at your place?\\n\\nHorst Wenzel winced, but caught himself quickly.\\n\\nDon't tell them you love them at least for the first three months of your relationship, or they'll run away, he explained patiently. German women don't like clinginess.\\n\\nWenzel, 27, makes his living teaching wealthy but uptight German men how to approach women. But this year, he decided to also volunteer his skills to help Germany as it struggles to integrate more than 1 million refugees who have arrived over the past two years, most of them from war-torn Muslim countries with vastly different relations between the sexes.\\n\\nFinding a relationship is the best way to integrate, and that's why I'm giving these classes, Wenzel said.\\n\\nLast week, in downtown Dortmund, he offered his third installment of How to fall in love in Germany, taking 11 young men through the paces. The students conceded they had a lot to learn.\\n\\nOmar Mohammed, a shy, 24-year-old goldsmith from Syria with spiky black hair and almond-shaped eyes, said he's attracted to German women, with their Nordic looks and punctuated accents. But they remain a mystery to him, and he has no idea how to approach them.\\n\\nIt's hard to meet a girl when you don't speak the language well and can't really talk to them, he said. There are a lot of differences, not only the culture and religion — we just don't have this total freedom at home.\\n\\nStill, he said, I'd love to marry a German woman and live with her. She could help me with the language, and she knows the place and the laws much better than I do.\\n\\nSome German women were receptive to the idea. Jasmin Olbrich, having a quick lunch of French fries at a food truck outside the educational center, said she liked the Middle Eastern looks and complained that German men drink too much beer, watch way too much soccer and are just so white!\\n\\nBut across Germany, hostility to asylum seekers has been on the rise since groups of foreigners — mostly young men from northern Africa — robbed and groped dozens of women on New Year's Eve in Cologne. Most of the hostility targets young male asylum-seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, who make up the majority of the migrants reshaping Germany. Last year alone, 890,000 people applied for asylum, with hundreds of thousands more applying this year.\\n\\nViolent crimes against migrants and arson attacks on asylum shelters and mosques have increased in frequency, and refugees say they have experienced discrimination and abuse since the Cologne attacks. The anti-foreigner sentiment is reshaping German politics as well, with the populist Alternative for Germany party surging as it campaigns against Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to welcome the migrants.\\n\\nThe flirting class, participants said, offered a way to get beyond the adversity.\\n\\nWe are really benefiting from the class, Kadib al Ban said. The teacher is telling us how German women think, how to talk to them … and understand their traditions.\\n\\nWenzel usually charges 1,400 euros ($1,500) for a private one-day class, or 4,000 euros for a group. The tall blond is an authority in Germany when it comes to the art of seduction, giving flirting advice on TV and radio. He says a half-million Germans follow his flirt university blog on how to find Mr. or Mrs. Right. For the migrants, Wenzel is volunteering his time in occasional classes across the country.\\n\\nA lot of the guys are absolute beginners when it comes to flirting, dating and sex, he said.\\n\\nThe class got off to a rocky start. The migrants, unsure what to expect, sat with their coats on and their arms crossed, eyeing their cheerful coach suspiciously.\\n\\nWenzel chatted about pick-up lines, paying compliments and original ideas for first dates. Impress and entertain the girls, Wenzel advised. Invite them to the theater, rock climbing, a concert, or take them on a trip to London or Amsterdam. That last piece of advice would probably work better for Wenzel's regular clientele of rich Germans; asylum seekers aren't allowed to leave the city they're registered in, and don't have the money to travel in any case.\\n\\nThen he moved on to sex.\\n\\nMen and women have sex all the time — on the first, second or third date, that's normal. Wenzel said. It's not a big deal in Germany.\\n\\nThe men in the room giggled, but snapped to attention.\\n\\nWhen Wenzel moved onto the differences between male and female orgasms and how to arouse a woman, they fell silent again. Several men blushed and others looked down at the floor in embarrassment.\\n\\nOne of the students became indignant, whispering in Arabic to his neighbor: But having sex before marriage is a sin; it's haram!\\n\\nBut there were moments of realization as well.\\n\\nAsked how to impress a German woman, one student suggested getting ripped at the gym. Wenzel countered that most women don't go for the body-builder type. Another suggested picking up a date in a Ferrari. Wenzel said that would attract women interested only in money. The students readily agreed, perhaps because most were thin and quite aways from being able to afford a sports car.\\n\\nWhen class let out, most of the men said they'd learned a lot and were eager to put their new skills to use.\\n\\nBut Kadib al Ban, the perky Syrian with the flowery pick-up lines, remained somewhat unconvinced.\\n\\nI'd happily have a German girlfriend, he said. But when I get married, I want to have a girl from my country who shares my culture and my traditions."}

While the move infuriated conservatives and many older Taiwanese, it reinvigorated Tsai's youth base.\\n\\nHer rival Han has struggled on the campaign trail.\\n\\nA plain-speaking populist, he stormed onto the political scene in 2018 when he won the mayoralty of the usually staunch DPP city of Kaohsiung, and then saw off party bigwigs to win the KMT primary.\\n\\nBut his political momentum slowed once he became the opposition candidate as he fought to shake off accusations he lacked experience and was too cosy with China.\\n\\nThis article has been edited."}

Deal slammed religious Georgians for their belief in traditional marriage and insisted that the character of the state was at risk. Deal went on to claim Georgia is a welcoming state that stands against discrimination against gays even at the cost of the loss of religious freedom.\\n\\nThe veto comes on the heels of campaigns mounted by numerous members of the entertainment industry such as Cocoa-Cola, Disney, Time Warner, and even sports concerns such as the NCAA and the National Football League — all of whom warned that they would cancel further projects planned for the state if the religious liberty bill was signed into law.\\n\\nThe NFL in particular warned it would eliminate Georgia from the running for future Super Bowls while the NCAA said it may ban playoff games from being played in the Peach State.\\n\\nNFL policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard. Whether the laws and regulations of a state and local community are consistent with these policies would be one of many factors NFL owners may use to evaluate potential Super Bowl host sites, the NFL said in a statement last week.\\n\\nIn fact, Gov.

{"original": "A leading cardinal and papal adviser has said that many faithful Catholics are troubled by the state of affairs in the Catholic Church under Pope Francis, despite the pontiff's popularity.\\n\\nIn a talk Monday at St Patrick's Church, London, Cardinal George Pell said that a number of regularly worshipping Catholics are unnerved by the turn of events in the church.\\n\\nThe Australian cardinal, who spearheaded the Pope's financial reforms in the Vatican and is a member of the Pope's C9 group of closest advisers, said that while Francis has a prestige and popularity outside the Church greater than perhaps any previous pope, he has made many Catholics uneasy.\\n\\nThe uneasiness was epitomized by a recent challenge by four important cardinals regarding doctrinal ambiguities in the Pope's teaching concerning marriage, divorce, conscience, and Holy Communion.\\n\\nIn September, the cardinals—Raymond Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller, and Joachim Meisner—wrote a private letter to Pope Francis asking him to clarify five serious doctrinal questions proceeding from his 2016 apostolic exhortation, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love). In their letter, they asked the Pope whether certain specific Church teachings about marriage, Holy Communion, and the moral law are still valid.\\n\\nCardinal Pell defended the four cardinals Monday, and when asked whether he agreed with their questions, replied: How can you disagree with a question?\\n\\nPell also said that the asking of the five questions was significant.\\n\\nWhen the Pope failed to reply to the Cardinals' September letter, they proceeded to publish it online on November 14, hoping to elicit a response.\\n\\nOne of the signers, Cardinal Raymond Burke, the former head of the Vatican's Supreme Court and an expert in Canon Law, said in an interview that if Pope Francis does not clarify serious doctrinal doubts arising from Amoris Laetitia, the cardinals will be forced to initiate a formal act of correction of a serious error.\\n\\nCardinal Pell said that much of the present confusion swirls around the question of the primacy of moral conscience and how it should be understood.\\n\\nConscience is not the last word in a number of ways, the cardinal said, adding that it must be formed according to revealed teaching and the moral law. Quoting Blessed John Henry Newman's writings on conscience, Pell said that many have embraced a miserable counterfeit of conscience, which Newman understood as nothing more than the right of self-will.\\n\\nPell also noted the irony among those trumpeting the primacy of conscience, since they only seem to apply it to sexual morality. How many people are advised to follow their conscience on issues of racism or when resisting to help the poor and vulnerable? the cardinal asked.\\n\\nA man who was sleeping with his girlfriend asked his priest whether he could receive Holy Communion, Pell related. In this case, it would be completely misleading to simply tell the man to follow his conscience, he said.\\n\\nAlong with Cardinal Raymond Burke, Pell was recently removed from the Congregation for Divine Worship, the Vatican office on the liturgy.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

Franklin Graham condemned New York political allies of LGBTQ lobbying groups who are attempting to debate Christian marriage beliefs at a time when the work of all charitable organizations is needed.\\n\\nGraham posted to Facebook Tuesday that, on Easter Sunday, as the New York death toll from the COVID-19 infection climbed higher, some New York officials and a special interest group have expressed concerns or outright opposition to the presence of Samaritan's Purse and our field hospital in Central Park.\\n\\nMY STATEMENT REGARDING OBJECTIONS TO SAMARITAN'S PURSE EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL SERVING COVID-19 PATIENTS IN NEW YORK… Posted by Franklin Graham on Tuesday, April 14, 2020\\n\\nLast week, LGBTQ lobbying group Accountable for Equality launched an attack on Graham and his Samaritan's Purse Christian outreach organization, accusing him and his group of putting New Yorkers' lives on the line by urging Christians who hold to one man-one woman marriage to join the effort to help those affected by the coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nIn his Facebook post, Graham wrote that, in response to the pandemic in New York, Samaritan's Purse erected a 14-tent, 68-bed emergency field hospital in Central Park, staffed by a team of more than 70 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel and relief specialists.\\n\\nThis respiratory care unit, which includes 10 ICU beds equipped with ventilators has admitted 119 patients during our first two weeks of operation, he explained:\\n\\nWhile so many have expressed their appreciation and support, sadly some New York officials and a special interest group have expressed concerns or outright opposition to the presence of Samaritan's Purse and our field hospital in Central Park.

I've seen far too many anti-LGBTQ activists like Graham ignore the suffering of LGBTQ people. In this instance, Graham is capitalizing upon a crisis to inflict more pain and suffering on an already marginalized population. He has stated, loudly and proudly, too many times that the LGBTQ community is a threat for me to want to place my life, or the lives of people l love and care about, in his hands.\\n\\nGraham asserted these politicians and organizations are using the coronavirus crisis to continue their criticism of Christian belief in traditional marriage.\\n\\n[W]e don't believe this is the time or place to wage this debate, he wrote:\\n\\nSamaritan's Purse is a decidedly Christian private relief organization, funded almost entirely by individuals around the world who share our passion for providing aid to victims of war, disease, disaster, poverty, famine and persecution—and doing so in Jesus' Name. It seems tone-deaf to be attacking our religious conviction about marriage at the very moment thousands of New Yorkers are fighting for their lives and dozens of Samaritan's Purse workers are placing their lives at risk to provide critical medical care.\\n\\nGraham explained that, while Samaritan's Purse paid staff is asked to subscribe to a statement of faith that includes belief in one man-one woman marriage, the organization has never asked any of the millions of people we have served to subscribe to anything.\\n\\nHe continued:\\n\\nIn other words, as a religious charity, while we lawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefs, we do not discriminate in who we serve. We have provided billions of dollars of medical care and supplies, food and water, and emergency shelter without any conditions whatsoever. Our Christian faith compels us—like the biblical Good Samaritan—to love and serve everyone in need, regardless of their faith or background.\\n\\nGraham said he and Samaritan's Purse do not object to criticism of their Christian beliefs, since it is part of life in a country that cherishes freedom of speech and religion:\\n\\nWhat we do object to is being harassed into diverting precious resources of time and energy and personnel away from serving COVID-19 patients in New York City in order to respond to demands for documents and other information from eight Democratic members of Congress, the Human Rights Commission and the Reclaim Pride Coalition—all while the death toll in New York continues to climb.\\n\\nIf any of these groups had funded and erected their own emergency field hospitals to serve COVID-19 patients in Central Park, Graham added, we would join what we believe would be most New Yorkers—and Americans—in applauding and praying for them, not harassing them."}

In addition to that, they are also positively perceived by their customers. It's a win-win.\\n\\nHowever, he acknowledges that furthering LGBT interests, especially in countries with cultures opposed to the promotion of gay lifestyles, will be a challenge. His answer is to think and act 'glocally': underscoring the business benefits of diversity locally, and adopting global policies that make the workplace safe, fair and accepting for all.\\n\\nZappulla's agenda contribution comes as the World Economic Forum releases its Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2017, arguing that countries' economic development should not be judged on GDP alone, but on social participation.\\n\\nAccording to the authors, The report, which covers 109 economies, seeks to improve our understanding of how countries can use a diverse spectrum of policy incentives and institutional mechanisms to make economic growth more socially inclusive without dampening incentives to work, save and invest.\\n\\nAfter ranking the countries based on twelve key performance indicators of inclusive development including poverty, two inequality measures, and carbon intensity, Norway came out at the top of the list, followed by Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom was ranked 21st, while the United States was in 23rd place.\\n\\nThe authors hope to inspire a coordinated international initiative to raise median living standards, in part through the replacement of free trade deals with the facilitation of trade by encouraging convergence around best practices and standards to reduce frictions and boost development."}

Khanna got Cohen to testify that Don Jr. is the second executive involved in criminal conspiracy. His line of questioning was a very big deal. (He also happens to be a progressive Rep that rejects corporate money!) ⬇️ https://t.co/ZdlBv2cTym — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 1, 2019\\n\\nBut all Ocasio-Cortez is doing here is spreading a lie told by the prison-bound Michael Cohen during his congressional testimony this week.\\n\\nAll of this nonsense surrounds the perfectly legal hush money President Trump paid to porn star Stormy Daniels. She blackmailed the president during the campaign and threatened to go public with the claim the two of them had a one night stand a dozen years ago.\\n\\nHe ended up paying her off, which is not illegal.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) asked Cohen about the money. The exchange went like this:\\n\\nMr. Khanna: The criminal charge against you then states that executive one forwarded your invoice to someone referred to as executive two, presumably Donald Trump Jr., who's signing this check as executive two, correct? Mr. Cohen: I believe so. Mr. Khanna: Are you telling us, Mr. Cohen, that the president directed transactions in conspiracy with Allen Weisselberg and his son, Donald Trump Jr., as part of a civil — as part of a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud, is that your testimony today? Mr. Cohen: Yes.\\n\\nThe only problem is that none of that is true, as the Wall Street Journal made clear on Wednesday:\\n\\nIn the afternoon session, Mr. Cohen identified the president's son, apparently incorrectly, as an unnamed Trump Organization executive referenced in the charging documents filed against him by federal prosecutors in New York. The executives were referenced in connection with the plan to reimburse Mr. Cohen for the payment to Stormy Daniels. In the charging document, federal prosecutors said the first executive, Mr. Weisselberg, forwarded an invoice from Mr. Cohen to the second executive, and it was approved. The Journal has previously identified Executive-1 as Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Mr. Cohen testified today that Executive-2 in the charging document was Donald Trump Jr.\\n\\nTo sum up: a) Trump Jr. was not identified in the charging document and b) there is no criminal conspiracy, as Ocasio-Cortez alleges.\\n\\nEven after being confronted with the facts, Ocasio-Cortez chose to double down:\\n\\nHow is anything I said a lie? Rep. Khanna did in fact ask Cohen the question, and Cohen implicated the President and his son in criminal conspiracy. If you take issue with Cohen's testimony, perhaps that's a good reason for us to call in further witnesses. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 1, 2019\\n\\nTo begin with, paying off a blackmailing porn star with your own money is not illegal, nor does it prove the two of them slept together. As Cohen mentioned in his testimony, Trump has been forced to pay off liars in the past.\\n\\nSecondly, keeping a payoff a secret is not a crime.\\n\\nMost importantly, the worst Trump is guilty of here (and he's not) is a campaign finance violation. Democrats and Dirty Cops in the Justice Department want us to believe the payoff should have been listed on Trump's campaign finance reports as a campaign expense. Even if that were true (and it's not), the worse case scenario is the campaign being hit with a fine.\\n\\nThe reason this is not a campaign finance violation is simple: Trump has been paying off this kind of blackmail for decades. Cohen admitted that during his testimony, which means this is not a campaign finance violation because you only have to report something as a campaign expense if that expense is specific to the campaign.\\n\\nIn other words, if you would have incurred this expense if you were not running for office, there is no requirement to report the expense.\\n\\nIf Trump has been making these payoffs going back more than a decade, if there is a pattern of Trump incurring these expenses to protect his reputation, marriage, and private life, then there is no way this is a campaign expense.\\n\\nAlthough she has only been in the U.S. House of Representatives a couple of months, Ocasio-Cortez has already been caught deceiving voters on numerous occasions.\\n\\nAnd I missed a few…\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "The Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, announced last week that its Board of Trustees has approved a new code of conduct for the site and its affiliated sites. Plans for a code of conduct had been announced last year and an early draft pushing left-wing identity politics submitted for public comment a few months later. Several clarifying changes were made following the comment period, with final changes after approval broadening the scope of restrictions on intimidating content.\\n\\nDiscussion of the code of conduct continues as the next public comment phase on its enforcement started in January. Members of Foundation-owned sites have responded with a mixture of hostility and caution regarding the code of conduct and the prospect of more Foundation intervention in the largely self-governing communities, such as the intrusions that prompted a Wikipedia editor revolt in 2019.\\n\\nLast year the Wikimedia Foundation announced that it was imposing the code of conduct on Wikipedia and other Foundation-owned sites because it wanted them to be welcoming, inclusive, harassment-free spaces in which people can contribute productively and debate constructively. Months later, a committee responsible for writing the code of conduct that was staffed with radical leftists submitted their draft for public comment from members of Foundation-owned sites. In the draft, several provisions advanced left-wing identity politics stances, including required use of preferred pronouns and other provisions criticized as threatening free speech.\\n\\nSeveral changes were made to the code of conduct in response to public criticism, but mostly to clarify the provisions or correct wording rather than significantly changing their effect. One change on a provision for disclosure of personal data added a vague prohibition on sharing information concerning the Wikimedia activity of users outside the projects. When the code of conduct was approved by the Foundation board, another major change was made to a provision barring use of symbols, images, categories, tags or other kinds of content that are intimidating or harmful to remove the need for showing an intent to be intimidating or harmful.\\n\\nIn a news release on the code of conduct's approval, the Foundation cited a Council on Foreign Relations report blaming online speech for rising violence . . . against marginalized groups and ethnic communities to justify the new measure. Foundation CEO Katherine Maher and Board Chair Maria Sefidari both reiterated the code of conduct's intended role in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for site users. The release further claimed the code of conduct signals the Foundation's commitment to creating spaces that foster diversity of thought, religion, sexual orientation, age, culture, and language to name a few.\\n\\nMaher and Sefidari further elaborated on the code of conduct plans in an interview with Reuters. Sefidari indicated their concerns about inclusivity were specifically about bringing in more women and marginalized groups. Although corporate media increasingly praise Wikipedia as a counter to fake news in a messaging strategy originally suggested by firm of the Clinton Foundation's PR head, the media have remained critical of Wikipedia on diversity matters. Concerns about control over Wikipedia and other Foundation-owned sites becoming more centralized were dismissed by Maher as she told Reuters they would not yet be expanding the Foundation's Trust and Safety team who enforce the site's Terms of Use and would be training communities and interested task-forces of users in enforcing the code of conduct.\\n\\nEnforcement questions have prompted concern about the Foundation becoming more involved in the affairs of site communities. On Wikipedia in 2019, editors revolted when the Foundation imposed a year-long Wikipedia-specific ban on a veteran administrator in a major escalation of the Foundation's role, which has traditionally acted only on serious legal matters or issues affecting multiple Foundation-owned sites. Pressure from the community forced the Foundation to back down and the ban was eventually overturned with editors believing the Foundation had committed to avoiding such intrusion into the self-governing nature of site communities in the future.\\n\\nWhile the code of conduct has been approved, the method of enforcement is yet to be decided and has been the subject of public consultations since January. Communities of select Foundation-owned sites have been asked about various methods of enforcement and what role the Foundation should play. At Wikimedia Commons, a file and image repository for Foundation sites such as Wikipedia, many users complained the Foundation was ineffective on harassment. Users at both Commons and Wikidata, a Foundation site focused on compiling data tables on subjects, insisted most enforcement should be publicly transparent with some allowance for a private reporting system in severe cases.\\n\\nResponses from some non-English language versions of Wikipedia sites were generally less hostile to the Foundation. A user from the Arabic-language Wikipedia who lives in Morocco mentioned some complaints with the Foundation's lack of transparency in handling cases and along with other users suggested members of the Arabic-language community should be more involved in the code of conduct's implementation to give users confidence in it. Users at the Korean-language Wikipedia seemed more open to direct Foundation involvement in enforcement, with one suggesting Foundation involvement should be allowed on request of the reporting user.\\n\\nConsiderably more resistance emerged at the Polish-language Wikipedia where a thread about the public consultation prompted users to vote on rejecting the code of conduct only to become frustrated when informed its implementation was already decided by the Foundation. Editor Zezen was particularly vocal citing the 2019 editor revolt, English Wikipedia banning profile pages supporting traditional marriage last year in a move criticized by family and Christian organizations, and English Wikipedia users advocating a No Nazis standard while allowing Stalinists and other left-wing extremists. Zezen argued similar political bias could be imposed on all Foundation sites, including to persecute critics of political correctness. One user called the code of conduct's approval the beginning of the end.\\n\\nZezen had previously been banned from the English Wikipedia mostly for edits relating to LGBT issues that editors found offensive such as editing a caption about LGBT-free zones in Poland to reflect the actual wording of non-binding resolutions by local governments promoting what they called pro-family positions. Also cited was Zezen's criticism of the No Nazis essay on the site arguing Wikipedia should be open to people of all ideologies or beliefs so long as they follow site policies. Those calling for the ban and the administrator who imposed the ban in turn cited the No Nazis essay as justification for banning Zezen.\\n\\nPolitical bias at Wikipedia and the Foundation has been a growing cause of concern. Last year the Foundation endorsed the Black Lives Matter movement, ignoring violent rioting associated with it and declaring no neutral stance existed on the issue, while editors on Wikipedia pushed the movement's agenda. The Foundation cited the code of conduct as one way it would address equity issues on Wikipedia in its endorsement. Numerous studies and analyses have demonstrated a left-wing bias on the site, a bias criticized by co-founder Larry Sanger last year, with one study finding the push for off-setting a pro-men bias on Wikipedia has over-corrected into a pro-women bias. With the new code of conduct, such biases are likely to worsen.\\n\\nT. D. Adler edited Wikipedia as The Devil's Advocate. He was banned after privately reporting conflict of interest editing by one of the site's administrators. Due to previous witch-hunts led by mainstream Wikipedians against their critics, Adler writes under an alias."}

The pope loves you like this, you have to be happy with who you are, he reportedly said.\\n\\nCruz is one of three victims of Father Fernando Karadima who were in Rome in late April for three days of meetings with Francis. His comments came in an interview published on Saturday with the Spanish daily El País.\\n\\nCommenting on the news during his weekly radio show Tuesday, Cardinal Dolan said that it is hard to know with certainty exactly what was said, and that one would want a little bit of 'wait and see' here, let's see exactly what the Holy Father said.\\n\\nWhile noting he had no intention of questioning the young man's sincerity, he did say it would be wise to keep in mind we got it third-hand, so what the pope said to him, he said to the press, so one would want to get a clarification.\\n\\nIt is of course possible that the pope used those very words but it is also possible that Mr. Cruz walked away with that message, but that the pope's words were somewhat different, he suggested.\\n\\nIn his own reconstruction of the meeting, Cardinal Dolan said the conversation probably went something like this: Well, God loves you and so do I.\\n\\nWhat he says is beautiful, Dolan said. Jesus could have said that.\\n\\nThat's sort of conservative, traditional, Catholic, orthodox teaching. The Catechism insists on that, he added.\\n\\nYes, yes, while any sexual expression outside of a man and woman in marriage is contrary to God's purpose, so is not treating anyone, including a gay person, with anything less than dignity and respect, he stated.\\n\\nThe cardinal tied the conversation back to the pope's celebrated remark in 2013 Who am I to judge? in reference to gay individuals in the Church trying to live chaste lives.\\n\\nPeople thought this was revolutionary, Dolan recalled. What he would say today would be similar to what Jesus would say.\\n\\nPeople don't understand those teachings of the Church, Dolan said.\\n\\nThe Catholic Church teaches that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered and contrary to the natural law.\\n\\nMen and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies, however, must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided, the Catholic Catechism states.\\n\\nHomosexual persons are called to chastity.

{"original": "In his 2018 wish list, John Zmirak, Senior Editor of The Stream and author of the new Politically Incorrect Guide to Catholicism, writes that he hopes Pope Francis repents or else resigns this year.\\n\\nFrom The Stream:\\n\\nPope Francis has done more to divide Catholics than any pope in 150 years. He has clouded the Church's teaching on marriage and sexuality. Francis has thrown out the clear, recent teaching of two of his immediate predecessors — which echoed Church practice and preaching for 2000 years. He has politicized the papacy, using its bully pulpit to further crudely crafted left-wing talking points on everything from the economy to immigration to climate science. He has marginalized and punished his critics, to the point that a new book calls him the Dictator Pope. Now he's defending his handpicked lieutenant, Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga. That Honduran leftist (and anti-Semite) is accused of massive corruption that benefited him personally, to the tune of $40,000 per month. Other favorites of Pope Francis include the disgraced Belgian Cardinal Wilfrid Daneels — who was caught on tape trying to silence a sex abuse victim — and LGBT advocate Fr. James Martin, SJ.\\n\\nIn the best case scenario, Pope Francis will see the error of his ways, and spend the rest of his pontificate undoing the damage he's wrought. Failing that, he should imitate the example of Pope Benedict XVI and admit that he can no longer lead the Church. He should resign, and open a political institute based in Buenos Aires.

Littlejohn told Breitbart News: Under the Two-Child Policy, single women are still forcibly aborted, as are third children.\\n\\nBack in 2015, Littlejohn remarked that any mention of human rights was noticeably absent from the Communist party's announcement. Even though it will now allow all couples to have a second child, China has not promised to end forced abortion, forced sterilization, or forced contraception, she said.\\n\\nThe news media at the time bought into the story that China had abandoned or scrapped its One-Child Policy, a depiction that Littlejohn called demonstrably false.\\n\\nThe new report also states that the sex ratio at birth reported by the Chinese government themselves indicates that the selective abortion of baby girls continues unabated under the new policy.\\n\\nAlthough Chinese authorities continue to officially frown on sex-selective abortion, some people reportedly continue the practice in response to government imposed birth limits and in keeping with a traditional cultural preference for sons, the report declares.\\n\\nAccording to a National Bureau of Statistics Report, the sex ratio at birth in 2015 was 113.5 males born for every 100 females born, a disproportion that could only be achieved through sex-selective abortion. Years of such sex-selective favoring of boys has resulted in an estimated 33 to 37 million more males living in China than females. This imbalance is fueling sex trafficking from multiple nations into China for forced marriage or commercial sexual exploitation to help fill the gender gap.\\n\\nChina's Two-Child Policy continues the human rights abuses and gender-based violence of the One-Child Policy, Littlejohn stated, while noting that China remains firmly on the path to demographic disaster due to its dangerously low birthrate.\\n\\nChina should be offering incentives for couples to have babies, not forcibly aborting 'illegal' pregnancies, Littlejohn added.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

The beheading reportedly occurred after she eloped with an older man, making it a case of honor killing.\\n\\nRomina Ashrafi, 13, reportedly ran away from her home in the northern province of Gilan against her father's will with a 35-year-old man she had fallen in love with. Under Iranian Islamic law, girls are allowed to marry from the age of 13, although the average age of marriage is 23.\\n\\nAfter being tracked down and returned home by the police, Ashrafi's father used a sickle to slice off her head while she was sleeping.\\n\\nHe has since been arrested after confessing to his crime at the local police station, the governor of Talesh confirmed to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on Tuesday.

The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, celebrated the opening of the CPPCC's meeting on Thursday as a sign of confidence in the face of reportedly 100 million people being forced into lockdowns while China insists it has its coronavirus outbreak under control.\\n\\nPhotos from the opening of the event showed what appeared to be hundreds of lawmakers, traveling from around the country, sitting in close quarters at the Great Hall of the People. All appear to be wearing masks, but none are respecting the six-feet distance scientists typically identify as necessary to avoid contact with the moisture droplets created by an infected person.\\n\\nThe People's Daily stated that some social distancing measures were in place, but only identified keeping journalists away from the lawmakers and shortening the length of the event as moves to limit the number of people in the chamber:\\n\\nUsually thousands of NPC deputies and CPPCC members descend on Beijing from all over the country, and hundreds of journalists will gather at the Great Hall of the People and other venues to cover the event. However, this year the meetings will be scaled down and the number of journalists will be limited in light of the situation. Therefore, many journalists will have to do video and phone interviews with the deputies or members who attend the meetings. Another way in which this year will likely be different is the length of the sessions, which could be shortened to one week.\\n\\nThe NPC is the National People's Congress, the body that convenes the second of the two sessions.\\n\\nThe decision to convene such a large-scale political event in the nation's capital is a sign of confidence and a signal that China is ready to take a step toward a return to normal, the People's Daily declared.\\n\\nThe event opened with a minute of silence for those who have died of Chinese coronavirus in the country and the health workers who sacrificed their lives in the fight against the epidemic. The Global Times, another communist outlet, noted that dictator Xi Jinping participated in the minute of silence and applauded the incident as an extraordinary event, though moments of silence for those killed by what studies have shown to be a preventable pandemic have occurred around the world.\\n\\nWith the moment of silence out of the way, the Chinese government's Xinhua news agency reported that the CPPCC members are expected to spend much of their time in the session working on new laws to combat future disease outbreaks, calling public health a hot topic at this year's event. Relatedly, the body is expected to discuss economic measures to help those who have lost their jobs, families who have lost their primary breadwinners, and businesses decimated by the ongoing lockdowns in China.\\n\\nXinhua did not discuss the ongoing coronavirus crisis in the nation's northeast. In March, Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the origin city of the Chinese coronavirus, and declared that the outbreak has basically been curbed in China. On Monday, speaking at the World Health Assembly, Xi told the world, in China, after making painstaking efforts and enormous sacrifice, we have turned the tide on the virus and protected the life and health of our people.\\n\\nA Bloomberg report this week revealed that as many as 108 million people in China are currently locked down in their communities, most in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, which border Russia. Reports from Jilin city, the regional capital, suggested that officials in the area are undercounting coronavirus cases and downplaying the severity of the outbreak there.\\n\\nChinese state media outlets did not address the northeastern outbreak in its coverage of the CPPCC's agenda.\\n\\nThrough arduous efforts, China has achieved decisive results in the fight against COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] to protect hard-hit Hubei and its capital city Wuhan, Xinhua asserted. The nation has also made major strategic strides in curbing the spread of the virus.\\n\\nLawmakers in both the CPPCC and the NPC will also be tasked with creating a civil code, detailing how the Communist Party should control property, contracts, personality rights, marriage and family, inheritance, and torts liability, according to Xinhua. The civil code is six years in the making, having been assigned to the lawmakers to draft in 2014.\\n\\nThe NPC, scheduled to meet on Friday, will also look at what the South China Morning Post called legislation for a new national security law tailor-made for Hong Kong that will proscribe secessionist and subversive activity, foreign interference and terrorism. Reports indicate the law is intended to expand the definition of secession to make it more difficult for pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters to legally participate in peaceful protests against the Communist Party.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

{"original": "The Australian government has taken the lead from President Donald Trump in the race to improve vetting of immigrants who may hold hostile Islamic attitudes, and to reform wage-slashing guest-worker programs like the H-1B white-collar outsourcing visa.\\n\\nWe're defined by a commitment to common values, political values, the rule of law, democracy, freedom, mutual respect, equality for men and women, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the media on Thursday, where he described the reformed vetting process:\\n\\nour citizenship process should reflect that. So today we are announcing changes to strengthen citizenship, to make for a stronger Australia, stronger citizenship, stronger citizen … before you apply to be a citizen. You will need to have competent English. That is a vital requirement … also, we need to ensure that our citizenship test enables applicants to demonstrate how they have integrated into and engaged with our Australian community, so that they're part of the community. They've lived here as a permanent resident for four years, they speak English, share our values, be integrated. Those are critically important elements. I believe that they will be empowering for applicants. This will be good for the applicants, good for the nation, underlining our Australian values at the very heart of Australian citizenship, Australian citizenship is the foundation of our democracy… these political values are what bind us together. That's what keeps us together in the midst of our diversity.\\n\\nThe new Australian push is a catch-up from 2016, when Trump championed immigration reform in the United States, while Turnbull sought to stabilize his government after he staged an internal party vote in September 2015 to take the Prime Minister's job from his own party's leader, Tony Abbott, an immigration hawk who entirely blocked and stopped a seaborne wave of immigrants from reaching Australia.\\n\\nTo some extent, Turnbull's flip towards pro-Australian position is designed to help his pro-business wing of the party from Abbot's pro-Australian wing of the party, and from the growing support being given to Pauline Hanson's nationalist One Nation Party, which is skeptical about Islam's ability to integrate into Australian society. In 2016 and before, Turnbull repeatedly endorsed immigration, invited additional refugees, and told the parliament in October 2016 that everyone sitting in this chamber and every Australian is a beneficiary of the diversity that is at the heart of our nation … the most effective weapon against the [Muslim] terrorists is an inclusive nation.\\n\\nAmid rising violence and welfare use among immigrant Muslims, a September 2016 poll showed that half of all Australians want to block Muslim immigration, which is strongly supported by business groups which profit from the inflow of extra consumers and lower-cost workers.\\n\\nTurnbull's minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, told reporters at the press conference that would-be immigrants will have to take an upgraded written test:\\n\\nThere will be further tests, further questions placed in the test as it currently operates, and there will be the opportunity for people to comment on some of these changes over the course of the next, over the course of the period between now and 1 June. So we will consult around the questions around the values issues and we can provide further detail. There is also change to be made to the pledge and, again, we'll consult on that particular issue as well. So I'll leave it there. For example, domestic violence, a perpetrator of domestic violence. My view is that that person shouldn't become an Australian citizen. And we can ask that question but we can also undertake our own checks in relation to police checks or whatever the case might be. So that's how you can adopt, apply the test.\\n\\nOn the 2016 campaign trail, and in his Executive Orders since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has called for a new process of extreme vetting would-be refugees and legal immigrants — especially Muslim immigrants — into the United States. For example, his January 27 Executive Order on immigration declared that his policy would be to exclude people with Hostile attitudes:\\n\\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including honor killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\\n\\nThe alliance of Democratic-appointed judges, progressives, and Islamic political groups are fiercely opposing any new tests, even though the existing immigration and citizenship process already includes questions and tests designed to exclude people who were terrorists or members of the Nazi or Soviet communist parties. The current immigration document also includes a requirement stemming from the 1775 war of independence which requires immigrant aristocrats to formal give up their noble titles before becoming citizens.\\n\\nIf U.S. immigrants lie in their documents, they can be stripped of their citizenship and repatriated. For example, U.S. officials have deported several immigrants who lied about their work for Adolf Hitler's National Socialist party in World War II.\\n\\nU.S. officials have not said anything about the plans for upgrading the immigration tests and vetting, partly because Trump has not yet been able to get many of his top-level nominees confirmed by the Senate. But Homeland Security John Kelly may be a strong backer of an upgraded test, and told a D.C. audience on Tuesday that we have a sacred duty and that is the continuation of the United States as we know it: To protect our way of life and the exceptional people we are.\\n\\nAustralia's reform government has an easier task than Trump, who must overcome roadblocks built by progressive judges, media and Democratic legislator and Democratic legislatures in a 50-state federal government for 330 million people. In contrast, Australia's parliamentary system allows a majority government to easily pass its agenda for the nation of 25 million people.\\n\\nThroughout the April 19 Australian press conference, the journalists and politicians tacitly recognized the problems created by the immigration of Islamic adherents who bring their peculiar institutions and values which endorse domestic violence against women, child marriage, 'Female Genital Mutilation,' and reject the authority of what Australians describe as secular law. For example, one reporter cited several of Islam's peculiar practices before asking Prime Minister, I'm not clear why practices such as female genital mutilation, forcing children to marry and what have you, how they're being or could be included in values questions when they're already illegal under Australian law. What's the need for a values question when it's illegal under Australians law, Australian law? that these values [in the test] aren't really enforceable outside of the law. If someone passes a test and says, Tick, yes I don't beat my wife. Tick, I know who [cricket player]\\n\\nAnother journalist scoffed at the test, saying these values [in the test] aren't really enforceable outside of the law. If someone passes a test and says, Tick, yes I don't beat my wife. Tick, I know who [cricket player] Don Bradman is. I'm an Australian citizen And then they don't express Australian values, what happens?\\n\\nTurnbull pushed back, saying:\\n\\nBut the point is, what [the current written test] doesn't go to or doesn't go to sufficiently are those questions of values and at the heart, at the very heart of our success is mutual respect; respect for each other, respect for people of different faiths and different cultures and respect of women and children. That is, you know as I've, you've often heard me say this. You know, not all disrespecting women, disrespecting women ends up in violence against women but that's where all violence against women begins. So this is a very important, very important Australian values; respect, mutual respect, respect for women and children and that is going to be, that is a key Australian value, who would argue with that? Is it reflected in our current process? No it's not, it should be.\\n\\nOn April 17, Turnbull announced his party would reform the 457 visa program, which allowed Australian companies to bring in foreign workers for skilled and unskilled jobs throughout Australia. The 457 visa will be replaced by a narrower visa program that will only be used to bring in workers who cannot be found in Australia and who can integrate Australian society, he said.\\n\\nThat push is also similar to Trump's effort to revamp the unpopular H-1B white-collar outsourcing program.\\n\\nEchoing Trump's Buy American, Hire American theme, Turnbull said that the goal os his reform is Australian jobs for Australians first … this is all about Australians' interst, this is about jobs for Australians. The new program will have a laser-like focus on Australia's interests, he said.\\n\\nWe're putting Australians first … Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs, he said.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeUt-dSbLc\\n\\nThis article has been updated with additional information about Australia's rising support for nationalist policies.\\n\\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart.com"}

That's especially true for college-educated women in high-earning occupations: Children are particularly damaging to their careers.\\n\\nResearch suggests that women are also likely to earn less due to women being more likely to either move or stay in a certain area due to the greater importance the couple places on the husband's job. Sari Kerr, an economist at Wellesley College, argues that because the spouse who earns is likely to do more of the household work, the gender pay gap is self-reinforcing.\\n\\nThat reinforces the pay gap in the labor market, and we're trapped in this self-reinforcing cycle, Kerr said.\\n\\nExperts argue that the most efficient way to reduce the wage gap would be to encourage employers to put less emphasis on asking their employees to work long hours and to allow them to work remotely. Progressive economists, like Kerr, also argue that government-subsidized childcare could lift women out of the self-reinforcing cycle of the wage gap.\\n\\nTo achieve greater pay equality, social scientists say — other than women avoiding marriage and children — changes would have to take place in workplaces and public policy that applied to both men and women. Examples could be companies putting less priority on long hours and face time, and the government providing subsidized child care and moderate-length parental leave.\\n\\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

{"original": "The sports world in Australia is still roiling after famed Aussie tennis player Margaret Court criticized same-sex marriage. Now, gay tennis player Martina Navratilova is demanding that the City of Melbourne rename its sports arena named after Court.\\n\\nNavratilova, who came out as a lesbian after she was outed as bisexual in the 1980s, wrote an open letter urging the city of Melbourne to change the name of its Court Arena. The facility is named after Margaret Court, the holder of a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles earned during her tennis career during the 1960s and 70s.\\n\\nControversy arose last week when the 74-year-old Court, who is now a Christian pastor, made comments critical of Qantas Airlines because the company has become an active promoter for same-sex marriage, ESPN reports.\\n\\nAfter her comments, the sports community in Australia became embroiled in condemnation of Court's comments, even though she has been an open critic of gay marriage for decades.\\n\\nNavratilova attacked Court for her views and said she was trying to take away people's rights. She then demanded that the arena stop honoring Court by naming its facilities after her despite her still-unsurpassed athletic record.\\n\\nWhen you were named after Margaret Court, it seemed like the right thing to do, Navratilova wrote in her open letter to Court Arena. After all, Rod Laver already had the big stadium, and Court is one of the all-time greats. I had long ago forgiven Court for her headline-grabbing comments in 1990 when she said I was a bad role model because I was a lesbian.\\n\\nIt is now clear exactly who Court is: an amazing tennis player, and … a homophobe. Her vitriol is not just an opinion. She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too). She is demonizing trans kids and trans adults everywhere, Navratilova added.\\n\\nWe should not be celebrating this kind of behavior, the former number one ranked player insisted.\\n\\nAnother Aussie tennis player agreed with Navratilova but went a step further to urge players to boycott any match scheduled for Court Arena. 2011 U.S. Open winner Sam Stosur, said, I think everyone can have their opinion. I don't agree with it. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we all get down to the Australian Open next year — and who wants to play on Margaret Court Arena and who doesn't. And we'll go from there.\\n\\nClearly, as far as Navratilova and Stosur are concerned, someone's achievements in any particular field should be invalidated if they don't agree with the left's political opinions.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com."}

He is already doing it. I look forward to him continuing to do so, King concludes, after addressing Jordan and Meadows's concerns.\\n\\nThe opinion piece, published exclusively in the Washington Examiner, cites Sessions's record at the Department of Justice in arguing against changing horses in mid-stream. King writes:\\n\\nSessions gets it. He understands the necessity of preserving the Rule of Law and of rectifying Obama-era abuses. Look at just some of the things the Justice Department has already done to erase Obama's corrosive legacy and to restore the Rule of Law: The DoJ won a 7-2 victory at the Supreme Court in support of President Trump's existing legal authority to implement a Travel Ban designed to safeguard the homeland.\\n\\nThe DoJ led efforts to rescind the unconstitutional DACA program that sought to provide legal status and work permits to illegal aliens.\\n\\nThe DoJ argued in favor of religious liberty at the Supreme Court, siding with a Christian baker's First Amendment right to not participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies which violate his religious beliefs.\\n\\nThe DoJ settled lawsuits with 96 plaintiffs who claimed the Obamacare Contraceptive Mandate unlawfully burdened their religious rights. The settlement permanently exempts these plaintiffs from the Obamacare mandate.\\n\\nThe DoJ has worked to protect the free speech right of students on university campuses.\\n\\nThe DoJ is working to end the payment of taxpayer-funded grants to Sanctuary Cities that defy the nation's immigration laws.\\n\\nThe DoJ is seeking to deliver justice to the family of Kate Steinle by prosecuting her illegal alien killer for the federal crimes of being a felon in possession of a firearm and an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.\\n\\nKing turned out the pro-Sessions op-ed quickly after Jordan and Meadows put out a message in the same pages claiming Sessions has no control of the FBI and that a new attorney general is needed.

I believe Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the right man in the right place at the right time to restore respect in America for the Rule of Law, he writes to them, adding:\\n\\nIn measuring Sessions' performance in office to date, it is important to remember two things: 1) the political climate he faced within the Department of Justice upon accepting President Trump's offer to serve, and 2) that Sessions is currently constrained by the fact that he is compelled to wait for the inspector general to complete his ongoing internal review.\\n\\nRead the rest here."}

One local media outlet noted that the choice for preface-writer seemed almost a provocation.\\n\\nWhen Fedeli was appointed Education Minister last December, the Italian pro-family group Generazione Famiglia called the decision a declaration of war against the traditional family and the right of children to have a mother and a father.\\n\\nIn recent years, Fedeli has been undoubtedly the most tenacious and ideological supporter of the manipulation of school programs at every level according to the dictates of gender theories, the organization declared.\\n\\nLast month, Fedeli came out publicly against the organizers of Family Day for their opposition to the use of gender theory in the nation's schools.\\n\\nThe bizarre thing is the Pope's longstanding hostility toward what he terms gender ideology, which he deems part of the global war to destroy marriage.\\n\\nLast fall, Francis said that today we are witnessing a global war to destroy marriage in which gender theory places a key role, fighting not with weapons, but with ideas.\\n\\nThe Pope has in fact been an outspoken critic of LGBT agitators' efforts to impose same-sex marriage and theories of gender fluidity that divorce gender from biological sexual differences.\\n\\nEarlier last year, Francis published a lengthy teaching text on marriage and the family called The Joy of Love (Amoris Laetitia), in which he underscored the unique value of both motherhood and fatherhood, while denouncing the legal deconstruction of the family through the acceptance of same-sex marriage.\\n\\nIn that same letter, Francis slammed gender theory for its denial of the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman, and for its dream of a society without sexual differences.\\n\\nAn appreciation of our body as male or female, he said, is necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves. Efforts to cancel out sexual differences based in anatomy are a symptom of a sick society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he wrote.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "The Trump administration will launch an effort to decriminalize homosexuality in countries where it is still illegal, as part of a diplomatic push for LGBTQ rights — and an effort to isolate Iran, which persecutes homosexuals.\\n\\nNBC News reported Tuesday that the effort is to be led by U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, a staunch Trump supporter who is among the highest-ranking openly gay officials ever to serve in the U.S. government. Grenell is currently among the front-runners to succeed Nikki Haley as UN Ambassador.\\n\\nNBC noted:\\n\\nU.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality — mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. Although the decriminalization strategy is still being hashed out, officials say it's likely to include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights. Other U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts throughout Europe, including the U.S. Mission to the E.U., are involved, as is the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration's top geopolitical foe.\\n\\nThere are 72 countries that still criminalize homosexuality, and eight that apply the death penalty, according to NBC. One is U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, according to a report by a gay rights organization cited by NBC News.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has been criticized by LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) activists in the U.S. for barring transgender volunteers from serving in the U.S. military, and rescinding a policy from the previous administration encouraging special accommodation for transgender students in public schools.\\n\\nHowever, Trump has stayed out of debates over same-sex marriage and has promoted gay officials, such as Grenell, who share his broader agenda.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama ran in 2008 on a platform opposing same-sex marriage and yet was embraced by LGBTQ activists. He switched his position before the 2012 elections, and told African countries to drop laws discriminating against homosexuals in 2015, but did not press the issue more widely.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has won praise from religious groups for promoting their agenda abroad, including the Mexico City policy, which bars U.S. foreign aid for being used to fund or promote abortion.\\n\\nJoel B.

They are the true New York Values.\\n\\nRegardless of the issues presented to Cruz while on the campaign trail, including questions of public policy such as abortion and same-sex marriage, the candidate says his overriding source for decision-making is the Constitution and that the founding document is the means to unify Americans.\\n\\nThe conservative Sun states its editorial board is looking for a candidate who grasps, is committed to, and is excited by America's constitutional principles.\\n\\nThe Constitution ought to be a unifying instrument; it is, after all, the only thing that all of our legislators, officers, and judges — from the President to the county sheriffs — must be bound by oath to support, states the Sun.\\n\\nThe publication continues:\\n\\nOur endorsement is not animated by hostility to either Donald Trump or Governor Kasich, both of whom are running well ahead of Mr. Cruz in the polls in New York. All three are better on key issues than either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders. We like Mr. Trump's willingness to re-think the United Nations. We're not against better trade deals. We are against a retreat from NATO, and Mr. Trump has been too xenophobic in his use of language in respect of religion and the immigration issue. Mr. Cruz, a former solicitor general of the border state of Texas, has been more sage.\\n\\nMillions of Americans sense that the Democrats have become unmoored from the constitutional principles, the Sun adds. Mrs. Clinton would re-write the First Amendment; New York, in 1788, ratified the Constitution only on the caveat that a Bill of Rights would be included.

Donohue asked. They don't want to protest, just pray. They pledge to stay six feet apart. They promise not to engage in violence. Can they do so? No.\\n\\nWhen a reporter for a Jewish newspaper called out the mayor for the irony of allowing throngs to take to the streets in a mass assembly, but denying permission for a small church service, he got indignant, Donohue notes.\\n\\nFour hundred years of American racism, I'm sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services, de Blasio replied.\\n\\nThe upshot, Donohue writes, is that de Blasio has decided to privilege protesters, many of whom are well-off white folks, all because he thinks that protesting racism justifies jettisoning his shutdown.\\n\\nThe hypocrisy grows even thicker because of the mayor's own, well-known racism, Donohue notes, since he has adopted racial quotas, repeatedly promoting policies that discriminate against Asian Americans by denying them seats in New York's public schools.\\n\\nDe Blasio has also denied black and Hispanic parents the advantages of school choice, quashing the opportunities for charter schools and other avenues toward educational advancement.\\n\\nPerhaps most disturbing, however, is the mayor's hostility toward religious faith.\\n\\nThis is a man who raised money for the communists in Nicaragua when he was young, and traveled, illegally, to Castro's Cuba for his honeymoon, lying to his own children about where it took place, Donohue writes.\\n\\nThe mayor also boycotted the St. Patrick's Day Parade for years and recently lashed out at Rev. Franklin Graham because the minister thinks marriage should be between a man and a woman.\\n\\nThis is the profile of an extremist, Donohue concludes. He throws the health of New Yorkers overboard to allow for a jammed protest he likes, and then invokes his health edict to ban people of faith from attending their house of worship.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

After city officials learned of his Christian belief that marriage is the union between one man and one woman, they invoked a non-discrimination policy to exclude him from being able to sell at the farmers' market.\\n\\nTennes says he was barred from selling his produce after his business, Country Mill Farms, refused to host a lesbian couple's wedding at its orchard in Charlotte, 22 miles outside East Lansing. Explaining his position on Facebook, Tennes cited his Catholic belief that marriage is a sacramental union between one man and one woman.\\n\\nIn a statement, the city of East Lansing said the farmer's decision not to host a same-sex wedding violated a long-standing ordinance that protects sexual orientation as well as the Supreme Court's ruling that grants the right for same-sex couples to be married.\\n\\nIn point of fact, the city introduced a modification to the city's farmers market vendor agreement just this year requiring sellers to comply with East Lansing's Human Relations Ordinance. Among other things, the ordinance prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.\\n\\nThe city's punitive action targets the farmer's use of his own private property, 22 miles outside the city and well outside its jurisdiction. Mr. Tennes has declared that he does not discriminate against LGBT customers at the farmer's market, and gladly sells his produce to all comers.\\n\\nIt's our faith that informs us how to treat all who come to our farm and the farmers market with dignity and decency … serving customers of many races, religions, cultures and those who identify with the LBGT community, he said.\\n\\nWhen it came to actually hosting a same-sex marriage that contradicts his biblical understanding of the nature of marriage, Tennes felt obliged to decline.\\n\\nOur faith and beliefs on marriage and hosting weddings at our home and in our backyard of our farm have nothing to do with the city of East Lansing, Tennes said at a press conference.\\n\\nAccording to Gay Star News, the biblical view of marriage is homophobic and the City of East Lansing barred Tennes for his homophobic religious views.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, May 31, Tennes filed a federal lawsuit against the city of East Lansing seeking his reinstatement at the market. According to the lawsuit, Country Mill is the only business to have been prohibited under the market's anti-discrimination policy.\\n\\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization specializing in religious liberty cases, is representing Tennes. They have asserted that his religious views on marriage have no bearing on his involvement at the market and said the city's actions amounted to a First Amendment violation.\\n\\nSteve and his farm have been singled out and excluded from full participation in the life of the community for only one reason, said ADF counsel Kate Anderson.

{"original": "A recent report from the Daily Caller alleges that a Google VP stepped in to block a Christian video on gay marriage from running on the tech giant's Youtube advertising platform.\\n\\nThe Daily Caller reports that Google banned a video which stated that the church welcomes homosexuals but encourages them to follow Christian teachings on same-sex marriage. Internal communications show that the video was banned from Google's advertising platform on YouTube after a Google VP agreed that the video constituted a microaggression and shouldn't be allowed.\\n\\nThe Daily Caller discusses the internal reaction to the video on Google's employee message boards:\\n\\nThe video was flagged in June 2018 in an internal listserv, Yes at Google, which is run by Google's human resources department, according to those communications and other internal documents, which a source shared with TheDCNF on the condition of anonymity. The listserv has more than 30,000 members and is devoted to policing microaggressions and micro-corrections within the company, according to its official internal description. The internal backlash to the video grew large enough to merit a response from a Google vice president, who said the video would no longer be eligible to run as an advertisement, the human resources team announced to the listserv.\\n\\nThe video in question was produced by Christian radio host Michael L. Brown who has previously spoken out against the homo-hatred and ugly rhetoric from some Christian groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church. In the video, Brown states that same-sex relationships are like other sins, but one that Jesus died for. Brown states that homosexuals can be Christian but notes that it has long been a Christian belief that sex only takes place in the marriage of a male and female.\\n\\nThe Daily Caller notes that there was almost an immediate issue with the video raised by Google staff:\\n\\nI cannot see how this can be allowed when the specific idea of LGBT videos is to allow the creators to feel free to share their content and be comfortable that anti-LGBT advertisers would not be attached to their content, the employee wrote. This seems very counter to our mission, specifically around PRIDE 2018 timeframe. Google's vice president for product management and ads, Vishal Sharma, agreed that the video was too offensive to air as an advertisement. Thank you for raising this very important issue. It means a lot to me personally and those of us working on this across the Ads and YouTube teams. YouTube is an open platform and we support the free expression of creators with a wide range of views, Sharma wrote in his response, which was included in the listserv. But we don't allow advertising that disparages people based on who they are – including their sexual orientation – and we remove ads that violate this basic principle, Sharma continued. After careful and multiple reviews over the course of a few days, our teams decided to remove the ad in question here as it violates our policy. We've communicated this to the advertiser and have been in touch with creators who have been actively engaged on this issue, Sharma added, again expressing his gratitude for the internal feedback.\\n\\nBreitbart News has covered other complaints raised by Google staff — such as when employees had a meltdown over the use of the word family during a discussion about a Google product aimed at children. Breitbart News also reported in December of 2018 that internal emails appeared to show Google targeting Breitbart News' advertising revenue specifically. A Google spokesperson later claimed that despite the internal discussion, no modifications were made to Google search results for political purposes."}
{"original": "Amidst the rich legacy that Justice Antonin Scalia left to the American people after more than 30 years serving on the Supreme Court, his last and one of his greatest statements against judicial activism came after the notorious 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that trampled the democratic process, legislating same-sex marriage for all 50 states.\\n\\nJustice Scalia's major contention with the court's decision had little to do with same-sex marriage at all and everything to do with democracy and the rule of law. It is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage, he writes, but it is of overwhelming importance who it is that rules me.\\n\\nToday's decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court, he said.\\n\\nIn his nine-page dissent, Scalia ripped into the majority opinion, calling it a judicial Putsch that poses a threat to American democracy. He added that a system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.\\n\\nThe Court's naked judicial claim to legislative—indeed, super-legislative—power bulldozed the right of the People to self-government, said Scalia, which represents the greatest threat to the American experiment in self-government.\\n\\nIn his scathing rebuke of the ruling, Scalia said that the majority had reached an opinion lacking even a thin veneer of law.\\n\\nHe noted that at the time the Constitution's 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, every State limited marriage to one man and one woman, and no one doubted the constitutionality of doing so, which makes it extraordinarily suspicious that the 2015 court could suddenly find differently.\\n\\nIn what amounted to a brief history lesson, Scalia underscored the gravity of the Court's action by comparing it to England's treatment of the American colonies that ignited the movement for American independence. The justice said that in its hubris, the majority decision had carried out a more serious offense than the one that sparked the Boston Tea Party and later the American Revolution itself.\\n\\nIndeed, wrote Scalia, to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.\\n\\nWhen the Supreme Court no longer acts like a judicial body and instead usurps the power to enact legislation, as it did in its infamous June 26 ruling, it radically oversteps its mandate and is worthy of nothing but scorn.\\n\\nAs millions of Americans pause to bid farewell to this brilliant and outspoken legal scholar and judge, his warnings of the dangers of judicial activism must not fall on deaf ears. In an election year, the direction of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.\\n\\nAntonin Scalia, RIP.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome"}
{"original": "House Democrats are poised to pass the Equality Act once again, claiming it will merely amend federal civil rights law to ensure sexual orientation and gender identity are included among the protected classes, even though the Constitution already provides protection for the rights of all American citizens, regardless of their identity group.\\n\\nIn 2021, the Equality Act could pass the Senate as well, and if so, President Joe Biden is expected to sign it into law. The legislation would end the federal recognition of the two complementary male and female sexes in favor of gender identity.\\n\\nIf enacted, the Equality Act could have a major impact on children and their parents, upending the culture as American families now know it.\\n\\nThe text of the legislation reads:\\n\\nAn individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.\\n\\nThat text indicates the privacy of girls in public facilities, such as school bathrooms and locker rooms, would no longer be honored.\\n\\nBoys who identify as, or claim to be, girls could compete on girls' athletic teams, take showers with them in public school locker rooms, and sleep in their hotel rooms when their teams are on the road.\\n\\nBiden signed an executive order on Wednesday giving sweeping rights to men and women who want to live as the opposite biological sex. https://t.co/ImNoLEairi — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 22, 2021\\n\\nInside the classroom, the Equality Act could allow for the normalization of gender ideology and abortion in school curricula.\\n\\nMelanie Israel of the Heritage Foundation explained Monday at the Daily Signal that, under the legislation, parental rights could take a far back seat to mandated school programs:\\n\\nThe Equality Act could lead to changes in school curricula, such as texts that affirm and promote controversial sexual orientation and gender identity viewpoints. The Equality Act could also be used to override states that have prohibited sexual orientation and gender identity curricula. Where states have conversely mandated sexual orientation and gender identity curricula, parents and schools do not have access to opt-out options.\\n\\nIsrael observed as well that Planned Parenthood, a giant of both the lucrative abortion and transgender medical treatment industries, would likely have greater access to young people in sex education programs under a federal Equality Act.\\n\\nShe elaborated on the possibilities:\\n\\nIf the Equality Act were to become federal law and public school curricula become further entwined with sexual orientation and gender identity ideology, Planned Parenthood is well-positioned to further its presence in public schools and take advantage of an additional avenue to promote both sexual orientation and gender identity ideology as well as the organization's hormone treatment services. In other words, additional sexual orientation and gender identity curricula could become yet another marketing tool for America's abortion giant.\\n\\nChuck Schumer said he is on board with Joe Biden's presidential campaign promise to allow youth access to sports activities, bathrooms, and locker rooms based not on their biological sex but their preferred gender. https://t.co/iYDrWjfYyX — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 3, 2020\\n\\nIn a Heritage Foundation virtual webinar, titled The Promise to America's Children: Protecting Kids from Extreme Gender Ideology and Laws, Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) expressed her concern the Equality Act would have a significant impact on what is taught in schools:\\n\\nSexual information, it's just going to be the norm, that the schools will start promoting the idea of sexual orientation or gender identity as just part of the curriculum, without us knowing about it, or having an opportunity to opt in or opt out because it'll just be considered discrimination.\\n\\nHartzler, a former teacher, said parents who disagree with the mandated gender ideology, with books containing examples of same-sex couples, etc., would be viewed as fueling discrimination.\\n\\nIt'll just be infiltrated into the entire curriculum, from kindergarten on, without parents even knowing about it, or having an opportunity to have a say, and so that's the first concern I would have as a parent, she said.\\n\\nHartzler added she is also concerned the Equality Act could affect parental decisions over the health care of their children.\\n\\nThe congresswoman recalled the story of parents in Ohio who lost custody of their daughter several years ago because they opposed her desire to transition to male. A judge allowed the girl's grandparents to take custody of her because they supported her medical transition.\\n\\nIt is just heart rending to think that parents were not able to determine the health care, what they thought was best for their daughter, and the judge actually stepped in and took away their custody, the congresswoman said.\\n\\nChildren in foster care could likely be affected by the Equality Act as well.\\n\\nAn adoptive mother, Hartzler said the legislation could likely have a negative impact on faith-based adoption agencies that strive to place children in homes with a mother and father.\\n\\nShe observed how some states and cities have already claimed the exclusion of same-sex couples as potential adoptive parents is discriminatory and that faith-based adoption agencies seeking out only families with a mother and father should no longer be allowed to operate.\\n\\nThe Missouri congresswoman explained the consequence of such policies is that many foster children are unable to be adopted into a loving home through faith-based adoption agencies if they are shut down. The Equality Act would nationalize such a policy.\\n\\nRyan Anderson, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, explained in an op-ed at the New York Post Sunday that the writers of the Equality Act have explicitly exempted the bill from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\\n\\nThe Act states:\\n\\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.\\n\\nFaith-based schools could thus face federal sanction for upholding the teachings of mainstream biology and the Bible, modern ­genetics and Genesis, when it comes to sex and marriage, Anderson noted.\\n\\nLet's be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 25, 2020\\n\\nUnder the Act, children are also likely to learn any attempt to protect unborn human life is now considered discriminatory.\\n\\nThe text of the bill states:\\n\\nDiscrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.\\n\\nAs Israel noted, the legislation would force the term sex in the Civil Rights Act to mean pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and the last of these — related medical conditions — has already been interpreted to include abortion by both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\\n\\nThus, discrimination on the basis of sex could include refusing to perform an abortion or provide funding for the procedure.\\n\\nAnderson summed up the concerns about the legislation.\\n\\nRather than finding common-sense, narrowly tailored ways to shield LGBT-identifying Americans from truly unjust discrimination, the bill would act as a sword — to persecute those who don't embrace newfangled gender ideologies, he said of the Orwellian Equality Act."}
{"original": "The Democratic Party is being dragged to the cultural left by its growing cohort of upper-income, professional-class voters, according to a survey by the Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nThe push for power by college-graduate professionals is creating a split with the Old Guard liberals and with the younger cohort of Blue Collar Democrats which provide the larger share of the party's votes on election day, the WSJ warned:\\n\\nThese college-educated liberals, many of them young and most of them white, make up a growing, Democratic Professional Class. Their interests differ in many ways from those of two other groups … The college-educated, professional class of Democrats is doing the most to push the party to the left. Policy ideas such as instituting a government-run, single-payer health-care system were once promoted only by the most liberal voters. They are now widely supported within the party – with the professional class emerging as the most enthusiastic … The professional class is also the most comfortable with same-sex marriage, changing gender roles and other recent social changes.\\n\\nThis professional class is relatively wealthy. More than 60 percent of this group earns more than $75,000 each year, the WSJ said.\\n\\nIn 2011, post-graduate voters split their vote 46 percent Democratic to 33 percent Republican. In 2017, that split widened to 53 percent versus 26 percent after non-college voters showed that they strongly backed Donald Trump in 2016. That switch shows blue-collar voters were turning away from the Democrats' elite-boosting policies of imposed civic variety — or diversity — plus cheap blue-collar labor via immigration, favoritism for sexual minorities, funding for urban growth, and deference to unelected international government.\\n\\nThe Democrats' postgraduate boosterism is supported by the new-industry CEOs, such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook or Amazon's Jeff Bezos. These business leaders are eager to suppress populist opinions that limit their worldwide ability to hire immigrants and sell products worldwide without any major cultural, economic or legal restrictions.\\n\\nThe Party's cosmopolitan leadership class is fuelling a growing conflict with the party's blue-collar base, says the WSJ:\\n\\nBlue-Collar Democrats, who lack bachelor's degrees, feel the most economically vulnerable. The Professional Class, which has college degrees, feels the most secure. As the aging Old Guard fades, the Blue-Collar Democrats' skepticism of trade, U.S. leadership abroad and other matters may clash with the Professional Class's support of engagement with the world. … Blue-Collar Democrats as a group have often been least likely to see globalization as a benefit to the U.S. economy. This helps explain why some Democratic lawmakers agree with President Trump that trade deals have hurt workers.\\n\\nThese rational splits over economic and self-government also helped Donald Trump grab a small but critical share of the Democrats' blue-collar votes in the 2016 election, including votes from African-Americans who oppose cheap-labor immigration. Similarly, a significant number of voters rejected the pro-transgender push by former President Barack Obama policies matched the preferences of the post-graduate class.\\n\\nThe WSJ survey does not explore the political gap between the pro-immigration professional class and the GOP-aligned business class, which is quietly using free trade, globalization, and immigration to cut the salaries paid to the Democrats' pro-diversity college graduates. However, since President Donald Trump was elected by populist voters in 2016, the Democratic Party's post-graduate class has moved towards a tacit political alliance with Wall Street.\\n\\nThe WSJ survey is a rare media recognition that the Democratic Party's policies are increasingly aligned with the globalist and diversity policies which aid the income and status of the high-IQ, post-graduate class — which also includes many people who work in the media.\\n\\nMost surveys tend to portray the political preferences of the professional class as independent of rational self-interest.\\n\\nFor example, a May 7 study by two post-graduate professors argued that aversion to social change is strongly predictive of support for Trump at the mass level, even among racial minorities. That language suggests that acceptance of social change is the proper position for voters to take, regardless of the proposed change.\\n\\nThe study noted the changing views within each party while disregarding the rational reasons for elites and blue-collars to differ over free trade, migration, civic diversity and social solidarity:\\n\\nThe two American parties appear to be polarizing on a national identity dimension used in studies of international parties, where one party advocates toleration and social and political equality for minorities over assimilation and the other favors defense and promotion of the majority national identity and culture\\n\\nBut the study also produced a remarkable chart showing the attitude of Democratic political insiders towards the pro-American views of normal voters.\\n\\nThe two authors at Michigan State University — Matt Grossman and Daniel Thaler — admitted to Breitbart News that attitudes on their openness to change charts may be guided by rational calculations. Grossman told Breitbart News:\\n\\nThey are widely-held views likely related to underlying personality differences and political predispositions … I agree that they are related to the preference for social stability, which can be quite rational.\\n\\nThaler responded:\\n\\nWhether aversion to social change is rational or good is a largely subjective question, which falls outside the scope of our research.\\n\\nTheir paper also included a set of charts showing how Democratic and GOP elites show more openness to change than do Democratic voters, GOP voters, and swing-voting independents."}

{"original": "Today, way too many people, in my opinion, are too frivolous with not only their God-given rights but those enumerated in the Constitution as well.\\n\\nThese rights represent the very essence of life in the United States and without these rights or the free exercise thereof, we become no better off than any other country on Earth. None of the enumerated rights in the Constitution are more important than those enumerated in the Second Amendment, i.e., the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nThe Second Amendment was written into the Constitution's Bill of Rights in order for the citizens of the United States to have the ability to ward off all enemies, both foreign and domestic, including those of an overbearing government. Included is the ability to protect ourselves and our families from those wishing to harm us. And, the exercise of these rights should be available to citizens no matter where we travel throughout this great country. However, such is not the case in today's world.\\n\\nToday, unless you live in a particular state that has signed reciprocity agreements with other states, your right to defend yourself and/or your family may end at the state line. Let that sink in. When you cross a state line, you may lose your right to self-protection. States such as California, Delaware, and New York offer no reciprocity with any other state, leaving all nonresidents defenseless as soon as they cross over that imaginary state line. No other right is treated with such disdain.\\n\\nHR 38—which the U.S. House of Representatives passed on December 6—would rectify this abominable situation by requiring all 50 states to give reciprocity to all citizens with a valid firearm license issued by any other state. It would, of course, like current reciprocal agreements between various states, require the license holder to abide by the laws of the state in which he or she is carrying a firearm. This bill would treat the firearms license in the same manner states now treat driver's licenses and marriage licenses. (Marriage licenses are issued by each state and all are recognized by all 50 states along with the privileges that are afforded by them.)\\n\\nMany people in this country do not travel to other states for pleasure but are forced to travel there because of their job requirements. Should not someone be held responsible for the safety of these citizens? Who? Certainly not their company as their company is not responsible for their safety in their home state. Law enforcement? We see daily how well that works. No matter how good or how hard law enforcement works, they simply cannot be everywhere. No, it is the law-abiding citizen who is responsible for him/herself in their home state as these people are their own first-responder.\\n\\nWhy should a Constitutionally enumerated right be treated differently? It should in no way be treated differently and no law-abiding citizen should ever be forced to be defenseless no matter where or for what reason they travel in this country. HR 38 is a bill that is long overdue, as the time is now to rectify many states' reluctance to allow all law-abiding citizens the right to self-protection no matter where they may travel.\\n\\nJerry Henry is the executive director of Georgia Carry and a guest columnist for Down Range with AWR Hawkins."}

{"original": "Comedian Doug Stanhope, a friend of embattled star Johnny Depp, claims in an explosive new column that the actor's wife is blackmailing him with accusations of domestic violence and physical abuse.\\n\\nIn a column for the Wrap, Stanhope wrote that he and other friends of Depp watched [Amber Heard] manipulate and f—k with the actor for years, but stayed quiet for fear of upsetting the Pirates of the Caribbean star.\\n\\nLast week, Heard, 30, appeared in a California court to claim that Depp was verbally and physically abusive toward her for the majority of their 15-month marriage. The Rum Diary actress also alleges that Depp threw a cellphone at her face during a violent altercation last Saturday night — Heard reportedly brought photos of her bruised face to court in an attempt to prove it.\\n\\nBut Stanhope, who has reportedly known Depp for years, wrote in the Wrap that he was at the couple's apartment earlier that day with his girlfriend Bingo — and that he believes Heard's claims are bullsh*t.\\n\\nStanhope wrote:\\n\\nBingo and I were at Johnny's house for most of that Saturday until just before the alleged assault. We assumed initially that his dour mood was because of his mother's death the day before. But he opened up in the most vulnerable of ways that it was not only his mother, but that Amber was now going to leave him, threatening to lie about him publicly in any and every possible duplicitous way if he didn't agree to her terms. Blackmail is what I would imagine other people might put it, including the manner in which he is now being vilified.\\n\\nBingo and I together, and then separately, told him how much we were aware of this manipulative a–hole, how his closest circle had all agreed on this since the day we met and that we all feared that telling him outright might alienate us all, he added. Love makes you do funny things.\\n\\nStanhope claims that Depp hadn't slept for days. So when the actor finally told him he felt like he could sleep, after a number of friends had expressed worry over Heard, they left.\\n\\nEverything Johnny had told us that she'd been threatening had actually come to be, Stanhope wrote of the claims that Heard later made in court.

A representative for Depp has vehemently denied the abuse allegations.\\n\\nThe actor's former partners, Vanessa Paradis and Lori Anne Allison, have both said in separate statements that Depp never physically abused them during the course of their relationships.

{"original": "On January 10, 1999, a cigar-puffing Tony Soprano drove out of the Lincoln Tunnel, onto the Jersey Turnpike, over the Meadowlands, past a 97 cent(!) gas sign, and through Jersey City before pulling into the driveway of his dull, generic suburban McMansion.\\n\\nIn the background Alabama 3's Woke Up This Morning throbbed on the soundtrack: Woke up this morning, you got yourself a gun, got yourself a gun, got yourself a gun… and with the sound of a record scratch, The Sopranos changed television forever.\\n\\nThe Sopranos is not the first show to tell a continuing story. There was Hill Street Blues and Twin Peaks; and let's not ignore primetime soaps like Dallas and Dynasty.\\n\\nThe Sopranos is not the first show to ignore the 22 to 24 episode season. For decades, the television miniseries, notably Roots (1977), The Winds of War (1980), Holocaust (1978), and most especially Rich Man, Poor Man (1976), had been gripping the nation over a handful of nights as novels for television.\\n\\nWhat Sopranos creator David Chase did accomplish, though, was nothing less than to crack the artistic code for a medium that was well into middle age.\\n\\nChase hardened the mold of the ten to thirteen episode format, and through adult storytelling, respect for the intelligence of his audience, cinema-quality production values, and pitch-perfect performances, showed the world what television was truly capable of. His mold is now the norm, what we expect. At the time, we had never seen anything like it, and therefore it is not hyperbole to argue The Sopranos is to television what Rock Around the Clock was to music.\\n\\nOne so-called first where I find myself in disagreement with some Sopranos fans is this idea Tony Soprano is television's first anti-hero.\\n\\nThere is nothing heroic about Anthony Soprano, anti or otherwise.\\n\\nAnti-heroes have a code and are willing to sacrifice to honor that code. Other than self-interest, Tony has no code. Through and through he is a gangster, adulterer, cold-blooded killer, inveterate liar, unrepentant racist, a bully, master manipulator, abuser of women, and a horrible, horrible father who made his children complicit to his crimes to devastating effect.\\n\\nHe is also a hypocrite, nothing like what he says he idealizes: Gary Cooper, the strong silent type. Tony is the exact opposite, a chronic complainer and serial-whiner prone to self-pity and rage.\\n\\nSomething else Tony is not: an old-fashioned gangster who honors the traditions of the mafia. He talks frequently about how great things once were and should be while brazenly violating those traditions through his smallness, rage, and greed.\\n\\nTony Soprano is evil.\\n\\nBut thanks to writing sharp enough to shave with and the late James Gandolfini's startlingly brilliant performance, Tony Soprano is also human, complicated, layered, and above all fascinating. What draws us to Tony is what convinced Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) to treat him in therapy: charisma, melancholy, and the hope his unique qualities (in a Mafioso at least) — namely intelligence and a certain level of self-awareness – will lead to redemption.\\n\\nFor the first time on television we are rooting for the villain, and this makes us as complicit, and that complicity is thrilling … at least for a while. The Tony we first meet, the man struggling with depression, panic attacks, conscience, the man capable of empathy, will slowly devolve into a rank bastard. And like Melfi, we come to realize we have been conned by a sociopath. And yes, there is also something thrilling about that, about being so expertly hustled for so long by Chase and his team of genius writers.\\n\\nAs a fan of the gangster genre, and an even bigger fan of David Chase (Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The Rockford Files), like a few million others, I caught the Sopranos premiere on HBO and … was disappointed. It was nothing like I expected, it was not Goodfellas in Jersey. Who cares about Tony's home life? But I hung in there and realized that throughout the week I was thinking about The Sopranos, talking about it, something I had not done since Twin Peaks, another show that took some time to fall in love with.\\n\\nBy the end of that first season I was hooked … and still am. Just last month, and for the fourth time since 2007, I binged the entire series, all 86 episodes in a few fevered weeks. What a pleasure it is to get lost again in that world, what a joy to revisit those magnificent characters and pick up on a million things I missed in previous viewings. Like a great novel, The Sopranos improves with each viewing, becomes richer, a wondrous buried treasure you never stop uncovering…\\n\\nNothing about The Sopranos has aged, and again, like a great novel, the most important aspect of it never will — its themes. While the show is about countless things, it is primarily concerned with two that are even more relevant today: the emptiness of American consumerism and the toxicity of identity politics.\\n\\nDavid Chase presents to us a cast of characters who, like us, have everything, who are blessed to live in America at the turn of the 20th century, which means we are the most prosperous generation in the history of the world. Food is so cheap and plentiful that obesity (a lack of self-control) is a disease, and so is this god of consumerism we mindlessly worship.\\n\\nCriticizing consumerism is not the same as criticizing capitalism. Consumerism is materialism, the worship of stuff, the tragic belief having it all will make you happy.\\n\\nLook at us, look at this amazing country of ours… We have done it. We have eradicated hunger. Our so-called poor own cell phones, air conditioners, enjoy cable TV… America is an economic miracle where the working class live like pharaohs, and yet this has not delivered the fulfillment promised.\\n\\nRather than appreciating this bounty, it has made us weak, spoiled, soft, petty, greedy, entitled, and by extension, deeply unhappy and dysfunctional. The vicious circle of the psychosis works like this: if having it all doesn't make you happy, that can only mean you don't have enough.\\n\\nWorse, this abundance has removed our sense of purpose. No longer are we needed to hunt and gather (as Melfi explains), or to protect our families, or to keep the wolf from the door. Desperate for a purpose, we now have the luxury to look inward, to work on ourselves. Melfi believes this is healthy. Through her eventual awakening and the jaw-dropping awfulness of the other therapists portrayed on the show, The Sopranos is here to tell us the opposite is true.\\n\\nSet during the George W. Bush era, Chase speaks of our lost purpose by reminding us we don't even fight our own wars anymore. Someone else's kids go out and do that for us, while we go to the mall (just as the president ordered), to the movies, lose ourselves in online porn, in chemicals and loveless sex, embrace shallow acts of trendy activism, practice our religion when it suits us, or simply treat it like a superstition, a form of witchcraft that wards off assuming responsibility.\\n\\nPursuing the American dream gave us purpose, achieving it left us empty and lost, and now we try to fill that spiritual hole by filling our homes with useless shit, by self-medicating, by pretending our social causes and faith are not just another form of narcissism — a sword to jab others and find them lacking and a shield to cover up what selfish and self-centered people we are.\\n\\nIn one episode, Tony sums this up brilliantly as a series of distractions until you die.\\n\\nThrough Chase's characters, and specifically through the prosperous and miserably unhappy Soprano family, he tells the story of an America cursed with achieving the American Dream, because … what the hell are we supposed to strive for now?\\n\\nThe Italian thing, the mother thing, the tradition thing, the need-to-control thing, the status thing, the alpha-male thing… Tony's existence is all about rationalizing as duty his endless pursuit of worldly pleasures — of those distractions until you die. The result is that Tony lives in a prison of his own making, a prison built on bullshit. And now he is barren and miserable and paying the price for abandoning his one true duty, that purpose which is truly fulfilling — being a decent and loving family man, being his own man.\\n\\nTony is America. No, that's unfair. Too broad… Tony is much of America. Too much.\\n\\nChildren without direction and purpose run amok. What you get when adults have no purpose or direction — to paraphrase my favorite moment from the series — are ethnic pride parades, shopping malls, and professionals assuring everyone nothing is their fault.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the show's relentless and righteous condemnation of identity politics.\\n\\nHollywood's modern-day Production Code would never allow Chase to explore the poison of this mindless tribalism through a protected class (blacks, gays, etc.), so he gives us a wealthy Italian family (and Family) as the ultimate example of the self-destructive madness found in those who use something as hollow as race and creed to have it both ways — to wallow in the false sense of superiority that comes with seeing yourself as persecuted.\\n\\nPersecuted. In America. Please.\\n\\nTrying to fully explain or grasp what this show is about is like trying to empty a bathtub with a butter knife. Wrapping your arms around something this enormous, this deep, this nuanced, and loaded with theme, is an impossible task. Each episode is deserving of its own chapter, each season a doctoral dissertation.\\n\\nTo try and come as close as possible to delve into everything worth talking about, I've decided to lay out some of my favorite moments from the show, those small moments that say so much, and sometimes say everything.\\n\\n—\\n\\nA.J. Soprano Does Not Know What Gutters Are\\n\\nThis clip reveals one of the most enjoyable traits about The Sopranos, which is how laugh-out-loud hilarious it is. This moment from season three is also about something bigger — those spoiled sociopaths being raised in countless American homes.\\n\\nA.J. Soprano (Robert Iler) will never follow in his father's footsteps as a gangster. That would require two things he does not possess: physical courage and a work ethic. Instead, A.J. is the archetype of the utterly useless millennial, the glassy-eyed sloth whose sense of empathy has been washed away by material excess, by never facing the consequences of his actions, by never being allowed to fail or face adversity.\\n\\nWhatever spark this kid might have once had was snuffed out by helicopter parenting and a useless school system that considers fidgeting a symptom of a disease called ADD.\\n\\nNaturally, this disease requires medication (so lazy educators don't have to deal with him), and above all, means the child is disabled and therefore a victim and therefore special and therefore never-ever responsible for his own actions.\\n\\nThe result is the sociopath A.J. who, by the end of the series, has no job skills, other than the ability to emotionally blackmail and manipulate everyone around him to get what he wants. A phony suicide attempt, a lot of pouting and moping, a passive-aggressive threat to join the military, and suddenly A.J. Soprano, the epitome of laziness and irresponsibility, has a job developing a movie and driving a BMW.\\n\\nOh, and he's not a hypocrite for driving that BMW, though, because a BMW is better for the environment than the SUV his carelessness turned into a $35,000 fireball.\\n\\nCarmela Soprano (and Sopranos Fans) Finally Hears the Truth\\n\\nMany patients want to be excused for their current predicament because of events that have occurred in their childhood. That's what psychiatry has become in America. Visit any shopping mall or ethnic pride parade to witness the results.\\n\\nBelow are my favorite four minutes in all of television:\\n\\nIn my mind, the true villain of The Sopranos is Tony's wife, Carmela (Edie Falco). In the classic first season episode College, she straight-up confesses that her greed and avarice take precedent over the evil she allows in her home and the effect it will have on her children.\\n\\nThe scene above is from early in the third season, and my guess is that it was at this point Chase decided he needed to lay down the law, to come straight out and tell the audience what the series is about — shopping malls and ethnic pride parades — and that nothing these characters do is in any way okay.\\n\\nOther than Artie Bucco's wife Charmaine (Kathrine Narducci), who regularly pleads with both the audience and her none-too-bright husband not to get too close to the mafia flame, this is the first and only time a truly moral voice is heard in the series, someone who not only condemns our heroes, but pours undiluted truth over so many modern hypocrisies.\\n\\nNaturally, none of this gets through to Carmela. This wise man didn't tell her what she wants to hear, so she shops around until someone does tell her what she does want to hear — that she is trapped in this life (she loves) by her sacred marriage vows. Sadly, this rationalization comes from a Catholic priest.\\n\\nCarmela is a monster, a monstrous mother, a Renfeld to Tony's Vampire, an audacious hypocrite who knows exactly what she is doing, what it is doing to her kids, but who will never give up the furs and jewels. The only time Carmela pushes Tony away is when she's feeling insecure financially or when his adultery threatens to publicly embarrass her and by extension her social status.\\n\\nJunior Soprano Falls in the Bathtub\\n\\nYour sister's cunt!\\n\\nThe beginning of the end for Junior Soprano arrives early in season two when the 71-year-old boss of New Jersey falls in the shower (the first of an endless stream of coming indignities and disasters), just after a win, after successfully scheming his release from prison.\\n\\nLike most of the series' characters, Junior is an archetype — the bitterly insecure old man staring death in the face; the miserable prick all too aware that the only thing that awaits him is sickness and death. He has no family to comfort him, no faith to guide him, so all he can do is rage and complain and spread his misery.\\n\\nJunior is also my favorite character in the series. Every line of dialogue is profane poetry, and usually funnier than anything you will hear in a sitcom (I've been farting into the same sofa cushion for eighteen months!)\\n\\nAs Junior, Dominic Chianese is a wonder to behold. How many actors could wring fear, anger, bitterness, and overall pathos out of Your sister's cunt.\\n\\nBrilliant performance. Brilliant character. Beyond brilliant writing.\\n\\nDr. Melfi Fires Tony\\n\\nI'm chalking all of this up to female menopausal situations.\\n\\nDr. Jennifer Melfi was as close as the series ever came to creating a character representing the audience.\\n\\nYes, she has ethics and found her Italian ex-husband's obsession with identity politics absurd, but she is also attracted to Tony. She enjoys being a tourist in his world. This gives her mundane life a thrill. For this reason, she is also no hero, at least not until the penultimate episode where she finally fires him as her patient.\\n\\nWhat prompts this firing is Mefli's own therapist, Dr. Kupferberg (Peter Bogdanovich) who, in his own underhanded and cowardly way, forces Melfi to confront a study that says sociopaths cannot be treated in therapy. In fact, treating a sociopath only makes them a better criminal.\\n\\nWith the truth staring her in the face, Melfi summons the courage to do the right thing. But if you watch the above scene, it is marvelously real. She's scared and angry, but also clumsy, and for this reason the moment is terribly unsatisfying. There is no catharsis, and this is deliberate.\\n\\nFor years, even though she knew better, Melfi allowed herself to act as Tony's enabler, even his consigliore.\\n\\nTherefore, the series doesn't believe that she, or us, deserve to feel righteous after being complicit (there's that word again) for so long.\\n\\nGuns Hidden Inside Roman Columns, TVs Sitting on Roman Columns\\n\\nOne abiding Sopranos theme is how Chase subtly uses the fall of Rome as a metaphor for the fall of America and the Italian Mafia.\\n\\nThe fact that Tony and Carmela use a hollowed out Roman column, the same column that once signified Rome's strength and power, to hide firearms and as a bedroom television stand, is the perfect symbolism for everything Chase wants to say.\\n\\nTony's Heart-Wrenching Dream-Coma\\n\\nThe Sopranos spent much of season five showing us just what a miserable bastard Tony Soprano really is. Honestly, by the end of that season I always hate the guy. Then, at the beginning of season six, Tony is not only shot, he is in a coma dying from sepsis.\\n\\nIn two remarkable episodes we experience what the comatose Tony Soprano experiences — a version of hell or purgatory, and here is how the first of those two episodes ends…\\n\\n…with the very real possibility Tony could die and the horror of the loneliness of his death dream … and our heart breaks.\\n\\nThrough masterful storytelling, character building, Gandolfini's second-to-none artistry, and Chase's ear for the perfect song (which elevates every Sopranos episode), this moment never fails to wreck me.\\n\\nThat last lonely shot of Tony before the credits … I fall in love with the guy all over again.\\n\\nShaking Down Starbucks\\n\\nIt's over for the little guy.\\n\\nAnother theme Chase often touches on is how America is becoming Generica, a country where no matter where you go, every place looks like every other place by way of the cancerous spread of corporate chains and box stores. The visual character of this country has literally been bulldozed by hotels, restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores, strip malls, and coffee shops that all look alike.\\n\\nIn this scene from the middle of season six, so much is said about this in the most entertaining fashion imaginable:\\n\\nYou can laugh at the predicament of a couple of mobsters trying to shake down a national coffee chain, but the real lesson here comes from the store manager — a corporate eunuch, a company drone who doesn't care because he hasn't built anything and has no stake in the place — which again adds to our sense of having no purpose.\\n\\nCarmine Lupertazzi Jr. Gets It\\n\\nThat dream with my father, the empty box; that wasn't about being boss, it was about being happy.\\n\\nFor two seasons we've been laughing at Little Carmine, his weakness, his vanity, his hilarious malapropisms. And then, in this wonderfully surprising and touching scene (starts at 1:35), we discover the dimwit is the wisest character of them all, Tony's Happy Wanderer, the one who figured out that the bullshit is bullshit and the only thing that matters in life, the only thing that fulfills, is family, is in the honoring of those seemingly humdrum rituals shared with the woman you love.\\n\\nMeadow Soprano Becomes a Mafia Princess\\n\\nOther than enjoying the benefits of being smart and beautiful, Meadow Soprano (Jamie-Lynne Sigler) is no different from her brother A.J.\\n\\nIf you look close enough, if you look past the sophistication and her progressive platitudes about race and poverty, you will find the same unfeeling sociopath. Meadow is basically her mother, a woman desperate for status, respectability, and STUFF. During Carmela's era, those things came from being a housewife and Catholic. Meadow's era requires symbolic acts of activism and a profession.\\n\\nBy the show's final episode, Made In America, Meadow is a full-blown mafia princess, is Carmela. She will marry into the mob, Patsy Parisi's son, a lawyer who defends the corrupt, and she will pretend that becoming a mob lawyer is rooted in social justice.\\n\\nTony Soprano: You said you wanted to be a lawyer for black people. Meadow Soprano: Oh, that's all I said? Really? What I said was The state can crush the individual. Tony Soprano: New Jersey? Meadow Soprano: The government. Specifically, the federal government. Tony Soprano: And what about little babies? They face, uh, meningitis. Meadow Soprano: You know what really turned me? Seeing the way Italians are treated. It's like Mom says. And if we can have our rights trampled like that, imagine what it's like for recent arrivals. Tony Soprano: Well… Meadow Soprano: If I hadn't seen you dragged away all those times by the FBI, then I'd probably be a boring suburban doctor.\\n\\nThe scourge of identity politics strikes again.\\n\\nSpeaking of identity politics, here is another fabulous example…\\n\\nThe Soprano Crew Defend Christopher Columbus\\n\\nIn this wonderful episode, where every possible group claims to be the most oppressed (Italians, Indians, blacks, women, even Italians who live in the north compared to those who live in the south), Tony is finally allowed to explode for all the right reasons:\\n\\nTony is usually pretty obtuse about these things, but here he is a voice of maturity and reason.\\n\\nLeft-wing pop culture writers frequently single this episode out as the series' worst.\\n\\nCan't imagine why.\\n\\nPaulie Talks to His Priest\\n\\nThe real con man here is the Catholic priest, the spiritual grifter who has taken all that money from Paulie (Tony Sirico) without ever telling him he cannot buy his way out of his sins.\\n\\nAs a practicing Catholic, this is something I see way too often: a morally crippled institution more concerned with keeping the customers happy than reminding them hell exists.\\n\\nBoth Paulie and the man betraying his sacred duty to save Paulie's soul treat the Christian faith as a transactional business, a superstition, witchcraft…\\n\\nFor those of us who believe, there is nothing more consequential or tragic.\\n\\nJanice Shoots Richie\\n\\nTony's older sister Janice (Aida Turturro) is another wonderful archetype, the malevolent hippie — the parasite and welfare cheat who hides behind her precious causes and disabilities, the phony who is all about peace, love, feminism, so cool and easygoing, when she is really a black hole of need, malice, and hypocrisy.\\n\\nThis scene from the end of the second season not only showed us who Janice really is, it is a wonderful piece of storytelling.\\n\\nThroughout season two, Richie Aprile (David Proval) and Tony have been headed towards a collision. Further complicating things is Richie's engagement to Tony's sister, Janice. At this point we assume Tony will either cave to Richie's demands for more authority or whack him. And then this happens, and it is not only a wonderful surprise, it makes perfect sense.\\n\\nAt first, the show's surprises were thrilling. But as we came to expect them, the anticipation of those surprises made viewing an even richer pleasure.\\n\\nJohnny Sack Loses His Backyard to a Herd of McMansions\\n\\nIn season three, chain-smoking New York mobster Johnny Sacrimoni (an amazing Vincent Curatola creating another of my all-time favorite characters) moves to an idyllic part of New Jersey to escape a crass and crowded New York.\\n\\nThe tractor plowing the field behind Johnny Sack's new home is a beautiful touch:\\n\\nOver time, though, we watch as that idyllic field is sold off for lots, and before long Johnny Sack's pastoral getaway is just another crowded suburb overflowing with McMansions.\\n\\nThe Point of No Return\\n\\nGood Morning, Rat\\n\\nEarly in the first season, Chase has his protagonist cross a line the audience never recovers from — Tony strangling a man to death in cold blood.\\n\\nThis was the most important moment in the series. From here, there was no going back. Until now, we could rationalize our sympathy for Tony. Through four episodes, he had not yet killed or even ordered a killing. In fact, he was the one calling for calm, for order, a charismatic knockaround guy guilty of nothing more than giving consenting adults access to vices criminalized by the government.\\n\\nNo more.\\n\\nJackie Jr.'s Sit Down\\n\\nNormally, I would never get involved with a stranger.\\n\\nYou cannot discuss The Sopranos without acknowledging everything that came before or how our knowledge of the gangster genre adds so much to the show without becoming cheap fan service.\\n\\nChase also didn't shy away from how gangster movies affect gangsters, affect his own characters — the way they talk, dress, see the world and themselves.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of wonderful moments like this, but dim-witted and doomed Jackie Jr. doing his Godfather bit manages to be both touching and hilarious.\\n\\nAnother favorite pop culture reference is when the movie-obsessed Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli) assumes the role of Joe Pesci's character in Goodfellas by shooting a mouthy smartass in the foot. If you recall, in Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece, the character shot in the foot is Spider, who is played by Imperioli.\\n\\nAnd yes, that's Joseph R. Gannascoli playing a bakery bystander, who will later return as Vito Spatafore (Gay Vito) in season two.\\n\\nJanice Literally Sucking the Marrow Out of Something\\n\\nNeed I explain?\\n\\nIn Conclusion:\\n\\nI am not a fan of Tony's death at the end of the series (for the record, I believe Patsy ordered the hit fearing Tony would hit him first). I understand and appreciate Chase not wanting to offer us a final catharsis. That would go against everything he wanted to say about crime, life, and even the medium of television. But this… Man.\\n\\nEnding a seven year journey using Tony's literal point of view after death, leaving us hanging with the fate of all these other characters, is a rip-off. And try as I might, I cannot see the artistic rationale, how this serves everything that came before.\\n\\nNevertheless, for as long as I live, every few years, I will continue to return to the Pine Barrens and to the Bada Bing and to Satriale's… Continue to dig into that buried treasure that, like all magnificent art, is timeless in its beauty and forever relevant to the human condition.\\n\\nAnd, oh, how I wish those guys were still with us, still living in our world. What they would have to say about iPhone addictions, social media, the mess that is cable news, Pope Francis, self-checkout lanes, Trump, Hillary, the Woke era…\\n\\nWell, unfortunately, we cannot even begin to imagine what they would say, because we do not hold the power to bottle lightning.\\n\\nThis piece was updated to correct a factual error.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "Former presidential candidate Jeb Bush attacked President Trump Thursday because Trump attacks others. Yes, this actually happened.\\n\\nProving once again that he has no core, no solid set of established beliefs or principles that would enable him to communicate a consistency of thought, Bush made a public fool of himself with his glaring hypocrisy, and yet another example of the hopelessly muddled thinking that made him a non-starter as a 2016 presidential candidate.\\n\\nRemember how it took Bush two weeks to answer a simple question about the Iraq War? It was like watching a monkey try to make love to a soccer ball slathered in grease.\\n\\nBush seemed then, and did again Thursday morning, like a craven and shallow politician who believes the only way to win elections is through appeasing the establishment media.\\n\\nThe nonsense Jeb spewed, especially when you look back at the Bush family history (which I will get to), beggars belief.\\n\\nHere are the lowlights:\\n\\nI can't imagine having to attack someone to make yourself look strong, Bush said during his Squawk Box appearance as John Kerry choked on a croissant.\\n\\n[Winning the presidency] is not worth disparaging people — [by being] a racist, homophobe, he added, as Willie Horton dropped his prison shiv.\\n\\nSo to my Republican friends … you have to praise the president when he does good things…. But when he goes beyond the line, or anyone else does, for that matter, you have to stand on principle.\\n\\nPublic leaders have a responsibility to fortify the culture, the 66-year-old former-governor said, in a direct attempt to shame Trump.\\n\\nLook I'm not a Never Trumper, and I think people get obsessed to the point where they cannot give him credit for the good things he has done. Bush said, even though he is a resident of the swing state of Florida and did not vote for Trump in 2016.\\n\\nWhen asked if he would run for office again, Bush laughably said he could not imagine having to attack someone to make yourself look strong.\\n\\nAnd then came this blubbering BS, The kind of campaign [Trump] ran would've never been successful a decade ago, or in the age of Reagan and Bush.\\n\\nWho does Jeb Bush think he's kidding?\\n\\nNow, before we go any further, I need to be perfectly clear about something… I personally have no problem with bare-knuckle politics, dirty politics, brutal politics. As long as violence, the condoning of violence, or the justifying of violence is not involved, I am pro-brutal politics. The nastier the better. Listen, when you live in a world with a corrupt establishment media that will stop at nothing — like accusing John McCain of having an affair with a lobbyist — to put Democrats in office, when you live in a world where Mitt Romney is accused of killing a woman, when you live in a world where CNN folk heroes a anti-Trump thug, you have to play the game as it is lays.\\n\\nNothing George W. Bush did to win re-election, nothing Trump did, bothered me in the least. There is also an honesty in the ugliness that I appreciate.\\n\\nJeb, however, is another matter. On top of being utterly clueless about how the real world works, his unmoored principles have once again exposed him as a man who should not be allowed anywhere near an oval-shaped office.\\n\\nDid Jeb not see what his own brother — George W. — did to personally denigrate and emasculate John Kerry in 2004?\\n\\nLike Barack Obama, George W. Bush proved to be a much better campaigner than president, and that glorious 2004 campaign was only about one thing — turning Kerry into an elite, French-loving, wind-surfer who hates America, lied about his war record, and is kept by his wife — a foreigney condiment heiress.\\n\\nAgain, I had no problem with any of this. To begin with, it is all true. In fact, the 2004 presidential election was a hoot. I loved every minute of watching Kerry melt into a puddle of ridicule.\\n\\nBut where was Principled and Outspoken Jeb when this hit the airwaves…?\\n\\nWhere was Principled Jeb, the man horrified by Trump's homophobia (this is a lie; for starters, Trump supports same-sex marriage) when his brother's 2004 campaign was intentionally putting the divisive issue of gay marriage on the ballot in every swing state to cynically gin up turnout?\\n\\nWhere was Principled Jeb, a man who says he's horrified by racism, when his own dad was going the full-Willie Horton?\\n\\nNo normal person believes the Willie Horton ad was anything other than honest, but Jeb likes to play by the media's rules, and the media say it was racist.\\n\\nAnd so, Jeberoni, the Jebster, Jeb!, Yeb!, Mr. Sensitive Conscience, is not only a pathetic weakling and more confused in his thinking than any national political candidate in memory, he is not even talented in his passive-aggressive attacks on Trump, because he looks like a braying jackass.\\n\\nGeorge W. Bush was brilliant at the politics of ridicule. As was Barack Obama (see: Romney, Mitt). Trump, however, is the god-king and Jeb's butt is obviously still smarting over getting a brutal taste of his own family's medicine.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "An article about Wikipedia published last Thursday on the Fox News website examined the left-wing bias of the online encyclopedia. Larry Sanger, co-founder of Wikipedia, stated in an interview for the article: The days of Wikipedia's robust commitment to neutrality are long gone. Fox also interviewed economics professor Bryan Caplan regarding the slanted coverage of communism and socialism on their Wikipedia pages, notably the omission of atrocities carried out by communist governments.\\n\\nFox cited other critics of the site and its biased handling of left-wing ideologies. Sanger previously published a blog post criticizing Wikipedia for its left-wing bias, declaring the site's neutrality policy dead due to bias.\\n\\nIn the Fox piece by Maxim Lott, Wikipedia is noted as having received less scrutiny than the other Big Tech firms. However, the piece further notes these tech firms, such as Google, also rely heavily on the site and Wikipedia itself is one of the most popular sites globally. The report follows this by reporting: critics – including Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger – tell Fox News that many Wikipedia pages have become merely left-wing advocacy essays.\\n\\nSanger is quoted by Fox as stating: Wikipedia's ideological and religious bias is real and troubling, particularly in a resource that continues to be treated by many as an unbiased reference work. Sanger also told Fox the deck is too stacked on Wikipedia for it to ever be salvaged and he has instead focused on helping facilitate the spread of alternative online encyclopedias through his Encyclosphere project. Those efforts are complicated by Big Tech's reliance on Wikipedia in their campaign against fake news online in keeping with messaging suggested to Wikipedia's owners by a public relations firm run by the Clinton Foundation's Head of Communications.\\n\\nFox News cites the Wikipedia articles on socialism and communism as examples of leftist bias. While both delve into leftist theory, they also covered each ideology's history almost completely ignoring the brutality and authoritarianism of many proclaimed socialist or communist regimes. Regarding the Soviet Union, one section states Soviet rule saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century with only a brief mention of the excesses of Stalin's regime not mentioning the famines and mass-killings it entailed. On Asia, Mao's reign in China is essentially unmentioned, while mentioning Indonesia's Suharto killing hundreds of thousands to suppress leftists.\\n\\nWikipedia's page on communism incredibly even mentions the Moscow Trials in a section on the Soviet Union yet does not mention they were widely seen as show trials and leaves unmentioned how they served as the starting point for Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, which led to the deaths of as many as a million people targeted by Soviet secret police. As Fox notes, the famines that occurred under Mao and Stalin's respective reigns in China and the Soviet Union are not mentioned and the word famine is not even present in the article on communism.\\n\\nOne editor's attempt to address the white-washed nature of the communism article following Fox's coverage by adding an additional paragraph to a short two-paragraph criticism section was quickly undone claiming it lended undue weight to criticism. In reaction to the white-washed nature of the pages, Caplan declared omission of large-scale mass murder, slave labor, and man-made famines is negligent and deeply misleading on Wikipedia's part. According to Fox News, when asked for comment the Wikimedia Foundation that owns Wikipedia noted content is controlled by volunteer editors and stated the site is a living, breathing project, and is always evolving just as our shared understanding of a topic does.\\n\\nNoting that neither article covers the most repressive and murderous acts of openly socialist or communist governments, Fox does note that an article exists on the topic of Mass killings under communist regimes. The mass killings article is notorious on Wikipedia as having at one point been under an unprecedented years-long indefinite page lock, which barred anyone without special administrative privileges from editing the page. Imposed back in 2011 to enforce a restriction requiring that all substantive edits receive consensus support, the page was eventually unlocked in 2018 with new looser restrictions imposed.\\n\\nAt the time the mass killings page was unlocked, the introduction to the page listed various figures for the extent of mass killings in the tens of millions, including the Black Book of Communism's range of 85 million to 100 million deaths. However, since the page was unlocked, the introduction has been considerably shortened to remove any mention of casualty figures in the millions, instead stating simply that estimates vary widely on the subject. A previously small sub-section questioning the inclusion of devastating famines occurring under communist-led governments was also considerably expanded with material mostly disputing the attribution of famines to specifically communist policies.\\n\\nPrevious efforts to address problems on the page about communism were also raised by Fox News, noting editor Narssarssuaq had repeatedly added to the communism article a line noting mass-killings have been attributed to communist governments. The line was eventually removed with one editor objecting on the article's discussion page by claiming Stalin was a Christian and therefore it would be like including his acts under the article on Christianity adding, Communism didn't kill these people; Stalin did.\\n\\nNarssarssuaq months later posted a notice about leaving Wikipedia claiming my conscience does not allow me to contribute to this project, not even with attempts to provide balance to biased articles and that the era of Wikipedia, if there ever was one, is over. Among other complaints, the editor stated: Unfortunately, it now seems that Wikipedia cannot be trusted to convey objective information – the information you get could easily be partisan. Later returning, Narssarssuaq would leave again after coming into conflict with editors over their suppression of Biden family corruption elections in the weeks before the 2020 Presidential election, one of many instances where editors supported Biden's campaign.\\n\\nBias from administrators in Wikipedia disputes is one factor frustrating attempts to balance site content. Narssarssuaq's efforts relating to Biden family corruption allegations were ultimately frustrated by an openly biased administrator who called the allegations Russian disinformation and threatened sanctions against Narssarssuaq citing numerous erroneous reasons. One editor interviewed by Fox noted another administrator favorably displays an anti-democratic quote from Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. This is apparently El C who previously used dubious reasoning to keep ICE detention facilities in a concentration camps list, echoing Democrat attacks against President Donald Trump's Administration. El C also recently expressed support for one editor's profile page suggesting Trump be hanged for treason.\\n\\nAn analysis in the Critic last year examined the question of administrative bias and found Wikipedia editors favoring right-wing views were six times more likely to be sanctioned by administrators than left-leaning editors. That analysis cited administrator Guy Chapman as another example of left-wing bias, including him joining a Black Lives Matter group on Wikipedia by stating: You can be one of three things: ally, enemy, or collaborator. Chapman is among many editors who supported Black Lives Matter and the far-left Antifa group on Wikipedia articles. Late last year he resigned as an administrator after banning an Antifa opponent from the group's page, though he denied his resignation was related.\\n\\nIn contrast to left-wing editors supporting violence and violent groups, one even having praised an Antifa terrorist attack on an ICE detention facility, editors who favor the right have been treated more harshly. An editor who expressed general support for Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on January 6th was banned indefinitely, one of many banned when opposing left-wing bias on the topic, despite having brought articles on two American Presidents and one Vice President up to featured status, the highest standard on the site.\\n\\nPrior to Fox's recent report, Sanger had criticized Wikipedia's left-wing bias himself on his blog. In that post, Sanger analyzed the articles on Trump and former President Barack Obama, describing how the latter was treated much more favorably including by not mentioning any scandals on Obama's page. He also analyzed other articles, such as the one on Jesus Christ, which he said could be fairly described as a liberal academic discussion of Jesus in a criticism later cited by Christian media reports condemning a decision last year banning profile pages expressing support for traditional marriage.\\n\\nStudies and analyses have previously identified a left-wing bias on Wikipedia, including a Harvard study cited in Fox's report. However, corporate media have generally praised Wikipedia for its reliability in recent years and many have relied on it as a source to the point of copying from it extensively, while conservative media such as Fox News and Breitbart itself have been increasingly purged from the site. Wikipedia has also been found to shape scientific literature and business decisions.\\n\\n(Disclosure: The author has previously been involved in disputes on Wikipedia with some parties referenced in this article)\\n\\nT.

{"original": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kimye is kaput.\\n\\nKim Kardashian West filed for divorce from Kanye West in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday after 6 1/2 years of marriage, court records show.\\n\\nKim Kardashian West filed for divorce from Kanye West Friday after 6 1/2 years of marriage, court records show. The move brings an impending end to one of the most followed celebrity unions of the 21st century — the marriage of a reality TV superstar and a hip-hop and fashion phenomenon with four kids, a vast fortune to split and even more fame.\\n\\nThe couple began dating in 2012 and had their first child in 2013. West proposed later that year using the giant screen at the empty waterfront ballpark of the San Francisco Giants, and the two married May 24, 2014, in a ceremony at a Renaissance fortress in Florence, Italy.\\n\\nThe beginning of the end of the marriage comes after the September announcement that the show that made her family's name, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, was coming to an end in 2021 after 14 years.\\n\\nIt was the first marriage for the West, 43, and the third for Kardashian, 40. While the union wasn't long, it outlasted the predictions of many cynics who thought doom was inevitable given the two oversized personalities, West's well-known volatility and the fact that Kardashian's previous marriage, to former NBA player Kris Humphries, was fleetingly brief.\\n\\nKardashian's first marriage at age 19 in 2000 to music producer Damon Thomas lasted until 2004, and in 2011, she married Humphries in a heavily hyped wedding that was televised in a two-part special on Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\\n\\nShe filed for divorce less than three months later, though was still legally married in 2012 when she and West, a friend for years who had paid tribute to her in his songs, became a couple, and she became pregnant.\\n\\nSince the Humphries divorce, Kardashian has retained the services of perhaps the best-known divorce attorney in the country, Laura Wasser, dubbed the Disso Queen after representing clients that include Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp and Britney Spears. Wasser filed the divorce Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court. It was first reported by celebrity website TMZ.\\n\\nKardashian is a Los Angeles-area lifer, but West is from Chicago and spends much of his time, including many of the latter months of the marriage, at his ranch in Wyoming, and has said he wants his kids with him there.\\n\\nTheir four children are all 7 or under: North, age 7, Saint, age 5, Chicago, age 3, and Psalm, 21 months old.\\n\\nBoth Kardashian and West have have parlayed their initial fame — his for being a sought-after hip-hop producer and the rapper behind Stronger and Gold Digger, hers for becoming a reality TV star on a par with a movie star — into bigger endeavors, and have amassed considerable wealth with it.\\n\\nWest's Yeezy fashion line, with its pricey clothing and coveted Adidas sneakers, has become as much part of his life and persona and his music. Kardashian went from famous socialite to major businesswoman, with mobile apps and games in her name, along with beauty products and clothes.\\n\\nWest has 30 million followers on Twitter, Kardashian has nearly 200 million on Instagram. Both are among the most posted-about people in the history of social media.\\n\\nWest was a vocal Donald Trump supporter who became a minor candidate for president last year; he ended up having little effect on the election. Kardashian has taken preliminary steps toward becoming a lawyer after devoting herself increasingly to freeing the unjustly imprisoned, which had led to meetings with Trump.\\n\\nWhile their marriage was extremely high profile in some ways as two experts in self-promotion became a team, the two did not appear together in public all that frequently. And the inner workings of their marriage were usually a well-guarded secret that took years to spill out into public view. On Keeping Up with the Kardashians, West appeared only occasionally, mostly serving as an oft-discussed off-screen character, and unlike other Kardashian couplings, viewers didn't see even made-for-TV versions of fights or especially tender moments.\\n\\nThey had more than their share of globe-trotting, scene-making and controversy-stirring moments however, from a trip to Jerusalem for North's baptism, to fashion weeks around the world including one in Paris where Kardashian was bound and robbed, to West's years-long feud with Taylor Swift, which Kardashian got sucked into.\\n\\nBut their careers did not have much overlap, and they spent much of their married time far apart.\\n\\nAnd her carefully curated persona stood in contrast to his erratic public moments that often resulted in wild statements and over-sharing tweet storms.\\n\\nIn one of these, since deleted, in July 2020, West said he had been trying to divorce Kardashian, that her mother Kris Jenner was a tyrant and that the family was trying to force him into psychiatric treatment.\\n\\nKardashian responded with a statement on Instagram, urging people to have compassion for West as he struggled with mental illness.\\n\\nHe is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with that pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder, Kardashian said. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.\\n\\nWest has not tweeted since election night."}
{"original": "A heterosexual couple have lost their legal battle to enter into a civil partnership.\\n\\nAcademics Rebecca Steinfeld, 35, and Charles Keidan, 40, wanted to secure legal recognition of their seven-year relationship by entering into a civil partnership, rejecting marriage as they claim it carries patriarchal baggage. However, they have been prevented from doing so because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 stipulates that only same-sex couples are eligible.\\n\\nIn November the couple, who have a seven-month-old daughter, challenged a decision by High Court judge Mrs Justice Andrews to dismiss their judicial review action. But on Tuesday their challenge was in turn dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the Telegraph has reported.\\n\\nAddressing Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Beatson and Lord Justice Briggs, Karon Monaghan QC advanced the argument that barring the couple from entering into a civil partnership was incompatible with Article 14 of the European Convention, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life.\\n\\nThey wish very much – and it is of very considerable importance to them – to enter into a legally regulated relationship which does not carry with it patriarchal baggage, which many consider comes with the institution of marriage, she said.\\n\\nDan Squires QC, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, who has responsibility for equalities within Government, told the court that a decision had been taken within Government to see how legislation extending marriage for same-sex couples planned out before offering civil partnerships up to heterosexual couples.\\n\\nThe judges agreed with the couple that a potential violation of Article 14, taken with Article 8, had been identified, but Lady Justice Arden dissented on the question of whether the Government's current wait and see policy was justified.\\n\\nMs Steinfeld said: We are pleased that today's ruling has shown that the Government must act very soon to end this unfair situation.\\n\\nAll three judges agreed that we're being treated differently because of our sexual orientation, and that this impacts our private and family life.\\n\\nAll three rejected the argument that we could 'just get married'. All three emphasised that the Government cannot maintain the status quo for much longer – they are on borrowed time.\\n\\nLady Justice Arden had accepted their case on almost every point, she added, saying: We lost on a technicality, that the Government should be allowed a little more time to make a decision. So there's everything to fight for, and much in the ruling that gives us reason to be positive and keep going.\\n\\nMr Keidan said: The Court of Appeal has made it clear the status quo cannot continue. The Government should now recognise the benefits of opening civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples.\\n\\nThe measure is fair, popular, good for families and children, and long overdue. They have everything to gain."}

She told the press she wants to spend more time with her young child and escape the whirlwind of political life, Le Figaro reports.\\n\\nAccording to various sources, there was some conflict between Ms. Maréchal-Le Pen and her aunt Marine Le Pen who was recently defeated by independent presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. Somewhat sympathetic to her grandfather Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marion had difficulty keeping a low profile when Jean-Marie was eventually kicked out of the party by Marine.\\n\\nMaréchal-Le Pen also came into conflict with FN vice-president Florian Philippot who she claimed had too much influence.\\n\\nIn public, Marion supported her aunt's candidacy for the French presidency. It is unclear how much of the perception of their personal conflict was true and how much was played up by French media to divide the two most popular politicians in the National Front.\\n\\nFor Marion, the base of the Front National is conservative, Catholic, and traditionalist, and she has opposed gay marriage and abortion to a much greater extent than her aunt. Marion had previously marched and spoke at rallies of the pro-traditional family group La Manif pour Tous (Protest for All) who slammed Macron as the anti-family candidate.\\n\\nMarion has also railed against feminists in the French National Assembly over abortion and the shutting down of pro-life websites. She then slammed left wing feminists for supporting the hijab calling it an Islamic submission tool.\\n\\nIt is unknown how long Marion will stay away from political life as she is currently ranked as one of the most influential MPs in the entire country. Marion is also the youngest member of the National Assembly ever elected, assuming the office at only 22 years old.\\n\\nNow aged just 27, Marion may still have a huge potential in future French politics.\\n\\nAfter conceding defeat on Sunday evening, Marine Le Pen announced her anti-mass migration populist movement would continue on. Others have said the Front National may also be rebranding away from its controversial past.\\n\\nThe new movement could even drop the 'Front National' name as the party looks to make huge gains in the legislative elections next month, even if it is missing one of its most prominent members.\\n\\nFollow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart.com"}
{"original": "During Friday's Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said President Trump repeatedly, Donald Trump creates a crisis, blames others for what's happening, and uses the ensuing chaos to demand a legislative solution that often harms even more people.\\n\\nTranscript (via FedNews) as Follows:\\n\\nAloha, this is Senator Mazie Hirono. I have the privilege of representing the people of Hawaii in the United States Senate. These are not normal times. Every day we face a fresh outrage from Donald Trump and his administration.\\n\\nOn issue after issue, Donald Trump creates a crisis, blames others for what's happening, and uses the ensuing chaos to demand a legislative solution that often harms even more people.\\n\\nThis is true on issue after issue, but let me focus on two that are deeply personal for me – immigration and health care.\\n\\nLast month, Donald Trump instituted his zero tolerance policy on people crossing the border, and the consequences have been severe. Children have been ripped away from their parents, placed into mass detention, deprived of adequate legal counsel, and isolated from everyone they've ever known.\\n\\nAfter millions of people rose up in sorrow and anger over what was happening, Donald Trump did what he always does. He blamed Democrats for a mess he created and proceeded to use these children as leverage to seek legislation that would enshrine the President's hatred and fear of immigrants into law.\\n\\nWhat's happening to these children and the President's antipathy toward immigrants speak to me personally. I came to this country when I was 7 years old with my mom and older brother. Mom was escaping an abusive marriage to start a new life for us. Mom worked at low paying jobs for long hours. My 9-year-old brother and I were latchkey kids. We waited at the bus stop every night for mom to come home from work.\\n\\nI've been thinking a lot about what it would have been like if my mother had been taken away from us. I know we would have been devastated. That's what the President is doing to these kids – some 2,400 who have been and are being traumatized by his actions. He apparently views them as collateral damage in furtherance of his policy of prosecuting every single one of their parents.\\n\\nIt's critically important that these children be reunited with their parents as soon as possible.\\n\\nRather than taking responsibility for unnecessarily traumatizing thousands of children, he – as usual – continues to blame others.\\n\\nOn health care, he follows a similar pattern. Over the past year, the Trump administration has led a concerted campaign to undermine our country's health care system and deprive millions of Americans access to quality, affordable health care.\\n\\nThey eliminated cost sharing reduction payments that help millions of Americans afford their care. They eliminated the health coverage requirement. These changes will increase premiums and make health care unaffordable for the people who need it most.\\n\\nAnd, in the latest outrage, earlier this month, the Trump administration refused to defend the Affordable Care Act in a Texas lawsuit to undo one of the law's key protections, arguing that people with pre-existing conditions – one in four in our country – should not be guaranteed health insurance. The President wants to take us back to a time when an insurance company could deny you coverage because you had diabetes, asthma, heart disease, cancer, or any other pre-existing condition.\\n\\nWhen I was diagnosed with kidney cancer last year, I was fortunate; I had health insurance that allowed me to focus on fighting my illness – not how I was going to pay for treatment. I now join the millions of people in our country with a pre-existing condition.\\n\\nOur stories do not matter to this President or this administration. But they matter to millions of us and to our families.\\n\\nDemocrats are calling on President Trump to use his executive authority to reunite the 2,400 separated children with their parents. We are calling on him to resolve many other problems his executive order created. And we are calling on his administration to stop its sabotage of our health care system and work with us on a bipartisan basis to protect and improve it.\\n\\nThese are not normal times, but we can't afford to be discouraged. Resisting this president and his administration requires each of us to step up, raise our voices, and fight back.\\n\\nIt's an honor to fight alongside you. Mahalo nui loa."}
{"original": "Gavin Newsom is to be sworn in as governor of California on Monday, marking the long-anticipated culmination of a long climb to the top of state politics.\\n\\nIt will be the first time since 1887 that California has had consecutive Democratic governors, according to the Associated Press — a fact that may seem unusual, given the default liberalism of California politics.\\n\\nThe state has experienced two political turning points. First was the presidential election of 1992, when California voted for Bill Clinton. It has chosen the Democrat ever since, thanks in part — ironically — to immigration reform signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. That law, also known as Simpson-Mazzoli, granted amnesty to illegal aliens –including many in California — but failed to secure the border, creating incentives for future illegal immigration.\\n\\nRepublican efforts in California and elsewhere to tackle the problem of illegal immigration led to growing alienation between Latino voters and the party that shared many of their social values.\\n\\nProposition 187 of 1994, which sought to deny non-emergency social services to illegal aliens in California, was the first of several important referendums to be passed by voters but reversed by the judiciary, with help from Democrat-run state governments that refused to defend them in court. (Another was Proposition 8 of 2008, which established traditional marriage in the state and was overturned in the courts.)\\n\\nThe next turning point was the financial crisis of 2007-8. Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had already moved to the left after losing reform referendums in 2005. He was unequal to the task of managing the fallout from the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed, leaving the state in fiscal crisis and undermining voters' confidence that Republicans offered a responsible alternative to Democratic profligacy.\\n\\nThe crisis also accelerated the departure of small business owners and homeowners from the state, decimating the GOP's voter base in California — an exodus that has only continued as Gov. Jerry Brown has raised taxes and imposed new regulations.\\n\\nNewsom will govern a state that is not only deeply divided between rich and poor, but in which the rich half is barely aware that the rest of the state is so far behind, or that California faces staggering long-term financial problems, thanks to the concentration of self-regarding media and culture industries in wealthy coastal enclaves.\\n\\nMany observers predict a tougher tenure for Newsom, partly because they predict a dire economic future for the country as a whole — a common theme for mainstream media pundits in recent weeks, driven partly by the gyrations of the stock market but also, undoubtedly, by a desire to see the Trump administration fail, in defiance of the data on job creation and economic growth.\\n\\nThe youthful, well-groomed governor is best known for championing the cause of gay marriage over a decade ago as mayor of San Francisco, but has tackled few major governing challenges since.\\n\\nNewsom is also a prisoner of his own campaign promises, including a platform promising universal health care and a recent conversion to the cause of high-speed rail.\\n\\nHe spent the weekend hosting a benefit concert for wildfire victims, featuring Pitbull; and attending a history museum with children.\\n\\nJoel B.

{"original": "The founder of the Ruth Institute, a pro-family nonprofit that teaches about the poisonous consequences of the Sexual Revolution, says disgraced Hollywood magnate Harvey Weinstein and Archbishop Theodore McCarrick have both lived by the sexual revolutionary creed.\\n\\nJennifer Roback Morse, Ph.D. writes at National Catholic Register that it is irrelevant that Weinstein prefers female sexual partners and McCarrick prefers male. What they have in common, she asserts, is they are both powerful men who believed they were entitled to use people sexually.\\n\\nIn May, Weinstein was arrested and charged with rape and sex crimes some eight months after his once-powerful career crashed as it also triggered sexual assault accusations across industries and the global #MeToo movement.\\n\\nMcCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, DC, was removed from ministry following allegations he sexually abused boys and engaged in sexual misconduct with seminarians.\\n\\nMorse contends the root cause of the sexual abuse problems of both men is the same:\\n\\nMen like Archbishop McCarrick and Weinstein think they are entitled to sex. And they both have (or used to have) enough power to take whatever they wanted. The fact that Archbishop McCarrick's preferred sex partners are male and Weinstein's are female should not distract us from this most basic point. Both men live by the Sexual Revolutionary Creed: Sex is a private recreational activity with no moral or social consequences. Everyone is entitled to the sex lives they want, with a minimum of inconvenience. Any sexual activity is morally acceptable, as long as the participants consent. Believing all this is called being sex positive.\\n\\nMorse says that, of course, the creed is a sham, and that both powerful and influential men have been able to manipulate the terms of 'consent' out of all recognition.\\n\\nThe sexual revolutionary ideology creates cover for the predator, especially the well-connected, powerful predator, she writes, adding that it is the ideology itself that caused the #MeToo movement to stall.\\n\\nMorse notes the starlets who criticize the exploitation of women, but who still endorse the ideology that objectification of women is acceptable. She observes how many actresses wore black dresses to the Golden Globe Awards to protest sexual abuse toward women, yet many of those dresses were very revealing.\\n\\nThese women want to keep their pills and their pornography and their view of themselves as progressive, she notes. They want to be 'sex positive' and never be caught in the predatory trap that the sexual revolutionary ideology makes possible.\\n\\nUrging Catholics not to make the same mistake, she says living by the true teachings of the Catholic faith in terms of sexuality and marriage – even when bishops and priests do not – is what is needed for lay people to effectively eradicate the poisonous consequences of the Sexual Revolution within our culture.\\n\\nMorse asserts bishops and priests who are discovered in sex abuse scandals or in covering up such abuse are enjoying worldly double-lives in which they have not only brought immediate harm to their victims, but are also likely failing to teach the Church's doctrines from the pulpit.\\n\\nTheir silence has been a contributing factor to the advance of the sexual revolutionary ideology throughout society, she writes. Their corruption undermines their brother priests who are living godly lives. And the scandal of the predatory priests casts a cloud of suspicion over innocent priests.\\n\\nBecause of the failure of these Church leaders to teach the faith and its doctrine on sexuality and marriage, Morse asserts the Church is no longer the guardian of traditional sexual morality. Instead, the Catholic Church has become a symbol of hypocrisy or worse.\\n\\nUrging Catholics to take matters into their own hands – even if bishops do nothing – Morse teaches the way to do this is to stop watering down Catholic teaching in their own lives in order to be politically correct:\\n\\nLet go of any part of the sexual revolution that you are holding on to. Maybe you agree that abortion is wrong, but you think contraception is OK. Maybe you are one of those parishioners who complain if the pastor preaches on pro-life topics. Maybe you are one of the parents in a Catholic high school who thinks the gay gym teacher shouldn't be fired just because she married her same-sex partner in a public ceremony.\\n\\nLet's go all in for the full truth, she urges."}

{"original": "ROME — Pope Francis has singled out neo-liberal capitalism and deregulation of markets as causes of human trafficking despite data that suggest the opposite is true.\\n\\nIn a video-message Monday to participants in the 7th World Day of Prayer, Reflection and Action Against Human Trafficking, the pope said that an economy without human trafficking is an economy with market rules that promote justice, not exclusive special interests.\\n\\nHuman trafficking finds fertile ground in the approach of neo-liberal capitalism, in the deregulation of markets aimed at maximizing without ethical limits, without social limits, without environmental limits, the pontiff declared.\\n\\nIf this logic is followed, there is only the calculation of advantages and disadvantages, Francis claimed. Choices are not made on the basis of ethical criteria, but by pandering to dominant interests, often cleverly obscured by a humanitarian or ecological veneer.\\n\\nWhile placing the blame for human trafficking on neo-liberal capitalism and market deregulation may square nicely with the pope's worldview, it runs counter to the facts.\\n\\nA 2017 analysis by U.S. News & World Report noted that the five countries with the worst record for human trafficking were all governed by authoritarian regimes with highly regulated markets and little respect for human rights. None of the worst offenders are free market economies.\\n\\nIn first place was Russia, which had established bilateral agreements with North Korea allowing for labor camps and slave-like conditions for workers within Russian borders. U.S. News reported that some 20,000 workers from North Korea are sent to Russia each year.\\n\\nChina was the second-worst offender because of its widespread use of human trafficking for state-sponsored forced labor as well as extensive sex trafficking to provide Chinese men with wives. Years of sex-selective abortions have resulted in an estimated 33 to 37 million more males living in China than females, an imbalance that is fueling sex trafficking from multiple nations into China for forced marriage or commercial sexual exploitation.\\n\\nIran was number three on the list, as the authoritarian Iranian government coerces foreigners, particularly Afghanis, into combat roles in Syria while small children work as street beggars under the threat of physical and sexual abuse. Instead of punishing traffickers, Iran punishes victims for unlawful acts such as adultery and prostitution, the article stated.\\n\\nThe former Soviet republic of Belarus, number 4 on the list, punishes various offenses — including criticizing the government — with forced and compulsory labor. The U.S. News report notes that some 7,000 people suffering from alcoholism or drug dependencies are held in medical labor centers with an obligation to work. The government of Belarus also requires the participation of factory workers, civil servants, and students in harvesting on state-owned farms or in street cleaning.\\n\\nIn fifth place is Venezuela, which came under the rule of authoritarian dictator Nicolas Maduro in 2013. Sex trafficking and child sex tourism are common, particularly among women lured from poorer regions to tourism hubs, the article states, and yet the government has conducted no investigations into human trafficking or offered any efforts to protect victims.\\n\\nThe U.S. State Department's most recent annual report on Human Trafficking (2020) points to mass migration as one of the primary causes of trafficking because of the huge economic interests behind people smuggling and the difficulty involved in properly regulating the influx of large numbers of people, many of whom fall through the cracks and wind up as victims of trafficking.\\n\\nAs just one example of this, during the most recent European migrant crisis (2014-2018), an estimated 80 percent of Nigerian women who migrated into Italy wound up working in prostitution, nearly always against their will.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

{"original": "Countless American believers in the Bible, myself included, were inspired tremendously on Monday when President Trump stood in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, and held up the Word of God for all to see.\\n\\nThe historic church was boarded up after rioters set fires there the day before, in an act which made even many on the Left incredulous.\\n\\nThe president's likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired. Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president's appearance outside the church shows he is more interested in power than in principle.\\n\\nSome religious leaders found it baffling and reprehensible that the St. John Paul II National Shrine would allow the president to visit with First Lady Melania Trump, who is Catholic.\\n\\nActually, the opposition to the President's actions is baffling. Every religious leader should be cheering the president's expression of faith and commitment to religious liberty.\\n\\nBefore the nation became engulfed in violence sparked in part by the death of George Floyd and in large measure by unrelated agendas of violent agitators, the president had planned to sign an executive order on international religious freedom at the John Paul II Center.\\n\\nThis was fitting, according to a statement on the Shrine's Twitter page, given John Paul II was a tireless advocate of religious liberty throughout his pontificate.\\n\\nPresident Trump, too, is committed to preserving religious liberty in our nation and in the world but that one unassailable fact is conveniently overlooked by his critics.\\n\\nTrump has been a tireless advocate for religious freedom during his presidency, beginning with an executive order close to my heart that he signed during a Rose Garden ceremony in May 2017, just over three months into his term. My colleague Alveda King, who leads our Civil Rights for the Unborn outreach, was there to represent Priests for Life.\\n\\nThat order, signed on the National Day of Prayer, loosened restrictions on the Johnson Amendment, which had been needlessly silencing clergy since 1954. President Trump's Department of Justice backed that up with a memo to the Internal Revenue Service in 2018, ordering agents not to enforce the Johnson Amendment.\\n\\nThe order also took the side of Priests for Life against the Obama mandate that every employer must provide abortifacient drugs and devices to their employees. Priests for Life was among dozens of petitioners who challenged that Obama mandate all the way up to the Supreme Court. In 2018, HHS finalized a rule that protected faith-based organizations from that mandate.\\n\\nAlso in 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the formation of a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in the HHS Office for Civil Rights. President Trump created the office to protect the conscience rights of health-care workers whose religious beliefs do not allow them to take part in abortion or assisted suicide.\\n\\nIn 2019, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs allowed Bibles on their premises once again. Also that year, the president lifted a ban on providing federal funds to faith-based black colleges and universities.\\n\\nThe president has also endorsed Bible literacy in public schools, defended the rights of students to pray, and defended faith-based adoption agencies that have been under attack for declining to place children in same-sex households.\\n\\nHe has looked at every place in our society where religious liberty is threatened, and taken steps to protect it. I have lost track of the number of special actions President Trump's Administration has taken to make the federal government and public life in general more hospitable to citizens and organizations of Faith.\\n\\nIt is absolutely refreshing and inspiring.\\n\\nHe continued those efforts this week.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, as his visit to a Catholic shrine was being decried in the media, President Trump signed an order that would prioritize religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nThis is a president committed to preserving and protecting the religious liberty every American is guaranteed under the First Amendment, and that everyone in the world is guaranteed by their human dignity.\\n\\nDid President Trump have the right to hold a Bible aloft in front of a church? You bet he did.\\n\\nThe Democrats, and their media mouthpieces, have gone too far in criticizing the president over what they called a stage-managed photo op. Yet this kind of criticism is more and more characteristic of their party and its leaders.\\n\\nIn 2015, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton infamously said that deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed (emphasis mine). These Democrats want to change people's religious beliefs, and they think they have to right to do that.\\n\\nIn his failed bid for the Democrat nomination for 2020, Beto O'Rourke said churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status. In other words, toe the non-Biblical party line or else!\\n\\nBiden says he's a Catholic, goes to Mass on Sunday, and believes that mothers should be able to have their children killed up until their due dates and that U.S. taxpayers should pay for it! During his lackluster campaign, Biden has said We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.\\n\\nOn this point he is absolutely right. And winning that battle demands keeping these morally misguided Democrats out of office.\\n\\nFather Frank Pavone is national director of Priests for Life."}
{"original": "Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden, who boasted during the CNN debate Sunday evening of his 100 percent rating from abortion political advocacy group NARAL, presents his Agenda for the Catholic Community at his campaign website.\\n\\nI'm a practicing Catholic, Biden states in his vision for Catholic Americans, and adds, I believe faith is a gift. And the first obligation we all have is, 'Love your God,' the second one is, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' … 'Treat people with dignity.' Everyone's entitled to dignity, that's a basic tenet in my household.\\n\\nThat dignity, however, does not extend to the unborn in Biden's vision for Catholics, though the Church makes clear its unchanging teaching in the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death.\\n\\nDuring his debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Biden answered his rival's challenge regarding his flip-flopping on the issue of support for the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision that is applied to congressional spending bills that prohibits taxpayer funds to be used for abortions.\\n\\n[B]y the way, everybody who has been to the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bits, Biden said, defending his prior votes for the Hyde Amendment, and then said:\\n\\nThe reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago. [N]umber two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when I'm elected president – if I'm elected president – a codification of Roe v Wade, amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And in fact, I've gotten 100% rating from NARAL as well.\\n\\nBiden's latest views appear to have been influenced by the abortion lobby, rather than the Catholic church.\\n\\nNARAL President Ilyse Hogue released the following statement touting her group's prowess in having pushed Biden to move further left on the issue of abortion and, consequently, further away from the Church's position:\\n\\nWe are proud that NARAL's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. We know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways. Both candidates need to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to Roe v. Wade and safeguarding abortion access. When Joe Biden fell short of that commitment, supporting the discriminatory Hyde Amendment, we pushed him along with our partners committed to reproductive justice. We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.\\n\\nApparently, even actress and left-wing activist Alyssa Milano had more sway with Biden than the Church. The Atlantic reported in June 2019:\\n\\nAlyssa Milano, the actress who's become a major online presence on issues of women's rights as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday to Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz, telling him the candidate needed to change. More calls came in, more tough conversations.\\n\\nIn July, Biden finally revealed his health plan would enshrine Roe v. Wade into the Constitution and force taxpayers to fund abortion.\\n\\nThe Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the progress of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers free preventive care including contraception by repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Biden was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina due to his ardent support for abortion on demand.\\n\\nRev. Robert E. Morey, the pastor of St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence, refused to give the Eucharist to Biden during Mass.\\n\\nSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden, Morey told the Florence Morning News. Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.\\n\\nBiden's shift radically leftward reflects that of his party.\\n\\nDemocratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Tom Perez said in 2017 there is no room in the Democrat Party for pro-life individuals.\\n\\nEvery Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, Perez said, as HuffPost reported. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state:\\n\\nIn an AxiosOnHBO interview with Jonathan Swan, Perez rebuked Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who commented on Perez's stance: It saddens me and weakens the democracy millions of Americans cherish when the party that once embraced Catholics now slams the door on us.\\n\\nWell, actually the majority of Catholics voted for Democrats in 2016, Perez shot back during the Axios interview when reminded of Dolan's comment, adding:\\n\\nYou know, Matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. And Matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, I fed you. When you were naked, I provided you with clothing. When you were an immigrant, I welcomed you. I think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from Donald Trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.\\n\\nAxios reported Perez said in a previous interview:\\n\\nI think the challenge that I see among a lot of people that go to Donald Trump rallies, and then they will go to church on Sunday, and I'm not … I don't know what faith they are worshipping. Donald Trump has done more to hurt the least of us among us than just about any president I can think of:\\n\\nA few days ago @BernieSanders declared that being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat.

Where's the outcry against this & socialism? https://t.co/T2XpoVgr9Y — Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) February 12, 2020\\n\\nIn fact, in August, the DNC unanimously passed a resolution that embraced religiously unaffiliated voters and belittled Americans of faith.\\n\\nThe resolution proclaimed that 70 percent of religiously unaffiliated Americans share the values of the Democrat Party.\\n\\nReligiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values, with 70% voting for Democrats in 2018, 80% supporting same-sex marriage, and 61% saying immigrants make American society stronger, the DNC stated, further defending secularists by asserting they have often been subjected to unfair bias and exclusion in American society, particularly in the areas of politics and policymaking where assumptions of religiosity have long predominated.\\n\\nThe Democrats continued by demeaning Americans of faith, referring to them as those most loudly claiming that morals, values, and patriotism must be defined by their religious views.\\n\\nReligious Americans, the DNC said, have used those religious views with misplaced claims of 'religious liberty,' to justify public policy that has threatened the civil rights and liberties of many Americans, including but not limited to the LGBT community, women, and others.\\n\\nBiden's vision for his Catholic agenda continues with the directive Build an economy where everyone comes along and we protect the 'least of these.'\\n\\nOnce again, the least of these does not include the vulnerable unborn.\\n\\nBiden's campaign, however, uses this section of the agenda to condemn Trump's tax cuts, which actually helped middle class Americans and to vow to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.\\n\\nThe former vice president's campaign also says the Catholic vision includes protecting the dignity of unions:\\n\\nThere used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It's time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they're worth. Joe will start by strengthening unions and helping workers bargain successfully for what they deserve. His plan will check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws. He will also encourage and incentivize unionization and collective bargaining.\\n\\nAs a Catholic, Biden also likely knows the Church teaches marriage is reserved solely for one man and one woman.\\n\\nCNN reported Monday that, as a senator, Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law, signed by former President Bill Clinton, that stated marriage is defined as between one man and one woman.\\n\\nDuring his debate with Sanders, however, Biden touted he supported same-sex marriage as early as 2012 – even before former President Barack Obama.\\n\\nI'm the first person to go on national television in any administration and say, 'I supported gay marriage,' Biden boasted.\\n\\nThe 2020 presidential candidate has made the radical shift leftward with the rest of his party.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Catholic League President Bill Donohue noted the Democrat Party's hostility toward Americans of faith.\\n\\nTo be specific, it is clear that none of the Democratic candidates wants to be tagged as religion-friendly, he stated.\\n\\nThere are some voices in the Democratic Party that freely admit how dangerously secular the Party has grown, he added. Their effort to bring sanity to their Party is commendable. But it is quite clear that they have failed."}
{"original": "The left is melting down about Phil Robertson's speech to the Western Conservative Summit over the weekend in Colorado.\\n\\nRobertson spoke up for complementary male-and-female marriage and so a writer at Mediaite called it Bible-based hatred. A writer at Salon called it hate speech. The Huffington Post called it a public freak-out session.\\n\\nThe left is especially incensed that Robertson believes that marriage is based on men and women rather than whatever is preferred by five judges on the Supreme Court. He cited 7,000 years of marital history as proof and also cited Scripture. This is a belief held by at least half of the adults in the United States and an overwhelming number of countries around the world.\\n\\nRobertson linked the 160,000 murders in America over the last 13 years to the Supreme Court's decisions — and the left assumed he is blaming those murders on gays. Here is how a writer at Salon put it:\\n\\nRobertson claimed that high death rate, which has actually decreased in recent years, is the fault of LGBT people. 'When you allow men to determine what's right and what's wrong, you get decisions like the five judges who said, 'I may not know we have 7,000 years of history of men marrying women, Robertson continued. 'A male and a female. For that reason, they'll leave their father and mother and cleave to one another and become one flesh. I know it's been that way for 7,000 years, but we know best for what's everybody.'\\n\\nIn fact, Robertson did not blame homosexuals for 160,000 murders in the U.S. Robertson was making the rather unremarkable point that chaos follows when the elite embraces the cultural and moral relativism that also justifies changing marriage rules to allow single-sex marriage. Rather than blaming gays, he is blaming a corrupt and unrooted legal and political culture.\\n\\nThe left seems to delight in misunderstanding Robertson. None more so than when Robertson supposedly used the calendar to show that Jesus was God.\\n\\nRobertson used the calendar to explain that something remarkable happened in the man Jesus, after all, our calendar is dated beginning with his life. He said, If your calendar is dated on of (sic) all the human beings who have ever walked on the earth, and your calendar is dedicated and predicated to just one of them, evidently something rather large went down back then.\\n\\nThe left has tried for years to silence Robertson. They hate the idea that one of their own network — A&E — has given him a platform. They were able to silence the Benham Brothers, who to this day refuse to back down on their beliefs about homosexuality and marriage. But the left has not been able to silence Robertson and his popular show Duck Dynasty. Even though Duck Dynasty is down in viewers, from a high of more than 11 million a few years ago to roughly 3 million now, the show is still the tenth highest rated on cable.\\n\\nRobertson still delights his audiences in his fearless defense of traditional beliefs, no matter how unpopular with the left-wing media.\\n\\nAt the Western Conservative Summit, he pulled his beard and explained it is the stuff of manhood and that the ladies present would never see him come in while they were putting on their makeup in the lady's room, a reference to the current battles over men in dresses using women's showers and locker rooms."}

Prager asked.\\n\\nWell, that's an interesting question, Apter replied. I think that that's a decision that individual musicians should make. I would go, yes, because I see that as a diplomatic, cultural mission, much the way the opening up of China took place under the Nixon administration with orchestral exchanges.\\n\\nPrager continued: And if a North Korean conductor shared the podium and conducted one of the pieces, along with the permanent conductor of the New York Philharmonic, you would still play?\\n\\nApter replied: I probably would, because this is an explicitly political mission in search of common understanding.\\n\\nPrayer answered: So one could infer from that that you deem playing under me more morally objectionable than playing under a North Korean conductor, in North Korea, the most tyrannical regime on earth.\\n\\nNo, I'd have to object to that. I think the situations are very different, Apter said, without further explanation.\\n\\nHe went onto claim that he had never called for a shutdown of Prager's concert with the Santa Monica Symphony, which Prager called not fully honest, since Apter had called for people not to attend, and fellow musicians not to play.\\n\\nApter said that he objected to Prager's guest conducting because he believed his presence was being used to entice political conservatives to donate to the symphony, whose money he did not want to earn. We want the right to opt out if we want to.\\n\\nHe also read statements that Prager had made that he considered offensive, such as describing leftism as a terminal cancer in the American bloodstream and soul. Apter said that rhetoric sent chills down his spine, and that it evoked calls for extermination.\\n\\nHe also objected to Prager's argument that acceptance of same-sex marriage was a sign of western civilization's decline.\\n\\nPrager responded: Did you read anything else that I wrote?

{"original": "It is hard to know how the thousands being prosecuted for thought crimes these days, from one end of Europe to the other, are likely to respond to this weekend's damning confession by Trevor Phillips.\\n\\nTwenty years after ordering a pivotal UK report which introduced the West to a newly-defined concept called 'Islamophobia,' the admission by the former head of the Commission for Racial Equality, that his report's contents had got almost everything wrong, is nothing short of seismic.\\n\\nPhillips's recent remarks were detailed in a feature article, for Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, prompted by the most comprehensive study ever conducted into the values of the UK's Islamic population.\\n\\nThe full results of the survey What British Muslims Really Think is set for broadcast on Wednesday, by Channel 4. The findings revealed by the polling giant ICM, so far, deal a knockout blow to the 'tiny minority of extremists' narrative dominating discussion of mass Muslim immigration for decades.\\n\\nICM's data outlines the unacknowledged creation of a nation within a nation, with its own geography, its own values and its own very separate future.\\n\\nResearch also highlights, a chasm opening up between Muslims and non-Muslims on such fundamentals as marriage, relations between men and women, schooling, freedom of expression and even the validity of violence in defence of religion.\\n\\nOver half of the UK's booming Muslim population, for example, would like to see homosexuality made illegal. Worse still, nearly a quarter of Muslims in the UK would prefer to live in fully Islamized enclaves solely governed by Sharia law. While one in three British Muslims support the right [sic] of a man to have more than one wife.\\n\\nPhillips's article even describes a conversation with Amra, a female Sharia court judge, detailing advice for the aspirant bigamist, which calls into question the on-going legal standing of such tribunals. At no point during their cosy chat does anyone mention that they are discussing the facilitation of a criminal offence made illegal in Britain in 1861.\\n\\nThe revelations in the Sunday Times also highlight the alarming contempt for white girls among Muslim males in Britain. The ICM survey provides a torrent of data that backs up the impression that this is a community whose idea of women's equality lies eons away from the mainstream, writes Phillips.\\n\\nYet given the estimated one million victims of the UK's Islamic child-sex slavery gangs, over the last twenty years, one feature of Phillips's article is more striking than any other.\\n\\nHis eagerness to park blame for the issues, thrown up by ICM's research, on the problem with Britain's white liberal elite instead of at his own front door.\\n\\nThe godfather of today's global 'Islamophobia' industry, Trevor Phillips, commissioned a landmark report as head of the little-known Runnymede Trust racial equality think-tank, in 1996. It was published the following year.\\n\\nIn the wake of the 2005 London bombings on 7/7, huge amounts of public money were funnelled into Muslim advocacy groups, first in the UK, aimed at tackling a form of bigotry largely invented eight years earlier. Due to a catalogue of failures since that time, some 400 ISIS jihadists now walk the streets of Britain.\\n\\nIslamophobia: A Challenge For Us All, fundamentally reclassified a word that had been little used in Europe before 1997 – other than by Iranian refugees, resident in France in the eighties, who first coined it to bully their females into wearing the veil.\\n\\nThough intended to document and prevent hate crimes, committed against Muslims, the Runnymede report rapidly transitioned into classifying 'Islamophobia' as a mental pathology – deemed to have eight separate characteristics.\\n\\nThese included seeing Islam as barbaric, irrational or sexist (Class 3). Considering Islam to be violent, aggressive, threatening or supportive of terrorism, were also guilty signs (Class 4). Even thinking of Islam as a political ideology (Class 5), or unlikely to be subject to moderation and reform (Class 1), were all part of the newly identified – and named – form of bigotry.\\n\\nInfluential global Muslim lobby-groups soon pounced on 'Islamophobia' as a means of pushing for the criminalisation of criticism of Islam, world-wide, impacting as far afield as the United States and at the United Nations.\\n\\nIn the decades that followed, 'Islamophobia' rapidly turned into a way of dismissing all legitimate concerns over the real-world social or criminal consequences of Islamic doctrine – or uncontrolled mass Muslim immigration – as rooted in prejudice.\\n\\nYet it was within the corridors of the European Union (EU) where a fixation with spurious 'Islamophobia' eventually reached its most absurd crescendo, even as every news cycle became dominated by terrorism caused by a hatred for non-Muslims instead.\\n\\nThe EU's first event dedicated to the protection of fundamental rights, scheduled for 1 October 2015, had originally concerned protecting free speech. Following last January's Charlie Hebdo massacre, the issue could scarcely be said to be more vital to Europe's cultural survival.\\n\\nYet the EU's Fundamental Rights Colloquium was soon reformatted, and became primarily focussed on combatting 'Islamophobia' and curtailing online free speech instead.\\n\\nThis should come as no surprise to seasoned EU watchers, given the Europe-wide criminalisation of certain forms of 'hate speech' in 2010, in line with the continents rapidly transitioning Islamic demography.\\n\\nSuch measures have resulted in the identical severity of sentences being faced by outspoken critics of mass Muslim immigration across Europe, since that date: Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, to Mogens Camre in Denmark, from Christine Tasin in France, to Lutz Bachmann in Germany.\\n\\nSince the nineties, ceaseless lobbying within media and government circles by the 'Islamophobia' industry has been hugely successful. Especially, by organisations that profit from pretending that rude social media posts constitute actual 'attacks' against Muslims.\\n\\nSuch efforts have largely ensured that those publicly critical of Islam do not merely have the inevitable possibility of murderous violence to contend with – they lose their jobs, their friends, and risk imprisonment too.\\n\\nTrevor Phillips's inability to see the root causes of Britain's Muslim integration crisis, in 2016, mirror the failures of the original Runnymede Trust report two decades earlier. It made no effort to delve into Islamic doctrine either.\\n\\nBemoaning the failures of assimilation in Blackburn, for example, whose 30 per cent Muslim population is barely mixed with white Britons, Phillips turns to Anjum Anwar for advice.\\n\\nHow I treat the stranger and family members is according to sharia, the Muslim woman tells Phillips, while dressed in a close-fitting headscarf. The Sunday Times article goes on to describe Anwar as someone who spends her time actively promoting integration.\\n\\nThat the likes of Trevor Phillips are still so wilfully ignorant, of those facets of sharia law, and the Quran, actively prohibit Muslims from emulating or even befriending non-Muslims (Q3:28), goes a long way to explaining Europe's integration crisis.\\n\\nFor critics of 'Islamophobia,' it is often felt to be a word created by fascists, and used by cowards, to manipulate morons. A quotation often misattributed to the late, great Christopher Hitchens.\\n\\nAs head of the UK's Commission for Racial Equality between 2003 and 2012, Mr Phillips famously had a bust of Lenin on his desk. He does himself a disservice with his recent contrition, and should own up to the distressing worldwide repercussions of his highly effective revolutionary zeal.\\n\\nGeorge Igler, a political analyst based in the City of London, is the Director of the Discourse Institute."}

{"original": "Since the launch of #MeToo, two innocent people connected to the movement have committed suicide — Anthony Bourdain and Jill Messick.\\n\\nIn February of 2018, 50-year-old Jill Messick, a one-time talent representative for #MeToo heroine Rose McGowan, took her own life.\\n\\nIn June of 2018, 61-year-old Anthony Bourdain — celebrity chef, world traveler, and boyfriend of #MeToo heroine Asia Argento, hanged himself in a Paris hotel.\\n\\nBoth untimely suicides occurred less than a year after the birth of #MeToo in October of 2017, a movement born through countless accusations against countless men in two left-wing institutions: Hollywood and the establishment media.\\n\\nHarvey Weinstein, of course, was the first, the smashed bottle that launched the USS #MeToo, and his two most famous and outspoken accusers are McGowan and Argento. Both have accused the disgraced mogul of rape, both have accused the entertainment industry at large as complicit.\\n\\nMcGowan, who was best known for co-starring in the decade-old series Charmed, has achieved worldwide fame as the fearless face of #MeToo. She has written a memoir, Brave, and her every social media utterance can make headlines and damage reputations. She also leads what she calls #RoseArmy, a million or so Twitter followers eager to defend their queen.\\n\\nArgento, who was best known in her native Rome as an actress and director, also became a household name through her #MeToo activism, which culminated in May when she earned rapturous applause at Cannes for a speech blistering the foo-foo film festival as a hunting ground for rapists.\\n\\nIn the wake of this upheaval, two people associated with McGowan and Argento took their own lives. We now know Messick and Bourdain spent years battling with the black pool of depression. This means we cannot know what drove them to end their own lives. Sometimes there is a trigger. Sometimes not.\\n\\nWhat we do know is the timeline of events just prior to both suicides, and those facts are worth laying out.\\n\\nIn October of 2017, McGowan spoke of Messick in glowing terms to the New York Times. While it was Messick who unwittingly set up the January 1997 meeting with Weinstein that would end in a rape accusation, McGowan told the Times that after she told Messick of the incident, She held me. She put her arms around me.\\n\\nThe New York Times also reported that even though she had only recently been promoted to a talent manager, the-not-yet-30 Messick immediately reported the Weinstein incident to her firm's partners and insisted they act. The two partners, Nick Wechsler and Keith Addis then met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messick's request and confronted him with Ms. McGowan's claim, the Times reports.\\n\\nAnd so, according to both the Times and McGowan, all the way back in 1997, Messick was on her side, her champion, did all she could, and although the matter was out of her hands after she reported the alleged assault to her superiors, McGowan ended up with a six-figure settlement from Weinstein.\\n\\nNearly a year after her role in reporting Weinstein, Messick went to work for Weinstein until 2003.\\n\\nOver time, though, McGowan's opinion of Messick seemed to change. The Federalist reports that through social media and Brave (released three months after the Times interview), McGowan publicly…\\n\\n…lashed out at Messick for arranging the meeting with Weinstein, for failing to support her, and for pressuring her to settle with him. For taking a job ten months after the incident at Weinstein's company, as Messick did. For being part of the problem.\\n\\nOn the same day Brave was released (January 30), Weinstein's lawyers released an email the accused serial rapist requested from Messick just before the scandal exploded on him in October.\\n\\nLooking back some 20 years, Messick spelled out her version of events:\\n\\nWhen [McGowan and I] met up the following day, she hesitantly told me of her own accord that during the meeting that night before she had gotten into a hot tub with Mr. Weinstein. She was very clear about the fact that getting into that hot tub was something that she did consensually and that in hindsight it was also something that she regretted having done.\\n\\nMcGowan flipped out over the report, and while she trained her anger on Weinstein, according to the Federalist, McGowan's #RoseArmy hunted down Messick:\\n\\nMembers of RoseArmy, intent on finding Messick, coordinated, in search of the right internet doors to bang on. Although Messick had tried to disguise her social media presence in an attempt to preserve some privacy, but she maintained a LinkedIn account, as a half-billion working people do. They found her there. They hounded her. They spewed ugly taunts and demanded on Twitter that she give back [her] woman card.\\n\\nA week later, Messick, who was herself a #MeToo supporter, took her own life.\\n\\nIn a public statement, Messick's family blamed the suicide on Weinstein, the media, Internet mobs, and McGowan's inaccurate accusations and insinuations:\\n\\nSeeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person's attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey's desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her. It broke Jill, who was just starting to get her life back on track. What makes Rose's inaccurate accusations and insinuations against Jill ironic was that she was the first person who stood up on Rose's behalf, and alerted her bosses to the horrific experience which Rose suffered. Twenty years ago, as a very junior person in a management company hierarchy, Jill exhibited her integrity in doing the right thing — she raised the red flag with the heads of her firm. In the face of inappropriate behavior, Jill handled the situation appropriately.\\n\\nJill Messick was the mother of two.\\n\\nAnthony Bourdain was the father of an 11-year-old girl, separated from his second wife, and not only dating Asia Argento, he was her public champion and defender. Backed by a popular social media presence and a reputation for telling it like is, heaven help anyone who saw Argento as anything other than a Weinstein victim and spotless #MeToo warrior.\\n\\nBy all accounts, including those social media accounts and his own travel show, Bourdain was very much in love with Argento. In September of 2017, Bourdain gushed to People magazine, She's a really accomplished director and writer along with being a longtime actress and a real sponge for culture, music, literature. So she's enormously helpful and inspiring.\\n\\nAfter her moment at Cannes, Bourdain described Argento's speech as an absolutely fearless off-script nuclear bomb.\\n\\nBourdain did say that marriage to Argento was not an option. After two failed marriages he feared it would be the death of everything with Argento. But he also said he wouldn't hate moving in with her.\\n\\nWhat's more, on top of championing her #MeToo activism, Bourdain also championed her career.\\n\\nIn a scathing indictment of Argento, Penthouse columnist Leah McSweeney writes that Bourdain's influence led to [Argento's] new role as a judge on the Italian version of X-Factor, and he hired her to direct an episode of Parts Unknown when the series filmed in Hong Kong.\\n\\nThis Argento-directed episode aired on June 3, and in the closing scene McSweeney says Bourdain looked into the camera and stated what many of his fans had already figured out when it came to his feelings for Argento: 'To fall in love with Asia is one thing. To fall in love in Asia is another. Both have happened to me.'\\n\\nTwo days after that segment aired, and just three days before Bourdain took his own life, a 42-year-old Argento was photographed kissing a 28-year-old French journalist.\\n\\nFrom here, McSweeney reports, everything between the two quickly and publicly spiraled:\\n\\nArgento fought to have the photographs pulled. Bourdain was mysteriously no longer following his girlfriend on Instagram. Argento then posted an Instagram story of herself in a Sid Vicious shirt that said Fuck Everyone, and captioned the image: You know who you are. Three hours later he killed himself. And she deleted the image off of her instagram story.\\n\\n(Quick aside: According to McSweeney, Argento's lawyers demanded she remove the article and apologize to Bourdain. Nothing in the posted letter, though, disputes any of McSweeney's facts).\\n\\nIt was at this point that Argento and McGowan teamed up.\\n\\nWriting on behalf of Argento, McGowan, in an open letter to Rolling Stone, defended Argento against those blaming her infidelity for Bourdain's suicide. And this is where the public learned for the first time Argento and Bourdain apparently had an open relationship.\\n\\nAnthony and Asia had a free relationship, McGowan wrote, they loved without borders of traditional relationships, and they established the parameters of their relationship early on.\\n\\nAsia is a free bird, and so was Anthony, McGowan explained, adding, Anthony's [suicide] was very much his choice. His decision, not hers. His depression won.\\n\\nSomething else we have just learned, something confirmed by both the New York Times and Argento, is that Bourdain knew Argento had settled an underage sexual assault claim against her for $380,000 in November of 2017, just one month after Argento helped launch the #MeToo movement.\\n\\nJimmy Bennett is a former child actor who has known Argento since he was seven, when they co-starred as mother and son in a 2004 movie directed by Argento. According to Bennett, back in 2014, when he was 17 and Argento was 37, she got him alone in a California hotel room (where the age of consent is 18), gave him alcohol, and then forced herself on him.\\n\\nBennett claims the assault was emotionally devastating because he had always seen Argento as a mother figure.\\n\\nAs far as Bourdain's involvement, according to the Times, everything was handled through his lawyer. According to a statement released this week by Argento, though, Bourdain was her white knight in the matter, the man who both urged her to settle and who paid the $380,0000 out of his own pocket.\\n\\nMany interpret Argento's statement as her way of blaming Bourdain for being too eager to settle, for getting her into this mess. Argento also denied having sex with Bennett, but photographs and text messages released by TMZ (and not yet denied by Argento) say different.\\n\\nRegardless, from here it is not hard to imagine the world of hurt Bourdain would currently be in were he still alive.\\n\\nNot only would he be accused of hypocrisy for attempting to cover up an alleged sexual assault of a minor at the height of the #MeToo movement, he also championed the alleged predator (Argento) as a #MeToo role model.\\n\\nThe following is not a small deal: Bourdain's popular show aired on the far-left CNN, a cable channel obsessed with bringing President Donald Trump down over payoffs to silence two adult women for alleged consensual affairs that happened over a decade ago; and here is one of CNN's biggest stars reportedly involved in a payoff to cover up the alleged assault of a minor…?\\n\\nThis was a ticking time bomb in the life of a man with a hard-earned reputation as an honorable straight-shooter.\\n\\nAnd then the woman he took this career-killing risk for was photographed screwing around in public with a guy half Bourdain's age. And even if there was an open relationship, these things are done discretely to save the woman from humiliation and the man from emasculation.\\n\\nArgento did not try to stop those photos from being published for no reason.\\n\\n#MeToo and two tragic suicides.\\n\\n**RELATED: Behind the Asia Argento Assault Scandal Is the Unbelievable JT LeRoy Scandal.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Klemm Joined the 500 marchers who met to demand equal rights and visibility for the LGBT community in the event organized by Respect, Romania's premier LGBT national lobby group.\\n\\nA proposed referendum would enshrine the traditional understanding of marriage as the union of one man and one woman in the national constitution.\\n\\nLast fall, Klemm explained in an interview with a Romanian news agency why he publicly pushes for gay marriage.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that it is a sensitive subject, Klemm claimed that the U.S. Supreme Court had resolved the legal problem over gay marriage, stating that it is unconstitutional and illegal to deny civil marriage to same-sex couples.\\n\\nTherefore, the U.S. should support gay marriage everywhere in the world, Klemm stated.\\n\\nKlemm's overt advocacy of gay marriage has met with backlash in the conservative country, and the ambassador has been criticized for abusing his position to meddle in the internal affairs of the nation. One of the most celebrated journalists in Romania, Ion Cristoiu, the founder of the country's most important daily newspaper, has publicly accused Klemm of being not the ambassador of the USA but of Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nThe journalist said that Klemm has used his influential position to promote attitudes against President Donald Trump in Romania despite the fact that most Romanians in USA are Trump supporters.\\n\\nI've never met a more talkative ambassador of a foreign power, Cristoiu wrote. Since he arrived in Bucharest, Hans Klemm has not closed his mouth. He speaks about everything, at any time and in any place. He has also violated diplomatic norms and commonsense rules by speaking about strictly internal issues of Romania.\\n\\nIn March 2015, President Barack Obama announced Klemm's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to Romania and in September of that year, Klemm assumed the duties of his new post.\\n\\nEven before the 2015 Supreme Court decision, however, President Obama wielded his international influence to promote LGBT rights and gay marriage worldwide, both through actions of the State Department and by his own direct diplomacy.\\n\\nIn December 2011, Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum instructing all federal agencies dealing with foreign affairs— from the State Department to the Department of Defense — to promote LGBT rights abroad.\\n\\nUnder my Administration, Obama said, agencies engaged abroad have already begun taking action to promote the fundamental human rights of LGBT persons everywhere.\\n\\nBy this memorandum I am directing all agencies engaged abroad to ensure that U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of LGBT persons, he stated, before enumerating a series of specific actions to be taken.\\n\\nIn an article in December 2015, the New York Times lamented that President Obama's full-court press for homosexual rights had sometimes backfired, resulting in increased hostility toward gays rather than greater acceptance.\\n\\nWhen the president visited Africa earlier that year, he made the LGBT agenda one of the centerpieces of his message, comparing discrimination of gays in Africa to the treatment of blacks in America prior to the civil rights movement.\\n\\nAs an African American in the United States I am painfully aware of what happens when people are treated differently under the law, the president said.\\n\\nThe Times article claimed that the U.S. government had invested more than $700 million into supporting the gay agenda globally and that more than half of that money had targeted sub-­Saharan Africa.\\n\\nImmediately after Obama's visit, a number of African leaders lashed out at the president for his western cultural imperialism, demanding that the president learn to respect Africa's values rather than imposing his own.\\n\\nIn the same way that we don't try to impose our culture on anyone, we also expect that people should respect our culture in return, said Theresa Okafor, a Nigerian activist.\\n\\nObama's alliance with the LGBT cause earned him more than a little opprobrium back home as well, with American black leaders furious that the president should compare the gay agenda to the civil rights movement.\\n\\nBlack leaders were irate when Obama compared the civil rights movement to the same-sex marriage platform on the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march, when black American citizens were beaten for demanding voting rights they were being denied.\\n\\nI marched with many people back in those days and I have reached out to some of my friends who marched with me, and all of them are shocked, Rev. William Owens of the Coalition of African American Pastors (CAAP) told Breitbart News.\\n\\nThey never thought they would see this day that gay rights would be equated with civil rights. Not one agreed with this comparison, he said.\\n\\nPresident Obama is a disgrace to the black community, Owens said. He is rewriting history. We didn't suffer and die for gay marriage. We marched for opportunity, equality, justice, freedom from oppression. We are the true heirs of the civil rights movement. We have a new movement to reclaim the 'real' civil rights movement.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Obama-era diplomats around the world are still marching to the orders given by their former commander-in-chief.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether President Trump will encourage officials from the State Department to continue to actively agitate for the LGBT agenda abroad, or whether he will instead encourage restraint and greater respect for national sovereignty, faith, and traditions.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "Before anyone starts accusing me of judging Just Mercy from a partisan political angle, let me point out two things: 1) I never judge movies based on politics, and 2) I happen to agree with the politics of Just Mercy.\\n\\nThose who dedicate their lives to challenging the justice system — who tirelessly fight to ensure that the State is not imprisoning or executing the innocent — are heroes in my book. While I'm in favor of capital punishment, I'm also in favor of an appeals system that makes damn sure there are no mistakes. You don't hear me running around wondering why we're not executing people faster. No, sir. I have zero faith in our government, especially the majority of mercenary losers who populate it. And if we're going to give the government the power to take away someone's rights, all of their personal freedom and sometimes their lives, that system needs to be relentlessly challenged.\\n\\nGod bless defense attorneys.\\n\\nGod bless appeals attorneys.\\n\\nGod bless the real-life hero of Just Mercy, Bryan Stevenson, who is doing the Lord's work.\\n\\nUnfortunately, none of that can change the fact that Just Mercy is a terrible movie.\\n\\nSet around 1990, Just Mercy is based on the true story of how Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) used his freshly-minted Harvard law degree to represent a group of death row inmates in Alabama, specifically Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), who really is innocent.\\n\\nTo begin with, as someone who has lived in a small town in the south since 1993, and who is also in an interracial marriage, I found the depiction of the south ludicrous. If it wasn't for the wider ties and lack of crew-cuts, you would think you were watching Mississippi Burning 2. Just a few years prior to O.J. Simpson's acquittal, we're supposed to believe black people are kept out of a courtroom so only the white people are allowed to sit? That white boys in pick-up trucks phone in bomb threats and drive by in slow-motion to glare at the noble black folk? That the sheriff and his men embrace the Rebel Flag and use the N-word in the presence of Harvard-trained defense attorneys?\\n\\nOkay, it's a true story, so maybe all that happened. But it's handled with such spoon-fed, heavy-handed pomposity, you can't help but roll your eyes, especially when a racist German Sheppard tries to attack a black woman.\\n\\nAnd then there's all the monologues. Man alive. There are no characters here. Just symbols. Stevenson has no emotional inner-life. He's just a savior. His sponsor, Eva Ansley (Brie Larson), has no emotional inner-life. She's just a good, liberal white lady. Jamie Foxx does what he can, and is by far the best thing here. But like everyone else, he speaks in monologues, in Oscar-bait speeches. After a while, you're watching a self-parody.\\n\\nExcept for the racist white people, everyone is so gosh-darned earnest and virtuous, including everyone on death row. No joke: according to Just Mercy, everyone on death row is noble and decent, and either completely innocent or noble and decent enough to admit their guilt. There's not a single death row inmate who acts like a real person, much less a criminal or murderer. They're all Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption: Clean prison cells. Pure minds. Filled with warmth, selfless humanity, humor, and bottomless wisdom.\\n\\nGimme a fucking break.\\n\\nThis isn't a movie-movie. This is a TV movie, an afterschool special, so simplistic and manipulative…\\n\\nIt also backfires on itself.\\n\\nObviously the movie opposes the death penalty — you know, even as it proves the system works. Hey, if the system works in racist Alabama, it must work everywhere.\\n\\nThe movie is also hypocritical. It closes by telling us a white person probably killed the girl McMillian's accused of killing. Probably. So to hammer its point home with the hammiest of hammy hands, Just Mercy hurls a murder accusation it's not sure of.\\n\\nFinally, what about the victims?\\n\\nWe're supposed to feel terrible for the man who admits to his crime (he suffers PTSD) but what about the girl he killed?\\n\\nIf you want to see a movie for grownups about the death penalty, see Dead Man Walking (1995), which was made by three of the most left-wing people ever: Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, and Sean Penn. Yes, the movie opposes the death penalty but it does so without shying away from the reality that almost all the people on death row are not only guilty as hell, but monsters who committed the most heinous crimes imaginable.\\n\\nUnlike Just Mercy, Dead Man Walking also has enough courage in its point of view, and enough human decency, to spend time with the victim's family, to allow them to have their say about their desperate need for closure and justice, to explain how they're torn apart by these endless (but necessary) appeals.\\n\\nDead Man Walking is a brilliant and unpretentious experience (and one of my all-time favorites); the antithesis of Just Mercy, which is simplistic, formulaic, patronizing, pompous, and horribly photographed to boot.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "Tuesday at his confirmation before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Neil Gorsuch responded to an accusation made by former Obama administration staffer Jennifer Sisk that he once told students women manipulate maternity leave.\\n\\nSisk, a graduate of the University of Colorado Law School, alleged Gorsuch made the comments in a legal ethics class. However, when confronted by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), Gorsuch promptly denied the allegation.\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nDURBIN: Let me ask you this specific one. It was 1993 and you were at Oxford, when you believe you first met this professor. Professor Finnis was tapped by the then-Colorado Solicitor General Timothy Tymkovich, to help defend a 1992 state constitutional amendment that broadly restricted the state from protecting gay, Lesbian and bisexual people from discrimination.\\n\\nDuring the course of the deposition which he gave in support of that effort, Finnis argued that antipathy toward LGBT people, specifically toward gay sex, was rooted not just in religious tradition, but Western law and society at large. He referred to homosexuality as bestiality in the course of this as well.\\n\\nWere you aware of that?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, I — I know he testified in the Romer case. I can't say sitting here I recall the specifics of his testimony or that he gave a deposition.\\n\\nDURBIN: I guess the reason I'm raising this is this is a man who apparently had an impact on your life, certainly your academic life. And I'm trying to figure out where we can parse his views from your views; what impact he had on you as a student; what impact he has on you today with his views. GORSUCH: Well, then I guess, Senator, I think the best evidence is what I've written. I've written over — gosh, written or joined over 6 million words as a federal appellate judge. I've written a couple of books. I've been a lawyer and a judge for 25 or 30 years. That's my record. And I guess I'd ask you respectfully to look at my credentials and my record. And some of the examples I've given you from my record about the capital habeas work, about access to justice. I've spoken about over-criminalization publicly.\\n\\nThose are — those are things I've done, Senator.\\n\\nDURBIN: And what about LGBT (inaudible) individuals?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Well, Senator, there are — what about them?\\n\\nDURBIN: Well, the point I made is…\\n\\nGORSUCH: They're people. And, you know…\\n\\nDURBIN: Of course. But what you said earlier was that you have a record of speaking out, standing up for those minorities who you believe are not being treated fairly. Can you point to statements or cases you've ruled on relative to that class?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, I try to treat each case, and each person, as a person, not a this kind of person, not a that kind of person — a person. Equal justice under law is a radical promise in the history of mankind.\\n\\nDURBIN: Does that refer to sexual orientation as well?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that single-sex marriage is protected by the Constitution.\\n\\nDURBIN: Judge, would you agree that if an employer were to ask female job applicants about their family plans, but not male applicants, that would be evidence of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, I'd agree with you it's highly inappropriate.\\n\\nDURBIN: You don't believe it's prohibited?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, it sounds like a potential hypothetical case. It might be a case or controversy I might have to decide, and I wouldn't want to pre-judge it sitting here at the confirmation table. I can tell you it would be inappropriate.\\n\\nDURBIN: Inappropriate. Do you believe that there are ever situations where the costs to an employer of maternity leave can justify an employer asking only female applicants and not male applicants about family plans?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, those are not my words and I would never have said them.\\n\\nDURBIN: I didn't say that. I asked you if you agree with the statement.\\n\\nGORSUCH: And I'm telling you I don't.\\n\\nDURBIN: Thank you.\\n\\nIn Wang vs. Kansas State, the case involved a cancer-stricken professor. You wrote an opinion that noted that EEOC guidance commands deference, quote, only to the extent its reasoning actually proves persuasive.\\n\\nEEOC's enforcement guidance on pregnancy discrimination provides as follows. Because Title Seven prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, employers should not make inquiries into whether an applicant or employee intends to become pregnant.\\n\\nThe EEOC will generally regard such an inquiry as evidence of pregnancy discrimination where the employer subsequently makes an unfavorable job decision affecting a pregnant worker. Do you find this instruction to be persuasive?\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, I — there's a lot of words there. And if you're asking me to parse them out and give you a legal opinion, then I — I fear that you may be — I — I'd respectfully say I'd have to study it in the course of a judicial case.\\n\\nDURBIN: Well, let me bring it right down to the operative words. Whether employee should or should not make inquiries into whether an applicant or employee intends to become pregnant.\\n\\nGORSUCH: Senator, I need to — it sounds like you're asking me about a case for a controversy. And I — with all respect, when we come to cases in controversies, a good judge will listen.\\n\\nSocrates said the first virtue of a good judge is to listen courteously and decide impartially.\\n\\nDURBIN: I think you know why I'm asking these questions.\\n\\nGORSUCH: No, this one I — I don't.\\n\\nDURBIN: The reason I'm asking is because about your views on pregnancy women in the work place is because two of your former students from legal ethics and professionalism class last spring wrote to this committee to say how troubled they were by your comments in an April 19th class.\\n\\nIt was a gender-targeted discussion regarding the hardship to employers of having female employees who may use maternity benefits. One of these students signed her name publicly to her letter, which is a pretty brave thing to do.\\n\\nThat student didn't just make this issue up after you were nominated. Last night, the University of Colorado Law School confirmed that she had voiced her concerns with administrators shortly after your April 19th class and also confirmed that the administrators told her they would raise this matter with you, though they never actually did so.\\n\\nWhen we receive information like this which raises questions about your views and conduct on important issues, I want to get to the bottom of it. I mentioned that to you yesterday in my opening statement that I would be bringing this up.\\n\\nSo, I just want to ask you to confirm, did you ask your students in class that day to raise their hands if they knew of a woman who had taken maternity benefits from a company and then left the company after having a baby?\\n\\nGORSUCH: No, Senator. And I'd be delighted to actually clear this up.\\n\\nDURBIN: Please.\\n\\nGORSUCH: Because the first I heard of this was the night before my confirmation hearing. I've been teaching legal ethics at the University of Colorado for seven or eight years. It's been a great honor and a pleasure.\\n\\nI teach from a standard text book that every professor — well, I don't know if every professor — a number of professors at CU and elsewhere use. It's an excellent textbook –Professors Lerman and Shrag.\\n\\nIn one of the chapters in the book confronts lawyers with some harsh realities that they're about to face when they enter the practice of law. As you know and I know, we have an unhappy and unhealthy profession in a lot of ways.\\n\\nLawyers commit suicide at rates far higher than the population. Alcoholism, divorce, depression are also at extremely high rates. Young lawyers also face the problem of having enormous debts when they leave law school.\\n\\nAs a — and that's a huge inhibition for them to be able to do public service like you and I are so privileged to be able to do. We talk about those things.\\n\\nThere is one problem in the book — and I'd be happy to share with you the book and the teacher's manual so that you can see for yourself, Senator — which asks a question. And it's directed to young women because sadly, this is a reality they sometimes face.\\n\\nThe problem is this. Suppose an older partner woman at the firm that you're interviewing at asks you if you intend to become pregnant soon. What are your choices as a young person?\\n\\nYou can say yes, tell the truth. Hypothetical is that it's true and not get the job and not be able to pay your debts.\\n\\nYou can lie, maybe get the job. You can say no.\\n\\nThat's a — that's a choice, too. It's a hard choice. Or you can push back in some way shape or form. And we talk about the pros and the cons in this acratic (ph) dialogue that they can think through for themselves how they might answer that very difficult question.\\n\\nAnd Senator, I do ask for a show of hands, not about the question you asked, but about the following question. And I ask it of everybody. How many of you have had questions like this asked of you in the employment environment, an inappropriate question about your family planning?\\n\\nAnd I am shocked every year, Senator, how many young women raise their hand. It's disturbing to me.\\n\\nI knew this stuff happened when my mom was a young practicing lawyer, graduating law school in the 1960s'. At age 20, she had to wait for a year to take the bar. I knew it happened with Justice O'Connor, couldn't get a job as a lawyer when she graduated Stanford Law School and had to work as a secretary. I am shocked it still happens every year that I get women, not men, raising their hand to that question. Thank you for the opportunity to clarify that Senator."}
{"original": "Us Magazine has published a report claiming Russian president Vladimir Putin is dating Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng in their new couple alert section, although the report also concedes that reports of the pair have been floating around for years, ever since their respective divorces in 2014 and 2013.\\n\\nAccording to the report, a Putin insider says the relationship between 63-year-old Putin and 47-year old Cheng has become serious.\\n\\nPutin ended a 30-year marriage to the mother of his two adult daughters, Lyudmila Putina, in 2014, after which he was romantically linked to Russian gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Kabaeva was rumored to have secretly borne Putin a love child at a Swiss hospital last year, a rumor the Kremlin dismissed as a journalistic hoax.\\n\\nDeng's rumored connection to Putin seems a bit tenuous, as Us admits she has yet to be spotted looking romantic with the Russian leader, although they have some very wealthy mutual friends. Deng divorced Murdoch after 14 years of marriage in 2013, supposedly because he grew suspicious she was having an affair with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\\n\\nJust about all of the many media reports buzzing about a Putin-Deng relationship trace back to Us Weekly – which, as noted above, admits it is an unsubstantiated rumor, although Vanity Fair says that rumor has apparently been traveling among a certain set for some time.\\n\\nVanity Fair is not a fan of this particular romance, saying it is a good thing there are no photos of them together, because that level of self-serving malevolence in one single frame would likely crumble the earth onto itself. It also describes the idea of the couple as almost too deliciously good and despicably evil to exist in reality.\\n\\nAs for why the long-rumored romance is suddenly big news, Vanity Fair speculates it might be Rupert Murdoch's recent marriage to Mick Jagger's old girlfriend, Jerry Hall.\\n\\nVF wishes Deng well, noting that everyone deserves love… even if it means settling for a former KGB spy accused of heinous crimes, who coincidentally might be the richest man in the world, with a net worth of over $200 billion."}
{"original": "Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign is over, and how lucky we are to be rid of that nasty piece of work.\\n\\nNever forget that the failed mayor of South Bend, Indiana, launched his failed presidential bid with hate, bigotry, and lies.\\n\\nAnd then, after his hate, bigotry, and lies earned him enough attention from a media that thrive on such things, the Mean Little Mayor morphed into one of the biggest presidential phonies ever.\\n\\nBut the hate came first…\\n\\nYou see, if you want to win attention from the fake news media, spewing hate at Christians is an easy and effective way to do it, which is exactly what this venomous little monster did.\\n\\nLet's return to last year, when the oh-so Christian Pete trashed Christians who didn't vote the way oh-so Christian Pete believed they should — you know, just like Jesus did…\\n\\nOf Christian Trump supporters, Mr. Alfred E. Neuman said in early April:\\n\\nIt's something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that's not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church where it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you're supposed to conduct yourself.\\n\\nThat same month, he questioned President Trump's faith:\\n\\nI'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith, but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God. I just don't understand how you can be as worshipful of your own self as he is and be prepared to humble yourself before God. I've never seen him humble himself before anyone.\\n\\nKeep in mind that all this piety is coming from a man who lives in open defiance of God with his husband — which is fine. I don't care how Mean Little Mayor Pete lives his life, and if he'd promise to lower taxes, kill terrorists, and deport illegals, I'd consider voting for him. But it's a bit much to lecture the rest of us about Real Christianity when you're living an openly homosexual life.\\n\\nNothing, though, reveals the true cancerous soul of Pete more than his taunting and bullying of Vice President Mike Pence.\\n\\nPete is such a vicious little liar, he picked a fight with Pence, even though Pence has never been anything but kind to Pete — even though Pence has been anything other than tolerant and decent to homosexuals.\\n\\nMy marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God. Speaking only for myself, I can tell you that if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: If you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\\n\\nEverything above is a lie. Pence has never commented on Buttigieg's or anyone else's lifestyle. But to win media love, this demagogic bully fabricated a straw man to smear a decent man as a bigot.\\n\\nAnd then, there's the blasphemy of claiming God is responsible for his openly gay lifestyle.\\n\\nGee, did Pete's Creator also make Pete a supporter of infanticide? Is that also God's fault? Did God make Pete a bully and a liar?\\n\\nAfter the bullying and lying wore off, Pete moved on to his record as America's Super Soldier.\\n\\nI don't have a problem standing up to somebody who was working on Celebrity Apprentice when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan, he said in May.\\n\\nOf NFL players kneeling, he told the Washington Post in July, I felt that I was watching Americans exercise a right that I had put my life on the line to defend. He added that he made 119 trips outside the wire, meaning off Bagram air base.\\n\\nBut as National Review's Kyle Smith (a Gulf War veteran) points out about those 119 trips, That's … not a thing. There are no such stats:\\n\\nSorties in aircraft are an official military statistic. Motor-vehicle trips are so routine no one would bother to keep track, any more than someone would log how many times Pete Buttigieg took a shower. No one cares. So Buttigieg himself created this phony statistic. Picture it: He made himself a little Hero's Log but all he had to put in it was routine trips. It's pathetic. It's hilarious. It's apple-polishing, résumé-buffing, box-checking, attention-seeking vaporware. Just like his whole career. … [Here's] why we are unimpressed with Pete Buttigieg's military career. Three things stand out about his brief sojourn in the Navy: One, he joined via direct commission. This, to most veterans, is a jaw-dropper. To say the least, this isn't the way it's usually done. Many of us recall the intensive pre-commission training (in my case, four years of ROTC in Connecticut and Advanced Camp with the 82nd Airborne in Fort Bragg) as the most trying intervals of our careers. Others spent four years at Annapolis or West Point. Buttigieg just skipped all of that. He passed a physical. He signed some papers. Voilà. To put this in terms a liberal might understand: Imagine you heard that someone got a direct diploma from Harvard but didn't actually have to do four years of papers and tests. You'd never forget it. You'd probably think of that person primarily as a short-cut specialist for the rest of your life.\\n\\nWhile I truly appreciate Buttigieg's service, I don't appreciate him swaggering around like the second coming of Audie Murphy when he didn't even earn a combat ribbon.\\n\\nAnd then, Buttigieg closed his campaign with the ludicrous and ridiculous phoniness of becoming the White Obama. You have to see this to believe it.\\n\\nTwo final things…\\n\\nButtigieg is not the first openly gay presidential candidate. That distinction goes to Fred Karger, who ran for president in 2012 as a … Republican.\\n\\nButtigieg is not a genius politician… He lost. He got wiped out. How many people win Iowa, almost win New Hampshire, and drop out two weeks later? No one. He choked. He's awful. He's ridiculously unappealing. He's mean. He's a phony. Good riddance.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here."}
{"original": "Paul Singer, through the Washington Free Beacon news outlet, appears to be the Republican behind what eventually became Fusion GPS's now-infamous dossier on President Donald Trump. It was hardly the first time the Wall Street billionaire bankrolled anti-populist causes. Here are five of Singer's worst globalist endeavors.\\n\\n1. Amnesty\\n\\nSinger has a long history of supporting amnesty for illegals and mass third-world immigration. Not only was he a key backer of the Republican establishment senators sponsoring the 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty bill, he joined with George Soros and the Ford Foundation to fund the National Immigration Forum open-borders non-profit. That group even tried to create a sham evangelical Christian front to push amnesty.\\n\\n2. Same-Sex Marriage\\n\\nHomosexual marriage went from a radical idea in all but the most leftist of circles to the nationwide law of the land in the space of 15 years. Few Republicans can claim as much responsibility for this social change as pro-gay marriage billionaire Paul Singer. He, for example, personally intervened to pressure the New York State legislature to approve the new definition of marriage.\\n\\nHis links to the leftist agenda, however, did not end with same-sex marriage. The so-called Human Rights Campaign, to which Singer continues to cut checks, led boycotts of the entire state of North Carolina when the elected representatives of that state saw fit to pass a law maintaining the separation of bathrooms on sex.\\n\\n3. Marco Rubio\\n\\nThe billionaire Singer was an essential factor in Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) being able to stay in the 2016 presidential campaign as long as he did. The two appear to have bonded over the 2013 amnesty push and Rubio and Singer remained loyal to each other thereafter.\\n\\nThis week, Rubio denied any role in the dossier's creation, telling CNN, As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn't and I'll tell you why: I was running for president. I was trying to win. If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I would've used it. I didn't have it.\\n\\nRubio has not replied to Breitbart New's request for comment since the revelations about Singer and the Free Beacon.\\n\\n4. Paul Ryan\\n\\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), who has overseen an abysmal first ten legislative months under a Republican president and GOP majorities in both houses. He even floated the idea of a new amnesty without any immigration concessions from the left in order to pass a budget. But he has found a consistent friend in Paul Singer.\\n\\nAccording to Open Secrets, Singer has consistently given Ryan the maximum personal donation. In addition, through his Elliot Management firm, Singer has been one of the top donors to Ryan's associated super PACs.\\n\\n5. Common Core\\n\\nLast but not least, Singer, in an alliance with Common Core evangelist Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was one of the major funders pushing what would represent the largest nationalization of the American K-12 education since the foundation of the Department of Education."}
{"original": "The Never Trump publication National Review is now attacking Franklin Graham for being … a bad Christian.\\n\\nYou have to read this piece of intellectually vacant drivel to believe it. Naturally, the author is the humorless David French, whose only real writerly skill is a super power that allows him to be perfectly satisfied with himself.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this remarkable ability almost always gets in the way of anything approaching rational thought and basic human decency. French is a nasty piece of work, the Frank Burns of the Internet, a sanctimonious tattletale and fool.\\n\\nTo begin with, his bitter attack on Graham makes no sense. It's a word salad of imperious gibberish designed only to appeal to the mindless mob that drives his sour tribe and Jake Tapper's TV bookers.\\n\\nYou see, French is enraged at Franklin Graham for reminding people that homosexuality is a sin.\\n\\nPresidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party, Graham tweeted on Wednesday. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever.\\n\\nIn a second tweet Graham added, Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.\\n\\nWhat I appreciate about Graham's statement, other than the fact that it's true, is that he is careful with his words. He is not condemning homosexuals as human beings. He is making a clear distinction between people and behavior. That's exactly right.\\n\\nNaturally, the intellectually dishonest French doesn't give Graham credit for this. But in his defense, French is probably too blinded by his own self-regard to see anything other than the bloodlust powering his Mighty Sword of Moral Justice.\\n\\nNo, what Mr. French is also furious over is that Graham has not condemned — you guessed it — the Orange Bad Man… and here's where things get dumb…\\n\\nYes, marriage is the union between a man and a woman, Mr. French helpfully explains, but Trump married a woman, then married his mistress, then married a third woman, then had an affair with a porn star while that third wife was pregnant with his child.\\n\\nAnd that's not even the dumbest part…\\n\\nWe should pray for presidents, critique them when they're wrong, praise them when they're right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can't ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness. In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency.\\n\\nAnd now you know what I meant by a word salad of imperious gibberish.\\n\\nIn a sane world, I wouldn't have to do this, but let me go ahead and explain the difference between Donald Trump and Mean Little Mayor Pete…\\n\\nAs far as we know, and as Graham himself has explained, Trump's infamous one night stands with a couple of blackmailing porn stars (the president denies any wrongdoing) occurred a dozen years ago.\\n\\nLet me repeat this somewhat important fact…\\n\\nA dozen years ago.\\n\\nWhat's more, Trump did not base his presidential campaign on championing his libertine past, on bragging about his adultery, on reveling in his sin. And from his glass house, Trump has never judged anyone else's Christianity, never sought to normalize his sinful behavior as Christian behavior, never blamed God for his sin.\\n\\nMean Little Mayor Pete, on the other hand, is guilty of all of that. So far, he has based his entire presidential campaign on the championing of his homosexuality, of his open defiance of God, of his sin; while at the same time he proclaims himself to be a purer-than-pure Christian, a much better Christian than any Christian who voted for Trump. Everyone's a bad Christian, except our Mean Little Mayor.\\n\\nListen, I take no pleasure in writing this about Buttigieg, or anyone. If he wasn't running around puffing himself up as the world's greatest Christian; if he wasn't condemning the Christianity of others based on an un-Christian purity test that demands we embrace his homosexuality; if he wasn't blaspheming by blaming God for his sin because God made me this way, I wouldn't say a word about the Mean Little Mayor's private life.\\n\\nAnd if the Mean Little Mayor was running on a platform of lower taxes, ending abortion, killing terrorists, building a wall, deporting illegal aliens, and never taking any foreign policy advice from David French's Merry Band of War-Happy Lunatics, he could be married to three men, a cactus, and a toaster oven and I'd still vote for him.\\n\\nMoreover, what Mean Little Mayor Pete is doing is even more sinful than parading his sin. He is literally hoping to mislead people into believing something that will put their immortal soul in danger, he is deliberately trying to deceive people of good faith into believing his open and defiant homosexuality is not a sin.\\n\\nI'm sorry to say this, but what Mean Little Mayor Pete is doing, purely to gain power, is scheming to lead the Faithful down the wrong path — which is a deliberate act of evil.\\n\\nFrench also sees hypocrisy in a 1998 op-ed Graham wrote that criticized then-Bill Clinton's Oval Office affair with Monica Lewinsky. But this is another wildly dishonest comparison between present-day adultery and something that happened … more than a decade ago. And to the rational, forgiving Christian mind, that is ALL the difference.\\n\\nBut in Mr. French's neurotic mind, a mind blinded by his own self-righteousness, a good evangelical is someone who publicly condemns people for behavior they claim to have put behind them — you know, just like Jesus would.\\n\\nListen, my beliefs don't perfectly align with Graham's. But when he says something like God put Trump in the Oval Office, I'm content to let it go, whereas Super Evangelical David French sees only a mercenary opportunity, an opening that allows him to abuse his faith as a transaction that might get him on TV or win a retweet from Chris Cuomo, a transaction that puffs him up with a sense of moral superiority.\\n\\nHonestly, does anyone want to live in Mr. French's vision of an idealized Christian world — one where we never let it go, where we condemn people over 12-year-old sins, condemn those for not condemning 12-year-old sins, and remain silent as a Mean Little Mayor uses his national platform to deliberately corrupt the Faith?\\n\\nFrench's vision of Christianity is dark, judgmental, unforgiving, mercenary, self-serving, and above all, cowardly — you know, just like Jesus intended.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "Irish Health Minister Simon Harris criticized a Catholic parish this week for publicizing on social media Church teaching against in vitro fertilization (IVF).\\n\\nThe Tullamore parish's post on Facebook, which has since been removed, underscored that IVF treatment is incompatible with the Catholic faith.\\n\\nThe process of IVF damages embryonic stem cells and thus life and is therefore completely, clearly and totally incompatible with our Catholic faith, the post read. For all believers in God, all life is sacred at all times.\\n\\nAs Catholics — we are unapologetically pro-life and are proud and are honoured to stand up for the voiceless and for the vulnerable unborn persons whom we are called to love, cherish and to bring closer to God, it read.\\n\\nThe message also asked for prayers for couples struggling to naturally conceive life and who are avoiding IVF treatment.\\n\\nAccording to official Catholic teaching, as summed up in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, IVF techniques are morally unacceptable because they dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act.\\n\\nThe act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, the Catechism continues, but one that entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person.\\n\\nMr. Harris said the parish's promulgation of Catholic teaching on the matter constituted inappropriate interference in people's personal decision-making.\\n\\nThe parish posted its message just days after Harris announced the allocation of two million euros to support people with fertility issues in accessing public service consultations.\\n\\nThe comments were, I am sure unintentionally, extremely hurtful to many families who are struggling with fertility issues, Harris said.\\n\\nI thought and certainly hoped we had moved to a point as a country that this sort of inappropriate interference in decisions that individuals and couples make about their own lives would be left to them, he added.\\n\\nMr. Harris also said that he found the Church's position on the matter inconceivable. I will never understand and I will never comprehend moral opposition to IVF, he said.\\n\\nAccording to David Quinn, the president of the Iona Institute for Religion and Society, a think tank and advocacy group that promotes marriage and religion in society, Harris's comments were illustrative of his renowned anti-Catholic animus.\\n\\nSimon Harris never misses an opportunity to bash the Church, Quinn posted on Facebook. Incredibly cheap politics.\\n\\nRegardless of the motivations behind Harris's criticism, it was sufficient to make the parish back down and delete its post, replacing it with a public apology. The parish said it was sorry for the great distress the comment had caused.\\n\\nMatters concerning fertility are sacred and sensitive, and all children are cherished and God-given, this is the essence of the Christmas message, the new message reads.\\n\\nThe parish understands the great suffering experienced by mothers and fathers who long for a child. At this time, we offer our pastoral and prayerful support to all parents and expectant parents, it states."}
{"original": "Chinese officials are considering implementing sex education classes in primary school, state media revealed on Thursday, to combat the restraint of Chinese traditional thoughts.\\n\\nThe state-run Global Times attributed the growing number of calls for a formalized sexual education curriculum in schools a result of an alleged staggering rise of sexual harassment cases related to minors, and reported that many health experts in regional Chinese bureaucracy and lawmakers at last week's two sessions, where the Communist Party drafts and approves laws, support the measures.\\n\\nOutside of sexual crime concerns, the call for an open and systematic sex education system in China comes as Beijing struggles to combat the nation's plummeting birth rate, which continued reaching near-record lows in the past five years despite the end of the communist one-child policy, which mandated all women who become pregnant a second time must kill their children, either through abortion or infanticide. China currently imposes a two-child policy on its majority Han ethnic group, but few families have taken the opportunity to increase their size.\\n\\nRecent proposals to help increase the birth rate include speed dating programs organized by the Communist Youth League, mandatory family building classes for couples applying for a marriage license, mandatory relationship and family classes in universities, government-funded egg-freezing; and shipping urban women to rural areas with a high percentage of single men. Chinese lawmakers also reportedly railed at the two sessions against the alleged feminization of Chinese men, defined in part as insufficient loyalty to the Communist Party.\\n\\nThe Global Times noted on Thursday that China already last laws in place mandating sex education in schools, but the sex education curriculum in China's compulsory education is still almost absent.\\n\\nDue to the restraint of Chinese traditional thoughts, parents tend to be ashamed of talking about sex in front of their children, a regional official in China's Ningxia province told the government newspaper. However, with the popularity of social media among minors, the content, including sexual violence and sexual abuse is presented in front of our children without supervision.\\n\\nChina's internet is heavily regulated; the Communist Party invests heavily in censoring content on social media outlets it finds problematic, particularly content that criticizes the regime. The Times did not indicate that officials discussed further censorship of sexual content online as a solution to the problem of unsupervised exposure of minors to the content.\\n\\nThe Global Times added a warning against formalism in sex education, which might be despised by children, without elaborating, and claimed the implementation of sex education in schools was highly popular on Chinese social media, where opinions the government disapproves of are immediately erased.\\n\\nElsewhere in its coverage of the two sessions, the Global Times noted that some lawmakers are seeking government policies to ban the feminization of male characters in films, TV dramas and other public media. The article, citing a member of one of the two sessions, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), defined masculinity as fervent belief in communism, or having a firm political stance. Zhang Shuhua, the CPPCC member, complained of too many feminized men appearing in popular culture.\\n\\nThe Chinese Communist Party has for years expressed particular concern with Asia's most popular cultural export, Korean pop music, or K-pop. K-pop boy groups often feature men wearing make-up and elaborately styling their hair. Their music is rarely aggressive and their public images are carefully protected, meaning few have visible romantic relationships. K-pop artists are, however, required to serve in the Korean military, resulting in paparazzi photos of them without their typically manicured outfits and engaging in combat training. Korean is technically at war with North Korea and its ally China, making these images unfavorable to Beijing for political reasons.\\n\\nChinese authorities removed Korean entertainers from most available programming in the country in 2016, including with unsophisticated measures like blurring the Korean nationals out of Chinese programs. The move failed to end the popularity of the genre and the currently most successful band in the industry, BTS, remains extremely beloved by Chinese youth. The Communist Party, through outlets like the Global Times, have attempted to smear BTS, largely on the back of statements by a band member thanking the United States military for its support during the Korean War, but the campaign has failed.\\n\\nZhang, the Chinese lawmaker, proposed limiting feminized images of men in entertainment available to Chinese people and formal education in masculinity in schools.\\n\\nAgain, the Global Times did not explicitly link this measure to China's shrinking birth rate, but Zhang told the outlet, this feminization reflects a sense of escape and the timidity of some young people who fear normal marriage and love, leading to abnormal values placed on love and marriage, and this will eventually cause a decline in the birth rate.\\n\\nChina welcomed 10 million newborns to the world in 2020, a 15-percent drop in the birth rate from 2019 and one of the lowest rates on record under communism. In contrast, the birth rate in 2016, the first year of the two-child policy, was 17.86 million babies. Chinese observers warned that the current rate is not stable and has declined to an alarming degree following the publication of the latest statistics.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

{"original": "The editorial staff of the left-wing National Catholic Reporter fussed and fumed that Catholic supporters of President Donald Trump have blood on their hands after the violent chaos that erupted at the U.S. Capitol Wednesday.\\n\\nThe editors wrote Thursday:\\n\\nClearly, the current resident of the White House who for months has repeatedly and deliberately lied about nonexistent election fraud, and who, even as Confederate-flag wielding thugs strolled throughout the Capitol, is guilty of inciting violence in his morning speech on the Ellipse. Later in the day, he would express love for what can only be described as domestic terrorists.\\n\\nMany Americans expressed shock as they watched the violent mob smash glass and scale the walls while members of Congress cowered under desks or rushed to secure bunkers, the Reporter editors continued. We were not surprised.\\n\\nThe left-wing group then named names:\\n\\nAnd, as for the Catholics who actually voted for Trump, the Reporter editors chastised them for caring about such things as Supreme Court justices, Catholic school choice funding so low-income children can escape failing public schools, and lower taxes so American businesses can thrive and provide more jobs, and families can provide a home, food, and education for their children without relying on the government.\\n\\nIt must stop, the editors raged on, demanding Catholics sever their relationship with what they call white Catholic nationalism.\\n\\nAnd a pro-life movement that embraces white nationalism is not a true pro-life movement, they pronounced. Period.\\n\\nCatholic League President Bill Donohue, however, saw it differently and asked Friday who is actually guilty of inciting riots?\\n\\nDonohue asserted:\\n\\nIn the wake of the storming of the Capitol, many are blaming President Trump for the violence. Of course, he never instructed anyone to engage in violence. Nevertheless, his critics argue that he stoked people's passions, which he did, and can therefore be held accountable. If this is the standard—inflammatory rhetoric—then Trump's critics are at best ethically compromised.\\n\\nDonohue then continued with many examples of left-wing inflammatory rhetoric, including:\\n\\nI need you to get out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors. I want you to talk to them whether they are independent or whether they are Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face. Presidential candidate Barack Obama, 2008\\n\\nWhen they go low, we kick 'em. That's what this new Democratic Party is about. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, 2018\\n\\nPlease, get up in the face of some congresspeople. Cory Booker, 2020\\n\\nPeople will do what they do. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commenting on violent protesters, 2020\\n\\nYou know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there is unrest in our lives, and unfortunately there is plenty to go around. Ayanna Pressley, 2020\\n\\nThey're [left-wing protesters] not gonna stop before Election Day in November and they're not gonna stop after Election Day. And that should be—everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't, they're not gonna let up and they should not. And we should not. Kamala Harris, 2020\\n\\nAnd please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful. CNN host Chris Cuomo, 2020\\n\\nLeft-wing commentators and activists (pretty much the same these days) have no moral authority to lecture the rest of us about violence committed by right-wing protesters, Donohue added. They nurtured a climate of violence over the past year by giving Antifa and Black Lives Matter their blessings.\\n\\nIn November, the Catholic League also condemned the Reporter for publishing an op-ed that called upon the U.S. Catholic bishops to suppress the cult of St. John Paul II.\\n\\nBreitbart News reported Donohue rebuked the actions of dissident Catholics intent on redirecting blame from disgraced sexual predator Theodore McCarrick to St. John Paul II.\\n\\nAs a bishop and then pope, John Paul II continuously challenged Marxist ideology and taught definitively about issues such as abortion, marriage between one man and one woman, and human sexuality – facts that are detested by left-wing individuals who still call themselves Catholic.\\n\\nFrom Breitbart News:\\n\\nIn its op-ed, the Reporter accuses John Paul II of calamitous, callous decision-making regarding former Cardinal McCarrick, insisting that he willfully put at risk children and young adults in the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and around the world while setting a deplorable example for bishops in ignoring the accounts of abuse victims.\\n\\nIn reading this editorial, one gets the sense that the true villain of the 'McCarrick Report' is not the predatory ex-cardinal, but rather Pope John Paul II, Donohue said, adding:\\n\\nIt is ironic as it is perverse, that the Reporter, which is quick to judge others for the clergy sexual abuse scandal, denies its own role in contributing to it. To be specific, its relentless attacks on the Church's teaching on sexuality enabled sick men to justify their homosexual assaults.\\n\\nIn July, the Reporter's executive editor also declared abortion supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to be the future of the Catholic Church.\\n\\nHeidi Schlumpf wrote she heard a stunning speech by Ocasio-Cortez while on the House floor and was struck by how often it referenced Catholic values.\\n\\nIn addition to support for abortion on demand, Ocasio-Cortez is also demanding that American taxpayers, regardless of whether they morally oppose the procedure, pay for the abortions of others through a repeal of the longstanding Hyde Amendment.\\n\\nAlso in July, the New York congresswoman denounced the presence of a statue in the U.S. Capitol honoring Saint Father Damien, who ministered to lepers and died of the dreaded disease. Ocasio-Cortez decided to share with her followers on Instagram that Father Damien is a remnant of white supremacist culture."}
{"original": "The ever-changing political demands of woke progressives have a hidden purpose — to help them jointly grab elite status by stigmatizing mainstream Americans, says Michael Lind, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\\n\\nWoke speech is simply a ruling-class dialect, which must be updated frequently to keep the lower orders from breaking the code and successfully imitating their betters, Lind wrote in the January 19 article for Tablet Magazine. The university-credentialed oligarchy changes the [entrance] codes and the passwords every six months or so … [to enforce a] strategy of social exclusion, he wrote.\\n\\nThe argument suggests that the progressive do not listen to the public's opposition to the predictable social and economic harms of their favored policies — such as girls who slice off their breasts, foreigners who die in the Hunger Games migration, and discarded Americans pushed toward opioid deaths.\\n\\nLind explained how progressives maintain their elite solidarity by excluding and demoting ordinary Americans and their children:\\n\\nMembership in the multiracial, post-ethnic national overclass depends chiefly on graduation with a diploma—preferably a graduate or professional degree—from an Ivy League school or a selective state university, which makes the Ivy League the new social register. But a diploma from the Ivy League or a top-ranked state university by itself is not sufficient for admission to the new national overclass. Like all ruling classes, the new American overclass uses cues like dialect, religion, and values to distinguish insiders from outsiders. Dialect. You may have been at the top of your class in Harvard business school, but if you pronounce thirty-third toidy-toid or have a Southern drawl, you might consider speech therapy. Religion. You may have edited the Yale Law Review, but if you tell interviewers that you recently accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior, or fondle a rosary during the interview, don't expect a job at a prestige firm. Values. This is the trickiest test, because the ruling class is constantly changing its shibboleths—in order to distinguish true members of the inner circle from vulgar impostors who are trying to break into the elite. A decade ago, as a member of the American overclass you could get away with saying, along with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I strongly support civil unions for gay men and lesbians. In 2020 you are expected to say, I strongly support trans rights. You will flunk the interview if you start going on about civil unions.\\n\\nLind is also a frequent critic of the federal government's inaction as giant corporations use their economic and technological power to grab and keep political power. On January 15, he wrote:\\n\\nToday Americans live under two constitutions: the political constitution and the corporate constitution. The political constitution is functioning reasonably well. The corporate constitution, by comparison, is a lawless realm of out-of-control tyranny. … Of graver concern in a democratic republic should be arbitrary powers exercised by [giant] companies in the real economy against dissident individuals or unpopular businesses or organizations. If businesses are banned from advertising their goods and services on electronic platforms and other forms of media; if authors of controversial books can be banned from online and physical book distributors; if political groups are banned from making electronic transactions, or having bank accounts; if individuals who hold the wrong opinions can be denied health insurance; if lenders deny credit cards to people who voted the wrong way in the last election or said something inflammatory on social media, then the United States is now a tyranny, even if the courts are open and elections are free. … The remedies for arbitrary corporate power in the new infrastructure industries, then, are simple and straightforward. Define online opinion and video platforms as regular publishers, subject to traditional publishing regulations that seek to deter dissemination of libels, profanity, obscenity, intellectual property theft, and so on. And define all the other big tech firms either as common carriers or public accommodations that are clothed in a public interest."}

{"original": "For a while, it seemed that the Jeff Bezos vs. David Pecker story was dying down. You remember all hullabaloo that from January: the messy stuff about divorces, and hacks, and you-know-what pics. But then the MSM developed a bad case of Michael Cohen on the brain, and the story faded.\\n\\nYet now the Bezos brouhaha is back, courtesy of The Washington Post, the newspaper owned by Bezos, and also thanks to The New York Times, which takes a slightly less kindly view of Bezos.\\n\\nAs we shall see, the Post has just put its reportorial knife deep into the chest of Michael Sanchez, the brother of Bezos' girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, whom Bezos and the Post seem to view as the bad guy, the one responsible for the embarrassing leaks to the National Enquirer.\\n\\nFor his part, Michael Sanchez says that he is innocent, mostly, and he has own take on recent events—and yet on February 26, he was flattened by 2,500 words of fresh Post reportage.\\n\\nThen on March 4, the Times jumped in with a piece headlined, How Jeff Bezos Went to Hollywood and Lost Control. The story wasn't that bad, and yet still, perhaps the Times is enjoying the spectacle of the owner of the rival liberal national newspaper paper suffering some. As the Times put it, Mr. Bezos is at the center of an honest-to-God melodrama, full of salacious revelations, family betrayals and international intrigue.\\n\\nHmm. Those words international intrigue certainly do fit Bezos. The Amazon honcho does, indeed, have a lot of power. And that gets Virgil thinking . . .\\n\\nYou've probably noticed it, too: Jeff Bezos looks a lot like Ernst Blofeld, the fictional villain in several of the early James Bond movies. (And to bring things more up to date, Blofeld also was the inspiration for Dr. Evil, as portrayed by Mike Myers in the Austin Powers films.)\\n\\nOf course, nobody is accusing Bezos and his global company, Amazon, of doing anything like what Blofeld and his international outfit, SPECTRE, were imagined to be up to.\\n\\nYet still, as the founder and chief executive of the world's second-most valuable corporation—who has also spent billions to develop his own private rocket company—Bezos is a movie-worthy figure, and he has had his recent moment of notoriety. Indeed, his response to that notorious moment has revealed the full extent of his planetary potency.\\n\\nThat moment started with the January 9 announcement that he and his wife were getting a divorce. Okay, so divorce itself isn't notorious anymore, but the very next day, the National Enquirer published some lurid details, complete with paparazzi photos, about Bezos' affair with Los Angeles TV personality Lauren Sanchez.\\n\\nSoon thereafter, no less than the president of the United States, Donald Trump, weighed in with a snarky tweet:\\n\\nSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2019\\n\\nTrump, of course, has long sniped at Bezos and the newspaper he bought in 2013, the Washington Post. Trump believes the Post is biased against him and his presidency and, furthermore, that Amazon has been getting a sweetheart deal on shipping rates from the U.S. Postal Service. Meanwhile, Trump is known to be close to David Pecker, the chief of American Media Inc. (AMI), publisher of the Enquirer.\\n\\nOn January 21, the Enquirer struck again, publishing racy text messages between Bezos and Sanchez. By now the rumor mill was going strong: not only about Bezos, his marriage, his company—and his judgment—but also about any possible Enquirer connection to Trump. Moreover, there were rumors that the government of Saudi Arabia might be involved because the Saudis and the Post have been in a feud since a Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul last October. And to complicate things further, the Saudis and the Trump family, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are known to be tight.\\n\\nThen, on February 7, Bezos posted his account of the Enquirer story, including the sensational allegation that the tabloid had tried to blackmail him over lewd personal photos that it had obtained.\\n\\nIndeed, not only did Bezos give his side of the story, but he also—using the authority of his well-known celebrity security consultant, Gavin de Becker—threw in four mentions of Trump and five mentions of Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSo while the story was often played for laughs—sample headline, Bezos Exposes Pecker—the underlying narrative could be vastly more serious.\\n\\nBezos' implication seems clear: Trump and the Saudis are somehow tied to the Enquirer's scoops. Indeed, as if there were any need to juice things up further, it was even suggested by others—although far from proven—that the Saudis had used Israeli spyware to hack Bezos.\\n\\nSo by now, we can see that we have the makings of a new James Bond-ish saga: The world's richest man, owner of one of the nation's most important newspapers–a man willing to play hardball with the largest metropolis in the U.S., New York City, over a new corporate location, which he will now put elsewhere–now finds himself stalked, and perhaps even hacked, by a prominent tabloid publication–which he reportedly considered buying, as a way of shutting down the story. In the meantime, even as multi-billion-dollar divorce proceedings begin, insinuations and accusations swirl around the president of the United States, as well as an exotically wealthy foreign government. And oh yes: All of this can be further connected, maybe, to the special counsel investigation of Robert Mueller, who seems to be casting a wide international net.\\n\\nIndeed, Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, who admittedly is becoming Shepard Smith-ian in his anti-Trump stance, says that the blowback from the Enquirer story could doom Trump. (For what it's worth, Napolitano's disdain for Trump now seems to extend far beyond legal issues; he disdains Trump for just about everything.)\\n\\nSo will Mueller, in fact, get involved in the Bezos-Pecker story? How 'bout the Trump-loathing Democrats who now control the House? To borrow the Enquirer's old slogan, Inquiring minds want to know.\\n\\nYet there's one additional element to this story that never entered into the Bond formula: The Main Stream Media has chosen to lionize Blofeld—oops, I mean Bezos.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the Post has always been in the bag for its owner—typical headline: Jeff Bezos stands his ground. (And all the others are just as puffy.) Yet other media outlets, too, are giving Bezos the hero treatment. Here's CNN's Brian Stelter:\\n\\nHis security chief's probe and the Enquirer's panicked reaction enabled Bezos, through a blog post, to reframe the story—making him out to be a journalistic hero rather than an embarrassed tech exec.\\n\\nIndeed, Kelly McBride of the Poynter Center, a journalism think tank, said of Bezos, I think he changed the first line of his obituary from Silicon Valley billionaire to First Amendment defender.\\n\\nYes, much or most of this exaltation of Bezos is due to his potential role, journalists hope, as the man who can help bring down Trump.\\n\\nYet there's also the undeniable magnetism of Bezos' money and power. That was the point of a February 8 column in the Seattle Times headlined, How Amazon gets whatever it wants. In the words of columnist Danny Westneat:\\n\\nIt does say something about American culture and politics today that the multibillionaire wannabe playboy with the penis pic peccadillo is the good guy in the story.\\n\\nContinuing, Westneat marveled at that February 7 blog post of Bezos, the one headlined, No thank you, Mr. Pecker, in which Bezos recorded that Pecker and AMI had made him an an offer I couldn't refuse—that being a reference to another famous movie villain, the Corleone crime family:\\n\\nBezos was channeling The Godfather, in which an offer you can't refuse means you wake up with a butchered horse head in your bed. That Bezos mocked this and trumped it, even while acknowledging that others might be forced to knuckle under, was a raw demonstration of the rarefied leverage and power Amazon enjoys at the tippy top of our society.\\n\\nAs for the tippy top of our society, it seems that Bezos, operating from his commanding vantage point, can make things happen—even inside the federal government's executive branch, which his arch-enemy, Trump, presumably leads.\\n\\nThe Amazon man's clout became even more manifest when we saw this headline from Bloomberg on February 8: Bezos's Story Spurs U.S. Prosecutors' Scrutiny of AMI. So we can see: It's as if Bezos' allegation is now guiding the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\\n\\nAnd now comes that big new Washington Post story, the one painting Michael Sanchez as a schemer and a conniver, and perhaps also a bit crazy. The Post quotes Sanchez, who seemed, bizarrely enough, to be happy to share with the Bezos-owned publication:\\n\\nSince January 7th, I've been accused by 'anonymous' sources and leaky 'Amazon investigators' of just about everything, including involvement in an international conspiracy theory involving President Trump, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and conservative operatives trying to 'take down' Jeff Bezos.\\n\\nYes, it appears that Team Bezos—a team that includes the Post—have decided that Michael Sanchez is the leaker; in other words, Bezos and his people blame Michael, not Lauren, for the original leaks. Actually, many reports hold that Lauren was involved, too, if only through carelessness; it's been reported that she showed some embarrassing material to her friends, and as they say, loose lips sink, well, you know.\\n\\nAnd yet for whatever reason—true love? larger game?—the Bezosians have chosen to keep the focus on Michael, to whom Lauren reportedly no longer speaks.\\n\\nAfter all, it would certainly elevate Bezos if he could turn his peccadillo into a major case against the Vast Trump Conspiracy. That is, liberals everywhere would love it, and soon enough if the Bezos People play it right, over time, it might seem as if the whole mess was Trump's doing, thus easing the stain on Bezos.\\n\\nOf course, the focus on Michael doesn't mean that the Bezosians aren't still going after Pecker, Trump, and whoever else. After all, it would certainly elevate Bezos if he could turn his peccadillo into a major case against the Vast Trump Conspiracy. That is, liberals everywhere would love it, and soon enough if the Bezos People play it right, over time, it might seem as if the whole mess was Trump's doing, thus easing the stain on Bezos.\\n\\nSo will Michael Sanchez be able to tell his side of the story? He has his own explanations and theories, which seem to focus on, for example, the supposedly nefarious role of de Becker, Bezos' security adviser.\\n\\nSure, Michael Sanchez can talk all he wants, but it seems likely that the MSM will treat him harshly, now that Bezos and the Post have helped to further stamp him as an unlovable Trump lover.\\n\\nIt's impossible to know where all these allegations and investigations will lead—other than, of course, to some great spy thrillers to come, with or without James Bond.\\n\\nThe truth, of course, is that Amazon has always been in the middle of the high-stakes digital economy, and none of that seems as innocent as it once did. For instance, Amazon is now the third-largest digital advertising platform in America, behind only Google and Facebook—and we know about them.\\n\\nMoreover, Amazon is a big player, too, in cloud computing, including for the Pentagon; in fact, Bezos' company is currently embroiled in a $10 billion legal battle with another mysterious corporate giant, Oracle, complete with flying allegations of improper influencing.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget Amazon Alexa, which counts as a kind of in-house spy machine; that's a piece of work that Bond author Ian Fleming never thought of, perhaps because his fellow Brit, George Orwell, already had. Alexa has been accused of many things, and, also, indisputably, it has a creepy laugh that goes off at weird times.\\n\\nIn addition, of course, there's the more familiar stuff about Amazon as a not-so-good corporate citizen; you know, nasty revelations about not paying taxes, overworking employees, denying them bathroom breaks–and firing them over too many, even for the medically needy-dipping into their tips, and generally contributing to the trend of the rich getting richer–and ever more arrogant.\\n\\nNo doubt Amazon is paying plenty of lawyers to keep everything it does deemed as legal, and yet it's still the case, in the icy words of Breitbart News' Charlie Nash, Amazon Helped Create the Invasion of Privacy Jeff Bezos Now Protests. Yet all that aside, as far as the establishment media is concerned, Bezos, because he's anti-Trump, can do no wrong.\\n\\nSurely, flying high on a private jet to somewhere, Bezos is having a good laugh about that. You know, a good Blofeldian laugh."}

{"original": "Why wasn't the British government better prepared for Brexit?\\n\\nThis is the question being asked right now by all the disgruntled Remainers who can't quite get over the fact that they didn't win.\\n\\nAnd my answer is: are you deluded, mentally ill, a bunch of bitter, vexatious, reality-denying tossers or what?\\n\\nWhich is to say that the answer is so bleeding obvious I find it an insult that you should feign to ask.\\n\\nJust cast your mind back to that distant and half-forgotten era all of five days ago when David Cameron still appeared to be a vaguely credible Prime Minister and Jean-Claude Juncker was so confident of a Remain victory that already he was boasting about how extravagantly the EU planned to shit all over us once we'd handed back the prison warders the keys.\\n\\nRemember? Good. Then what you'll also recall – now that it has all come flooding back to you – is that at the time the prospect of Brexit was literally unthinkable.\\n\\nIt was, I suggested, about as likely as me going to a bar and picking up a supermodel; then taking her home; then discovering that, no, she wasn't in fact a ladyboy or Bruce Jenner or anything like that, but she was a really hot chick who actually wanted rampant sex. With me.\\n\\nWhat made it unthinkable was that all the experts had lined up to tell us it was. First came President Obama warning us that we'd be banished like naughty boys to the back of something called the queue; then came all the other bigwigs from the IMF's Christine Lagarde and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, all variously confirming with the expertise and authority of their office that no actually it would be worse than that: markets would crash, property prices would plummet, businesses would hurry to relocate, the pound would become as worthless as the Zimbabwean dollar, men would say openly that Christ and his saints slept etc. Oh, and also, of course, World War III would break out.\\n\\nThat last contribution came from David Cameron, whom you probably won't remember now, but he's the Prime Minister whose main career achievement – indeed possibly whose only career achievement – was to change Britain's laws on gay marriage.\\n\\nLook, I like gays as much as the next red-blooded heterosexual Dad. Some of my best friends are gay, one of them, unfortunately, being Milo. Plus, I was an enthusiastic instigator of homosexual acts at my prep school – I virtually invented it – so I know what it's all about. I like gay clubs, gay music, gay culture. At Glastonbury just now, I queued up to join the Meat Market gay club where a handsome youth in drag at the entrance patted me down and affectionately squeezed my testicles while my wife looked on. In fact, if I didn't prefer girls I would DEFINITELY be gay myself.\\n\\nAll that said, I think Gay Marriagewas an utterly silly thing for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to be wasting parliamentary time on – especially when it proved so divisive to the party Cameron professed to be so keen on uniting.\\n\\nIn today's Mail the ever-shrewd Dominic Lawson argues – and I think he's right – that it was partly the Gay Marriage thing that we have to thank for the EU referendum. The division it caused within the Conservative party meant that Cameron needed a sop to please those on the traditionalist wing of his party who might otherwise defect to Nigel Farage's UKIP. That was when he promised the Referendum…\\n\\nBut I don't think we should be remotely grateful to Cameron for this unintended consequence. Rather I think we should be absolutely bloody livid at the mess he has left his country in as he prepares to bow out as Prime Minister.\\n\\nYes I know I was nice about him immediately after his resignation speech. But that was three days ago when I was still in shock over the Brexit result. Now I've had time for a bit more reflection, I can see his disgraceful, petulant, arrogant behaviour for what it is.\\n\\nCameron's unforgivable betrayal of his responsibilities was to take the side of the democratically unaccountable Brussels elite against the British people.\\n\\nHe didn't need to do this – and when he came back from his renegotiation attempts clutching nothing but a bag of beans, he could so easily at that point have said: Looks like the EU just isn't interested in negotiating. Maybe invoking Article 50 will concentrate their minds.\\n\\nInstead, he chose to double down, and support Remain more wholeheartedly than ever. In the absence of evidence that the EU was good for Britain – which clearly he was incapable of producing – he instead resorted to the dire, mendacious bully tactics mentioned above. Not only that, but he cynically hijacked the entire apparatus of the Civil Service – with the full support of the sinister mandarin Sir Jeremy Heywood. – to try to crush the brave minority of Leave MPs such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson in their tracks.\\n\\nThis is what is so dishonest about the Remainers' question: Why doesn't the government have a plan?\\n\\nBecause – obvs – the government, taking its cue directly from the top, made damn sure there wasn't a plan.\\n\\nAs for the supplementary question – Well why don't Gove and Boris and co have a clearer plan? – that's pretty disingenuous too because again the answer's obvious:\\n\\nBecause, damn it, they were fighting for the near-impossible on a wing and prayer. Unlike Remain, they didn't have the full resources of the government, the European Union, the big banks, the corporations, the trade unions and the BBC behind them. Indeed, David Cameron and the Civil Service made sure they were treated like pariahs, even to the point of denying them parliamentary briefings.\\n\\nAttacking Boris and Team Leave for lacking a credible plan is a bit like going up to the Beatles in their Hamburg club days and demanding to know why they haven't yet sketched out Sgt. Pepper.\\n\\nBack to David Cameron. He was the man who made this mess – not by instigating the referendum (a good thing!) but by so arranging it that if he lost then the winning side would suffer.\\n\\nThis may be good dirty politics but it is very, very poor statesmanship.\\n\\nCan you imagine Margaret Thatcher doing such a thing – shafting her country in order to vent her petty pique over a rival? Of course you can't. But that's exactly what Cameron has done to his enemies in Leave.\\n\\nHe won't forgive his former advisor Steve Hilton for pointing out how badly Cameron blew his opportunity to change British politics for the better.\\n\\nHe won't forgive Michael Gove – whom he considers his made man – for betraying him by putting ideological principle before loyalty.\\n\\nHe certainly won't forgive Boris Johnson whom he cordially despises.\\n\\nWhat Cameron will be hoping now is that his personal referendum disaster may turn into a Pyrrhic victory for his enemies. He'll want Boris Johnson to lose the fight to become Prime Minister; he'll want a Remain candidate to win instead – someone like Teresa May – and perhaps, ideally, sabotage the EU negotiations so that we end up with some sort of grubby compromise whereby we might as well have Remained in the EU for all the difference it makes. He'll want, in other words, what the majority of British people demonstrably don't want. Vengeance before country.\\n\\nI was never much of a fan of Cameron while he was Prime Minister. His capacity to disappoint was almost limitless.\\n\\nHis final act – resigning in a fluster in order to poison the wells and salt the fields for the side that democratically defeated him – is, I fear, entirely typical of the man.\\n\\nShame."}
{"original": "During Wednesday's episode of FNC's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson argued President Joe Biden's pleas for unity during his inauguration speech should be viewed with a degree of skepticism because the new president was not referring to every American.\\n\\nCarlson said in the name of defeating white supremacy, the new Biden administration was sending a signal it intends to use the power of the federal government against political opponents applying a broad definition of white supremacy.\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nCARLSON: Happy Inauguration Day. It's a big moment for the country. The changing of the guard, a peaceful transfer of power, another reassuring display of the awesome pageantry of constitutional government.\\n\\nThere were solemn speeches today; sworn oaths, belted anthems, all echoing against the backdrop of 26,000 smartly attired federal troops who are guarding our capital city from unseen threats. There's quite a display. It was all a lot to take, really.\\n\\nSo like many of you, we flipped on the tube to see what it meant. Here's what we learned.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden respects government. He respects people who disagree with him. He listens to them.\\n\\nVAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think that Joe Biden is going to train us to see the world differently.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He plans to usher in a new era of hope, and the action he is promising the minute he takes office.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've gone from indecency to decency.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He filled that empathy void.\\n\\nJONES: There was not one part of that that wasn't just medicine in the wound.\\n\\nDAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Those lights that are — that are just shooting out from the Lincoln Memorial along the reflecting pool, I look — it's like almost extensions of Joe Biden's arms embracing America. It was a moment where the new President came to town.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So to recap, Joe Biden respects people's differences, but at the same time, he is going to train us to be very different from the way we are. He will bring hope and decency. He will fill the yawning void where our empathy should be. He is medicine.\\n\\nJoe Biden's arms lean and hard from decades of empathetic labor on our behalf will encircle us like lights from the Lincoln Memorial. And at that point, well, God knows, anything is possible.\\n\\nIf there's a thin bead of sweat forming in your upper lip, as you think about all of this, that's okay. Don't feel shame. Shame isn't necessary now. Joe Biden is here.\\n\\nAnd not just Joe Biden, Jill Biden, too. Mrs. Biden, Dr. Biden. — together, the two of them, MSNBC informed us will redeem this nation through their love. Behold.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What a story though. What a great love story between Jill Biden and Joe Biden. It's just a different kind of marriage.\\n\\nThis is a love match, like the Obamas were, so I think that'll be healing for the country, too.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Biden's marriage is healing for all of us, for the country. The Biden's love is America's love. Jill and Joe are the mother and father of this nation. From their loins, we are born and yet reborn. May their names emerge from our lips in praise forever, and so on. That was cable news today.\\n\\nThe funny thing is, and there are many funny things going on right now, every person with a microphone in every TV studio in America today knew the fuller truth when they said things like the ones you just heard. They knew, for example, for certain that Joe Biden isn't well. Everyone in Washington knows that, but no one said it out loud, not a word. They withheld that news from you as they have for months, so much for speaking truth to power.\\n\\nOn the other hand, what did you expect? You've watched the lying for years now. You know what it is. You figured out how it works.\\n\\nSo it dawned on us today that maybe we ought to stop playing all these stupid media clips every night. It's like watching the town drunk throw up on himself over and over again. Obviously, it's repulsive and shocking. It's hard to turn away. But can you really be surprised by it?\\n\\nThrowing up on themselves is what town drunks do. If you keep watching them as they do it, maybe after a while, you are part of the problem. Maybe so. In any case, we flipped off CNN and decided to check out Joe Biden's speech for ourselves. And it was interesting, actually, both for what it said and for what it didn't say.\\n\\nOne particular part of the speech stuck out especially. Now, we didn't support Joe Biden for President, you probably guessed that. But if we're being totally honest here, and we want to be honest, we have to say it was very hard to disagree with this specific part of the address. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On this January day, my whole soul is in this, bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I asked every American to join me in this cause.\\n\\nWith unity, we can do great things, important things.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Bringing America together, Biden said. Uniting our people, uniting our nation, to which we said as we watched it and we meant it when we did. Amen. Unity. That is precisely what this country needs more than it needs anything. We are all in this together, every single American and we have no choice but to hang together.\\n\\nLet's finally accept that we are one country and act like we are and make this a better place for everyone. Unity. No decent person opposes that.\\n\\nIf Joe Biden can bring unity to this country, he will be a legitimately great President. But there's a catch. There always is a catch.\\n\\nWe're going to bring America together, Joe Biden told us today, but not everyone is going to be included. Unity doesn't mean every single American because not everyone who is born within our borders really is an American, some of us are beyond the pale of citizenship, morally. We may have American passports and birth certificates, but effectively, we are hostile foreigners, we are the enemy, we must be defeated.\\n\\nHere is who Joe Biden says those people are.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBIDEN: A rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: We will defeat political extremists, domestic terrorists, white supremacist, those are America's enemies. We must wage war against them. We must, quote, defeat those people. That's what Biden said today.\\n\\nIt seemed like a highly significant part of his speech and maybe a significant part of the Democratic Party's governing agenda going forward. We're not imagining this. We weren't the only ones who noticed it. People who voted for Joe Biden heard it, too. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard a declaration of war against white supremacy and against the lies that brought our democracy to the brink.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And President-elect Biden will inherit an unprecedented domestic security crisis.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: A declaration of war against white supremacy. Now, you may not have noticed that because then on one level, it's not very remarkable. Not many Americans support white supremacy. Most people in this country find it disgusting, of course, and they should.\\n\\nBut the question is, what is it exactly? Now that we're waging war on white supremacists, can somebody tell us in very clear language what a white supremacist is? That's not some Picayune semantic question. Joe Biden isn't a high school debate coach, Joe Biden is the new President of the United States.\\n\\nJoe Biden controls the largest military and largest law enforcement agencies in the world. He has now declared war. So we should know specifically and precisely who exactly he has declared war on. We have a right to know that.\\n\\nInnocent people could be hurt in this war, they usually are. There could be collateral damage in this war, and the casualties will be Americans.\\n\\nSo again, what is a white supremacist? You might be surprised to learn just how broad the definition for that has become. Bloomberg News has described a wall on our southern border as, quote, a monument to white supremacy so be certain not to support that.\\n\\nColin Kaepernick who seems to have the unequivocal support of Corporate America calls the Fourth of July an example of white supremacy. So you'd better put away the fireworks and the hotdogs.\\n\\nThe United States Army, a trusted institution, if there ever was one has used an entire manual on what is and what is not white supremacy. So you should know this. Among the telltale signs of a committed white supremacist are these: celebrating Columbus Day, using the term American exceptionalism, any support for Federal border security or English only measures or, quote, education funding from property taxes, all white supremacy.\\n\\nUsing the phrase, There's only one human race is white supremacy, too, according to the Army, and of course, voting for Donald Trump, all white supremacy.\\n\\nHere's the problem. Let's say you don't buy those definitions. Let's say you're, for example, white foot poor, and you have trouble accepting the idea that you're benefiting from some kind of structural advantage. We better shut up about it if you know what's good for you because according to the United States Army, the quote, denial of white privilege is a classic sign of yes, white supremacy, so no complaining.\\n\\nYou can see the problem with this, we definitely can see the problem. This show was not on the air for six months before there was an organized and highly aggressive campaign by prominent Democrats to denounce us as white supremacist. The first time it happened, the people who work on this show, many of them kids, were shocked and horrified by that. White supremacists? What's worse than that?\\n\\nThe phrase evokes images of burning crosses and lynchings. It's awful.\\n\\nIn our case, it was totally undeserved. This show is completely opposed to the practice of judging people on the basis of their skin color. We have said that repeatedly every week for four years. No show in all media has said it more or meant it more sincerely.\\n\\nWhy have we said that? Why are we opposed to judging people on the basis of their race? Not simply because we were taught to oppose doing that though we were, but because it's immoral, and it's immoral because we believe in God. That's the real answer.\\n\\nBelieving in God doesn't make you a good person, unfortunately. But believing in God does answer the question of where we came from. God made us, that's what believers believe. Once you understand that, it is impossible to think that any one race is inherently better or worse than any other race, because God made every person.\\n\\nGod assigns an identical moral value to every individual. God cares about all of us equally. So we are judged by what we do, not by how we were born. We really believe that. Most Americans really believe that.\\n\\nIt's not an accident that Martin Luther King was a Christian Minister and that Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong were not. Secular leaders are the ones most likely to count their populations by race, and then to embrace collective punishment. Through history, they often have. We've said all of that before in the show many times.\\n\\nSo the question is, why have they kept denouncing us, as of all things, white supremacists? We thought a lot about that, you should think a lot about it, too now that the Biden administration has declared war on people they claim to have white supremacist ideas.\\n\\nIn our case, it all started when we began criticizing the people in charge. Other channels fill their air with attacks on so-called Proud Boys, whoever they are, or the QAnon enthusiasts or gun owners in Central Pennsylvania who fix air conditionings for a living and tend to vote the wrong way. They go after those people, and you can see why. Attacking those people isn't hard. None of them have real power. They don't — let's be honest, they don't.\\n\\nBut private equity does have power, a lot of power. So does Google, so does Citibank, so does the government of China, so does even silly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with her massive social media accounts. Those are the people who run our country. They don't like to be criticized.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they don't care to defend themselves directly with reason and fact, often they can't do that. So instead, they denounce you, your critics, their critics, as white supremacists. And then they just ignore what you say. Fine. We've dealt with this for years, we're used to it. It no longer hurts our feelings, we understand what's going on.\\n\\nBut there's a new regime in power starting today and they seem to be planning to accelerate things dramatically. They're getting the FBI and the Pentagon involved in this hunt for people who may criticize them. That's a very big change, and you should understand what it's really about."}

Now I am banned, on 9/11 mind you, for daring to give suggestions on how we can stop another 9/11. It is against Facebook's 'community standards' to try to stop Jihadist attacks on Americans. This is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.\\n\\nThe article outlined nine ways in which Jihad can be countered both online and in person. Glazov's tips include: 1. Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment. 2. Scrap Countering Violent Extremism. 3. Stop Partnering With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups. 4. Implement a Concrete Countering-Jihad Strategy. 5. Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.\\n\\nGlazov previously faced censorship on social media when his Twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted Islamic religious texts. The columnist's account was suspended for violating Twitter's rules relating to hateful conduct.\\n\\nThe tweets that resulted in Glazov's temporary suspension related to Sahih Bukhari's texts discussing Mohammed's marriage to Aisha when she was six years old, and a quote posted by Glazov from the Quranic Suras that mandates the Hijab for women and sanctions sexual slavery. These direct quotes from Islamic religious texts were apparently enough to result in Glazov's account being locked until he deleted the offending tweets.\\n\\nIn April, Glazov was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of abuse he received on the platform. In an article on his website, he posted screenshots of an exchange he had with another Facebook user named Muhammad Irfan Ayoub. Glazov claims that Ayoub began rebuking him for daring to bring attention to the persecution of women and girls under Sharia and telling Jamie to convert to Islam. In one exchange, Ayoub reportedly told the writer that Allah will defeat you, Glazov replied; Allah will defeat us? I thought Islam was a religion of peace? Ayoub replied; Peace for those who obey Allah and His Prophet. but those who oppose them their [there] is no peace for them.\\n\\nIn another exchange, Ayoub said: I will break your mouth. The posting of these exchanges resulted in a seven-day ban of Glazov's account by Facebook.\\n\\nBreitbart News reached out to Facebook for comment on Glazov's latest suspension but has yet to receive a response at the time of the writing of this article."}

{"original": "Democrats are on the wrong side of the immigration argument, the core issue shaping Western politics, says Andrew Sullivan, a moderate-minded liberal writer at New York magazine.\\n\\nSullivan is a gay liberal who led the push for single-sex marriage. But he is not an anti-America progressive. He has supported the border wall and recognizes the political extremism of the Democrats' see-no-problem policies towards immigration:\\n\\nMy own view is that the only Democrat who will beat Trump next year will campaign for control of immigration, legal and undocumented, in a sane and humane way. The issue will be dominant again — because of a huge wave of migrants, many of them rural Guatemalans, who are overwhelming the border, trying to enter the U.S. at a current pace of 100,000 a month. Their ability to claim asylum under current law permits them to show up at the border, get admitted and processed by the Border Patrol, and then released into the interior, to reside here until a court date, which could come up years later. The backlog in the underfunded immigration courts is vast, with more than a million still in line for a hearing. Many of the migrants won't show up for the court date; those who do can still resist deportation indefinitely. What this means is that the U.S. now has an effectively open border with Mexico, and, according to the American Bar Association, the immigration system is irredeemably dysfunctional and on the brink of collapse. Repeating the Democratic mantra that there is no border crisis will not work for much longer. This year will see more undocumented immigrants than in any year under Obama. And the high rate of success among those trying to enter to the country now encourages more migrants to make the journey, especially given the forces of disorder and climate change that are forcing people to flee. The lesson from Europe in 2015 is that a migrant surge fuels itself, as word gets back home. And then white nationalism takes off. We could, in other words, be in the mother of all immigration scares as the first primaries take place. We could have a million more migrants to grapple with. Currently, no Democrat has any response to this. The only candidate with an actual immigration policy, Julián Castro, favors a much more lenient system and an end to criminalizing illegal border crossing. He wants the immigration surge to become a flood, all but guaranteeing Trump's reelection.\\n\\nThere should be no penalty for illegal immigration, says Julian Castro, one of the Democrats' presidential candidates. He also wants amnesty for millions. OK, so offering wage cuts and rent hikes may not be the best campaign tactic, but it is original. https://t.co/ZQJ25AHWkM — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) April 2, 2019\\n\\nSullivan uses his warning to the Democrat Party to tout Pete Buttigieg, who is a progressive and gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana:\\n\\nIf Buttigieg counters with a campaign for a path to citizenship for most here, but also in favor of mandatory e-verify (a completely humane way to enforce immigration law in the interior of the country via employment), he'd break out of the pack. Just actively treating the fears about immigration as legitimate — and seeking to assuage them — would mark him as a different kind of Democrat.\\n\\nSullivan is a bourgeois gay, and wants gay people to become an indistinguishable part of normal society. For Sullivan, gay equality means that politics for gay people becomes just humdrum, normal politics — crime and traffic, wages and migration, healthcare laws, and Social Security debates.\\n\\nDemocrats should 'Give Trump his F* wall' or else lose in 2020, says Andrew Sullivan, a Brit immigrant who pushed gay marriage and does not fit the left's hate-profile of conservatives. https://t.co/ftVxaUik0S — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) June 25, 2018\\n\\nBut Buttigieg is a gay, big-government progressive, so his supporters, alliances, commitments, and politics all tend towards the progressive, no-borders left, despite his moderate demeanor and his professed Christianity.\\n\\nFor example, on the April 7 Meet the Press show, Chuck Todd asked Buttigieg about his immigration policies. Buttigieg answered by saying that illegals should be protected because they are part of U.S. communities:\\n\\nSo we have worked very hard to be a welcoming city because the current immigration policies are just wrong. People who are really important parts of our community are being torn apart from their families. And this is not making us safer. It is not making us stronger. Now, when it comes to ICE, I don't care what the agency in charge of our immigration and border enforcement is called. I care what it does. And as long as you have an agency, even if you get rid of ICE and called it something else, being ordered to tear families apart from one another or being ordered to make it harder to get on a path to citizenship, you're going to continue to have heartbreaking stories that are not helping anybody. Whether we're talking about the undocumented immigrants concerned or whether you're talking about the communities that they're a part of.\\n\\nThat is a diplomatic way of saying that illegals will be allowed to stay in the United States once they get past the border. That is also the Democrats' usual We're-not-for-deportations disguised endorsement of open borders.\\n\\nThis is also the backway way progressives say Americans are not allowed to build their own communities, not to protect their communities from foreign migrants who lower their wages, crowd into their children's blue-collar schools, and fuel the divisive diversity which helps progressives grab power in fractured societies.\\n\\nButtigieg's progressivism also pressures him to oppose the clear biological distinctions between men and women, and thus he talks up the transgender ideology.\\n\\nIn an April 7 fundraiser for a gay advocacy group, Buttigieg suggested the Pentagon should accept the core transgender demand that people's legal sex be determined by their sense of gender identity, not by their actual genes and male-or-female body. He said:\\n\\nThe struggle is not over when transgender troops, ready to put their lives on the line for this country, have their careers threatened with ruin one tweet at a time by a commander in chief who himself pretended to be disabled in order to get out of serving when it was his turn.\\n\\nIf the Pentagon is forced to accept the claim that gender (not the bright line of biology) decides a person's male or female sex, then progressives will have won a huge victory in their campaign to erase the public's immense variety of helpful civic practices and laws which help men and women manage their competitive and cooperatives lives together. Those non-government rules — marriage, dating, sports leagues, privacy, and much else — are based on the recognition that women and men are legally equal and also different and complementary.\\n\\nIn contrast, most progressives believe that men and women are indistinguishable and interchangeable, and so only a few are able to publicly oppose the transgender ideology or the globalist, open-borders push.\\n\\nSullivan's liberalism allows him to recognize the reality of biology and sex — and of nations and borders — but it does not allow progressives to become liberal moderates."}

HGTV is proud to have a crystal clear, consistent record of including people from all walks of life in its series.\\n\\nThat wasn't enough for Aurthur, who made a point of noting that Fixer Upper has not yet included a gay couple in each of its first three seasons:\\n\\nWhen pressed about same-sex couples being welcome on Fixer Upper in particular, the representative for HGTV highlighted the phrase in any of our shows. The series, which just launched its fourth season, has yet to do so.\\n\\nAurthur appears to insinuate that HGTV is anti-LGBT even after acknowledging in her previous article that two other popular programs on the network, Property Brothers and House Hunters, have featured gay couples in the past. The absence of gay couples on Fixer Upper is apparently enough evidence for BuzzFeed to suggest that the show, the couple and the network are all anti-gay bigots.\\n\\nAurthur's second story on the Gaineses also claims that the first article sparked a firestorm of criticism from Christians who argued that people who oppose same-sex marriage and LGBT rights are persecuted by the media.\\n\\nBut most of the criticism of the first article came not just from Christians, but also from BuzzFeed's own readers and from many of Aurthur's peers in the media.

{"original": "Australia's most prestigious law school accommodates two courses which call for elements of sharia law to be incorporated in the mainstream legal system — including allowances for polygamy and lowering the age of consent to end opposition to child marriage. The courses also chide judges who denounce Muslim values during sentencing.\\n\\nSydney University's Muslim Minorities And The Law course uses a textbook which promotes the idea that sharia and common law are not inherently incompatible, the Daily Telegraph reports. It is taught by Professors Salim Farrar and Dr Ghena Krayem.\\n\\nThey are both 'law' in the sense they represent and communicate a set of 'norms' that operate at both individual and a community level, the book explains. A portion of the textbook identifies the benefits of ending monogamous relationships and notes how sharia law does not recognise the minimum age in marriage.\\n\\nThere is no minimum age for a contract of marriage, but it should not be consummated if that would cause harm to the putative spouse, the book reads. Whilst some have argued that there may be reasons for changing marriage laws to include polygamous marriages… there have not been any proposals for any legislative amendment proposed by the Muslim communities in our Common Law jurisdictions.\\n\\nAs to the need for Western society to accommodate traditional Islamic views on a host of issues, the textbook pleads for special treatment for Muslims before the courts.\\n\\nWhere found guilty of transgressing Western values, for example in gender equality, or violating national security, courts have clearly communicated their denunciation of 'traditional' or conservative Muslim values when sentencing, dispensing exemplary sentences and announcing aggravating factors, even when the written law does not explicitly demand it.\\n\\nThe revelation comes at the same time a leader of the terrorist group Hezbollah has denounced the West for opposing child marriage and urged Muslims to spread it to the West.\\n\\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah slams 'morally-bankrupt' opponents of child marriage, urges Muslims to 'spread it to the West.' pic.twitter.com/0vfqXr6Kpv — Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) July 13, 2017\\n\\nThis is not the first time sharia law has become the focus of debate in a Western country.

{"original": "The coronavirus outbreak reveals the value of faith communities in assisting people during times of crisis, said radio host Dennis Prager, author of The Rational Bible: Genesis and founder of PragerU. He joined Wednesday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow to discuss religious beliefs amid adversity.\\n\\nShortcomings in secular and unmarried life may be revealed during the coronavirus pandemic, estimated Prager.\\n\\nI think that people will realize that there's been a certain foolishness in thinking that a godless and religionless life is is rich, said Prager. It isn't, and it's crises that make that clear.\\n\\nSecular people lack a built-in community relative to the faithful, added Prager.\\n\\nUnderstanding the value of companionship in a loving marriage becomes more widespread in difficult times, Prager remarked.\\n\\nThe other thing that I think is going to come out of this is I think that all these young people in America who have a cavalier attitude toward marriage … may realize that being alone with my CEO status or my Yale PhD isn't quite as good as being with somebody that I might love and who loves me, Prager determined.\\n\\nLISTEN:\\n\\nMarlow asked, Has the absence of faith left us more vulnerable at this moment? Because I can't help but feel that it has. An absence of faith leaves people less prepared to confront suffering, he added.\\n\\nOf course we're better prepared, replied Prager, describing religious practice as preparation to deal with suffering. Who's better prepared if a ship sinks — people who have been practicing swimming their whole life or people who don't know how to swim? The religious know how to swim when there's bad stuff.\\n\\nPrager described part of his mission as helping people understand why God is important. He said, I never try to convince people about God's existence. I only try to convince people of God's necessity. That's far more important to me.\\n\\nI don't believe that that God will protect me from COVID-19 more than a secular guy, Prager stated. I do not believe that, so I just want to make that clear, however, that doesn't mean you don't call on God. 'God is my shepherd. I shall not want.' It doesn't mean God is going to save me and not my secular neighbor. I don't believe that.\\n\\nPrager continued, I am absolutely convinced that a subtext here is that secular people fear death more. And we don't want to die any more than anyone. I love life. I love my family and friends. I love everything I do. I'm crazy about life, but I don't fear death. I believe there's an afterlife. I don't think this is all there is. Clearly, if you think this is all there is then you will fear losing it more than the guy who thinks this isn't all there is.\\n\\nMarlow asked about reconciling worldly suffering with belief in God. Why does God allow this to happen, and how would you describe it to people who do feel like they've been abandoned in times like this?\\n\\nPrager responded, This is the oldest question. The book of Job is entirely about this. First of all, religious people are are not only allowed — but expected — to ask God, 'Why do you seem like you've abandoned me?' For a Christian, Christ on the cross's last words are, 'Why have you abandoned me?'\\n\\nStruggling with God is a biblical theme and completely in keeping with being a religious person, noted Prager. The first monotheist, the first Jew, Abraham, argues with God, he said. The name Israel means argue with God.\\n\\nPrager went on, God does not abandon us. Just because God doesn't save us doesn't mean he's abandoned us. If God saved everyone in hardship, then belief would be idiocy. It would be nonsense. Of course people would believe. It's like a celestial butler, 'God, I have a trouble here, okay?'\\n\\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand Americans a year die from errors in hospitals, 250,000, Prager remarked. We're not close … so I personally am more worried about the shutdown of the society than I am of COVID-19.\\n\\nA virtual seder will be available via PragerU on Wednesday beginning at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.\\n\\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\\n\\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter."}
{"original": "An Indonesian Muslim group named Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran (Indonesia without dating) has declared February 14 Indonesia Without Dating Day, organizing rallies, talks, popular events to stamp out both the holiday and the practice of dating before marriage.\\n\\nThe Asian outlet Coconuts reported on Monday that the group organized a rally over the weekend to promote their new Sharia-compliant replacement for Valentine's Day and will continue to organize promotional events throughout the week in anticipation of the holiday.\\n\\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country. Hardline Muslims in the country have spent years campaigning against Valentine's Day, accusing it of being a depraved foreign ritual, a violation of Sharia, the Islamic law, both for being the feast day of a Catholic saint and a holiday associated with romance and sexuality. Multiple towns in the country ban celebrating the event locally, often to the detriment of local businesses accustomed to profits from couples' gifts. Other Muslim countries in the region, like Malaysia and Pakistan, have birthed similar movements against the gifting of flowers and chocolates for Valentine's Day.\\n\\nThe Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran campaign against the holiday is unique in that the group advocates against any romantic dating all year round. Instead, the group's leaders urge young people to remain single and immediately marry someone if they are interested in a relationship, with no period of dating prior to marriage in which the two would get to know each other. A profile published by PRI last year described the group as a movement to eliminate premarital dating, derided as a sinful, Western ritual that will ruin your life. These young Muslims instead want to push their island nation, long branded as religiously moderate, toward practices that more closely resemble norms in, say, Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nThe group's February 14 campaign will aim at convincing young Muslims to never date another person, or immediately either break up with or marry the person they are currently dating. According to Coconuts, the group is organizing talks on relationships, sexual health, and religion for their Indonesia Without Dating Day on Friday.\\n\\nThe group will also reportedly use the occasion to sell books and other merchandise, which Coconuts explained encompasses a significant portion of the group's reason for being:\\n\\nIn all seriousness though, Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran has been heavily criticized in the past by people accusing the movement of being a cash grab taking advantage of gullible young conservatives. There are also concerns that the movement, which has members predominantly in their teens and early 20s, would normalize young and underage marriage involving people who may not be mentally, economically, and/or physically ready for a serious life commitment.\\n\\nThe group, which claims 20,000 members, invests heavily in its social media presence, both to expand membership and sell branded products. Membership in the group costs a $13 fee. Its website features a subsection for buying group-related products, much of which is clothing. Specialty hijabs appear to be high on the list of marketed products; the page links to an Instagram account full of fashion images showcasing hijabs for sale.\\n\\nThe movement swirls around a profit-seeking business, Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran, which sells a variety of branded accessories: T-shirts, hijabs, keychains and trucker hats, the PRI profile of the group published in July 2019 detailed, highlighting that its marketers are proficient in using memes and online attention to expand membership. The group also has ties to social media influencers who regularly post about the horrors of dating and encourage followers to lead conservative Islamic lives – also while selling sponsors' products.\\n\\nPaying for membership in the group allows for access to services, as well, such as chat rooms to meet members of the opposite sex and marry them without dating. A reporter quoted in the PRI article described the chat rooms as militaristic.\\n\\nWhile Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran's tactics may be novel, Indonesian Muslim groups' war on Valentine's Day has become an annual tradition. In 2013, for example, Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim group, urged a limit on teenagers exchanging gifts on Valentine's Day, arguing that doing so results in teens joining special Valentine's Day sex parties, which they alleged are a common occurrence in Western countries.\\n\\nWe don't want to completely ban Valentine's Day but it's not for teenagers, a Nahdlatul Ulama secretary said at the time. Teenagers see it as a time to express love and affection and they often end up in sex parties, like in the West.\\n\\nThe Islamic Defenders Front went a step further, calling the entire celebration immoral, with or without sex parties.\\n\\nIn 2016, the city of Banda Aceh banned the holiday entirely.\\n\\nOur society and the Muslim youth should certainly not be celebrating non-Islamic holidays, said Mayor Illiza Saaduddin Djamal. The law says it is haram. The government is obliged to protect the public and younger generation from unlawful acts.\\n\\nThe mayor ordered police to re-educate anyone caught exchanging gifts, decorating homes or businesses with hearts or other related imagery, or otherwise appearing to observe the holiday. Several other cities joined the ban in 2018.\\n\\nIn 2017, the National Muslim Youth Association organized an anti-Valentine's Day protest, chanting Say No to Valentine and urging women to beware using too much perfume.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}
{"original": "China's state-run Global Times on Tuesday reported the country registered 10 million newborns in 2020, a 15-percent decline from 2019 that brought China's birth rate well below the warning level demographics experts have established.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Global Times, there was some dispute between the Ministry of Public Security and the National Bureau of Statistics about precisely how many children were born in China last year, but no matter which agency gets the last word, the demographic news is not good:\\n\\nThere has been a declining curve of yearly new births in China — 17.86 million, 17.23 million, 15.23 million and 14.65 million in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, according to data released by the NBS. The low birth rate in China has reached an alarming degree, but it is not a surprise, Mu Guangzong, a professor from the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The main reason for the decline is the low desire among young couples to have children due to the high cost of supporting a child, he said, noting that for many young couples, the general housing and education policies in China as well as the social environment as a whole do not encourage them to have kids.\\n\\nThe Global Times obliquely referred to the unbalanced sex ratio of Chinese people as another factor in declining birth rates. In other words, back when the authoritarian Chinese government was strictly enforcing its one-child policy with mandatory contraception and abortion, girls were considered a disposable luxury by parents desperate to have a son.\\n\\nA generation later, China finds itself with a shortage of mothers, and male children still account for 52.7 percent of births. As of 2019, the Chinese population included 30.49 million more males than females.\\n\\nNothing like this has happened in human history, the Washington Post said of China's sex imbalance in 2018, noting that Beijing must manage a generation of men who will never find wives and only rarely have sex that is roughly comparable to the population of California.\\n\\nBeyond an epidemic of loneliness, the imbalance distorts labor markets, drives up savings rates in China and drives down consumption, artificially inflates certain property values, and parallels increases in violent crime, trafficking or prostitution in a growing number of locations, the Washington Post warned, noting that India has an equally troubling sex imbalance and many other Asian nations are not far behind.\\n\\nThe Global Times quoted Minister of Civil Affairs Li Jiheng's warning in December that China has reached a critical turning point and sorely needs a national strategy to tackle the aging population.\\n\\nLi said the fertility rate has plunged dangerously beneath the rate of 2.1 births per woman required to maintain a stable population, urging government action to boost the fertility rate to meet China's growing need for workers. Other Chinese analysts estimated it could take 15 years or more for relaxed family planning rules to noticeably increase the birth rate, while China's population of retirees swells inexorably to 300 million over the next few years.\\n\\nAFP postulated Tuesday that China's reversal of its notorious one-child policy in 2016 has yet to produce a baby boom due to empowered Chinese women often delaying or avoiding childbirth and young couples blaming rising costs and insufficient policy support for families.\\n\\nThe BBC noted China's birth rate hit a 70-year low in 2019, three years after the end of the one-child policy. This is commonly attributed to a lack of government financial support for young couples to have the families their government suddenly desires, after years of threatening to destroy their lives if they dared to have a second child, but as the Global Times story suggested, there is growing concern that the male-female imbalance may have created a demographic log jam that cannot be cleared with government subsidies.\\n\\nAFP's report suggests China faces a unique combination of its own self-imposed demographic issues and the problem faced by almost every industrialized society: convincing young people to have children, especially multiple children, instead of pursuing their careers and enjoying material success is very difficult.\\n\\nNot even two children are sufficient to rise above the 2.1 births per woman threshold of stable population growth; many families with three or more children are needed, and this is difficult to achieve if young people delay marriage and family in favor of professional and financial success. Reversing a plunge as steep as China's, with such a huge excess of males in the population, probably cannot be achieved by simply offering larger subsidies to defray the cost of raising children."}

While many of the cases occur among Muslim families, FGM is not exclusive to Islam and much more common in Africa than in any other part of the world. Often, the procedure occurs in areas with limited hygiene and a lack of medical supplies, and is done by senior tribal members or other non-medical professionals.\\n\\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) is still widespread – but increasingly condemned – throughout much of North and East Africa. However, the recent history of the practice in Egypt presents special challenges for those trying to end it, the UNFPA site read.\\n\\nNot only does the procedure hurt the victim physically, but it can also lead to long-term mental health issues. Experts have identified no legitimate medical reason for a woman to ever undergo FGM.\\n\\nIn 2016, Egypt implemented an amended law that made penalties harsher for those who performed the ancient procedure, according to Breitbart News.\\n\\nThe nation's health ministry reportedly announced the enactment of the amendment, which increases punishment for FGM to felony charges, with up to 15 years in prison, from a misdemeanor, with a maximum of three years behind bars, the article stated.\\n\\nHuman rights lawyer Reda el-Danbouki said the law only criminalizes FGM in cases where there is no medical justification.\\n\\nThis clause opens the door to parents as well as physicians to claim that they were not conducting female circumcision but simply removing allegedly discomforting skin growth, he noted, adding that judges are not convinced FGM is a crime.\\n\\nJudges are lenient when it comes to cases entailing violence against women, Danbouki said.\\n\\nFriday, managing director of the Tadwein Gender Research Center, Amel Fahmy, commented that unless there is true criminalization of the practice, it will continue.\\n\\nMany more Egyptian girls will be forced to undergo the procedure, and many of them will die, Fahmy concluded."}

Wedding photos posted on social media showed the bride wearing an Islamic headscarf.\\n\\nThe ST cited reports that the couple has visited a fertility clinic in Germany because Sultan Muhammad's first marriage was childless and he is desperate to start a family. Muhammad seemed quite healthy and vigorous otherwise, with a penchant for extreme sports such as off-road driving, horse riding, football, and endurance challenges.\\n\\nMuhammad V was the 15th king of Malaysia since it peacefully separated from the United Kingdom in 1957 and the first to abdicate. If he had remained on the throne, the 49-year-old monarch would have served only three more years, because Malaysia has a unique rotational monarchy in which the ceremonial royal office is passed between nine sultans.

The Conference of Rulers is scheduled to vote on January 24 and swear in a new king on January 31, although there is no legal deadline for installing a new king.\\n\\nThe SCMP explained why the decision may not be as simple as confirming the current acting king to hold the rest of Muhammad V's term or tapping the next scheduled king to take over early:\\n\\nUnder the rotational system, the Sultan of Pahang state, Ahmad Shah, is next in line although the sultan is ailing according to local media, a rumour the palace has strenuously denied. Johor's Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar and Sultan Nazrin Shah of Perak, who is currently the deputy king and is carrying out the functions of the king until a new one is elected, are the next two names in the rotational system. Although the functions of the king are largely ceremonial, he also serves to safeguard Islam in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and must assent to the appointment of individuals for various senior government roles including that of prime minister. Under the constitution, there are only three instances in which the ruler who is next on the list can be denied the position: if the royal is a minor, if the Conference of Rulers by secret ballot resolves that he is unsuitable by reason of infirmity of mind or body or any other cause to exercise the functions of king, or if he declines to take the position. The ballot would then move to the next ruler on the list. In 2016, the Sultan of Johor claimed he had been offered the role of king, bypassing both Kelantan – Muhammad V's home state – and Pahang, saying he had rejected the offer out of respect for the rotational system.\\n\\nMalaysian political experts speculated that Sultan Ahmad Shah might abdicate his own position, citing his poor health, allowing his son to become sultan and king, or that Sultan Ibrahim Ismail of Johor might take the job he declined in 2016. One problem with that scenario is that Ismail supposedly does not get along well with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has a long history of attempting to limit the powers of the monarchy and remove its immunity from prosecution.\\n\\nThe South China Morning Post recalled a few clashes between the prime minister and Muhammad V as well:\\n\\nIn May, after the general election that saw former governing coalition Barisan Nasional toppled for the first time in its 61-year rule, there was widespread speculation that the palace had delayed Mahathir's swearing in as prime minister. In June, the government and the Agong reached an impasse regarding the appointment of ethnic Indian lawyer Tommy Thomas as attorney general, a position normally reserved for a member of the Malay-Muslim majority race – although the constitution does not specify a specific race, gender or religious requirement for the role. The Agong consented to the appointment after two weeks of the stand-off. Muhammad V was also the ruler who handed democracy icon and prime minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim a royal pardon in May, wiping clean his record of multiple charges of sodomy and corruption and releasing him from prison.\\n\\nCNN reported on Monday that at least six members of the Conference of Rulers have already met to discuss who will succeed Muhammad V, and in fact might have prodded him to abdicate, either because they were unhappy with his choice of fiancee or because they thought he was not well-suited to handle an era of fundamental change in Malaysia."}

Mazzant sentenced former north Texas elementary school principal Oscar Figueroa to 10 years in federal prison and ordered him to pay $17,600 in fines and assessments, U.S. Attorney John M. Bales announced. Breitbart Texas first reported on Figueroa, 47, last year after officials charged him with one count of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.\\n\\nFigueroa, the former principal of Viridian Elementary in the Dallas area Hurst-Euless-Bedford (HEB) school district, was under investigation after placing a Craigslist online ad seeking male-male oral sex at a movie theater with young partners. An undercover male police officer answered the ad, posing as a 16-year-old. The two began to text, arranging to meet at the fashionable Frisco Stonebriar Centre Mall AMC movie theater. Instead of a hook up, Figueroa was arrested as he and the undercover officer walked to a unisex bathroom. In July, a federal grand jury indicted Figueroa. During the trial, the feds introduced Figueroa's text messages with the undercover agent, his interview with law enforcement, approximately 120 Craigslist ads Figueroa posted seeking sexual activity, and the contents of his cellular phone, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Texas. In addition to 120 months of federal prison, Figueroa will be required to register as a sex offender.\\n\\nLast week, Harris County authorities charged a now former Katy High School art teacher with having an improper relationship with a student in 2015. Katy school district police arrested Robert Evan Milton, 42, for the alleged sexual misconduct an 18-year-old female student in her senior year. He bonded out of jail on $30,000.\\n\\nAccording to the Harris County Court's probable cause document, the relationship began over Instagram, where Milton purportedly said he was in an unhappy marriage and he was available to date. The alleged victim admitted to authorities she had a crush on her teacher, who also was a photographer. On April 19, 2015, he took her senior pictures at Houston's Cullen Sculpture Garden. A sudden rain storm led them to his car for shelter. There, they kissed and fondled each other. The teen told police after this encounter she would try to spend time with him in the classroom.\\n\\nOn Thursdays, she stayed after school and the two went into a classroom storage closet to kiss and touch. Not long after, the teen said they had sex. Milton allegedly rented cheap motel rooms for 2-3 hour trysts on several occasions. According to the warrant, he paid in cash. One time, they had sex in his parked car and were interrupted by a police officer.\\n\\nShe stated that she was embarrassed about being caught but told the officer that she was of legal age, the court document stated. She also said it was consensual sex. She explained she remembered the officer telling the Defendant that he (the Defendant) was old enough to be her father and to get out of there, the report stated.\\n\\nAnother Houston area educator, Oscar Perez, 44, was accused of molesting a third grade girl in the Clear Creek school district over incidents that allegedly happened in 2009. The Galveston County Sheriff's Office arrested the McWhirter Elementary teacher and charged him with continued sexual abuse of a child. Houston's KPRC 2 (NBC) reported the alleged victim, now in high school, told police investigators Perez purportedly sexually assaulted her when she stayed after school for STAAR test tutoring.\\n\\nOnce the school district was notified of the student's complaint in late April, they put Perez on administrative leave. Perez, however, denied the charges, saying it did not happen. He bonded out of jail on $40,000 and will next appear in court on August 8.\\n\\nInterestingly, Galveston detectives found a February 2016 complaint by a current student against Perez in his school district personnel file. The unnamed minor claimed Perez rubbed her leg during an exam and made her feel uncomfortable, said KPRC 2. Clear Creek school district officials put him on leave while they investigated the claim but ultimately found no reason to discipline him.\\n\\nThe TEA's fiscal year ends on August 31 after which they will release their annual figures on teacher improprieties. During the 2014-2015 school year, the state's educator sexual misconduct cases increased for the seventh consecutive year.\\n\\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter @OutOfTheBoxMom."}
{"original": "Couples in Japan confined to their homes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic are venting their marriage frustrations online, leading to corona divorce trending on social media there, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Monday.\\n\\nIn response, Japanese short-term rentals have started marketing vacant apartments as an opportunity for stressed spouses to temporarily escape quarantine homelife, Japan Times reports.\\n\\nOn April 16, Japan's government declared a national state of emergency to curb the spread of the coronavirus, limiting people's movement across the country. During the lockdown, the government has asked citizens to avoid unnecessary outings, schools are closed, and most people are working from home.\\n\\nAccording to the Japan Times, decreased tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic has left many Airbnb-style rental properties across Japan empty. Several companies have seized the opportunity to market the vacant apartments as short-term sanctuaries for people who need space from their spouses.\\n\\nOne such company, Kasoku, based in Tokyo, advertises its apartments as the solution for couples on the brink of separation due to quarantine stress.\\n\\nPlease consult with us before thinking about 'coronavirus divorce,' Kasoku advised. The company reportedly offers its furnished units as temporary shelters for people to take some time to themselves, whether to escape their family, work, or just relax alone. The apartments cost ¥4,400 [$40] per day.\\n\\nThe company started renting corona-divorce-advertised apartments on April 3. In its first two weeks, the campaign brought in 20 customers, Kasoku's spokesman, Kosuke Amano, told Japan Times on April 16. The service includes a free 30-minute divorce consultation with a legal official.\\n\\nKasoku admits its marketing campaign has been slightly tongue-in-cheek. However, the company says that the apartments have been rented by some people with serious problems, such as a woman escaping domestic violence.\\n\\nJapan, an island nation with high population density, has long suffered from issues caused by limited space. Especially in Tokyo, Japan's capital and most populous prefecture, tiny apartments and living spaces are infamous. In addition, Japanese society has engrained gender roles in which women are expected to take on traditional responsibilities of domestic life, such as childcare and chores.\\n\\nUnder these conditions, Japanese homes have been transformed into tiny pressure cookers of stress for spouses, especially women, during the lockdown. Among Kasoku's renters are a woman tired of taking care of her children, who are at home all day because of school closures, and another woman who said she fled after having a big fight with her husband, Amano told Japan Times.\\n\\nCouples seem to be struggling with quarantine life in other parts of the world as well. In China and Russia, divorce rates have reportedly increased during coronavirus lockdowns, according to Japan Times. Still, the use of the term corona divorce in Japan seems particularly Japanese given some historical context. The phrase Narita divorce was coined in the 1980s in Japan to describe newlywed couples returning to Tokyo's Narita Airport after their honeymoon, where they would often decide to separate after realizing they had nothing in common, according to SCMP.\\n\\nJapanese public broadcaster Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) has been devoting a section of its morning program to give advice on how to avoid and diffuse marriage tensions that could possibly lead to divorce, Japan Times reports. About 35 percent of marriages in Japan end in divorce, compared to 45 percent in the United States, according to SCMP.\\n\\nAlthough originally expected to end May 6, Japan's government has been eyeing an extension to its current coronavirus lockdown, Japan Times reported on April 26. At press time on Tuesday, Japan had 13,614 infections and 385 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus."}

This is just the latest confirmation of a downward trend, with the yearly birthrate declining by 91,000 since 2008.\\n\\nThe decline was far sharper in births to couples both of whom are Italian citizens. Children born to Italian couples sank to 385,014 in 2015 (a drop of over 95,000 over the last seven years). Istat attributed the trend to two factors: ever fewer Italian women at childbearing age and an increasing unwillingness to have children among those who could.\\n\\nBirths to couples where at least one of the members is a non-Italian have continued to climb relative to births to Italian couples, and now make up 20.7 percent of the total yearly births nationwide, or just over one fifth.\\n\\nThe Institute also highlighted a precipitous drop in the marriage rate, with 52,000 fewer marriages in 2015 than in 2008. The birthrate within marriages has dropped even more than among the general population (a decline of nearly 120,000 births in just 7 years). At the same time, out-of-wedlock births have risen steadily as a percentage of all births, representing 28,7 percent of the total in 2015.\\n\\nSumming up, Istat notes that the average number of children per woman has dropped to 1.35 in 2015 from 1.46 in 2010. Italian women have on average 1.27 children whereas foreign women residing in Italy give birth to an average of 1.94 children per woman.\\n\\nItaly's birthrate has fallen further and further below the replacement rate of roughly 2.1 children per woman.

{"original": "Shiite Iran continues to criminalize women's right's activism, designating peaceful female advocates as enemies of the state and using its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to crack down on them, reports human rights watchdog Amnesty International.\\n\\nIt notes:\\n\\nThe [human rights] organization's research reveals that since January 2016 more than a dozen women's rights activists in Tehran have been summoned for long, intensive interrogations by the Revolutionary Guards, and threatened with imprisonment on national security-related charges. Many had been involved in a campaign launched in October 2015, which advocated for increased representation of women in Iran's February 2016 parliamentary election.\\n\\nMagdalena Mughrabi, interim deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Amnesty International, noted:\\n\\nIt is utterly shameful that the Iranian authorities are treating peaceful activists who seek women's equal participation in decision-making bodies as enemies of the state. Speaking up for women's equality is not a crime. We are calling for an immediate end to this heightened harassment and intimidation, which is yet another blow for women's rights in Iran. Rather than addressing Iran's disturbing record on women's rights the Iranian authorities have once again opted for repression, accusing women's rights activists of collusion in western-orchestrated plots in a bid to maintain their discriminatory practices towards women.\\n\\nThe Shiite country is using arbitrary orders for interrogation of activists.\\n\\nMany have been accused of espionage and treason — crimes that are punished by death in Iran.\\n\\nAmnesty International points out:\\n\\nThe women summoned for interrogation were given no reason for the summonses they received, but once inside the interrogation room they were bombarded with accusations of espionage and collusion with 'foreign-based currents seeking the overthrow of the Islamic Republic system.'

{"original": "Last week former NFL player Jack Brewer declared a tremendous awakening is happening in the country as some black Americans are abandoning the Democrat Party and turning to support President Donald Trump.\\n\\nBrewer said:\\n\\nI'm going to take the guy who's actually putting in the policies that are going to make life better for my young black son and my young black daughter, versus somebody who gives me lip service — like, unfortunately, the Democrats have done for our community for years.\\n\\nThis ⁦article is at the heart of the Black Awakening.. I watched my Dad lose business for years while folks hire illegals. Yes, Black unemployment improvements are a direct result of ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ policies. Even The NY Times admits it. https://t.co/LOq8AaE9Hz — Jack Brewer (@JackBrewerBSI) December 31, 2019\\n\\nBrewer's words are backed up by recent concrete efforts, starting with the Blexit movement, and, now, new polling that shows some black voters are indeed pulling away from the Democrat Party on particular issues as the 2020 election year is upon us.\\n\\nFive important signs that some black Americans are awakening to a break with the Democrat Party are:\\n\\n1. The establishment of Black Voices for Trump:\\n\\nLed by co-chairs Hermain Cain, Diamond and Silk, and Pastor Darrell Scott, Black Voices for Trump seeks to encourage the black community to re-elect President Donald J. Trump by sharing experiences and successes of everyday people as a result of the Trump administration.\\n\\nRe-electing the President will ensure greater economic opportunity, safer communities, and better healthcare policies for generations to come, the group states.\\n\\nIn December, a Zogby Analytics survey found black support for Trump is at the highest levels of the year, reported Paul Bedard at the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, all African Americans do not hate Trump! said pollster Jonathan Zogby, who, after oversampling black voters in his survey, found not only that support for Trump was at 27 percent, but also that, in match-ups with 2020 Democrat candidates, support for Trump was higher than his 2016 level of eight percent in all cases.\\n\\nAgainst Joe Biden, Trump receives 12% of the black vote. Against Sen. Bernie Sanders, it was 14%, Bedard noted. And against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, it was 17%.\\n\\nThose levels are the best for a GOP president or presidential candidate since 1968, the report noted.\\n\\nTwo other recent polls showed 34 percent of black likely voters approve of President Donald Trump's presidency.\\n\\nA Rasmussen poll found black likely voter approval of Trump at 34 percent, and an Emerson Poll showed 34.5 percent approval by black likely voters:\\n\\n2. Black Americans – like other voters – want jobs and a sound economy that will enable their families to thrive:\\n\\nIn a November op-ed at the Washington Examiner, Vernon Robinson III and Bruce Eberle recalled that, in 1936, the new Gallup Poll found Democrat President Franklin D. Roosevelt received 76 percent of the black vote – just four years after he received only 21 percent from black Americans in Chicago.\\n\\nRobinson and Eberle, authors of the upcoming book Coming Home: How Black Americans Will Re-Elect Trump, asked:\\n\\nHow could such a reversal happen in so short a time span? For nearly 70 years, the Republican Party had enjoyed near-monopoly support from black voters. After all, the first Republican President was Abraham Lincoln, who was responsible for freeing the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But, much like the Democrats today, the Republican Party of that era took the black vote for granted. The Republicans thought, How could a black American not vote for the candidate of the Party of Abraham Lincoln? Or, as a Democrat might say it today, How could an African American not vote for the party whose president signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965?\\n\\nDemocrats, the authors observed, made a concerted effort to reach out to the black community. They compared that effort to that of Trump today.\\n\\nClearly, Trump's attention to black voters, his signing of the First Step prison reform bill, and his policies creating the lowest unemployment rate for black Americans in history have had an impact, they asserted.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported in December, the unemployment rate for black men is at a record low:\\n\\nThe economy added 266,000 jobs in the month, far more than expected. Black men over 20 picked up 14,000 of those jobs, according to Labor Department data released Friday. That matched in increase in the civilian labor force for that cohort. As a result, the unemployment rate for black men stayed at the all-time low of 5.1 percent hit in October.\\n\\nAnd in April, Trump celebrated his prison reform bill victory over the crime laws of the Clinton era that, the president said, disproportionately impacted the African American community.\\n\\nBreitbart News reported then:\\n\\nTrump noted that thanks to the First Step Act, more prisons were working to help reform prisoners by getting them job training programs, mentorship, and education opportunities to help them find employment after prison. … Today, I am announcing that the Second Step Act will be focused on successful re-entry and reduce unemployment for Americans with past criminal records, he said. And that's what we are starting right away.\\n\\nRobinson and Eberle added that, as Trump's policies have helped the black community, Blexit activists and individuals such as recording star Kanye West have refused to be shamed into silence by the Democrats and the left-leaning news media. They wrote:\\n\\nInstead, like their forbears in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, they have gone on offense, courageously exposing the fact that the policies of today's Democratic Party are often completely foreign to the values and aspirations of black Americans.\\n\\n3. More black Americans are condemning abortion:\\n\\nAs the Democrat Party doubles down on its embrace of abortion on demand, and continues to hold up eugenicist Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger as a progressive icon, pro-life leaders say Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in modern history.\\n\\nIn November, the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) announced it had unanimously passed a resolution that affirms the value and dignity of all human life and condemns elective abortion.\\n\\nWriting at the Washington Examiner, Timothy Head, executive director of the Faith & Freedom Coalition and Rev. Dean Nelson, executive director of Human Coalition Action, noted this remarkable resolution that went largely unnoticed by the establishment media:\\n\\nThe Church of God in Christ, a seven-million-member black denomination, unanimously passed a historic resolution affirming the value and dignity of every human life and opposing the practice of elective abortion in America. A key excerpt from the Resolution on the Sanctity of Human Life reads: COGIC is one of the largest historically black Protestant denominations, which also include the National Baptist Convention, the National Baptist Convention of America, the Progressive National Convention, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. Like these other groups, COGIC does not have a history of institutional involvement with causes typically associated with the Republican Party. Yet given the direction that abortion policy is moving in this country, its leaders felt compelled to act.\\n\\nCOGIC joined with the pro-life Human Coalition to create the Family Life Campaign, a three-year initiative that serves to save babies from abortion.\\n\\nIn September, New York Times columnist Thomas B. Edsall warned black voters should not be taken for granted.\\n\\n[T]he percentage of African-Americans describing themselves as moderate or conservative is almost twice as large as the percentage of white Democratic primary voters who describe themselves that way, he wrote, adding:\\n\\nIn the case of abortion, the WSJ/NBC surveys show that 97 percent of white primary voters agree that the procedure should be totally legal compared with two thirds of black primary voters. A vanishingly small number of white Democratic primary voters — 3 percent — said abortion should be illegal, compared with a third of black Democrats.\\n\\nAs Democrats lurch left, black Christians stand firm in their values https://t.co/6EktPDvton @Deanlife1 — Human Coalition (@HumanCoalition) November 27, 2019\\n\\n4. Black Christians are no longer compatible with a Democrat Party that values secularism more than people of faith:\\n\\nHead and Nelson observed black Americans are becoming the most conservative constituency within the Democratic Party's coalition, particularly where religion and abortion are concerned.\\n\\nIn August, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) unanimously passed a resolution that embraced religiously unaffiliated voters and belittled Americans of faith.\\n\\nThe resolution touted that 70 percent of religiously unaffiliated Americans share the values of the Democrat Party.\\n\\nThe religiously unaffiliated demographic represents the largest religious group within the Democratic Party, growing from 19% in 2007 to one in three today, stated the resolution.\\n\\nIn a reach for secularists and the nonreligious, the Democrats pointed out:\\n\\nReligiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values, with 70% voting for Democrats in 2018, 80% supporting same-sex marriage, and 61% saying immigrants make American society stronger.\\n\\nThe DNC further embraced and defended the nonreligious, asserting they:\\n\\n…have often been subjected to unfair bias and exclusion in American society, particularly in the areas of politics and policymaking where assumptions of religiosity have long predominated.\\n\\nThe Democrats concluded that since nonreligious Americans made up 17% of the electorate in 2018, they also have the potential to deliver millions more votes for Democrats in 2020 with targeted outreach to further increase turnout of nonreligious voters.\\n\\nRev. Bill Owens and his wife, Dr. Deborah Owens, authors of A Dream Derailed: How the Left Hijacked Civil Rights to Create a Permanent Underclass, told Breitbart News the Democrat Party abandoned black Americans decades ago.\\n\\nThe Owenses stated:\\n\\nWe're tired of being taken for granted by politicians who don't reflect our values. The black church has long been the center of the black community. But Leftists are now actively trying to push Christians out of the public square. When they're not trying to silence us, they're mocking us or our values.\\n\\n5. Black Americans have already sharply separated themselves from the Democrat Party on the issue of education:\\n\\nIn November, Florida Angel Mom Kiyan Michael, a member of the Black Voices for Trump advisory board, drew attention to the divide between the Democrat Party and black voters on the issue of school choice.\\n\\nIn a column at the SunSentinel, Michael wrote that school choice programs, such as those Republicans in her state have been putting into effect since the early 2000s, have been a successful way to pull low-income children out of failing public schools.\\n\\nMoreover, black Democrats have been overwhelmingly supportive of school choice, though most party leaders and 2020 Democrat presidential candidates are not, favoring their relationships with teachers' unions instead.\\n\\nBreitbart News reported:\\n\\nMichael points to one national poll, commissioned by the American Federation for Children, advocates for school choice, and conducted by Beck Research, a Democratic polling firm, that found 67 percent of voters support school choice, including 73 percent of Latinos, 67 percent of blacks, and 68 percent of whites.\\n\\nAnother poll released in August by Education Next found black Democrats approve of targeted vouchers, universal vouchers, and charter schools at 70 percent, 64 percent, and 55 percent, respectively, and Hispanic Democrats approve at 67 percent, 60 percent, and 47 percent:\\n\\nYet a third poll commissioned by school choice proponents Democrats for Education Reform, and conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group, found 81 percent of Democrat primary voters, including 89 percent of black Democrat primary voters, support a proposal to expand access to more choices and options within the public-school system, including charter schools, which are funded with taxpayer dollars but operated by private boards.\\n\\nDespite these overwhelming numbers in support of school choice in its many forms, Michael observed:\\n\\nDo-nothing Democrats still call the policy racist because they'd rather that public school teachers win with lifetime employment while black children lose with a lifetime of underperformance and missed dreams.\\n\\nTrump has also helped the more than 20 percent of black college students who receive their degrees from the nation's historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). As USA Today noted in September, under the Trump administration, federal funding for HBCUs has increased by more than $100 million over the last two years, a 17% increase since 2017.\\n\\nDuring an appearance on Fox & Friends when he discussed the black awakening, former NFL star Brewer said, For me, once I saw the policies that President Obama pushed in the back half of his presidency just — it left a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nAnd then I really started being awakening [sic] to what was happening with the Democratic Party — making so many promises but then abandoning the community that I worked so hard in, he continued.\\n\\nSo true. Especially in the Black Community where they have been convinced by Fake News to think he is racist. But I no longer hide my support. If they hate me so be it, I love the truth more than being popular. #MAGA #BlackVoicesforTrump #Blexit https://t.co/uZB3gUU3LR — Black Conservative Christian Patriot (@BlackPatriotQ17) December 28, 2019\\n\\nI said enough was enough, and I really started putting aside what my parents and my grandparents taught me about sticking to the Democratic Party because they were the party for African Americans, Brewer said."}
{"original": "Aggressive gay advocacy groups are using their court-backed transformation of marriage law as a legal hammer to impose an unprecedented genderless society on Americans, says the president of the National Organization for Marriage.\\n\\nBrian Brown – an organizer for the annual March for Marriage to be held in Washington, D.C. Saturday – said this year's event will still focus on the Supreme Court's Obergefell decision last year that suppressed states' rights to define marriage as the bond of one man and one woman.\\n\\n[This ideology] would allow men who 'identify' as women to gain access to intimate facilities like changing rooms, locker rooms, and bathrooms, and saying that any women who object that they are uncomfortable with such an arrangement are 'bigoted,' he said. Obergefell v. Hodges … illegitimately determined that all states must issue and recognize 'marriages' to same-sex couples, imposing the skewed values of a handful of judges on the nation with no legal foundation and in a gross example of legislating from the bench, Brown said , according to the Christian Post.\\n\\nHowever, he also added, The focus this year will be broader and timely, and noted:\\n\\nIn addition to protesting the illegitimate Supreme Court ruling of last year, and the [lawsuit] threats to religious liberty and freedom of conscience which have arisen in its wake, we will also be standing against the unprecedented and deplorable overreach of the Obama administration in trying to force the radical gender ideology of LGBT extremists on our communities.\\n\\nBrown said the Obama administration's directive on transgender bathroom policies puts our wives and daughters in the uncomfortable and dangerous situation of sharing intimate facilities like bathroom and changing rooms with biological men who simply 'identify' as women.\\n\\nThe March for Marriage was first held in 2013 as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA. This year's March on June 25 is timed with the Supreme Court's decision in the Obergefell matter last year.\\n\\nCountless Americans recognize that this decision is illegitimate and unlawful and the March for Marriage provides an opportunity for them to stand up and say so, Brown said.\\n\\nIn general, the transgender ideology says the state should require every American to validate every person's choice of created gender identity, even though a man who wants to be a woman is still a man by every known scientific measure of evolutionary life. For example, an Oregon law recently allowed a jury to award $60,00 t0 a transgender teacher because other teachers declined to use the teacher's preferred pronoun, which is they rather than him or her. New York City has also establish similar forced-speech rules.\\n\\nThe ideology's claim that the state must enforce a new right to gender identity also means that the state must ignore and often dismantle many civic rules that evolved to help the two distinct sexes — men and boys, women and girls — meet their legally equal, but different and complementary, needs. For example, the transgender ideological demand means that single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms must opened up to people of the opposite sex, regardless of age, and without any verification of created gender identity.\\n\\nAs a result, it is now an offense in Washington State to ask a man in a woman's bathroom if he thinks he is male or female. Similarly, Obama and gay advocacy groups have slammed a popular North Carolina law, dubbed HB2, because it requires people to undergo medical procedures before they can use a bathroom reserved for the opposite sex.\\n\\nSimilarly, the pro-transgender ideology will allow men to use shelters designated for battered women, to participate in girls' sports leagues, and to impose government discrimination against any charitable or educational groups that are focused on either of the two sexes."}

The movement is celebrated by the United Nations, which works to create a historic legacy of internationally-agreed strategies, standards, programs and goals to advance the status of women worldwide. While American women still have plenty worth fighting for, the status of women internationally doesn't compare. Women's strikers' decision to hijack this day shows just how far out of touch they are with the more serious problems facing hundreds of millions of women worldwide—problems ranging from human trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced marriage, and female genital mutilation to brutal murders masked in honor. Our foreign sisters need our help, and International Women's Day should be about them. Not us.\\n\\nSaid Harkness to Kassam regarding today's protests ignoring many issues that plague the Muslim world, such as genital mutilation, I think one of the reasons we don't often hear about it from these women's march feminists is because it's a very inconvenient narrative to what they stand for….\\n\\nHarkness continued, a lot of these injustices are actually occurring in Muslim countries and they don't want to being attention to it. One of the founders of the women's march is Muslim. Why aren't we hearing from her on International Women's day about this issue?\\n\\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\\n\\nLISTEN:"}

After the center announced that it had fired Morris Dees, its charismatic co-founder, for misconduct, another group of employees sent a separate letter accusing the center's leadership of being complicit in decades of racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and sexual harassment and/or assault. Mr. Dees, 82, has denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nBob Moser, a former SPLC staffer, wrote in the New Yorker last week: The work could be meaningful and gratifying. But it was hard, for many of us, not to feel like we'd become pawns in what was, in many respects, a highly profitable scam.\\n\\nThe president of the SPLC, Richard Cohen, has resigned. So, too, did the SPLC's deputy legal director, and a member of the SPLC's board of directors.\\n\\nFor years, the SPLC — once a widely-respected civil rights organization — has smeared conservative organizations that it falsely designated as hate groups merely for holding mainstream views that differ with those of the radical left. In 2012, a crazed leftist used the SPLC's hate map in an attempted mass shooting at the Family Research Council (FRC) in Washington, DC; the FRC was on the list merely because it supports traditional marriage.\\n\\nIn 2018, the SPLC agreed to pay British anti-extremist Muslim Maajid Nawaz $3.3 million after mis-identifying him as an anti-Muslim extremist. In 2015, it apologized for including Ben Carson on its list of extremists.\\n\\nDespite these glaring, destructive errors, mainstream media and wealthy corporations continued to treat the SPLC as a legitimate organization — and often partnered with the SPLC to blacklist conservative groups and individuals.\\n\\nJust last month, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman admitted that his company worked with the SPLC to identify, and to blacklist, conservatives.

{"original": "Rural communities in Kenya are reportedly taking advantage of school closures due to the coronavirus to perform female genital mutilation (FGM), Reuters reported on Tuesday.\\n\\nIn Kenya, 21 percent of women and girls, aged 15-49, have undergone FGM, according to United Nations data. The procedure requires the partial or total removal of the female genitalia and can cause grave health problems for the entirety of a girl's lifetime and death.\\n\\nIn 2011, Kenya criminalized FGM with a punishment of three years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. Nonetheless, Kenyans continue to perform the barbaric procedure; some communities erroneously view the gruesome ritual as necessary for girls' social acceptance and marriage prospects.\\n\\nOn April 6, Kenya's president placed some parts of the country on lockdown, limiting people's movements to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. On March 27, Kenya had enacted a dusk-to-dawn curfew. With the new restrictions on movement, young people are confined to their homes more than usual. In Kenya's northern Samburu county, schools were closed early on March 16 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, reports of FGM have increased in this county.\\n\\nIn an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday, Bernadette Loloju, chief executive of the semiautonomous government agency Anti-FGM Board, said she had received several reports that girls – specifically girls kept home from school – had been forced to undergo FGM in Samburu.\\n\\nWe did confirm one girl who was at risk [of FGM] and a case is registered with the police, and her mother has been arrested, said Loloju, adding that the child was about 12 years old.\\n\\nWe don't want to take any chances. We have to be vigilant, which is why we are trying to step up efforts in light of this [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic, Loloju said.\\n\\nAuthorities have since asked village chiefs and community workers to visit rural communities in Samburu county and report cases where girls may be at risk, according to Loloju.\\n\\nLast year, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to end FGM in Kenya by 2022. At the time of the announcement, women's rights groups argued that the goal was unrealistic due to many factors in Kenya, such as remote locations, severe poverty, and a high prevalence rate in certain parts of the country.\\n\\nThe practice occurs throughout Africa. In Egypt, a 12-year-old died in January after an FGM procedure was forced upon her by her parents, who were later arrested. FGM is reported in Africa more than any other part of the world."}
{"original": "The director of a Chinese social development think tank recently proposed unmarried Chinese women over the age of 27 — known as leftover women or sheng nu in China — should embrace the surplus of single men in rural China to find a husband, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday.\\n\\nLeftover women — most of whom reside in Chinese urban centers and are highly educated — should not feel afraid to go and live in rural villages, according to Wu Xiuming, the deputy secretary-general of the Shanxi Think Tank Development Association, a non-governmental organization in central China specializing in social development research. He further suggested that Chinese government officials encourage urban women to migrate to rural areas to find husbands by offering programs that incentivize the move.\\n\\nWu and other Chinese social development researchers have suggested the matchmaking scheme as part of an overall push for the Chinese government to address a worsening social crisis in China caused by a decades-long gender imbalance. The gender imbalance is rooted in China's only recently defunct one-child policy, which the Communist Party of China (CPC) implemented in 1979 in an effort to control China's then-rapidly growing population. CPC authorities relaxed the policy, which encouraged selective abortions for females in favor of the preferred male sex, in late 2015 to allow families to have up to two children. Nearly four decades of the scheme's enforcement severely warped China's gender demographics, producing one of the most unbalanced sex ratios in the world.\\n\\nChina's population today counts roughly 30 million more men than women, or 114 males for every 100 females, according to the international data provider Statista. The global average sex ratio at birth is about 105 males for every 100 females, according to the World Health Organisation.\\n\\nChina's gender imbalance is most acutely felt today in the country's rural areas; women have increasingly abandoned rural communities in recent years for urban centers to pursue educational and career opportunities. The exodus of women from rural villages has left men in the communities with limited marriage prospects. These men are likewise referred to as leftover men, or sheng nan.\\n\\nThe gender structural problem should be addressed as soon as possible. For example, [the government should] train rural leftover men on vocational skills and transport them to regions or industries with a high density of women, Liu Xuan, a 26-year-old migrant worker from rural Dancheng county in Henan province, told the Xinhua Daily Telegraph last week.\\n\\nLiu said he had gone on ten blind dates since the age of 19 in his quest to find a wife but had yet to secure a bride.\\n\\nBoys in our village have to queue up for blind dating, but girls can be picky, Liu told the newspaper, a daily publication of China's official state press agency, Xinhua."}
{"original": "The flood of Chinese imports into the U.S. does not just cost jobs. It shuts down factories and businesses altogether, with devastating consequences for the communities where they are located.\\n\\nAfter years of denial, it is now widely known that the opening of the U.S. market to Chinese imports was devastating, inflicting deep and lasting damage to many areas in the U.S. Regions most exposed to competition from China not only lost manufacturing jobs, they saw overall employment decline and never recovered. Areas with higher exposure have also been shown to have more people relying on food stamps and disability payments, more people addicted to opioids, lower rates of marriage, higher rates of political polarization, and higher rates of incarceration.\\n\\nNew research suggests that one of the main reasons the damage has been so deep and lasting is that the jobs lost from Chinese imports were not just from companies downsizing or becoming more efficient but from closing manufacturing plants altogether. The paper by four economists — Brian Asquith of the National Bureau of Economic Research and University of California at Irvine's Sajana Goswami, David Neumark, and Antonio Rodriguez-Lopez — finds that the so-called China shock operated mainly through deaths of establishments.\\n\\nThis makes the job losses from the China shock fundamentally different from other adverse shocks, such as recessions, that can hit the U.S. labor market. In those situations, job losses are primarily from contractions of the number of people employed at a plant, rather than the outright closing of a plant.\\n\\nFrom a local-labor markets point of view, regional economies are likely to suffer more from deaths than from contractions (which tend to be one-off events or cyclical) because closed establishments can more permanently reduce local employment, the authors write.\\n\\nThe economists say that many of the workers thrown out of work because of establishment deaths are later reabsorbed into the nontradeable sector, mainly through the births of new establishments. What is not explored in the paper is that many of these nontradeable sector jobs, however, a likely to be lower-paying service sector jobs."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has repeatedly used his political position to steer money — both contributions to his campaigns and government funding — to his family members, explained Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, senior contributor to Breitbart News, and author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite.\\n\\nIn the 13th installment of the Drill Down, Schweizer walks through how the self-described democratic socialist senator from Vermont channels campaign funds to his wife, Jane Sanders.\\n\\nThroughout his congressional career in the House and Senate, Bernie Sanders has used campaign funds to procure media-buying services from a consulting company founded and operated by his wife and her children.\\n\\nSchweizer stated:\\n\\n[In] 2000, Bernie was in Washington D.C, serving in Congress. Jane and her children a new LLC called Sanders and Driscoll. The new firm was a for-profit consulting company, and was run by Jane, daughter Carina, and son David. The family ran this new business out of the Sanders family home. Because of the way it was structured, it's impossible to know just how much money Bernie's wife and children made from his congressional campaign. But critics would claim that Sanders doled out more than $150,000 to his family through the new company. Jane would even set up a media buying company, meaning that she would get paid every time candidate Bernie Sanders bought television advertising for his Congressional campaigns. Then, during his 2016 presidential run, the Sanders campaign would funnel $82 million dollars through a mysterious media buying company run by Jane's former colleagues. That company, known as Olde Towne Media, was located in private home in a cul de sac in Virginia.\\n\\nAs mayor of Burlington, VT, Bernie Sanders appointed his wife to an initially unpaid position in his municipal administration. Against the city council's objections, he later put her on the payroll at local taxpayers' expense.\\n\\nSchweizer recalled Jane Sanders' previous role as head of Burlington College, a private school with fewer than 200 students. One of the college's board members admitted that hiring Jane Sanders was a function of her marriage to Bernie Sanders — then a member of House of Representatives from Vermont — believing it would help the school's fundraising endeavors.\\n\\nDespite its financial difficulties at the time, in 2009, Burlington College contracted with an unaccredited woodworking school run by Jane Sanders' daughter, Carina Driscoll. Over $500,000 was funneled to from Burlington College to the woodworking school.\\n\\nCarina Driscoll's school also received at least one federal grant from the US Department of Agriculture, added Schweizer, noting that Bernie Sanders had oversight over the USDA's funding at the time as a member of the Senate Budget Committee.\\n\\nI don't believe in Charity, said Bernie Sanders while mayor of Burlington.\\n\\nSchweizer concluded, While Sanders may not be a fan of charity, he seems to have no problem awarding jobs and contracts to those closest to him.\\n\\nThe biggest charity in Bernie's life is Bernie, said Schweizer in January.\\n\\nRead the full video report's transcript here.\\n\\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik."}
{"original": "Two Army Green Berets are fighting for their military careers after being associated with an anonymous email that accused their commanders of lowering standards to enable more soldiers — particularly female — to graduate from its prestigious Q-course.\\n\\nThe anonymous email, signed, A concerned Green Beret, accused the leaders of the school of moral cowardice for lowering the standards, and weakening instructors' ability to discipline students as they look to get further through the pipeline.\\n\\n[The school] has devolved into a cesspool of toxic, exploitive, biased and self-serving senior officers who are bolstered by submissive, sycophantic, and just-as-culpable enlisted leaders, the email said. They have doggedly succeeded in two things; furthering their careers, and ensuring that Special Forces [are] more prolific but dangerously less capable than ever before.\\n\\nOne of the specific complaints was that the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC), commonly referred to as Q-course, was restructured so that there were no physical barriers to earning the coveted Green Beret.\\n\\nThe email, which was blasted out to the entire U.S. Army Green Beret force in November 2017, became known as the letter heard around the world. It was then published by a news site started by former special operations forces, and it generated stories from the Associated Press, NPR, and other major news outlets.\\n\\nMaj. Gen. Kurt L. Sonntag, the commander of John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, which runs the course, responded at the time that the selection process before the Q-course, known as Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS), has evolved into a proven, challenging process that allows the training regiment to predict whether a Green Beret candidate will be successful operationally.\\n\\nIf SFAS is correct, and we believe it is, the SFQC is not a place where high attrition rates should occur. Instead, the mission of the SFQC cadre is to train to standards, he said at the time. Sonntag also said no fundamental SF standard has been removed, but that some comments in the email warrant further evaluation.\\n\\nBut in the months since, soldiers have been quietly punished for the email, according to the two Green Berets.\\n\\nThe commander of the company of instructors was relieved around April, and later given a 15/15 on his Officer Evaluation Report, the lowest score one can get, affecting his chances for promotion, and thus, staying in the military.\\n\\nThe author of the email was given an Article 15 around June for disrespecting a general grade officer. An Article 15 is an administrative, non-judicial punishment, according to the United States Code of Military Justice, which hurts one's ability to be promoted and to stay in the military.\\n\\nNow, the two additional Green Beret instructors, Sergeant First Class Micah J. Robertson, 33, and Sergeant First Class Michael Squires, 31, say they are being punished by association.\\n\\nRobertson said in an interview that after the email was sent out, commanders put together a list of about seven suspects, including them. He said he believes they were suspected because they had previously brought up concerns during town halls with leaders that were held to solicit their feedback.\\n\\nBoth have been instructors since 2016, before Sonntag took command in June 2017, and say they have witnessed the changes.\\n\\nAlthough Micah and I had nothing to do with it, it spoke true to what's happening in the regiment. This guy Sonntag, who's basically the one who's trying to screw us over — he's trying to make his career about putting a female through the course, Squires said. He added that he did not oppose women in Special Forces, but opposed lowering the standards.\\n\\nNot only doing that, he's changed it to where the guys who are coming through the Q-course are not even the same quality of guys we had back in the day. Guys who should have been kicked out for several different things … As instructors, they took our power away.\\n\\nBoth Robertson and Squires were also served with Article 15s related to the email, as well as to an online app they started building in September 2017 named Kayu, aimed at helping travelers and veterans with similar interests connect.\\n\\nThe Article 15 accused both men of using their positions as instructors for the purposes of personal gain by sourcing information from students that had no relevance to training, or having their students sign up for the app. Robertson called that hogwash.\\n\\nRobertson and Squires rejected the Article 15 and requested a court martial — which they knew was a risky course of action, given the potential for a more severe punishment. However, they said they were so confident of their innocence they wanted to fight the Article 15s, and tell their side of the story.\\n\\nIn November, they were notified that Sonntag had decided to drop their Article 15s. They were then both sent a General Order Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) — a letter of reprimand from a commander that requires zero evidence. GOMORs either stay on one's record temporarily or permanently, and if permanent, can hurt a soldier's ability to be promoted and stay in the military.\\n\\nIt's a hate letter, and you can't fight that, said Guy Womack, a military trial lawyer and analyst, about GOMORs. You can ask your commander not to put it in your permanent file…but you have no real right to due process like you do with criminal proceedings.\\n\\nHe said Sonntag likely dropped the Article 15s because he knew he would lose in a court-martial. Robertson and Squires called their bluff, and the GOMOR was a face saving measure, he said.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that's a common way to shoot someone in the back and that's what it amounts to, Womack said. I've had cases — a few of them in recent years — where the evidence was not there to convict someone of a crime, but the command believed they had done something wrong. So they say, 'We'll give you this GOMOR.' It's a common tactic.\\n\\nIn December, both Robertson and Squires received word that their GOMORs would stay on their files permanently. And just last week, both were told they were being discharged from the military within 60 days.\\n\\nBased on what? I said take it to court martial so I could have my day in my court, so I could have my voice, and give my testimony, and show how jacked up this is, and I was not given my chance to tell my side, said Squires.\\n\\nRobertson has served over 13 years in the Army, and Squires have served over 12 years. Both joined after 9/11, in 2005 and 2006, when they were 20 and 19 respectively, and have both served multiple deployments overseas. Both have three children.\\n\\nThey could care less about what we're going to do about our families and our jobs, Squires said.\\n\\nThey're even getting to the point now where they're trying to make us work very long hours just to keep a handle on us because they're worried we're going to go crazy, and they basically want us to be in the office all day long, and at the end of this, we're just going to get dropped off, out of the military, he said.\\n\\nSo I can't even go search for a job, look for a job, they're holding us, and they're just going to kick us out, no money, no paycheck, on the streets, my kids with no food, no health care, nothing, Squires added. They don't care what happens to us.\\n\\nSonntag has also come under fire for trying to punish an Army chaplain and his assistant after the chaplain said he could not conduct a marriage retreat with same sex couples due to the requirements of his chaplain-endorsing agency. Both were later exonerated.\\n\\nIt is not clear whether any of the comments in the email that Sonntag said warrant further evaluation have been addressed.\\n\\nIn response to a request for comment, U.S. Army Special Operations Command's Director of Public Affairs Lt. Col. Loren Bymer said in a statement:\\n\\nArmy Special Operations Command is predicated on high standards and character attributes that define a Soldier's service. There was not an all-inclusive investigation launched, but all allegations of misconduct were handled by commanders at the appropriate levels and adjudicated accordingly. The Special Warfare Center and School has a responsibility to ensure each soldier attending training is prepared to meet the needs of the nation now, and in the future. This includes ensuring professional instruction, consistently strenuous mental and physical standards, inclusive training, and upholding the expectation that cadre and candidates demonstrate the Army Special Operations attributes at all times.\\n\\nThe issue of standards will likely continue to be a heated topic of debate, as the military continues to integrate more women into the combat arms.\\n\\nThe Obama administration began lifting restrictions on women serving in the combat arms, and services have been slowly implementing those policies.\\n\\nThe Marine Corps, which was the most resistant, has made recent headlines for integrating a female platoon into a previously all-male battalion at Parris Island, S.C., and for its first female Marine officer graduating from the Scout Sniper Unit Leaders Course.\\n\\nAt the same time, the military is facing recruiting shortages, and an ever-increasing demand for Special Forces.\\n\\nOnly 29 percent of young Americans between 17 and 24 are eligible to meet the requirements to join the military, according to the Heritage Foundation. Only one in eight wish to serve in the military, according to the Associated Press.\\n\\nWe have some recruiting challenges, and I think the trajectory is not good over the next few years, Mark Mitchell, principal deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, said February at the 2018 Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict Symposium, according to Military.com.\\n\\nFormer Green Beret and Ultimate Fighting Champion superstar Tim Kennedy said Army recruitment challenges hit the Green Beret force especially hard.\\n\\n[For] Special Forces specifically, we are gonna have the biggest deficit of eligible… population, to select from, he said on The Joe Rogan Experience on May 17. You have to have a certain level of intelligence, a certain level of physicality, just to be eligible for Special Forces to pick you…that pool is the smallest that has ever been in history.\\n\\nSonntag himself acknowledged those challenges shortly after taking command. He said at a symposium in November 2017 that all three of the Army Special Operations regiments are facing serious challenges in force structure changes, pipeline production, and recruiting.\\n\\nWe are currently not meeting our production numbers. The restructuring of the 85th [Civil Affairs] Brigade has created an imbalanced CA force structure. And our recruitment is down. If something doesn't change soon, we will short the operational force drastically over the next five years, he said.\\n\\nRobertson said lowering standards in order to produce more Green Berets goes against a fundamental SOF truth that every Green Beret is taught.\\n\\nThey were basically telling us to not uphold standards, said Robertson. The reason they were doing that is because they were trying to make quota…In Special Forces you don't sacrifice quality for quantity."}

{"original": "Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) is dead wrong when he says that former President Donald Trump can be impeached for political speech that is protected by the First Amendment, and it speaks volumes about this unconstitutional sham of a Senate impeachment trial.\\n\\nThe Democrat House impeachment managers concluded their arguments regarding the former president on Thursday. Knowing the main points the Trump team's arguments are about to make to the Senate, lead manager Raskin included in his remarks that even if Trump's words on January 6 were protected by the First Amendment, he can still be impeached and convicted for them.\\n\\nThis is an outrage that would have been unthinkable just a few short years ago. I have already opined on why trying the impeachment of a former president is unconstitutional and what advice I would give Trump.\\n\\nBut Raskin took this sham to a new low of unconstitutionality when he argued that there is no First Amendment defense against impeachment. Actually, the Constitution is a 100 percent defense against impeachment. That goes to the heart of what impeachment is about.\\n\\nThe Constitution says that a president can be impeached only for high crimes and misdemeanors. And each senator takes an oath at an impeachment trial that the senator will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.\\n\\nThe First Amendment is part of the Constitution, which is the Supreme Law of the Land. So anything protected by the First Amendment cannot be any sort of crime because it supersedes criminal laws, and therefore any senator sworn to follow the Constitution in this trial cannot consider anything protected by a constitutional right to be criminal grounds for impeachment and conviction.\\n\\nNot all speech is protected by the First Amendment. A person cannot commit perjury by lying under oath, or impersonate a federal police officer, or lie on a tax return. Those are all crimes. The famous example is that you cannot falsely shout Fire! in a crowded theatre.\\n\\nBut that is not what Raskin said. He did not say that you cannot claim constitutional protection for criminal speech. Everyone knows that, and in fact former President Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury when he lied under oath.\\n\\nInstead Raskin said that the First Amendment cannot be a defense. That is absurd. Not all speech is protected by the First Amendment, but speech that is constitutionally protected must by definition not be any sort of criminal speech. If so, then a person saying it has exercised a constitutional right, and thus not committed a high crime or misdemeanor, and therefore cannot be impeached for it.\\n\\nJust imagine where Raskin's reasoning would take this country. If a president is a faithful Roman Catholic, devout Southern Baptist, or Orthodox Jew, whose faith teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman, and that sex is defined by biology rather than the gender a person chooses to identify with, that could run afoul of antidiscrimination laws. The correct response is that such beliefs are protected by the Free Speech Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution's First Amendment, which trumps federal and state antidiscrimination laws, and therefore are perfectly legal.\\n\\nBut under Raskin's view of impeachment, such a president could be removed from office for being an active part of that church or temple because they cannot assert any part of the First Amendment as justifying their words or actions.\\n\\nYou could make similar arguments for public officials who exercise their Second Amendment right to bear arms, or their Fourteenth Amendment rights to travel to another state (like, for example, Florida – which seems to be controversial these days). There could be legal arguments made against those officials, who could assert those constitutional rights as protecting their actions. But if the First Amendment is not a defense against impeachment, neither is it a defense of the rights guaranteed by another constitutional amendment.\\n\\nRaskin can try to argue that Trump's words fit into one of those narrow categories of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, and therefore can be illegal speech. But he cannot argue that a public official doing something that is protected by a constitutional right can somehow also be a crime that can get them removed from office.\\n\\nThe events of January 6 were terrible, and those who broke the law must be held accountable. But to claim that truth as a justification for saying that even the First Amendment cannot stand in the way of Democrats' vengeance against a former Republican president is a dangerous claim, and provides yet another reason for the Senate to acquit.\\n\\nKen Blackwell is on the policy board of the American Constitutional Rights Union and the board of directors of First Liberty Institute, and Distinguished Fellow for Human Rights and Constitutional Governance at the Family Research Council."}

{"original": "The Chinese state newspaper Global Times is warning authors of danmei, a majority female-written genre of online gay fiction, which communist government officials have banned; they are offering digital currency in exchange for reporting the vulgar content.\\n\\nGlobal Times approaches the topic from an economic standpoint, noting that outlets that have had success publishing danmei fear that they will no longer be able to profit from the content, as foreign distributors interested in buying the fiction now fear running afoul of the Chinese government.\\n\\nI was in the process of selling the adaptation rights of some of our novels and even considered bringing in investors to expand the platform. The investors initially showed great interest but after the release of the two regulations last week, they got cold feet, an anonymous owner of a danmei website told the government-controlled outlet.\\n\\nThe crackdown is part of a larger censorship system debuting last week. According to the Times, The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) made public a guideline that says all online literary platforms will be assessed annually on an 100-point scale, of which 30 points will be dedicated to 'value guidance and style of thought.'\\n\\nAll works of fiction must now reflect core socialist values and abide by moral norms.\\n\\nThe regulation demands that up to 20 points be attributed to whether the platform has provided enough literary works that reflect core socialist values, the report added, noting that the grossest violations of value guidance would be any content that questions or challenges China's communist system (serious political error).\\n\\nSAPPRFT also unveiled a new initiative in which all movie theaters in China must screen communist propaganda before the beginning of films. Television outlets must now also broadcast at least seventeen propagandistic drama series approved by the government each.\\n\\nWhile typically reflecting the Chinese government's party line and regurgitating belligerent state propaganda against the United States, the Global Times has printed comments from individuals referring to homosexuality as normal and natural, if only present among a small group of people. That remark, from a sexologist, came in response to new online censorship from the China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA), which banned pornography and vulgar tastes including abnormal sexual relations such as incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse, as well as unhealthy views on marriage such as sexual freedom and wife swapping.\\n\\nCommunist dictatorships have traditionally abused the rights of their LGBT citizens, placing them in labor camps or executing them for their counter-revolutionary behavior. China is no different; while there are no known statistics on the number of LGBT individuals killed or imprisoned under Mao Zedong, there is ample evidence of such abuse. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but instances of conversion therapy abuses persisted.\\n\\nDanmei, the gay fiction genre in question in the Times article, consists of more than consensual adult gay activity, however. Many of the stories, the New York Times reported in a 2014 story on the genre, involve abuse of men and father-son incest; though a high percentage of danmei authors are women, few of the characters created are. Some fantasies in question, the New York Times cites a scholar explaining, are meant to subconsciously subvert the state. The same year this profile surfaced, the Chinese government arrested over twenty women for participating in writing gay fiction online.\\n\\nThe crackdown on danmei is part of a broader initiative by President Xi Jinping to suppress any organic expressions of Chinese culture that the government cannot control and replace it with socialist family values. In December 2016, Xi delivered a speech calling for a new trend toward socialist family values, followed by a crackdown on dating television shows, online video that did not conform to correct political and aesthetic standards, and any media promoting Western lifestyles."}
{"original": "Conservative professor John McAdams is under threat of termination from liberal university president Michael Lovell of the Jesuit-run Marquette University. McAdams is not taking the threat lightly and has fired off a blistering letter to his boss.\\n\\nIn the lengthy letter sent to Lovell, McAdams charges the president with publicly misrepresenting various aspects of the case, violating academic freedom, and with misconduct in carrying out his duties.\\n\\nThe story began almost two years ago when McAdams publicly defended a student who was told by a teaching assistant that his Catholic views on man-woman marriage were homophobic and not welcome in her ethics class. For his defense of the student, McAdams was investigated for 17 months by a faculty committee and publicly excoriated by Lovell in his official capacity as Marquette president. Lovell summarily suspended McAdams and banished him from the campus.\\n\\nA report from the investigating faculty committee was just released and recommended McAdams be suspended without pay through the Fall 2016 semester. But Lovell has gone beyond what the faculty committee recommended and has demanded that McAdams apologize and take responsibility for subsequent email attacks on the teaching assistant. Lovell gave McAdams ten days to do this or face the revocation of his tenure and termination of his 39-year employment with Marquette.\\n\\nAt the heart of Lovell's complaint about McAdams is his charge that McAdams should be responsible for the negative emails the teaching assistant received. McAdams writes to Lovell, After posting some vitriolic emails sent by others to Ms. Abbate, you went on to tell the university that 'a professor inflicting this type of personal attack on a student' is unacceptable as if I either had a hand in these emails or launched a comparable attack on Ms. Abbate. Both implications are outrageous and you know it.\\n\\nMcAdams says that Lovell's attack on one of his own tenured professors is a strong statement that you are the one who lacks commitment to the University values you accuse me of violating.\\n\\nMcAdams also charges his boss with selective quotation from the report of the Faculty Hearing Committee and incomplete description of its conclusions. You fail to acknowledge that you are not simply implementing the recommendations of the Committee (as wrong as they are) but are going beyond them, writes McAdams.\\n\\nThe Faculty Hearing Committee actually scolded Lovell for his summary banishment of McAdams from campus as a violation of Faculty Statutes and a denial of due process. According to McAdams, The Committee found that your concern about the 'safety' of students on campus was pretextual and was, in fact, done to mollify 'public' demands (in this case, Philosophy websites like the Daily Nous) to take action against me.\\n\\nMcAdams believes that Lovell is particularly incensed that the Faculty Committee did not follow his recommendation that McAdams be fired but rather recommended only suspension and that the Committee did not recommend that McAdams confess his crimes as a condition of reinstatement, something McAdams refers to as compelled speech and compared earlier to the Inquisition.\\n\\nMcAdams says:\\n\\nI am to be suspended even though the Committee conceded there is not rule against criticizing how others conduct their classes, no rule against criticizing students, no rule against identifying students of linking to their own blogs, and the post I wrote was not vituperative or rude. If that can cause a tenured professor of thirty-nine years to be suspended or fired, it is hard to imagine how any faculty member could know when he or she is free to speak.\\n\\nMcAdams concludes:\\n\\nIf you fire me for failing to make a statement you demand, you will be committing yet another violation of the Due Process and the academic freedom provisions of the Faculty Statues. Unless you rescind your demand that I do so by April 14, 2016, I will assume that you mean what you say and that is precisely what you intend to do.\\n\\nThroughout the letter, McAdams refers to other venues where the issues will be discussed in greater detail, a not-so-subtle threat of legal action. McAdams has acquired legal counsel."}

This is a crisis due to the scourge of homosexuality, in its agents, in its motives, in its resistance to reform.\\n\\nIt is no exaggeration to say that homosexuality has become a plague in the clergy, and it can only be eradicated with spiritual weapons, he said. It is an enormous hypocrisy to condemn the abuse, claim to weep for the victims, and yet refuse to denounce the root cause of so much sexual abuse: homosexuality.\\n\\nIt is well established that homosexual predators exploit clerical privilege to their advantage, he said. But to claim the crisis itself to be clericalism is pure sophistry.\\n\\nIn 2017, Vatican police raided the apartment of a 50-year-old priest, breaking up what Italian media described as a gay orgy fueled by drugs and alcohol.

I guess it doesn't change anything for me and my mindset is still first hand with what's going on here with the Wallabies.\\n\\nIt hasn't really had an effect on me at all, so I stand firm on what I believe in and what I said.\\n\\nFolau was raised as a Mormon but he and his family switched to the Assemblies of God church in 2011.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported, the same-sex marriage debate in Australia is proving to be fiercely divisive. The postal ballot was called after the conservative government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull preferred option of a national referendum was twice rejected by the upper house.\\n\\nThe final result of the nation-wide poll will be announced on November 15.

{"original": "Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed several bills into law Tuesday, increasing the penalties for female genital mutilation.\\n\\nOf the 13 bills he signed into law, one of the bills he signed would classify female genital mutilation (FGM) in Michigan as a felony that carries a penalty of up to 15 years behind bars, the Detroit Free Press reported.\\n\\nThose who commit these horrendous crimes should be held accountable for their actions, and these bills stiffen the penalties for offenders while providing additional support to victims, Snyder said. This legislation is an important step toward eliminating this despicable practice in Michigan while empowering victims to find healing and justice.\\n\\nThe penalty under the new law is much stricter than the federal law banning the practice, which only carries a five-year prison sentence.\\n\\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the practice of FGM is seen by some Muslim sects in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East as a religious ritual and involves cutting or removing parts of female genitalia. Often, the rationale among these sects is to make women discouraged from having sex outside of marriage.\\n\\nData from UNICEF shows 98 percent of girls in Somalia and 87 percent of Egyptian girls have undergone the procedure.\\n\\nThe legislation stems from a case in which federal prosecutors charged two Detroit doctors and a physician's wife in April for allegedly performing genital cutting procedures on girls as young as seven years old.\\n\\nDr. Jumana Nagarwala was arrested April 13 for allegedly carrying out FGM procedures on multiple girls in her suburban Detroit office in Livonia, Michigan.\\n\\nA second doctor, Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, and his wife Farida Attar were also arrested the following week for allegedly acting as co-conspirators in Dr. Nagarwala's scheme.\\n\\nThe other bills signed into law permanently revoke the medical licenses of any medical practitioner who is convicted of carrying out such a practice and increase the statute of limitations to 10 years, so victims have more time to seek damages in civil lawsuits.\\n\\nABC News reports that Michigan is the 26th state to have laws on the books banning the practice. The legislation will go into effect starting in October."}

But long after her retirement she remained independent, and did not set foot inside a nursing home until she she took a hard fall at 103. According to the Deccan Chronicle, Dye walked two miles to work, four times a day, on a steep hill. But when asked about the secret to her long life, it isn't consistent daily cardio she cites.\\n\\nWhenever anyone asks her about her past romances or if she has a husband, she says, 'I've never had one, that's why I'm this age,' said her niece Diana Heaton. She says she has not had the stresses of marriage; it's tongue-in-cheek more than anything. She has always loved her clothes and has always dressed immaculately.\\n\\nNow that Dye must live somewhere she can receive assistance, Heaton said that she does still dress herself and goes into the common room and chats with people. She has a great sense of humor still, she has never lost it. Even after everything, at 106, Dye walks freely without a stick and is very independent.\\n\\nWhether it be the steak and chops she cooked for herself, her daily exercise, her complete avoidance of pubs, her fierce independence, or the lack of men, Dye seems to be doing something right.

{"original": "Prince Harry and Princess Meghan astounded the world — and the Royal family, apparently — when they announced they were giving up on their senior royal duties and decamping to Canada. In fact, Meghan has gone already — appearing to leave Harry to pick up the pieces at home.\\n\\nAnd it's a shame, because the UK really did seem ready to embrace its new American princess when the pair tied the knot in a fairytale wedding at Windsor in 2018. Furthermore, the British people really do support the monarchy and do tend to cut them a lot of slack. So what could possibly have gone wrong?\\n\\n–All those flights–\\n\\nSo, it turns out that British people really aren't that fond of hypocrisy. And one of the most obvious forms of the art this century has come from the media class, lecturing the ordinary folk on not taking flights while on jet aircraft themselves.\\n\\nMeghan — and by extension, Harry— has turned out to be an absolute master of the genre. Flying to Africa to hector the rest on climate change was a highlight — working to save the world, one private jet at a time.\\n\\nThe fact is, being a Royal is a pretty globetrotting job and folk accept that — the British monarchy is also the monarchy for 15 other Commonwealth Realms worldwide including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. Far from hating on the Queen for the flights she makes, Britons really love the modest way she also travels by train a lot, in preference to the private motorcade or helicopter, without feeling the need to lecture everyone about it.\\n\\nIndeed, the Queen often skips the more expensive Royal Train altogether these days, and is sometimes seen travelling on ordinary public commuter trains, going with only a single aide to carry her bags. Well, she is 93, after all.\\n\\n–Because stoicism is for other people–\\n\\nThe famous British stiff upper lip has taken a mighty beating in the modern era — amid the army recruiting millennial snowflakes and young men being encouraged to talk about their feelings rather than learning to regulate them like sane, well-adjusted people. It is small wonder there's any sangfroid left to shore up a civilised society at all.\\n\\nBut even so, perhaps the United Kingdom's much-reduced sense of reserve is not easy to acclimatise to if coming from the emotions-trump-facts luvvie world of Hollywood. Nobody expected Meghan Markle to break with Royal protocol in a television interview with British network ITV in 2019 to talk about how hard her life was — not least the interviewer, who appeared genuinely amazed to have his questions answered.\\n\\nDescribing marrying into one of the wealthiest, powerful, and respected families on the planet, former U.S. television actress Meghan told the documentary her life was hard and a struggle.\\n\\nSo there you go.\\n\\n'It's Hard': Meghan Markle Laments the Pressures of Royal Life https://t.co/DRk6LCAeaQ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 21, 2019\\n\\n— Going too far, too fast–\\n\\nIt may have been the case that Meghan privately believed that under the staid exterior, curly sandwiches, and luke-warm tea the British people were actually mega-woke and just praying that some forward-thinking Royal would finally bring up their children as gender-neutral.\\n\\nTalking about feeling the embryonic kicking of feminism from your unborn child and declaring you'd not have too many children because climate change — which certainly wins applause in narrow, liberal circles — just comes across as a bit odd to the majority.\\n\\n–Demanding princess treatment–\\n\\nCould there possibly be truth in the impression given that Princess Meghan expects to be treated as more Royal than the Royals?\\n\\nThe papers have run with repeated claims that Meghan has had to be told off by other Royals including Princess Catherine and the Queen herself for failing to treat members of the Royal staff with sufficient respect. That's just not the way things are done in Britain — you treat the lowliest with a respect those in other nations might reserve only for the highest, or at least you're meant to.\\n\\nIn fact, revulsion at the haughty way a growing number of well-to-do people regard those at the bottom of the ladder was one of a thousand little nudges that pushed the United Kingdom to vote for Brexit in 2016 — have no doubt. The idea that the Queen would be rude to a member of the public just rings hollow.\\n\\nThrough an entirely separate Royal scandal in the past year we now know, supposedly, that well known Royal princesses occasionally go out for dinner with their Duke fathers at local branches of entirely ordinary eatery Pizza Express. A far cry from Meghan and Harry banning their neighbours from petting their pet dogs and ordering tennis fans to put their cameras away at Wimbledon because the Princess was present — despite sitting very prominently in the Royal box for all to see.\\n\\n–She broke Prince Harry–\\n\\nPrince Harry is — was — really popular with the British people. And little wonder. He was the handsome attack-helicopter pilot who served on the front line with the infantry in Afghanistan prone to occasional silly decisions (extremely questionable fancy dress choices and turning up naked at a pool party, for instance). He was the man who tragically lost his mother at a young age in the public eye and has devoted much of his adult life to charity work.\\n\\nThe well of public sympathy for Harry in Britain is deep.\\n\\nAnd yet, rightly or wrongly, the public has perceived a sudden change in the party Prince in a very short space of time, and Princess Meghan being at the helm during that adjustment.\\n\\nCountry pursuits are a key part of the social calendar for the family Meghan married into — yet Harry made headlines in 2017 when he declined to attend the Royal family's traditional Christmas shoot. This reportedly was to please his flexitarian activist then-fiancée.\\n\\nHarry once took his military roles very seriously. But now the British tabloid press reports the Royal Marines, who he enjoys the honour of leading, haven't heard from him in months. What is going on?\\n\\n— Because Britain's really racist–\\n\\nYeah, not really.\\n\\nIn fact, it is the American mainstream media which made such a meal out of ethnicity, not the British. And yet North America is where the couple is heading.\\n\\nIn a survey at the time she became a princess, Meghan was more popular in the UK than a whole host of royals, including the heir to the throne, Prince Charles. If British people were just interested in how light someone's skin was, you might expect that to be the other way around.\\n\\nAnother piece of research at the time found the British people were extremely relaxed about the whole thing — 79 per cent said they were fine with a Royal marrying a foreigner, 78 per cent were cool with a divorcee, 69 per cent had no objection to different ethnicity. In fact, the only area that didn't have overwhelmingly majority support was whether a royal could have a gay marriage or not, and even then more supported than opposed, at 44-to-41 with 15 per cent don't knows.\\n\\nThis and many other reasons is why James Delingpole points out that the United Kingdom is a country more comfortable with race than many others in the west. Despite what certain pedlars of agitprop and alleged racism would claim otherwise."}
{"original": "Prominent evangelical pastor Franklin Graham said Sunday that LGBTQ activists are trying to ban the truth of the Gospel from British society by having him barred from preaching in the UK.\\n\\nIn parallel posts on Facebook and Twitter, Rev.

Graham has not hesitated to voice his disagreement with the 2015 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to impose same-sex marriage on the nation in Obergefell v. Hodges. Appealing to biblical morality, Graham has continued to assert that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, which was the predominant belief of humanity for all of history.\\n\\nIn his dissent from Obergefell, Justice Samuel Alito presciently wrote that the decision would be used to hurt Americans who may not share a contemporary view of marriage as a malleable, fluid arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons.\\n\\nIt will be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy, he wrote.\\n\\nIn his Facebook post Sunday, Rev. Graham cites Australian Martyn Iles who asks if society has become so 'tolerant' that it is now intolerant of mainstream Christianity.\\n\\nThis is really a fight for truth, and the Gospel is what is really being 'banned' from these venues, Graham writes. It really boils down to the fact that they disagree with the message.\\n\\nSpeaking the truth of Christianity to people, even when the message is unwelcome, is love speech, Graham asserts, the opposite of hate speech.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

{"original": "Former vice president Joe Biden offered a hint of his strategy for an impending 2020 presidential run on Friday, telling reporters that he is not moderate, but that the progressive wing of the party is further left than its voters.\\n\\nBiden's remarks were an effort to establish his ideological credentials — and also a challenge to his rivals, especially Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), all of whom have adopted far-left policies in the early days of the Democratic primary.\\n\\nBiden spoke to reporters in Washington, DC, after addressing the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers:\\n\\nREPORTER: Mr Vice President, you said two weeks ago that you said you were the most progressive person in the Democratic Party — BIDEN: No, I said liberal. I didn't say progressive. REPORTER: You said progressive, sir. BIDEN: Well, here's the point. That's changing too. For my whole career, I wish had been labeled in Delaware for the seven times I ran as a moderate. I was never labeled as a moderate. And if you look at my record with the ACLU, if you look at my record with all of the traditional liberal organizations, I' have never walked away from — I'm not sure when everyone else came out and said they are for gay marriage, I'm not sure when everyone else came out and talked about a lot of things I talked about. But my point is, is the definition of progressive now seems to be changing. That is, Are you a socialist? Well, that's a real progressive. Or you believe in, whatever. So I was talking about up until this last time around the traditional judgments of whether or not you were, quote, a liberal, was whether or not — what your positions on race were; on women; what's your position on LGBT community; what's your positions on civil liberties, you know. I'll stack my record on those things against anybody who'se even run, who's running now, or who will run. REPORTER: But sir, are you suggesting the party is moving too far to the left? BIDEN: No — REPORTER: Can you win in a primary? BIDEN: We'll find out if I can win in a primary. But let me say one last thing. Here's the deal. I think you guys, if you look at all the polling data and look at the actual results, the party has not moved to the way — however you — I don't want to characterize it, whatever characterization you just made. The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense. … So the idea the Democratic Party has sort of stood on its head, I don't get it. And by the way, we should welcome, the party should welcome this — I don't know how you want to characterize it, the progressive left. It should be welcome. We should have a debate about these things. That's not a bad thing. But the idea, all of a sudden, the Democratic Party woke up, you know, everybody asked me now, what kind of Democrat — I'm an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. And I'm proud of it. Thank you.\\n\\nIn effect, Biden was saying: I have never been a 'moderate,' and I am a 'progressive,' which used to be understood as 'liberal.' But today, the definition of 'progressive' has become 'socialist.' That's not what I am, and it's not what the party's voters are. They are 'liberal' or 'moderate', the same coalition that elected Barack Obama and myself, twice.\\n\\nBiden has not officially announced that he is running for president, but his candidacy is imminent.

Three years before marrying the former Nancy Barbato, he had landed a 15-minute radio show on local station WAAT.\\n\\nDuring the marriage's early years, the Sinatras lived in a modest apartment in Jersey City, where their two eldest children were born. For a time she was employed as a secretary while her husband worked as a singing waiter.\\n\\nAfter Sinatra became a pop-music sensation in the 1940s, the couple moved to Los Angeles, where the singer would also become a movie star, raconteur, man about town and notorious womanizer.\\n\\nNancy Sinatra left Frank after his affair with actress Ava Gardner became public knowledge.

{"original": "UPDATE: The candidate, Colonel Bob Starr, finally responded to questions about his advocacy for LGBT rights. He spoke with a local Abilene affiliate and stated that he felt the term activist was a misrepresentation of his views. He stated, I believe and strongly support traditional marriage, but as commander of Dyess Air Force Base, my job was to enforce the law and not discriminate against anyone who made different lifestyle choices than the ones that I agreed with, Col. Starr says. All I had to do was make sure that homosexual airmen were not discriminated against. That's what changed in the law in 2011.\\n\\nThe candidate, however, did not explain or address the discrepancy between making everyone feel welcomed and his having worn gay pride clothing sprinkled in rainbow paint coupled with his active participation and promotion in and of gay fun runs.\\n\\nThe original article follows:\\n\\nQuestions were raised at a candidate forum in Lubbock, Texas, about West Texas conservatives lining up behind a GOP candidate for Congress who actively and recently supported, promoted, and participated in gay pride events. The candidate, Colonel Bob Starr, can be seen in a number of photos wearing gay pride clothing, throwing his arms in the air as a champion in gay pride runs, and even wearing a rainbow painted gay pride shirt.\\n\\nA long list of West Texas conservatives who have endorsed the active promoter of gay rights can be found on Col. Starr's campaign website, though it is unclear whether they are aware of Starr's gay activism due to Starr not mentioning it on any of his campaign materials.\\n\\nDuring a VFW congressional candidate forum in Lubbock Friday night, Jason Corley, Republican candidate for CD19, asked about why we are supporting gay rights at Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene. The question appeared to have been aimed at fellow candidate, retired Air Force Colonel Michael Bob Starr. Colonel Starr was formerly commander of the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess AFB, according to his official USAF biography.\\n\\nStarr did not address the question which came at the very end of the forum, Corley told Breitbart Texas in an interview. He asked it because he is concerned about the military being used for social engineering. He said he also asked about the possibility of women being required to register for the draft and why taxpayers should be required to fund gender selection surgeries for transgender people serving on active duty.\\n\\nWhile Starr did not answer the questions, it appears he has been very active in supporting gay rights groups on his base. Photos, like the one above from a 2014 Dyess Pride running event and the photo below from a 2015 Pride Alliance 5K Color Run held last summer, show the Colonel not only approved of the gay organizations but actively engaged in their event–with great enthusiasm and pride. The photo below shows Colonel Starr wearing a gay pride t-shirt painted in rainbow colors.\\n\\nCorley said it raises questions about just how much people know about this candidate. We know he served in the Air Force, and I appreciate that, Corley told Breitbart Texas in a phone interview on Saturday. But, what else do we know about him. This is an agricultural region and we need candidate who knows ag. We don't need another Neugebauer.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama ended the military's ban on gays openly serving in the military in September 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported.\\n\\nThe colonel and Dyess AFB seem actively involved in the business of promoting the social engineering project underway. In July 2014, the Dyess AFB official newspaper published an article from Col. Starr's own public affairs office promoting Progression, acceptance and our LGBT Airmen.\\n\\nOn-base gay rights groups like Pride Alliance appear very grateful about the support given to their groups by Col. Starr. In May 2015, Senior Airman James Rogers told the Abilene Reporter-News that the Pride Alliance is constantly involved across Dyess and occasionally in the Abilene community as a whole. We're the first LGBT support group on Dyess, he told the Reporter-News. The atmosphere of acceptance, from Col. Starr to the new Airmen Basics has been great. They've put an emphasis on changing. You can see with us out here, we're here because we have the support to be out here.\\n\\nThe group sponsored a 5K run in July 2015 in honor of LGBT Pride Month.\\n\\nCorely also expressed concern about special interest money that has shown up in the race. Money from a PAC named Conservative Texans has made massive contributions to the Starr campaign, according to FEC filings.\\n\\nColonel Starr's participation with the gay rights group events is not apparent on either his campaign website or his Facebook page.\\n\\nBreitbart Texas reached out to Colonel Starr for comment, but has not received any comment or explanation at the time of this article's publication.\\n\\nBob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

{"original": "A Texas Supreme Court Justice has issued a dissenting opinion stating that while the U.S. Supreme Court has declared that same-sex couples may marry, the U.S. Constitution does not necessarily require cities to offer benefits to same-sex spouses of employees. While marriage may be a fundamental right, spousal benefits are not. He says that the same constitutional strict scrutiny does not apply to employment benefits.\\n\\nJustice John Divine issued a dissenting opinion to the Texas Supreme Court's denial of the petition for review in the case of Jack Pidgeon and Larry Hicks v. Mayor Sylvester Turner and City of Houston.\\n\\nThe decision by the state's highest court to not review the lower court's decision, let stand a ruling that cities cannot deprive married same-sex couples the benefits it provides to opposite-sex couples. Devine disagreed with his colleagues and wrote that the court should have heard the case.\\n\\nMarriage is a fundamental right. Spousal benefits are not, Devine wrote in his dissent from the denial of the petition for review. Thus, the two issues are distinct, with sharply contrasting standards for review.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was brought by two Houston taxpayers prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges. The decision granted same-sex marriage rights across the country. The Houston lawsuit was aimed to stop cities like Houston, from granting employee benefits to same-sex couples who were married in a state that recognized gay marriage when Texas law did not. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and granted a temporary injunction blocking the City's actions.\\n\\nThe Obergefell decision was issued prior to the Court of Appeals hearing and was cited by the Court as it overturned the trial court's injunction.\\n\\nIn his dissent, Devine wrote:\\n\\nObergefell concerned access to marriage, not an Equal Protection challenge to the allocation of employment benefits. The court of appeals apparently assumed that, if the Supreme Court concluded no government interest justifies recognizing marriage as only between couples of the opposite sex, then no interest justifies offering different benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex spouses of City employees. But, as discussed below, marriage—not spousal employment benefits—is a fundamental right, and laws limiting access to a fundamental right receive stricter scrutiny than laws distributing government benefits. As the majority in Obergefell recognized, 'the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change' when fundamental rights are not at stake.\\n\\nJustice Devine continued:\\n\\n(C)laims by same-sex spouses of City employees to employment benefits do not enjoy the benefit of strict scrutiny. Indeed, in Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court considered whether a law denying special protections to homosexuals had 'a rational relation to some legitimate end.'\\n\\nDevine urged that the state has an interest in encouraging procreation and that offering benefits to opposite-sex couples would encourage procreation within marriage.\\n\\nAfter all, benefits such as health insurance provide financial security as couples decide whether to have a child. An opposite-sex marriage is the only marital relationship where children are raised by their biological parents. In any other relationship, the child must be removed from at least one natural parent, perhaps two, before being adopted by her new parent(s). This does not diminish any child's inherent dignity, a fact the City presumably recognizes by extending benefits to their employees' children regardless of the employees' marital status. But it does explain why the State might choose to direct resources to opposite-sex couples.\\n\\nDevine concludes his 11-page dissent stating:\\n\\nTexas, as it allocates benefits to employees' spouses, may recognize the differences between same- and opposite-sex spouses. To withhold this decision from the people is to undermine precedent, democracy, and the limited role of courts in our nation. It bears repeating that the Supreme Court in Obergefell embraced 'democracy [as] the appropriate process for change, so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights.' I would take the Court at its word. Because the court of appeals did not, I respectfully dissent to the denial of the petition for review.\\n\\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

He made the remarks during his tenure at MSNBC (2005-2008) and his tenure at Fox (2009-present).\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, Carlson shared a statement to Twitter refusing to apologize and instead invited his detractors to debate him on his popular program. Media Matters caught me saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago, said Carlson. Rather than express the usual ritual contrition, how about this: I'm on television every weeknight live for an hour, Carlson continued. If you want to know what I think, you can watch. Anyone who disagrees with my views is welcome to come on and explain why.\\n\\nIn 2009, Carlson called the charges against Jeff bullshit, arguing that arranging a marriage between a 16-year-old and a 27-year-old is not the same as pulling a stranger off the street and raping her.\\n\\nI am not defending underage marriage at all — I just don't think it's the same thing exactly as pulling a child from a bus stop and sexually assaulting that child… The rapist, in this case, has made a lifelong commitment to live and take care of the person, so it is a little different. I mean, let's be honest about it, he told host Todd Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.\\n\\nDuring another segment, Carlson recalls a story regarding a teacher who had allegedly molested a 13-year-old student nearly 30 times in one week. In response, the shock jock asks Carlson if he was physically capable of enduring such unwanted advances or do you take your hat off to this kid? Carlson replied: So my point is that teachers like this, not necessarily this one in particular, but they are doing a service to all 13-year-old girls by taking the pressure off. They are a pressure relief valve, like the kind you have on your furnace.\\n\\nIn the compilation video, Carlson is also heard proposing eliminating rape shield laws, arguing that it gives the accuser all of the power. During other segments, he described socialite Paris Hilton and pop singer Britney Spears as two of the biggest white whores in America, and called Alexis Stewart, the daughter of Martha Stewart, c*nty.\\n\\nLaura Keiter, a communications director for Media Matters, said in a statement to TheWrap: Anyone remotely familiar with Tucker Carlson won't be surprised by the misogyny. But what's striking about these clips is that it comes off as so natural and normal for him; it's like you're getting a chance to see who Tucker Carlson really is and what those ideas really mean. The clips provide insight into the misogyny of his current Fox News show.\\n\\nFox News has not issued a statement on the unearthed video."}

{"original": "With Miami signing journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick on Sunday, it's perhaps a long-shot QB Colin Kaepernick will be joining the Dolphins.\\n\\nAccording to a report last week from CBS' Jason La Canfora, the free agent QB has his eye on the Dolphins' QB opening. Miami traded long-time starter Ryan Tannehill to the Tennessee Titans last week.\\n\\nReached out to source close to @Kaepernick7 and asked if he was interested in filling Miami QB vacancy. Was told 'yes, he's training hard and ready to play' could get interesting. La Canfora tweeted on March 15.\\n\\nOther reporters were pushing for the Dolphins to sign the quarterback who started the anthem-kneeling movement to protest police brutality and social injustice, and recently settled his collusion lawsuit against the NFL.\\n\\nOne reporter who thinks Kaepernick to Miami might be a good fit is San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler.\\n\\nDolphins owner Stephen Ross is a maverick, wrote Ostler on March 16. He was the lone dissenting vote among NFL owners on the Raiders' move to Las Vegas. Ross is founder of the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality, which champions social justice and fights racial discrimination.\\n\\nAlso: Brian Flores, the Dolphins' new head coach, is black. Not that every black person or every black coach supports Kaepernick and his cause. But Flores grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, so he might be more sensitive to racial injustice than the average coach, and less likely to be a protest hater.\\n\\nHowever, the potential problem with a Kaepernick-Miami marriage, might be the Cuban community in South Florida.\\n\\nIn a post-game press conference in 2016, Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, wore a T-shirt with a photo of Malcolm X and Fidel Castro meeting in 1960.\\n\\nFlorida has an enormous Cuban population, estimated at 1.5 million. Many of whom fled Cuba after Castro took over the country. A lot of Cubans live in Miami and the South Florida region, which is the Dolphins' market.\\n\\nAfter the communist dictator took over in 1959, the Miami Herald reports, 5,000 or so (were) executed in the immediate aftermath of Castro's 1959 takeover — sometimes after kangaroo-court trials.\\n\\nMany more political prisoners have been killed and imprisoned since them. Fidel Castro died in 2016. However, his dictatorial style still dominates the island nation, under the rule of his brother Raul.\\n\\nLong-time Miami Herald sportswriter Armando Salguero, who was born in Cuban imprisonment before his family eventually fled to the United States, grilled Kaepernick on that T-shirt late in the 2016 season, before a 49ers-Dolphins game.\\n\\nOne thing Fidel Castro did do is they have the highest literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here even though we're fully capable of doing that, Kaepernick told Salguero.\\n\\nSalguero wrote in response to this quote:\\n\\nIs this real life? First, Cuba does not have the highest literacy rate. Second, don't be surprised if the same people who report Cuba's admittedly high literacy rate are related to those who report its election results — the ones in which the Castros get 100 percent of the votes. Third, could it be Cuba doesn't have to invest a lot in its prison system because, you know, dungeons and firing squads (El Paredon) are not too expensive to maintain?\\n\\nSo Kaepernick to Miami, as some in the media are pushing, might not be a good idea.\\n\\nUnless the Dolphins want to risk turning off their Cuban fan base, which is considerable."}
{"original": "Medicaid is gently carrying tens of thousands of healthy Americans to their early deaths each year, according to analysts who are trying to explain the massive and unprecedented spike in deaths among middle-aged Americans in post-industrial America.\\n\\nWhen I last wrote about the increased mortality rates among lower- and middle-class whites, I suggested the welfare state played a significant role in creating the death wave. Now, in a massive and extensively researched article for Commentary, Nicholas Eberstadt shows how Medicaid is funding the gateway drugs — opioid prescription painkillers — which lead people towards deadly heroin and early death.\\n\\nEberstadt quotes from the award-winning 2016 book Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic by Sam Quinones. As one passage in Dreamland explains:\\n\\n[The Medicaid card] pays for medicine—whatever pills a doctor deems that the insured patient needs. Among those who receive Medicaid cards are people on state welfare or on a federal disability program known as SSI. . . . If you could get a prescription from a willing doctor—and Portsmouth had plenty of them—Medicaid health-insurance cards paid for that prescription every month. For a three-dollar Medicaid co-pay, therefore, addicts got pills priced at thousands of dollars, with the difference paid for by U.S. and state taxpayers. A user could turn around and sell those pills, obtained for that three-dollar co-pay, for as much as ten thousand dollars on the street.\\n\\nIn 21st-century America, 'dependence on government' has thus come to take on an entirely new meaning, Eberstadt sardonically observes.\\n\\nKeeping in mind that one of Obamacare's undeclared goals – arguably the only part of the program that actually worked – was the radical expansion of Medicaid, Eberstadt's citation of 2013 Census Bureau data is sobering: 21 percent of all civilian men between 25 and 55 years of age are now Medicaid beneficiaries.\\n\\nFurther, a jaw-dropping 57 percent of non-working white males in the same age bracket are now collecting disability benefits. Some of them are receiving benefits from multiple government programs. Almost half of the men who have dropped out of the labor force are taking some form of pain medication on a daily basis, according to a 2016 study cited in the article.\\n\\nEberstadt explains what that means in socio-economic terms:\\n\\nDisability checks and means-tested benefits cannot support a lavish lifestyle. But they can offer a permanent alternative to paid employment, and for growing numbers of American men, they do. The rise of these programs has coincided with the death of work for larger and larger numbers of American men not yet of retirement age. We cannot say that these programs caused the death of work for millions upon millions of younger men: What is incontrovertible, however, is that they have financed it—just as Medicaid inadvertently helped finance America's immense and increasing appetite for opioids in our new century.\\n\\nPrinceton economics professors Angus Deaton and Anne Case calculate that if the death rate among middle-aged whites had continued to decline at the rate it fell between 1979 and 1998, half a million deaths would have been avoided over the years from 1999 through 2013. That, they note, is about the same number of deaths as those caused by AIDS through 2015, writes the New York Times.\\n\\nPerhaps the major reason that the White Death has been so baffling for the experts is that they can't believe that their benevolent government programs are playing a central role in this national catastrophe.\\n\\nElsewhere in Eberstadt's article, he looks at the failure of the Obama economy to provide opportunities for advancement – which in turn was the acceleration of job-market trends that date back to the end of the dot-com boom in the Nineties – and the calcification of both social and physical mobility. As other sources cited in my previous article argued, the welfare state has largely eliminated the incentives for people to move away from disadvantaged areas.\\n\\nAt the same time, the boundless opportunity represented by the pursuit of the American Dream doesn't look so boundless anymore. The lower-middle-class man no longer fears hunger and deprivation, nor does he see a glittering prize to reach for with extraordinary effort. Nothing to run from, and nothing to climb towards: it's no surprise that so many have stopped running or climbing.\\n\\nEberstadt also briefly touches on the hollowing out of the civil society resources which normally cope with stress and loss:\\n\\nWe already knew from other sources (such as BLS time use surveys) that the overwhelming majority of the prime-age men in this un-working army generally don't do civil society (charitable work, religious activities, volunteering), or for that matter much in the way of child care or help for others in the home either, despite the abundance of time on their hands. Their routine, instead, typically centers on watching—watching TV, DVDs, Internet, hand-held devices, etc.—and indeed watching for an average of 2,000 hours a year, as if it were a full-time job.\\n\\nThe Left has largely accomplished its grand 50-year mission, destroying the nuclear family, organized religion, and masculine values such as self-reliance, leaving many dependent on government functionaries for sustenance and hope. We aren't supposed to be competitive anymore, and we aren't meant to feel even a twinge of shame about long-term dependency on welfare programs or about dropping by the local Medicaid clinic for more pain pills. We have been strictly instructed to place no particular value on traditional marriage — not for its role in healthy child-rearing, or for the vital and different benefits it brings to men and women.\\n\\nThe old-fashioned civil-society resources of church and family have withered under relentless assault from the Left, which seeks to replace all other social institutions with the worship of and dependency upon the benevolent State. The result is a wave of young and middle-aged people with nothing in their lives to inspire or sustain them, leading to a growing dependency on drugs, often beginning with prescription medication and moving on to illicit substances like heroin.\\n\\nThe result is a wave of young and middle-aged people whose adult prospects are turned off, who tune out from their local civic society, who have nothing in their lives to inspire or sustain them, so they accept the federal government's invite to drop by the Medicaid clinic for the temporary fix of cheap prescription medication, until they eventually kill themselves with stronger, deadlier heroin.\\n\\nThe entire government-funded sequence is a grim update of Timothy Leary's infamous 1966 advice for the counter-culture: turn off, tune out, drop in, and then die off."}
{"original": "Rachel Fulton Brown, a professor of Medieval Studies at the University of Chicago, has come under fire for a blog post that she wrote in 2015, entitled Three Cheers for White Men.\\n\\nHer 2015 blog post, Three Cheers for White Men, argues that white men have played a role in the development of certain rights enjoyed by women throughout the Western world. In the post, Fulton highlights specifically chivalry and courtly love, the development of marriage into a sacrament valid only if both men and women consented and elements of feminism, which were supported by philosophers like John Stuart Mill.\\n\\nBut some in Fulton Brown's field consider her scholarship and more specifically, blog posts like this one, to be a threat. Dorothy Kim, a professor at Vassar College, responded to Fulton Brown's work by highlighting that nefarious white nationalist groups often idealize medieval history because of the esteemed role that white men played during the historical period.\\n\\nIf the medieval past (globally) is being weaponized for the aims of extreme, violent supremacist groups, what are you doing, medievalists, in your classrooms? she wrote. Because you are the authorities teaching medieval subjects in the classroom, you are, in fact, ideological arms dealers.\\n\\nThe takeaway from Kim's response is that medieval studies scholars, now more than ever, must adopt forceful anti-racism positions, as to ensure that Neutrality is not optional, she added.\\n\\nHow are you signaling in your classroom that you are not upholding white supremacy when you are teaching the subject loved by white supremacists? Kim wrote. Neutrality may have worked in a distant past when white supremacists/KKK/white nationalists/Nazis were some imagined fringe group, but that is not going to work now.\\n\\nAccording to Fulton Brown's blog, Kim encouraged other scholars in the medieval studies community to condemn Fulton Brown's scholarship. She criticized Fulton Brown for her past contribution to Breitbart News and for her relationship with former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos.\\n\\nOn August 28, Kim published a blog post entitled, Teaching Medieval Studies in a Time of White Supremacy, which suggested that white supremacist attitudes are rampant in the United States in 2017.\\n\\nResponding to the post, Fulton Brown argues that Kim doesn't understand the field of medieval studies.\\n\\nI have never met Professor Kim; perhaps she does not attend the meetings of the Medieval Academy. But what I know from what she has written about me is this: Professor Kim wants you to be afraid. I don't. I want – like Mary – for you to know that you are loved and that God so loved the world that he gave his Son in sacrifice that the world might be remade. How should you signal that you are not a white supremacist if you teach the medieval western European Christian past? Learn some f*cking medieval western European Christian history, including the history of our field.**\\n\\nThe University of Chicago administration, specifically the Dean of Social Sciences, vigorously defended Professor Fulton Brown's right to express herself online. This defense adheres to the principles laid out in the Report on the Committee on Freedom of Expression at the University of Chicago, which explains that the views of their faculty will not be suppressed even if others find such views to be immoral or offensive.\\n\\nThe University's fundamental commitment is the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose.\\n\\nIn a separate statement, senior members of the Department of History defended Fulton Brown's right to express herself. The current debate about race and medieval history is playing out, as it should, in the public arena, and it is up to the participants to make their arguments and draw their own conclusions, the statement reads. It is essential to uphold the value of free speech in that context, especially when it is controversial or unpopular."}
{"original": "The UK scientist whose doomsday predictions triggered a massive lockdown on both sides of the Atlantic has resigned his government advisory position, amid claims he broke the strict lockdown rules he pushed to meet his married lover.\\n\\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist of Imperial College, London resigned from his role as a senior scientific advisor to the British government Tuesday evening.\\n\\nHe became known as professor lockdown after his alarming data modelling predicted huge casualties for the populations of the United Kingdom and the United States unless they enacted severe curbs on individual freedoms to lock the nations down. While the moves were criticised by senior legal figures as approaching a police state, Professor Ferguson's advice was nevertheless heeded by the government in March.\\n\\nDelingpole: Why Must Coronavirus Decision Makers be Clouded in Secrecy? https://t.co/etEWwdqpBI — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 23, 2020\\n\\nWhile Professor Ferguson frequently appeared in the media to defend his work and to tell the public not to break the lockdown rules, he was himself spectacularly breaking them in secret, according to a report in Britain's Daily Telegraph, which claims the hard-line scientist was meeting his married lover.\\n\\nThe paper names Antonia Staats, a married mother, who was quarantined with her family at a separate address to the professor. Breaching the terms of the lockdown — as enforced by police — she travelled to Ferguson's own home on at least two occasions, the paper claims.\\n\\nStaats, who is identified as a left-wing activist, was said to be in an open marriage, The Telegraph claimed. Posts on Staat's public Facebook page show strong left-wing themes, including paid activism as an employee of a campaign group, encouraging tactical voting in the last general election to oppose the Conservative party, and hard green activism.\\n\\nAdmitting his error, Professor Ferguson told the paper:\\n\\nI accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in Sage [the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]. I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The Government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.\\n\\nThe professor is not the first government scientific figure forced to resign after taking a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do posture to the general public. Breitbart London reported in April when the chief scientific advisor for Scotland resigned her position after ordering citizens to obey the lockdown measures while breaking them herself in public.\\n\\nWhile Britons have been ordered to stay in their normal residences and not travel to their country homes in hope of enjoying a more comfortable and less cramped lockdown period, Dr Catherine Calderwood was photographed travelling to her country home. She received a police warning after being exposed in a national newspaper and resigned shortly afterwards.\\n\\nMonica Lennon, health spokesman for Scottish Labour, remarked that Calderwood's actions were extremely disappointing and hypocritical, and asked: If the Chief Medical Officer can't lead by example what chance do we have of convincing people to stay at home?\\n\\nIn New Zealand, the government's health minister was demoted after ignoring his own advice. Dr David Clark was photographed going for a country bike ride, and subsequently drove his family to the beach to go surfing. Reflecting on his breaking the advice of his own department, Dr Clark noted: I've been an idiot."}

{"original": "A six-justice majority has extended homosexual rights to same-sex couples by ordering the state of Arkansas to allow a non-related or same-sex spouse be named as the second parent on a child's birth certificate, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer.\\n\\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissented in a decision that reverses what until now was a space on one's birth certificate reserved for the opposite-sex spouse. Both the majority and minority opinions held opposing views on whether the Arkansas law reserves the parental space on the birth certificate for biological parents.\\n\\nWhen a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples 'the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage' … we reverse the state court's judgment.\\n\\nThe State uses those certificates to give married parents a form of legal recognition that is not available to unmarried parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not, consistent with Obergefell, deny married same-sex couples that recognition.\\n\\nWriting for the dissenting justices, Gorsuch wrote, in part:\\n\\nTo be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a State must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether §20–18–401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go. The statute in ques- tion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Oberge- fell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders. In an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state supreme court agreed. And it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the Constitution. To the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this Court's prec- edents suggest just the opposite conclusion.\\n\\nThe statute in question establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Obergefell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders.\\n\\nThe question before the court in Pavan v. Smith was whether a state violates the 14th Amendment by denying married same-sex couples the same right afforded to married opposite-sex couples under state law to have the name of the birth mother's spouse entered as the second parent on their child's birth certificate.\\n\\nIn this case, according to court documents, the respondents, who were the plaintiffs in the lower-court action, are three female same-sex married couples and their children. One spouse in each married couple gave birth to a child.\\n\\nWhen the Department of Health declined to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed as parents, respondents filed suit in circuit court seeking a declaration that petitioner's refusal to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed violated their constitutional rights, as well as a declaration that certain statutory provisions were unconstitutional. Respondents also sought to enjoin enforcement of petitioner's policy against naming both spouses on the birth certificate under these circumstances and an order requiring petitioner to issue corrected birth certificates naming both spouses."}

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) paying her husband's consulting firm $2.8 million during her campaign for a House seat.\\n\\nConservative congressmembers filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and now hope to prohibit enriching relatives through the campaigning process.\\n\\nFor too long, lawmakers of both political parties have engaged in the ethically dubious practice of pocketing campaign funds by 'hiring' their spouses and laundering the money as campaign-related expenses, Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-WI) said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Washington Times reported on the bill:\\n\\n[Omar] told supporters after the election that she would cut ties with E Street Group, headed by her husband Tim Mynett, to avoid any perceived issue, but the sponsors of the legislation said that the problem is bigger than any single candidate. The Oversight for Members and Relatives Act would prohibit candidates for federal office from compensating spouses who work on campaigns and require disclosure of any direct or indirect payments made to spouses or immediate family members, including children, parents, siblings and in-laws. At least two top Democrats could be predisposed to support the measure: A similar measure sponsored by Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat, was approved by the House in 2007 with the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nSchiff said in a 2007 press release that candidates run for federal office to serve the public, not to financially profit from the campaign.\\n\\nThere have been too many reports of corruption and abuse in Congress over the last few years, and the passage of this bill with bipartisan support marks an important step forward in restoring the public's confidence that elected officials are working in the public's interest and not their own, Schiff said at the time. Candidates run for federal office to serve the public, not to financially profit from the campaign.\\n\\nTiffany said the OMAR Act was indeed based on Schiff's Campaign Expenditure Transparency Act.\\n\\nIt is outrageous and inappropriate for Members of Congress to convert campaign donations to personal funds in this way, Tiffany said. It feeds public perceptions of corruption, undermines public trust in Congress, and must come to an end.\\n\\nRep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) called what Omar and others have done despicable.\\n\\nLoopholes that allow members of Congress to funnel campaign funds to their spouses are despicable and erode trust in our government, Gallagher said. There's simply no logical reason for allowing this practice to continue, and I'm proud to join Rep. Tiffany in this common-sense effort to ensure members can't profit off running for Congress.\\n\\nThe Times reported:\\n\\nA 2013 analysis by USA Today found that 32 members of Congress had doled out more than $2 million to relatives who staffed their campaigns in the 2012 election. One of the biggest recipients was the wife of Rep.

{"original": "NEW YORK (AP) — Brian Dennehy, the burly actor who started in films as a macho heavy and later in his career won plaudits for his stage work in plays by William Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller, has died. He was 81.\\n\\nDennehy died Wednesday night of natural causes in New Haven, Connecticut, according to Kate Cafaro of ICM Partners, the actor's representatives.\\n\\nKnown for his broad frame, booming voice and ability to play good guys and bad guys with equal aplomb, Dennehy won two Tony Awards, a Golden Globe and was nominated for six Emmys. He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2010.\\n\\nTributes came from Hollywood and Broadway, including from Lin-Manuel Miranda, who said he saw Dennehy twice onstage and called the actor a colossus. Actor Michael McKean said Dennehy was brilliant and versatile, a powerhouse actor and a very nice man as well. Dana Delany, who appeared in a movie with Dennehy, said: They don't make his kind anymore.\\n\\nAmong his 40-odd films, he played a sheriff who jailed Rambo in First Blood, a serial killer in To Catch a Killer, and a corrupt sheriff gunned down by Kevin Kline in Silverado. He also had some benign roles: the bartender who consoles Dudley Moore in 10 and the levelheaded leader of aliens in Cocoon and its sequel.\\n\\nEventually Dennehy wearied of the studio life. Movies used to be fun, he observed in an interview. They took care of you, first-class. Those days are gone.\\n\\nDennehy had a long connection with Chicago's Goodman Theater, which had a reputation for heavy drama. He appeared in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo in 1986 and later Chekhov's Cherry Orchard at far lower salaries than he earned in Hollywood. In 1990 he played the role of Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, a play he reprised at the Goodman with Nathan Lane in 2012 and in Brooklyn in 2013.\\n\\nIn 1998, Dennehy appeared on Broadway in the classic role of Willy Loman, the worn-out hustler in Miller's Death of a Salesman and won the Tony for his performance.\\n\\nWhat this actor goes for is close to an everyman quality, with a grand emotional expansiveness that matches his monumental physique, wrote Ben Brantley in his review of the play for The New York Times. Yet these emotions ring so unerringly true that Mr. Dennehy seems to kidnap you by force, trapping you inside Willy's psyche.\\n\\nHe was awarded another Tony in 2003 for his role in O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. At the podium, after thanking his family, co-stars and producers and complementing his competitors, he said: The words of Eugene O'Neill — they've got to be heard. They've got to be heard, and heard and heard. And thank you so much for giving us the chance to enunciate them.\\n\\nDennehy was born July 9, 1938, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the first of three sons. His venture into acting began when he was 14 in New York City and a student at a Brooklyn high school. He acted the title role in Macbeth. He played football on a scholarship at Columbia University, and he served five years in the U.S. Marines.\\n\\nBack in New York City in 1965, he pursued acting while working at side jobs. I learned first-hand how a truck driver lives, what a bartender does, how a salesman thinks, he told The New York Times in 1989. I had to make a life inside those jobs, not just pretend.\\n\\nHis parents — Ed Dennehy, an editor for The Associated Press in New York, and Hannah Dennehy, a nurse — could never understand why his son chose to act. Anyone raised in a first or second generation immigrant family knows that you are expected to advance the ball down the field, Dennehy told Columbia College Today in 1999. Acting didn't qualify in any way.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-3-inch Dennehy went to Hollywood for his first movie, Semi-Tough starring Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristofferson. Dennehy was paid $10,000 a week for 10 week's work, which he thought looked like it was all the money in the world.\\n\\nAmong his films: Looking for Mr. Goodbar, Foul Play, Little Miss Marker, Split Image, Gorky Park, Legal Eagles, Miles from Home, Return to Snowy River, Presumed Innocent, Romeo and Juliet and Assault on Precinct 13. He played the father of Chris Farley's titular character in the 1995 comedy Tommy Boy.\\n\\nHe played serial murderer John Wayne Gacy in the 1991 TV movie To Catch a Killer and union leader Jackie Presser in the HBO special Teamster Boss a year later. I try to play villains as if they're good guys and good guys as if they're villains, he said in 1992\\n\\nHe worked deep into his 70s, in such projects as SundanceTV's Hap and Leonard, the film The Seagull with Elisabeth Moss and Annette Bening and the play Endgame by Samuel Beckett at the Long Wharf Theatre. His last foray on Broadway was in Love Letters opposite Mia Farrow in 2014.\\n\\nHe is survived by his second wife, costume designer Jennifer Arnott and their two children, Cormac and Sarah. He also is survived by three daughters — Elizabeth, Kathleen and Deirdre — from a previous marriage to Judith Scheff."}
{"original": "The progressive National Catholic Reporter (NCR) published an editorial Tuesday trashing New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan for capitulating to the Republican Party.\\n\\nIn their op-ed titled Dolan delivers the church to Trump and the GOP, the paper's editors lament that the cardinal archbishop of New York has inextricably linked the Catholic Church in the United States to the Republican Party and, particularly, President Donald Trump.\\n\\nAn unapologetic shill for the Democrat Party, NCR said that the U.S. bishops had been masterfully manipulated by the Trump administration into participating in a conference call with the president, during which Cardinal Dolan reportedly said he considers himself a great friend of Trump and that he was honored to start the comments on the call.\\n\\nThe following day, the cardinal announced inside St. Patrick's Cathedral that Mr. Trump was worshiping with us, since the president said he would be live-streaming the Mass from the White House.\\n\\nIn so doing, Cardinal Dolan provided more campaign footage to Trump and the GOP, the article alleges.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that similar complaints were lodged against Cardinal Dolan by conservatives in 2012 when he invited then-President Barack Obama to the Al Smith dinner in New York, with some asking with disdain: Why would you invite our enemy to a night of merriment? NCR, of course, had no problem with this at all and defended the cardinal's decision as this right thing to do.\\n\\nThe National Catholic Reporter, which has made its reputation through open dissent to Catholic Church teaching for decades, pushing everything from women's ordination to gay marriage to abortion, said in its op-ed that it is unprecedented that the Church's leadership would cozy up so cravenly to a president whose most consistent attribute is an uncontrollable propensity for lying.\\n\\nFor Dolan and his fellow episcopal travelers, the all-consuming issue is abortion, the article notes with thinly veiled scorn. That tops the agenda in any political consideration.\\n\\nThe Church's dogged insistence that abortion is an unspeakable evil that claims the lives of a million innocent human beings each year in the United States alone seems completely lost on the National Catholic Reporter, which has been more than willing to sell out the principles dearest to the Church in order to support the Democrat ticket.\\n\\nWe have regularly and strongly objected to what the bishops were doing in the public square regarding the issue of abortion because the strategy has proven most effective in dividing the Catholic community and turning the institutional church into a partisan enterprise, the editors note.\\n\\nParroting language from the abortion lobby, the nominally Catholic paper describes abortion as merely a women's issue that seemingly has nothing to do with the massacre of unborn children.\\n\\nThis absolute rule for women comes from an all-male culture that showed itself quite adept at accommodating a level of violence against already-born children, covering it up and wishing to move beyond the facts and the wrecked lives of thousands of victims and their families, the op-ed states.\\n\\nThis unholy alliance with Trump, coupled with the GOP stacking of the Supreme Court, may get the bishops the abortion ban they so covet, but it will not end the debate, the editors whine.\\n\\nThe Catholic voice, capable of a priceless contribution to the public conversation, has been sold for cheap to political hucksters, they conclude.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the paper will continue to stump for the nominally Catholic Joe Biden in the upcoming election, despite the candidate's open opposition to virtually every moral issue the Catholic Church stands for.\\n\\nIn rending their garments over the bishops' supposed capitulation to political expediency for the sake of advancing their moral agenda, the NCR editors may wish to take a long, hard look at themselves. After all, at least the bishops are pushing for Catholic principles rather than using the Catholic name to undermine the Church and promote a culture of death.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

Islamically, there's an emphasis on enjoying physical relationships within the context of marriage, not just for procreation. It is the wife's right that her husband satisfy her sexually.\\n\\nThe book offers explicit, candid advice on everything from kissing to sex positions.

In fact, it was fast becoming non-existent. She had been a model Muslimah her entire life.

She had eagerly looked forward to marriage as a chance to finally indulging in all the physical intimacy she had postponed for the sake of Allah.\\n\\nBut the new bride had no idea of what sex should involve, other than the mechanics.\\n\\nAccording to Muladhat, deciding what sexual acts are permissible in Islam is a source of confusion for those of the faith, and the misconception that females shouldn't enjoy sex is prevalent.\\n\\nGuilt associated with sex is drummed into women from childhood, she explained.

She also wants 21,000 more police and customs officials.\\n\\n– Taxes –\\n\\nLe Pen would impose a 35 percent tax on goods by companies which move production outside France, and would penalise groups that hire foreign workers.\\n\\nShe would cut income taxes by 10 percent for the lowest-earning households, and would drop France's plan to withhold income tax from monthly earnings starting next year — currently French pay tax on income the year after it is earned.\\n\\nMacron wants a three-year suspension of housing taxes for 80 percent of French households.\\n\\nHe also wants to turn France's so-called solidarity wealth tax on people claiming more than 1.3 million euros ($1.4 million) in assets into a tax on real-estate wealth, which would exclude financial assets.\\n\\nLe Pen has said she would leave the wealth tax untouched.\\n\\n– Energy, education, family –\\n\\nMacron has pledged to cut France's reliance on nuclear energy to 50 percent of its total electricity needs by 2025, from about 75 percent now.\\n\\nLe Pen has been a staunch defender of nuclear power, and would halt France's efforts to develop wind power.\\n\\nIn education, Le Pen would impose a uniform for all public school students and roll back a controversial reform meant to make French school days shorter.\\n\\nMacron wants to give schools more autonomy in terms of hiring and cut primary school class sizes in half in low-achieving and poor areas.\\n\\nHe would also ban the use of cellphones in elementary schools.\\n\\nLe Pen opposes gay marriage, although she would allow civil unions, and would restrict medically assisted procreation to only couples unable to have children naturally."}

Biden turned away from the cameras, wiped away some tears, then stood stoically as Obama draped the blue-and-white ribbon around his neck.\\n\\nI just hope that the asterisk in history that is attached to my name when they talk about this presidency is that I can say I was part of the journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country, Biden said.\\n\\nThere were standing ovations — several of them — at what had been billed as a modest farewell ceremony for Biden but evolved into a surprise bestowal of the Medal of Freedom, the last time Obama will present the honor.\\n\\nI had no idea, Biden said of the award, insisting he didn't deserve it.\\n\\nIt was the only time Obama has presented the medal with distinction, also awarded only once by each of the previous three presidents.\\n\\nOne week out from the Obama administration's end, a deep sense of nostalgia set in at the White House as longtime staffers pack up their offices, send out their last emails and bid farewell to the president they've served. On Tuesday, Obama returned home to Chicago to deliver his valedictory address, and next week he'll depart Washington as ex-president just after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in.\\n\\nObama, joined Thursday by his wife and daughters, was effusive in his praise for the man who ran against him in 2008, then agreed to be his running mate. He said Biden had made him a better president, calling him a lion of American history.\\n\\nTo know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard and to live life fully, Obama said.\\n\\nThe famously plainspoken Biden has long said he only agreed to the job after Obama agreed he would be the last person in the room before major decisions were made. Over two terms, they developed a bond that both men said transcended the office, with their wives, children and Biden's grandchildren becoming close friends.\\n\\nThey disagreed, too, on occasion, including when Biden advocated against the high-stakes raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Biden's tendency to veer off-script caused occasional headaches for the White House, such as when he unexpectedly announced support for gay marriage in advance of the 2012 re-election, forcing Obama to do the same soon after.\\n\\nYet as they gathered for a final goodbye, none of that seemed on either man's mind.\\n\\nObama said there had been no turf wars between our staffs, a departure from other recent administrations. And Biden told the story of how after his son Beau Biden died in 2015, leaving behind a wife and children, Obama was distraught when Biden said he might sell his house to help support them, and offered to give them money instead.\\n\\nIt was a reunion for the many staffers and colleagues who worked with Biden over the years. Joining Biden's wife, sister and children in the State Dining Room were former Sens. Chris Dodd and Ted Kaufman, former chief of staff Bruce Reed, and even Biden's White House physician.\\n\\nObama traced the history of Biden's nearly half-century-long political career, from chairing the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees to the cancer moonshot effort he started recently and plans to continue. Obama praised his vice president for his work on the economic stimulus, middle-class issues and curbing violence against women.\\n\\nI've not mentioned Amtrak yet, or aviators. 'Literally,' Obama said, invoking a few of the more famous Bidenisms.\\n\\nBiden's career in Washington started in 1972 steeped in tragedy when his wife and infant daughter died in a car crash just before he was to be sworn in as U.S. senator. After exiting the national stage next week, he plans to stay active in Democratic politics and work on policy issues at a pair of institutes he's developing at the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nHis folksy demeanor lent itself to plenty of jokes and caricatures, like the series of photos of Biden eating ice cream that exploded on social media.

{"original": "Salon Magazine has accused the Republican Party of being out of touch with post-Christian America, warning the GOP that if it doesn't renege on its alliance with Christianity, it will soon become irrelevant.\\n\\nTed Cruz's failure to get the GOP nomination, Matthew Sheffield proclaims in Salon, is a perfect window into trends that will set the pace of American politics for decades to come: Americans are moving away from Christianity, including people most likely to vote Republican.\\n\\nTo back up his claims, Sheffield cites the 2014 Pew Research study finding that 23 percent of Americans say they're unaffiliated with any religious tradition, up from 20 percent just three years earlier.\\n\\nThe trend away from religion, and Christianity in particular, Sheffield argues, is the real cause of Republicans' woes and their failure to win the last two elections.\\n\\nThe likely reason why Republicans have declined in popularity among the non-religious is GOP's long habit of identifying itself as a Christian party, he states. The later attempt to add in a Judeo- prefix has done little to stop the bleeding.\\n\\nWhile the statistics showing a rise in the religiously unaffiliated are undoubtedly sobering to people of faith, Sheffield fails to mention that the very same Pew study showed that over 70 percent of Americans continue to identify as Christian. That means that to an overwhelming majority of Americans, God matters.\\n\\nAnd while Sheffield rightly notes that atheists overwhelmingly vote Democrat, he comes up with the unlikely conclusion that Republicans should slough off their historical friendliness with religion in order to keep up with social trends. In other words, Republicans should repeat the Democrats' mistakes of alienating the pro-life community, religious believers, and traditional families in the hopes of pandering to the relatively small group of religiously unaffiliated.\\n\\nWhile observing that the religiously unaffiliated appear to have a real preference for Democrats, Sheffield insists that Republicans could cut into the Democrats' voter base if they would just abandon the illusion that Americans still care about God.\\n\\nWhile secular people have always favored Democrats for as long as the data goes back, Sheffield says, the situation has actually become even worse in recent years for the GOP.\\n\\nIf the GOP would just sell its soul and dump its religious constituency, Sheffield suggests, things would go a whole lot better. This includes a full embrace of same-sex marriage and other positions at odds with Biblical morality, in the name of political expediency.\\n\\nRegardless of what happens to GOP candidates in November, Christian conservatives face a choice, Sheffield concludes. They can embrace identity politics and become a small group of frustrated Christian nationalists who grow ever more resentful toward their fellow Americans, or they can embrace reality and render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's.\\n\\nMany other plausible theories could be advanced as to why the Republican Party lost the last two elections, none of which would involve its supposed over-dependency on the Christianity of its base.\\n\\nNonetheless, a more important consideration should be made here.\\n\\nAlthough the Republican Party espouses no particular religion and many of its members care more about the economy and national security than religious belief, the GOP has been a home to many people of faith, including those who have felt betrayed by the Democrats' callous treatment of believing Christians and Jews.\\n\\nWhat Sheffield seems not to realize is that for many Americans, the choice of being Christian is not just a means to a secular end. Embracing or rejecting faith in God is not the result of a political calculus whose ultimate goal is mirroring societal trends and thus achieving popularity and victory. To let social surveys dictate one's political platform, raising a finger to the wind every time fashions change, is to have the shallowest of views of the meaning of politics.\\n\\nMany Americans still believe that political parties should ultimately be guided not just by pragmatism and polls, but by deeply held convictions concerning the common good, justice, truth, and the welfare of all citizens.\\n\\nAnd for many, those convictions not only tolerate religious faith, they are born of it and sustained by it.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "TEL AVIV – Saudi Arabia has recently become embroiled in a debate over the idea that polygamy can provide a solution to the problem of single women in the kingdom, with some proponents saying men should take three wives – a single woman, a widow, and a divorcee – thus alleviating the burden of spinsters on society.\\n\\nThe hashtag #One Third Of Saudi Women Are Unmarried trended on Twitter in Saudi Arabia sparking fiery debate, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) reported. Breitbart also reported on a similar hashtag trending on wider Arab social media. Earlier this year, Alarabiya reported that a group of marriage officiants in the Gulf kingdom had started a WhatsApp group named Polygamy and within a month 900 women had joined.\\n\\nStatistics in the country regarding the phenomenon vary greatly, even among government ministries. In 2014, the Saudi Planning Ministry reported three million single men and women, double the number from 2010. The Saudi General Authority for Statistics reported in 2016 that the number of single women above the age of 15 was approximately 2.3 million, but noted that unmarried women aged 32 or older only numbered 230,000. Saudi law, which forbids women from driving, permits polygamy – as does Islam.\\n\\nHawazin Mirza, a lecturer at King 'Abd Al-'Aziz University in Jeddah, took to national television earlier this year to promote the establishment of a polygamy academy. Mirza's institution promises that within a single month, any man requesting its services would be provided with three wives – a single woman, a divorcee, and a widow. If such a marriage would prove itself a decade later, the husband would be provided with a fourth wife – free of charge. In return, the man would be expected to attend a six-month marriage prep course.\\n\\nWriting for the Saudi daily Okaz, columnist Abdallah Omar Khayat wrote that while women may feel that the idea of polygamy is loathsome, it has become a social and moral need, required in the interest of the homeland and of the citizens.\\n\\nHe conceded that a man's first wife will always considers herself abandoned and unwanted after her husband marries a second woman, and that her existence is only valued to the point that she may raise their children. According to Khayat, these are thoughts that Satan creates in her imagination.\\n\\nPolygamy is one of the ways that can lead to eliminating spinsterhood, concludes Khayat.\\n\\nThere are however, several voices of dissent within the country, particularly from more liberal women. Writing in the Al-Jazirah daily, Saudi journalist Samar Al-Muqrin said polygamy as a solution to the proliferation of singlehood reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the institution of marriage.\\n\\nAccording to Al-Muqrin, such ways of thinking stem from the idea that marriage concerns sex alone, and not a shared life which, in her view, cannot have more than two people in it.\\n\\nShe adds that many women today are not marrying out of choice because they do not want to throw [themselves] into the arms of just any man, no matter what he looks like.\\n\\nColumnist Salma Al-Qusheiri agrees with her counterpart, but in harsher tones, calling Mirza's proposal for a polygamy academy as oppressive and misogynistic.\\n\\nWhile the world around us advances and tries to develop day by day … in our society we do the opposite! she wrote in the Al-Watan daily.\\n\\nAccording to Al-Qusheiri, polygamy is nothing but legal adultery … that no sane person who has reached adulthood would consider.\\n\\nMirza, who as a lecturer at a university should know better, is turning Saudi woman into cheap – very cheap – merchandise – [and all] in the name of Islam, writes Al-Qusheiri.\\n\\nAlso writing for Al-Watan, columnist Fahd Al-Ahmari took a slightly different view, claiming polygamy poses health threats, particularly to the husband. The reason for this is he is now expected to provide for several families at once – both from a financial and emotional aspect. She brings proof of her claim, noting a 2015 study conducted at a Saudi hospital and medical research center that showed men with multiple wives suffer from heart problems four times more than the rest of the male population."}

{"original": "Too often, politicians at every level will ignore the clear language of a law if it does not let them do as they wish. This was evident on two fronts last week: in California and here in the District of Columbia.\\n\\nFirst California. You will recall that we filed a taxpayer lawsuit in August 2014 challenging a decision by the University of California Regents to give up to $27.1 million in non-resident tuition waivers and financial aid to illegal alien students in their schools.\\n\\nA lower California state court upheld their action, and we've now completed the briefing for the appeal of the lower court ruling with the filing of a reply brief last week. We brought this litigation on behalf of Earl De Vries, a legal resident and taxpayer of California (Earl De Vries v Regents of the University of California (BC555614)). Under California law, taxpayers have the right to sue government officials to prevent unlawful expenditures of taxpayer funds and taxpayer-financed resources.\\n\\nIn our August 2014 lawsuit on behalf of De Vries in the L.A. County Superior Court, we asked the court to halt the estimated annual $19.6 million in non-resident tuition waivers, $4.3 million in taxpayer-funded grants and scholarships, and $3.2 million in state loans the Regents have started giving illegal alien students.\\n\\nUnder the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act passed by Congress in 1996, unlawfully present aliens are ineligible for state or local public benefits. The only exception to this federal law is when a state affirmatively provides for such eligibility to illegal aliens, which states may do only through the enactment of a State law.\\n\\nThe California State Legislature passed statutes granting such tuition benefits to California State University students and California Community College students, but it was forbidden to do so for University of California students. Under the California Constitution, the UC Board of Regents is entirely independent of the state legislature in policy matters, so there is no lawful way for the California legislature to allow or require the University of California to provide public benefits to illegal aliens.\\n\\nIn March 2015, the Superior Court ruled that the UC Board of Regents policies themselves (and not the state statutes) are the state laws that affirmatively provide the benefits to UC students in satisfaction of federal law and dismissed the lawsuit. In November 2015, Judicial Watch filed its opening appellate brief with the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, arguing that the trial court wrongly read extra words into Congress' statute. Specifically, the brief argues that the federal statute in question does not say 'state law or administrative rule, regulation or policy.' It says 'State law.' This means an enactment of the state legislature.\\n\\nIn our March 22 appellant's reply brief, we highlighted how the appointed UC Board of Regents has not been granted the same rights as a state legislature elected by voters under federal law:\\n\\nWhen Congress wrote only through the enactment of a state law can unlawfully present aliens receive benefits, that is precisely what it meant. This means the exercise of state legislative power. … The Regents argue this is not what Congress really meant, but rather it meant any exercise of state lawmaking power, be it legislative, executive, judicial, or by independent board. Those arguments are unavailing. Congress' unique word choices and other evidence of Congressional intent behind [the federal law] prove that the statute is limited to representative or democratic state legislative acts only. UC Regents officials think they can rewrite the law according to their personal whims and provide illegal aliens in-state tuition benefits contrary to law. Public officials on the UC Board of Regents need to put aside politics and obey both federal law and the California Constitution. They have no right to play politics at taxpayers' expense.\\n\\nTaxpaying California citizens deserve to have their hard-earned money spent lawfully, De Vries says. What the Regents are doing is not only illegal, and it's grossly unfair to taxpayers.\\n\\nThere also was action this week in the U.S. Supreme Court on a matter that concerns illegal aliens. Last year, we joined with the Allied Educational Foundation (AEF) in the filing of two amici curiae briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of Sue Evenwel, a Texas resident who filed a lawsuit to overturn a Texas malapportionment law (Sue Evenwel, et al. v. Greg Abbott, et al. (No. 14-940)) and (Sue Evenwel, et al. v. Greg Abbott, et al. (No. 14-940)).\\n\\nWe argued then that Texas is devaluing the votes of certain citizens by improperly including noncitizen nonvoters when determining the equal population of legislative districts. Under federal law and the laws of all 50 states, only citizens may vote in federal elections. Texas' scheme to give weight to non-voting non-citizens along with lawful voters is contrary to the principles embodied in citizen voting laws. As a result, the votes of some Texas' citizens have, by some measures, almost twice the electoral power of the votes of other Texas citizens.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the Supreme Court this week found that, the one-person, one-vote allows states to use total population only, rather than voter population, when apportioning state voting districts: Adopting voter-eligible apportionment as constitutional command would upset a well-functioning approach to districting that all 50 States and countless local jurisdictions have fol­lowed for decades, even centuries.\\n\\nIsn't it incredible that five of the six justices who signed on to that opinion just last year imposed gay marriage across America despite thousands of years of tradition and law!\\n\\nThe media made much of the 8-0 ruling, but the same media masked reports of the Court's divisions. Justice Thomas agreed with the result only because he thought states had leeway to apportion state legislative seats as under our constitutional system. Justice Alito also noted that the decision by Justice Ginsberg left for another day the issue of whether only voters could be counted for purposes of apportionment by the states. View the Evenwel opinions here.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court's Evenwel majority decision undermines the principle of one man, one vote. The decision will encourage politicians to fill their legislative districts with more non-citizens and fewer voting Americans. This abuse could lead to unequal voting power for voters in districts with large numbers of alien residents.\\n\\nUnder this decision, 100,000 black American voters in one state legislative district would have the same voting power as 10,000 white American voters in another district with 90,000 non-citizens. Even though total population is the same in both districts, voting power is radically different.\\n\\nThese types of abuses, already present in Texas, will spread nationally.\\n\\nThis is one reason this political decision by the High Court will not stand the test of time.\\n\\nTo that end, you may now want to contact your state's elected representatives about how you feel about counting non-citizens in apportioning representation in your state legislature."}

This is by no means to suggest that most of those with a homosexual inclination are abusers, but the fact remains that the overwhelming majority of abuse has been inflicted on post-pubescent boys by homosexual clerics.\\n\\nIt is mere hypocrisy to condemn the abuse and claim to sympathize with the victims without facing up to this fact honestly. A spiritual revitalization of the clergy is necessary, but it will be ultimately ineffectual if it does not address this problem, the archbishop stated.\\n\\nIn his statement, Viganò also wondered aloud why Pope Francis continues to elevate notorious homosexuals to positions of influence if he really intends to tackle the problem.\\n\\nWhy does Pope Francis keep and even call as his close collaborators people who are notorious homosexuals? Viganò said. Why has he refused to answer legitimate and sincere questions about these appointments?

Almost nothing has been said about sexual misconduct with adults, which is itself a grave abuse of pastoral authority, whether or not the relationship was 'consensual.'\\n\\nRecent reports suggest that clerical sex abuse over the last decades has been overwhelmingly homosexual in nature, with at least three out of four victims being male.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a sudden Democratic presidential contender, is attacking the religious beliefs of his opponents.\\n\\nWorse, he is mocking the faith of religious voters who support President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe irony is rich: Buttigieg is openly gay, and is married to a man, both of which contradict traditional religious teachings.\\n\\nThat is not to say his faith is illegitimate, but one might expect him to be less judgmental of others.\\n\\nLast week, in an interview with USA Today, Buttigieg called Trump's Christian faith into question: I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God, he said. I just don't understand how you can be as worshipful of your own self as he is and be prepared to humble yourself before God, he added. Buttigieg later defended his remarks on ABC, saying he was attacking Trump's hypocrisy.\\n\\nIt is odd that someone whose own faith would have been called into question until quite recently for a lifestyle that directly contradicts traditional Christian principles would dare to question anyone else's commitment, doing unto others precisely what he would not have done unto him.\\n\\nBut in point of fact, Trump has openly — and humbly — acknowledged his personal religious failings, telling the Republican National Convention in accepting his party's nomination in 2016 that I'm not sure I totally deserve the support he had received from the evangelical community.\\n\\nButtigieg wasn't finished. In a speech to the LGBT Victory Fund's annual brunch Sunday, he attacked Vice President Mike Pence, suggesting that Pence was an anti-gay bigot. My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God, he said, as quoted by The Hill. He added that he wished the Mike Pences of the world would understand that being gay was not a choice: Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\\n\\nThe left is obsessed with the idea that Pence is anti-gay, solely because he is a born-again Christian and once advocated for conversion therapy — 20 years ago.\\n\\nIf anything, Pence has tried to appease the gay community. In 2015, when Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to protect Christian business owners from being compelled to endorse gay marriage, Pence immediately backed down in the face of criticism and signed a fix to the law.\\n\\nIn 2018, when he was publicly taunted by gay competitors at the Olympic Winter Games, Pence reached out — to no avail.\\n\\nLGTB activists have set up the false conceit of Pence as an enemy, when he has treated them with nothing but tolerance.\\n\\nButtigieg's remarks were not only mean-spirited, demonstrating the opposite of the Christian tolerance he claims to espouse, but they were also an indirect attack on the traditional Christian teachings that Pence, like many others, embraces.\\n\\nFinally, on Sunday's edition of NBC News' Meet the Press, Buttigieg accused evangelical Christians of unbelievable hypocrisy for voting for Trump: It's something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that's not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church were it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you're supposed to conduct yourself.\\n\\nAs has been widely reported, evangelicals have overlooked Trump's personal failings because he has been more faithful than any other president to his promises on pro-life policies, conservative judges, religious freedom, protecting Israel, and other issues.\\n\\nButtigieg's response is to attack evangelical voters. That is not exactly a smart idea when the main pitch of his presidential campaign is that he will be able to compete against Trump for support in the heartland.\\n\\nButtigieg is smart enough to know that voters are tired of the public attacks on Christians and Christianity — hence his recent defense of Chick-fil-A, noting that while he disagrees with its owners' views, he dislikes virtue signaling.\\n\\nAnd yet Buttigieg cannot help himself. Like many other Democrats, he disdains religion in the public sphere until he can use it to bludgeon his opponents, adopting the self-righteous posture towards other Christians that he accuses them of taking toward the LGBT community.\\n\\nRather than humility, Buttigieg is displaying intolerance, adding to the sense religious voters have that what Democrats want is not just to drive them out of the public square, but out of their own faith.\\n\\nJoel B.

But police arriving at the couple's residence that night reportedly saw no evidence of injuries to Heard, and the actress declined to file a police report.\\n\\nThe Rum Diary actress filed for divorce from Depp earlier this month.\\n\\nAs the result of Amber's decision to decline giving an initial statement to the LAPD, her silence has been used against her by Johnny's team, Spector said in a statement provided to the Independent. Amber did not provide a statement to the LAPD in an attempt to protect her privacy and Johnny's career.\\n\\nJohnny's team has forced Amber to give a statement to the LAPD to set the record straight as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media, Heard's attorney added. Amber has suffered through years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Johnny. In domestic violence cases, it is not unusual for the perpetrator's playbook to include miscasting the victim as the villain.\\n\\nDepp's team has vehemently denied that the actor abused Heard, with the actor's high-powered attorney, Laura Wasser, flatly stating last week that the actress invented the abuse claims to gain a financial upper hand in divorce proceedings.\\n\\nDepp's former romantic partners, Vanessa Paradis and Lori Anne Allison, have each released separate statements claiming that Depp never physically abused them throughout their relationships. On Monday, the actor's friend Doug Stanhope alleged that Heard is attempting to blackmail the actor with the abuse allegations.\\n\\nMeanwhile, two security guards who were reportedly present during the altercation Saturday night told TMZ on Tuesday that Heard had allegedly yelled Stop hitting me!' at Depp, even though at the time, he was in the kitchen and she was sitting on the sofa, at least 20 feet away.\\n\\nThe security guards also told the gossip site that it was Heard who was allegedly regularly violent towards Depp.\\n\\nAmber can no longer endure the relentless attacks and outright lies launched against her character in the Court of Public Opinion since the tragic events of May 21st, Heard's attorney said. With her statement Amber hopes to give the LAPD the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation into the events of that evening and before. If that occurs, and the truth is revealed, there is no doubt that Amber's claims will be substantiated beyond any doubt, and hopefully Johnny will get the help that he so desperately needs.\\n\\nWe took the high road. Unfortunately, Johnny's team immediately went to the press and began viciously attacking Amber's character, Spector added. Amber is simply a victim of domestic violence, and none of her actions are motivated by money. Amber is a brave and financially independent woman who is showing the courage of her convictions by doing the right thing against Johnny's relentless army of lawyers and surrogates.\\n\\nThe Family Law Court is not going to be influenced by misinformation placed in the social media based on anonymous sources. Amber is the victim.

{"original": "The number of people given French citizenship this year is likely to soar 45 per cent from 2015's figure, with the vast majority of new French from North Africa. The spike follows a concerted push by the ruling Socialist Party to naturalise 100,000 people a year.\\n\\nIn an investigative report, monthly journal Causeur notes that the sharp uptick in naturalisations far exceeds previous patterns and asks whether agencies' rush to grant citizenship to more new French is a coincidence against the backdrop of presidential elections in 2017.\\n\\nIn 2012, as Interior Minister, the now-Prime Minister Manuel Valls took a wrecking ball to the previous centre-right government's naturalisation criteria, abolishing the multiple choice tests on French culture and values and the need for candidates to be employed on a permanent contract.\\n\\nBranding the previous government's policies on naturalisation the result of a France that doubts, looks at the world with suspicion, Valls declared that he wanted to see 100,000 people a year given French citizenship. The Socialist politician also said he hoped a further 20,000 spouses of French citizens would be naturalised each year through marriage.\\n\\nCauseur reports that it is very much an open secret that in recent months the department which manages accession to French nationality has been a machine that is naturalising in full swing.\\n\\nReportedly, naturalisations have risen at a rate far higher than in recent years. Between 2013 and 2015 the rate at which the decree was given increased by 17 per cent, whilst it had halved between 2010 and 2012 before Valls took office and modified the rules.\\n\\nIn 2015 the department had more than met the Prime Minister's goal of 100,000, naturalising 113,603 people. Causeur discovered that the number of new French this year could exceed last year's total by 45 per cent.\\n\\nThe majority of people who are being granted citizenship are not European, accounting for 78 per cent of the total. Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians top the list of new French, followed by Turks and Senegalese people.\\n\\nCauseur notes that applications for citizenship are received by the sub-directorate of access to French nationality of the Interior Ministry, where they are approved or refused, and then sent on to the central record keeping service which realises the process.\\n\\nThe journal found that this service has a stock of 10,000 pending cases which have already been accepted by the Interior Ministry, something which Causeur states is extremely rare.\\n\\nWith the presidential election set for next year, polls have for months shown president François Hollande losing to all likely adversaries. According to a 2012 survey of 10,000 voters, 93 per cent of Muslims in France voted for the Socialist Party president, who is the most unpopular head of France in modern history.\\n\\nIn his successful presidential campaign, Hollande promised an amnesty to all of the estimated 400,000 Muslims illegally in France.\\n\\nNow a huge, and growing, electoral bloc, commentators have observed that Muslims in France decided the election. An estimated 1.7 million of them voted for Hollande in 2012, who beat incumbent president Nicolas Sarkozy by just 1.1 million votes."}

She was 92.\\n\\nRae died at her Los Angeles home Sunday with her family at her side, said her publicist, Harlan Boll. A cause of death was not immediately available, but Rae was diagnosed last year with bone cancer after beating pancreatic cancer, Boll said.\\n\\nShe originated the character of Mrs. Garrett in 1978 during the first season of NBC's comedy Diff'rent Strokes, then took Mrs. Garrett with her for the spinoff Facts, which premiered the following season.\\n\\nInitially set at a girls' boarding school, that NBC series ran for nine seasons. Rae left after its seventh year, however, explaining later, I needed some time for the rest of my life.\\n\\nThe Facts role came to Rae after years of theater and television performances. She earned an Emmy nomination for the part, and she was a two-time Tony nominee for her work on Broadway.\\n\\nHer last feature film credit was Ricki and the Flash with Meryl Streep in 2015. That same year she released her autobiography The Facts of My Life, co-written by her son Larry Strauss.\\n\\nMindy Cohn and Kim Fields, who played members of Mrs. Garrett's brood, recalled her lovingly.\\n\\nShe was my champion, a teacher, a proud example of the tenacity and perseverance needed to live as a creative, along with your talent and gifts. i love you char, Cohn, who played Natalie, posted on Instagram.\\n\\nSorry, no words at the moment just love and tears… and yeah, smiles, tweeted Fields, who portrayed Tootie.\\n\\nTony Award-winning actress Audra McDonald tweeted: She was so sweet, funny, wise, lovely, and brilliant. She will be so missed. Rest In Peace Sweet Charlotte Rae.\\n\\nTodd Bridges, who was on Diff'rent Strokes, said on Twitter that she was beloved by all her colleagues and that the show would not have been the same without you.\\n\\nEdna Garrett provided kind if sometimes wry counsel to her Facts of Life charges (which, besides Cohn and Fields, included Lisa Whelchel, Nancy McKeon and Molly Ringwald) on a series that was praised for dealing with such sensitive issues of teenhood as sex, drug use, eating disorders and peer pressure.\\n\\nI wanted to bring in as much humanity as possible, as well as the humor, Rae told The Associated Press early in the show's run. I don't want her to be Polly Perfect, because she must have human failings and make mistakes.\\n\\nHer own life was marked by tragedy, Rae told the AP in a 2015 interview. She said the most devastating thing she faced was her son Andy Strauss' diagnosis of autism at a time when there was far less understanding of or attention to the disorder. Andy died in his mid-40s of a heart attack in 1999.\\n\\nBorn Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in Milwaukee, on April 22, 1926, she had studied drama at Northwestern University, then moved to New York where, despite early plans to be a serious actress, she quickly found work doing satirical sketches in Greenwich Village clubs.\\n\\nIt was there that Broadway producers, who frequented such bistros, discovered her, leading to her first Broadway musical, called Three Wishes for Jamie, in 1952. A few years later, she originated the role of Mammy Yokum in the Broadway musical Li'l Abner.\\n\\nRae made numerous TV appearances in 1950s drama anthologies including The U.S. Steel Hour, ″Playhouse 90″ and Armstrong Circle Theater, sharing the black-and-white screen with such actors as Zero Mostel, Art Carney and Gertrude Berg.\\n\\nIn 1961 she became a semi-regular on the New York-based cop sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? as the wife of the NYPD officer played by future Munsters grandpa Al Lewis.\\n\\nShe received Tony nominations in 1966 for Pickwick and in 1969 for Morning, Noon and Night.\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, Rae moved to Los Angeles with her then-husband, composer and music editor John Strauss, and their sons Andy and Larry. There she was cast in the short-lived Norman Lear sitcom Hot L Baltimore and a similarly unsuccessful variety show hosted by Rich Little before scoring Diff'rent Strokes, on which Mrs. Garrett was the family's housekeeper.\\n\\nRae stayed busy with film and stage appearances, including 1971′s Bananas from Woody Allen and 1979′s Hair. Other credits included the 2008 comedy You Don't Mess with the Zohan and the 2012 thriller Love Sick Love.\\n\\nIn 2005, at age 79, she appeared in a new comedy, Leading Ladies, at Ford's Theater in Washington.\\n\\nIn 2013, Rae went public with an account of why her marriage to Strauss had ended in the mid-1970s after a quarter-century. She said he disclosed to her he was bisexual and wanted an open marriage. Strauss died in 2011.\\n\\nIn addition to son Larry, she is survived by sister Miriam Guten and three grandchildren.\\n\\nServices were pending, Boll said."}

{"original": "John McAdams, a conservative professor at Marquette University, has been suspended after criticising a fellow lecturer for refusing to allow same-sex marriage to be debated in class. The suspension will be extended indefinitely unless McAdams admits his guilt within two weeks.\\n\\nIn a blog post, McAdams drew attention to an incident in which a student was told to by instructor Cheryl Abbate to leave her philosophy class if he wished to debate same-sex marriage or adoption by gay couples.\\n\\nAccording to McAdams:\\n\\nThen things deteriorated further as the student said that it was his right as an American citizen to make arguments against gay marriage. Abbate replied that you don't have a right in this class to make homophobic comments. She further said she would take offense if the student said that women can't serve in particular roles. And she added that somebody who is homosexual would experience similar offense if somebody opposed gay marriage in class. She went on In this class, homophobic comments, racist comments, will not be tolerated. She then invited the student to drop the class.\\n\\nAfter the student complained to two university deans and the chair of the Philosophy Department, McAdams said the Chair pretty much blew off the issue. According to McAdams, the student is now dropping his class with Abbate.\\n\\nLike the rest of academia, Marquette is less and less a real university, concluded McAdams.\\n\\nIn response, a Faculty Hearing Committee unanimously recommended that McAdams be suspended for a period of one-to-two semesters. University President Michael Lovell agreed to suspend McAdams, but added a further condition that was not included in the Committee's recommendations: McAdams will only be reinstated at the end of his suspension if he admits guilt in making the blog post.\\n\\nSpeaking to Campus Reform, McAdams said he had no intention of complying with Lovell's demand.\\n\\nI think this is a ploy on Lovell's part to get me fired because he knows I won't do any of that, McAdams said.

{"original": "Taiwan's presidential election entered its final day of campaigning with a mixture of angry allegations, calls for unity, and international tensions.\\n\\nIncumbent President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) remains heavily favored to win, but Tsai herself advised supporters to come together and never underestimate our rival, meaning Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Han Kuo-yu.\\n\\nThe race has been a huge comeback for Tsai and the DPP, which was trounced so badly in the 2018 local elections that Tsai stepped down as leader of the party. The protest movement in Hong Kong is widely credited with shifting the Taiwanese center of political gravity back in her direction as apprehension about China grows. Solid economic growth helped defuse Han's accusations that Tsai compromised Taiwan's prosperity by taking a tough stance against Beijing.\\n\\nOver the past few years, China's diplomatic offensives, military coercion, interference and infiltration have continued unabated. China's objective is clear: To force Taiwan to compromise our sovereignty. Democracy and authoritarianism cannot coexist within the same country. Hong Kong's people have shown us that 'One Country, Two Systems' is absolutely not viable, Tsai said in her New Year's Day address to the nation, neatly bottling up her campaign theme.\\n\\nA huge rally for Tsai on Saturday was brimming with references to Hong Kong, including a profusion of flags emblazoned with the main slogan of the protest movement, Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.\\n\\nTsai told supporters to endure to the last minute and achieve electoral victory with unity and love, reminding them that respected friends and family members might support her opponent.\\n\\nSuch calls for unity are easier for the front-runner to make. KMT's campaign closed out with angry allegations of corruption against the DPP and warnings of disaster if Tsai retains the presidency.\\n\\nWe must be united and vote for Han to get rid of the corrupt DPP, to allow Han to build a safe and prosperous Taiwan. If you are an opponent of Tsai but decide not to vote for Han, this means you will be doing Tsai a favor, said Han's deputy campaign manager, Chou Hsi-wei.\\n\\nUnderstandably, but perhaps not helpfully, former KMT leader James Soong — now running under the People First Party (PFP) in a nominal alliance with KMT — told supporters not to count him out of the race and throw their votes to Han, even though he is running in a very distant third place and Han has little chance of winning if he does not absorb the PFP's votes.\\n\\nWhether you are a KMT supporter or a DPP supporter is not the issue. In line with the basic rules of a democratic society, the most important thing is to elect a capable and honest man to serve us, Soong said in his own call to unity, choosing words that probably would not go over well in the United States if two male candidates were attempting to unseat a female incumbent.\\n\\nThe saga of confessed Chinese spy William Wang Liquiang boiled through the last day of the campaign, making the calls for unity a bit strained since each Taiwanese party is accusing the other of using Liquiang in a scheme to discredit them. On Thursday, the government of Australia, where Liquiang is seeking asylum, confirmed that an alleged threat to his life is under active investigation.\\n\\nThis prompted DPP politicians to renew allegations that KMT is working with Communist China to influence Taiwanese politics and tried to silence Liquiang through bribery and intimidation. KMT fired back with allegations that the DPP is paying Liquiang to smear them. The DPP said the KMT is bribing Liquiang to falsely state that the DPP tried to bribe him.\\n\\nRising tensions between Taiwan's close ally the United States and Taiwan played a role in the election on Friday, with Tsai taking time to convene a meeting of her national security council and Cabinet ministers to discuss possible impacts on Taiwan's security, economy, and energy supply. The possibility of China exploiting U.S. distraction in the Middle East to make aggressive moves on Taiwan was discussed.\\n\\nAnother eleventh-hour scandal blossomed on Friday with accusations of homophobia against the KMT and its allies for hanging banners with ostensibly intimidating slogans such as I Want to Have Grandchildren and Continue the Family Line. LGBT critics denounced the KMT as a reactionary and conservative force, while Taiwan's Green Party and New Power Party (NPP) took the opportunity to boast of their support for same-sex marriage and adoption.\\n\\nLate polling has Tsai with far more votes than Han and Soong combined, while other parties barely register. Fudan University in the mainland Chinese city of Shanghai published an extensively-researched and carefully-modeled forecast anticipating a blowout win for Tsai with almost 60 percent of the vote on Friday but pulled the prediction down only a few hours later without explanation.\\n\\nThe South China Morning Post noted Fudan University used to be known as a relatively free-thinking institution, but its attitude was adjusted by the Chinese Communist Party last month, so now its charter includes Marxist twaddle and professions of loyalty to the party. The inference was that Fudan was ordered to take down its Taiwanese election predictions because they might depress turnout for the pro-China candidates."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON, DC – Senators confirmed three high-priority Trump judges to the federal appeals courts last week without a single Democrat voting for any of them, with one of those new judges replacing an irreplaceable conservative judicial icon, Judge Alice Batchelder.\\n\\nThe Senate confirmed Allison Jones Rushing on March 6 as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which covers five states in the middle of the Eastern Seaboard. The vote was 53-44. At age 37, Judge Rushing is the youngest appellate judge appointed by President Donald Trump. A partner at powerhouse law firm Williams & Connelly, Rushing is an Evangelical Christian – a group that is underrepresented on the federal appeals bench – and a former law clerk both to Justice Neil Gorsuch (when he served on the Tenth Circuit appeals court) and Justice Clarence Thomas.\\n\\nThe other two confirmations were for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. With them, President Trump has appointed six of the 16 seats on that court, the single largest impact on any federal court to date measured either by absolute numbers or by percentages.\\n\\nFirst is Chad Readler, who was confirmed 52-47 on March 6. Readler has been serving as the principal deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) since President Trump took office, making him the second in command in a division with over 1,000 attorneys. He previously worked as a partner at Jones Day, one of the largest law firms in the world. Judge Readler was recommended by former White House Counsel Don McGahn – who likewise was a partner at Jones Day and is now returning to that firm – and took a leading role defending President Trump's policies against legal challenges during 2017 and early 2018 while Senate Democrats obstructed confirmation of the permanent head of DOJ's Civil Division, Jody Hunt.\\n\\nSecond is Eric Murphy, who was confirmed 52-46 on March 7. Murphy is the solicitor general of Ohio, and well known as a stalwart conservative. Liberals attacked him for a host of reasons, including defending Ohio's law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. (Defending state laws against legal challenges is a central part of the job of any solicitor general.) He formerly clerked for a prominent judge on the Fourth Circuit and then for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nMurphy's confirmation marks the passing of a baton, as he takes the seat being vacated by Judge Batchelder, who has been one of the originalist champions on the federal bench for 27 years. President Ronald Reagan appointed Batchelder to the federal district bench in Ohio in 1985, and Bush 41 elevated her to the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit in 1991.\\n\\nLike Judge Edith Jones on the Fifth Circuit, Batchelder has been a generation-long anchor for her Sixth Circuit on adhering to the original public meaning of the Constitution, regardless of political pressures or opinion polls. She was considered for the Supreme Court in 2005 – as Jones was in 1990 – but by all accounts was genuinely relieved when President George W. Bush picked Samuel Alito for the seat, preferring small-town life in Ohio to living in the nation's capital.\\n\\nJones and Batchelder have served as the deeply admired twin conservative matriarchs on the federal bench for more than a quarter century. Several other judges have worn the mantle of unflinching originalists, like Diarmuid O'Scannlain on the Ninth Circuit and David Sentelle on the D.C. Circuit, but with their elegant and maternal demeanors, Jones and Batchelder have stood out as doyennes of the federal bench in a dignified manner reminiscent of the United Kingdom's Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher.\\n\\nBatchelder's latest act of service in her long career occurred when she sent her letter to President Trump informing him that she was ready to take senior status, which is a semi-retired status where judges still hear cases part-time but give up their seat to be filled by a new judge. Instead of taking her status immediately, she informed the president that she would continue to hold the seat not only until he nominated her replacement, but also would keep on serving until the Senate confirmed that nominee. That way, she could continue to serve alongside all the regular-service judges to rehear important cases in en banc sittings until the day when a younger constitutionalist judge could fill that seat in her stead.\\n\\nAlthough she is handing off her seat to Murphy, Batchelder will continue hearing cases on a part-time time basis instead of retiring, continuing with Jones to set the pace for dozens of new Trump-appointed constitutional conservatives.\\n\\nRegarding the three nominees confirmed last week – as well as Judge Eric Miller, confirmed one week earlier to the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 53-46 with no Democrats in support – the American Bar Association (ABA) rated all of these nominees as either Qualified or Well Qualified.\\n\\nThe ABA is a leftwing organization that Democrats hail as the gold standard for evaluating judicial nominees. Yet despite the ABA's declaring that all these nominees fully qualified for their judgeships, not a single Democrat – not even Sen. Joe Manchin (WV) or the very vulnerable Sen. Doug Jones (AL) – voted for any of them.\\n\\nFederal judges continue to be one of President Trump's greatest achievements. Five more appellate nominees, and 37 nominees to the federal trial courts, are on the Senate calendar for a final floor votes in the weeks ahead.\\n\\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News and formerly served as a law clerk under Judge Batchelder.

In certain fields, it is better to do nothing than do damage.\\n\\nSalvini said that when dividing up the different government ministries between the two parties, the League chose to focus on areas where its moral and social agenda could make a real difference.\\n\\nIn the subdivisions of the government leadership, we have chosen the ministry of the Family and Disability; the Ministry of the Interior, which also deals with discrimination and gender issues; the Ministry of Education to give a clear stamp of freedom of education and respect for certain principles, he said.\\n\\nTherefore, within the limits of the contract, respecting different sensibilities, we have tried to keep some principles held high, he said.\\n\\nMr. Salvini said he is firmly opposed both to the womb rental entailed in surrogate motherhood and to gender-fluid parenting. To give an example: last week I was told that on the website of the Ministry of the Interior, on the forms for the electronic identity card there were 'parent 1' and 'parent 2,' Salvini said. I immediately changed the site by restoring the words 'mother' and 'father.' It's a small thing, a small signal, but I assure you that I will do everything in my power as Minister of the Interior.\\n\\nWombs for rent and similar horrors, absolutely no, he said.\\n\\nWe will defend the natural family founded on the union between a man and a woman, he added.\\n\\nCuriously, despite Mr. Salvini's complete alignment with the Catholic Church on key moral issues such as the right to life, traditional marriage, gender theory, and freedom of education, the Italian Church establishment has been waging an open war on the interior minister, comparing him to Satan and the antichrist, because of his commitment to reining in illegal immigration.\\n\\nMr. Salvini was asked how he explains the unprecedented hostility toward him from the Catholic establishment in Italy, notably the bishops conference and Catholic journals such as Famiglia Cristiana and Avvenire.\\n\\nHonestly I cannot explain it. So much virulence leaves me truly perplexed, Salvini said, adding that on the other hand he is flooded with mail from Catholics — even priests and bishops — who encourage him to keep going the way he is.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "Roger Stone told Breitbart News that CNN coordinated with the Mueller investigation in producing great footage depicting him as some sort of criminal in order to taint the jury pool. He offered his remarks in a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\\n\\nStone recalled last Friday's events when he was arrested by FBI agents at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with a CNN production team in tow.\\n\\nLISTEN:\\n\\nStone said, [FBI agents] walked me out in the middle of the street to make sure the CNN camera could get great footage of the whole thing. The street was sealed off, so how CNN had a camera right outside the door; that's very hard to understand, because nobody else was allowed on the street.\\n\\nCNN denied being tipped off by sources within Robert Mueller's team or the broader FBI, crediting reporter's instinct with its decision to have a camera crew on-site during the pre-dawn raid of Stone's home.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted about CNN's presence at the scene of Stone's arrest:\\n\\n\\n\\nGreatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2019\\n\\nStone continued, They then took me to the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale where I was shackled, hand and foot, in heavy metal shackles, and put in a holding cell for three hours with three African-American gentlemen who, by the way, all support President Trump's recent justice reform package, and I waited to go in front of a judge who released me on the bond that we've discussed.\\n\\nStone went on, So this was meant to do two things. One, to taint the jury pool, to paint a picture for the American people that I'm some sort of criminal, even though I'm charged with non-violent process crimes, and also to send a message to others.\\n\\nStone added, Reading the indictment, there are several people who are preparing to lie on behalf of the Mueller investigation and bear false witness against me. So they want to let them know that this will happen to them unless they say what they're told to say.\\n\\nLast Friday, CNN's Jake Tapper said of Stone's possible imprisonment, He might like it.\\n\\nStone considered Tapper's comment as innuendo-laden. He said, Look, I'm a libertarian. I think people know that. I'm a long-time supporter of same-sex marriage, of the legalization of marijuana. I'm a libertarian conservative. I'm not a social conservative. People know that. My private life is my private life. I'm married and I have two children, five grandchildren, and our business is our business.\\n\\nStone went on, I don't know what those implications are. I mean, Jake Tapper looks light in the loafers to me. I don't know what implication he's making about me, but I think most people found the whole thing repugnant. Yeah, I like to dress well. I have a fashion site; Stone on Style. You can go there, now. I've written books. 'Stone's Rules for Men's Style.' I've been the men's style correspondent for the Daily Caller and I still am. What's the implication there?\\n\\nStone described harassment and threats directed at him and his family.\\n\\nThe hatred, the death threats, the threats against my children, the threats to disfigure my wife, said Stone. I've had people call the house and say, 'We know where your children go to school,' and hang up. The left is sick in this country. They are mentally ill.\\n\\nStone stated, For two years, now, I've been unable to go out in public to a restaurant or through an airport without ugliness and people threatening to kill me and people saying, 'You're a Russian spy.'\\n\\nStone described the financial burden of combating the Mueller-led operation's charges against him.\\n\\nIt's destroyed my consulting business, explained Stone. I lost my health and life insurance in December, because I could no longer pay the premiums. I had to sell my car. I had a small fund set aside for the college education of my children which I had to liquidate, which had come from the proceeds of my books sales.\\n\\n\\n\\nStone continued, The internet censorship of my show on Infowars and my Facebook page where — I've written five books; two of them New York Times best sellers — strictly through Facebook promotion, because I understand targeting. I can no longer do that because I'm censored and shadowbanned on Facebook.\\n\\nStone invited Breitbart News patrons to support his legal defense fund.\\n\\nI had to set up a legal defense fund: StoneDefenseFund.com, said Stone. Or you can go to WhoFramedRogerStone.com. They both go lead to the same place. That's the only authorized place if you want to help me and my family.\\n\\nStone pleaded, I'm broke. I'm looking at $2 million in legal bills to try to not spend the rest of my life in prison on some kind of trumped up phony political charges because I supported Donald Trump for president, and because I helped bring down the most evil, corrupt, foul-mouthed, self-centered, short-tempered kleptocrat in American history: Hillary Rotten Clinton.\\n\\nStone pondered FBI Director Chris Wray's possible involvement in the FBI raid of his home.\\n\\nObvious question: Did the FBI Director Christopher Wray approve this raid? asked Stone. And if so, why? There's a question for the president. Who approved this? They have to have spent half a million dollars. Who approved this? Christopher Wray may be the president's worst appointment. He's a deep stater. He didn't vote for Donald Trump. He doesn't support Donald Trump. Why is this guy the FBI director? I don't really get it.\\n\\nStone went on, Matthew Whitaker seems to me to be a good man. He's got authority to act, right now. He has an out of control federal prosecutor who he could limit to Russian collusion based on previous legal decisions, but he doesn't seem to do so.\\n\\nStone concluded, This isn't about me. It's about the president. They're coming for him. Anybody who doesn't see that is naive, and they want me out of the way because I will speak out against it.

{"original": "Attorneys for Amber Heard filed a defamation lawsuit on Friday against comedian Doug Stanhope that included yet more details of alleged abuse against her husband Johnny Depp.\\n\\nHeard's new lawsuit came less than a week after the Stanhope, a longtime friend of the Pirates of the Caribbean star, accused Heard of blackmailing Depp in a column published in The Wrap on May 29.\\n\\nDepp has hit and kicked Heard on numerous occasions, has thrown objects at her, at one point nearly suffocated her to the point where she feared for her life, Heard's new lawsuit claims.\\n\\nDepp is an alcoholic and drug addict, and these violent episodes occurred mostly after Depp had relapsed into a cycle of substance abuse. His drug and alcohol abuse has increased dramatically in recent years, as has his violent behavior.\\n\\nHeard repeatedly returned to Depp, despite his verbal and physical mistreatment of her, hoping optimistically that the man she married would change his behavior, the lawsuit reportedly continues.

{"original": "The number of young girls in Somalia subject to female genital mutilation (FGM) has soared in recent weeks amid lockdown measures imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, according to a report from the children's rights organization Plan International on Monday.\\n\\nDespite lockdown measures being imposed, circumcisers – locals who mutilate the girls at their parents' request – are reportedly working door-to-door to tend to girls stuck at home during the pandemic, leading to a large increase in the number of mutilations taking place.\\n\\nWe've seen a massive increase in recent weeks, said Sadia Allin, Plan International's head of mission in Somalia. We want the government to ensure FGM is included in all Covid [Chinese coronavirus] responses.\\n\\nUnder normal circumstances, FGM typically takes place during school holidays or in rural areas, as the procedure is technically illegal in Somalia, although very few cases are actually prosecuted.\\n\\nThe lockdown is being seen as an opportune time for the procedure to be carried out in the home with ample time for healing, Allin continued. The economic turndown is also motivating the cutters to resort to harmful livelihood options, and they are knocking door to door to cut girls.\\n\\nA strictly Islamic country, Somalia has the highest rate of FGM worldwide, with around 98 percent of women victims of the procedure. According to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), FGM is defined as all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injuries to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\\n\\nThese non-medical reasons typically include supposedly protecting a Muslim girl's modesty by depriving her of sexual pleasure. The practice offers no health benefits and can result in severe pain, hemorrhage, genital tissue swelling, fever, infections, and urinary problems. In the long term, it can also lead to urinary and vaginal problems, as well as an increased risk of childbirth complications.\\n\\nOne of the cases we have recorded is of two sisters aged 8 and 9 who was cut last week and who are still trying to come to terms with what happened to them, Allin explained. Their mother, like many parents, views cutting as an essential part of a girls' cultural and gender identity, a precondition for marriage and most importantly a religious rite of passage.\\n\\nAround 200 million women are victims of the procedure worldwide. According to the United Nations Population Fund, the coronavirus pandemic could drastically increase the number of girls subject to the barbaric procedure, leading to potentially two million more cases over the next decade that otherwise would not have taken place.\\n\\nEvery girl and woman should have the autonomy and necessary knowledge to be able to make free and informed decisions about her body, Allin concluded.\\n\\nIt is crucial to engage families, communities and traditional and religious leaders in changing attitudes and norms around this harmful practice, she added. We need to ensure it is no longer perceived to be acceptable, beneficial, or tolerated and is instead condemned as a human rights violation which needs to be eliminated.\\n\\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com"}
{"original": "America's ever-deepening college debt problem is really a symptom of a worse malady: our societal addiction to college itself.\\n\\nAny sober assessment of the facts would indicate that too many Americans are going to college. As a result, college costs—and debt—have skyrocketed while the rewards for college have plunged.\\n\\nYet this is something that has escaped the attention of our political elites. And, as it turns out, our financial and cultural elites—as the recent college admissions scandal indicates. Many Democrats want to double-down, promising free college to young people—a euphemism for college funded by taxpayers.\\n\\nPerhaps surprisingly, Ivy-league educated Ivanka Trump has recently come out as a skeptic about America's love affair with college. The first daughter has taken up a leadership role in the Trump administration's workforce development efforts—and shown a remarkable candidness when it comes to our college problem.\\n\\nI think culturally, for a long time we have created and perpetuated the narrative that there is one pathway to achieving the American dream and its four-year university, Ms. Trump said in a recent interview.\\n\\nTrump goes on:\\n\\nThat has been instilled into American students, it's often American parents that feel that is the only viable path. So you have kids going into school racking up enormous amounts of student debt that they'll often take decades if there ever able to pay it off without a skill, if they ultimately graduate. So I think opening up the prism and saying there are many different pathways. It depends what you want in your life and taking the stigma away from those who choose alternative pathways who choose technical schools, vocational education. At the end of the day, it's about connecting workers with their passion, with their jobs. There's very little opportunity for somebody who wants to the vocational route, the technical route because all the money pushes you into a four-year college system.\\n\\nJust as her father drew attention to the incredibly bad hand American industrial workers had been dealt by decades of anti-American trade deals, Ms. Trump is drawing attention to the bad hand the U.S. has dealt our young people.\\n\\nThe facts are stark. Over the past 40 years, the U.S. has doubled the share of high school graduates who go on to get college degrees. Forty-six percent of high school graduates receive degrees from four-year colleges, and another 24 percent get degrees from two-year colleges.\\n\\nThis increase in college education, however, has come at a steep cost. The relative benefits of a college degree have been declining for nearly two decades, while costs have been escalating. College graduates still earn more than high school graduates and are less likely to be unemployed—but the gap has been contracting.\\n\\nAnd the income and employment benefits may overstate the lifetime effects of college degrees. The college wealth premium—the amount of extra wealth college graduates have accumulate the course of their lifetime—has declined even more rapidly than the income and employment premium, according to a recent study by the Federal Reserve. And among blacks, Hispanics, Asians—that is, everyone except whites—there is no wealth premium at all, the study found.\\n\\nAfter ten years, nearly one-third of college graduates wind up in a job that does not require a college degree, the Wall Street Journal reports.\\n\\nThat should not be surprising. It demonstrates that the supply of college graduates has outpaced demand, which is exactly what you would expect would happen when ample subsidies and societal pressure are applied to increase college attendance. When, as Ms. Trump put it, all the money pushes you into a four-year college system.\\n\\nThe average sticker-price of a four-year college, including room and board, is now $50,000 per year. As Barron's Jack Hough recently pointed out, $200,000 in cash invested in the name of a 22 year old would produce a $3 million retirement nest egg by the age of 68, if the money is invested at about a 6% year return.\\n\\nThis high price is being financed by debt. On average, a college graduate owes twice as much debt as she did twenty years ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. Educational loans now amount to more than $1.5 trillion. More than one out of ten student loan borrowers will default on their loans.\\n\\nFederal Reserve economists recently studied the impact all that debt is having on those aged 24 to 32. They found that while it plays a significant role in keeping young people from buying homes, although other factors—including the high price of homes—were more important.\\n\\nIn surveys, young adults commonly report that their student loan debts are preventing them from buying a home, Fed researchers Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, and Kamila Sommer found. Our estimates suggest that increases in student loan debt are an important factor in explaining their lowered homeownership rates, but not the central cause of the decline.\\n\\nThis is having a profound effect on American society. People are getting married later, which reduces the number of children they have. Women, in particular, delay marriage when they bear lots of student debt. And a significant number of people who say they do not want children cited student debt as the reason.\\n\\nTwenty-two percent of college graduates were delayed by at least two years in moving out of a family member's home due to their student loans, a survey of millennials by the National Association of Realtors found. More than half of respondents said they were delayed in continuing their education or starting a family due to student loan debt.\\n\\nBernie Sanders and others who have endorsed the idea of relieving students of the burden of paying for college address the debt side of the problem only. And it's not clear that this is really much progress at all since professors will still have to be paid, buildings maintained, textbooks purchased. So while a student might not have to foot the bill, that debt will need to be borne by workers—which is really just a transformation of individual debt into higher taxes. And if history is any experience, the government will not effectively be able to contain the burgeoning costs. If anything, quite the opposite: cost increases will accelerate once individuals no longer see the bills.\\n\\nThere's no such thing as a free lunch, even if in a college cafeteria.\\n\\nThe first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. We have a problem, as Ms. Trump has indicated. Others in Washington, DC, should take note."}

Surachate described the father as being a governor in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nHe has 10 children. He said the daughter might feel neglected sometimes, Surachate said.

At least a thousand vehicles passed through a toll booth on the edge of Wuhan overnight. Air passengers were packed aboard planes crewed by attendants wearing masks, goggles, and gloves.\\n\\nSchools are still closed, temperatures are checked when people enter buildings and masks are strongly encouraged. City leaders say they want to simultaneously bring back social and commercial life while avoiding a second wave of infections, VOA reported.\\n\\nWuhan residents told VOA the end of the lockdown was a tremendous achievement and the city's recovery is a testament to the strong will of its people.\\n\\nChinese state media insisted all necessary precautions have been taken while sticking to the Communist Party line that the coronavirus has been effectively wiped out in Wuhan. The Global Times celebrated the hustle and bustle of crowds returning to Wuhan's streets, writing fondly of energy, laughter, and constant intimate arguments filling the air as the naturally chirpy and rambunctious people of Wuhan emerged from quarantine.\\n\\nThe Global Times detailed the surge of outbound traffic from the city:\\n\\nFollowing thorough maintenance checks and reviews, in total 230 bullet trains are being made ready for departure, according to local media reports. Local authorities also announced on Tuesday that starting from 00:00 on April 8, Wuhan will lift 75 checkpoints designated to control outbound flows and resume normal function of 15 major traffic security checkpoints, while random inspection work would be carried out in line with epidemic prevention and control work. The city's transport authority also warned on Tuesday that lifting the outbound travel ban does not mean relaxation of epidemic measures. Those who do not need to leave Wuhan to resume work should avoid going out, otherwise, those who need to go out and resume work need to make plans regarding travel routes in order to avoid massive gatherings and traffic jams. About 55,000 people are estimated to leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday, most of whom are heading to the Pearl River Delta, home to many of China's warehouses. The first train will go to Nanning, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at 7:06 am, according to the local railway authority.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Global Times said arduous prevention techniques are still in place because China has to deal with those pesky imported cases plus a few hard-to-detect asymptomatic local carriers:\\n\\nLocal officials in Wuhan have warned earlier that they should prevent relapses of infection cases due to lifting the city lockdown, especially after the country has made visible progress in containing the virus. Mi Feng, spokesperson of the National Health Commission, said on Tuesday that the country has reported no new confirmed cases, no new suspected cases and no new deaths on Monday, and domestic critically ill cases have dropped below 200 for the first time since the outbreak. However, there have been sporadic infection cases in the country for several days. While the epidemic situation is worsening in Europe and the US, imported cases surpassed domestic ones [in China], bringing pressure for treatment, prevention and control work, testings as well as quarantine measures, he said.\\n\\nAnother Global Times piece on Wednesday told cities like Milan and New York to look upon Wuhan as a shining example that proves this invisible enemy, while extremely dangerous and tough, can be beaten and that there is indeed a bright light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\nThe Global Times repeated the assertion that Wuhan has zero confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and invited outsiders to visit the reinvigorated city:\\n\\nWhile this is far from declaring a victory given the persistent risks and challenges ahead, the move on Wednesday marks the biggest step yet for not just Wuhan but the entire world since the outbreak. It is a moment when Wuhan residents can finally shout out to the world: We are back! It is a moment that shows the world that we can beat this common enemy, though we have to pay a huge price. For Wuhan, this means its residents are now allowed to leave the city and others are welcome to visit. It means one of the largest transportation hubs in the nation is open for business again. It means millions of businesses in the city – small and large, service providers and manufacturers – can further pick up the pace to resume their operations. It means Wuhan is finally on the fast track to a full recovery.\\n\\nAfter chastising New York and Milan for being a little slow to implement the kind of lockdown measures that ostensibly kept infections to a minimum in Wuhan, the Global Times concluded by restating the Communist Party line: China has and will continue to seek cooperation with other countries. We hope all countries can put aside their political differences and work jointly toward the same goal – defeating this common enemy and restarting the global economy.\\n\\nThe People's Daily celebrated the reopening of Wuhan with an ill-advised tweet inviting the world to have a taste of Wuhan and let the mouth-watering specialties in Wuhan satisfy your stomach. The tweet was hastily deleted on Wednesday after heated criticism and mockery.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times on Tuesday cited local reports that suggested Wuhan hospitals are discharging coronavirus patients too early and officials are downplaying the number of both asymptomatic cases and obvious infections.\\n\\nSources in Wuhan said medical staff have been instructed not to publicly declare coronavirus cases, and in one case that reached social media, a hospital refused to admit an elderly man who needed treatment for other issues because it evidently did not trust his negative test results from the coronavirus treatment center that discharged him.\\n\\nDespite a flood of Chinese state media reports that Wuhan residents are jubilant over the end of the lockdown, the flood of couples expected to seek marriage certificates after the lockdown was lifted did not materialize. Wuhan registered hundreds of marriages each day before the pandemic, but on Tuesday when the marriage registration office reopened after two months, only a handful of people applied. Some of this was blamed on glitches in the smartphone application couples were told to use when they set up an appointment at the registration office."}
{"original": "All but seven House Democrats voted Friday for a bill which ends legal and civic rights for women by allowing men who say they are transgender to freely use women's legal rights, sports leagues, institutions, and private spaces.\\n\\nThe radical policy pushed by Democrats ensured that only Republicans in the House debate defended the rights of women and girls to have female-only civic institutions, including sports clubs, private bathing, and shelters.\\n\\nDemocrats applauded themselves for voting to free individuals' from civil society and from biology and repeatedly denied the GOP arguments that the legislation would endanger religious freedom, children's health, parents' authority, women's rights, and female sports. Seven Democrats dodged the vote, while 228 Democrats voted to change the legal definition of women.\\n\\nThe legislation, dubbed H.R. 5 or The Equality Act, is unlikely to get through the GOP-led Senate. But it marks the Democratic Party's almost unanimous support for the revolutionary claim that every American must accept that each person's legal sex will be determined by the individual's current choice of gender identity.\\n\\nThe Democrats added the transgender ideology to a bill which extends current anti-discrimination law to gays and lesbians.\\n\\nThe few GOP legislators who spoke during the debate were largely silent about the extension of rights for gays and lesbians. The handful of GOP legislators who spoke mostly focused their criticism on the legislation's attempt to override portions of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act and on the gender ideology's impact on women and women's sports.\\n\\nThe GOP leadership stayed out of view. GOP Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, for example, did not speak against the legislation — even though it would make it legally risky for parents or doctors to question a child's claim to have an opposite-sex gender identity or deny an unhappy teenager's demand for risky sex-related medical treatments.\\n\\nMedical experts point to growing evidence that sex-related medical treatments are very hazardous to teenagers, including teenagers who would likely be gay or lesbian.\\n\\nIn contrast, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer emotionally backed the extraordinary gender identity legislation that blurs the evolved legal and civic distinctions between women and men, boys and girls.\\n\\nTime Mag. endorses transgender activist who claimed that 'women' can have male sexual organs.

But Trump is aggressively defending those laws. https://t.co/pCzXHsyuny — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\\n\\nEight Republicans voted for the gender ideology. They included Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, Indiana's Susan Brooks, Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzgerald, Texas's Will Hurd, as well as John Katko, Tom Reed, and Elise Stefanik from New York.\\n\\nHowever, the eight-member GOP vote for the transgender claims counts as a partial success for a series of conservative organizations amid passivity from GOP leaders and GOP donors, and amid hostility from progressives, gay advocacy groups, the established media, and the well-funded transgender advocacy groups. Without the conservative groups, many additional GOP legislators would have gone along with the establishment pressure.\\n\\nThe GOP legislators who led the opposition included California's Rep. Tom McClintock, Missouri's Rep. Vicky Hartzler, Arizona's Rep. Debbie Lesko, and North Carolina's Rep. Virginia Foxx.\\n\\nHartzler, a former track coach, said:\\n\\nThis bill legalizes discrimination, government-imposed, top-down discrimination against those with time-honored views of marriage and gender. … [it will] dismantle female athletics … men are taking home the gold in women's sports.\\n\\nLesko said the bill:\\n\\nIt would allow anyone, at any time, to declare that he or she is a member of the oppo sex without any medical or psychological diagnosis … It would erase women's and girls' rights by requiring facilities, such as schools, churches, dormitories, domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, to allow biological males who identify as women, in women's bathrooms, women's and girls' shelters, women's and girls' showers, and in women's locker rooms. This will indeed violate women's' privacy and can ultimately violate their safety … [it] will eliminate women's and girls' sports … will also require, require, doctors to provide sex change surgeries and sex change hormones to adolescents without parental consent and without a medical or psychological diagnosis. This could permanently sterilize young girls … Congress should only pass laws that protect women, not threaten, silence or abandon them.\\n\\nMcClintock said that bill is intended to prevent children from getting good medical advice against sex-altering surgery and is intended to ensure that girls cannot exclude males from their sports. This is the brave new world that House Democrats propose under the name of equality. He said:\\n\\nThis bill harms people in so many ways – destroying safe spaces for women, undermining women-owned business, intimidating the free exercise of conscience. But let me concentrate on only one aspect — the destructive impact it has on women's' sports. Wherever these laws are imposed, biological males have begun to dominate women's competition. Listen to 16-year-old Celina Soul of Connecticut: Eight of us lined up at the starting line, but when six of us were only 3.4 into the race, two girls were already across the finish line. What just happened? Two boys identifying as girls happened. Fair is no longer the norm. The chance to advance, the chance to win has been all over for us. I missed the chance to compete in the NE championship this past season because of this … this policy will take away our medals, record, scholarships, and dreams.\\n\\nRep. Doug Collins, the top-ranking GOP member on the House Judiciary Committee said:\\n\\nAllowing men to compete against women in sports. … is demoralizing because it makes [women's] talent irrelevant. … Never before in American history has a political party tried so dramatically to rewrite the federal civil rights laws to include an undefined, self-referential ideological term called gender identity in the U.S. code, applicable to literally any entity that receives federal assistance, including elementary schools, colleges, and healthcare centers.\\n\\nFoxx warned the legislators, saying: This a classic something of passing something now and figuring out what it means later. if the devil is in the details, we are in for a lot of devilish surprises.\\n\\nEstablished media outlets ignored the purpose and likely impact of the transgender ideology.\\n\\nThe House passed a bill Friday, 236-173, extending federal anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ Americans, Politico announced.

Listen to the story of Selina Soule, a high school athlete from Connecticut who was directly impacted by a similar law. #INEqualityAct https://t.co/ZRM25Twwly — CWA LAC (@CWforA) May 16, 2019\\n\\nBackground Facts and Figures on Transgender Ideology:\\n\\nIn general, the transgender ideology says a person's sex is determined by their gender identity, not their biology. The ideology also insists that men and women are more or less identical, and it objects to the public's view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal. The transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing transgender rights laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that women and girls are different — and have different priorities — than men and boys.\\n\\nTransgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo transition surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study. A Pentagon report commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that rates for genital surgery are exceedingly low- 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.\\n\\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have competing goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, troubled teenage girls trying to flee womanhood, and people trying to de-transition back to their sex. It also includes men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women's rights, parents eager to support transgender claims, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, revenue-seeking drug companies, and medical service providers.\\n\\nPolls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.\\n\\nMultiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology's claim that people's legal sex is determined by their feeling of gender identity, not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of sympathy for people who say they are transgender alongside lopsided opposition to the ideology.\\n\\nYet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\\n\\nThe progressive push to bend Americans' attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of gender identity has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.\\n\\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents' rights in childrearing, children's safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women's ideals of beauty, culture and civil society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men's sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children's sexual privacy."}

Jay Inslee (D-WA) announced last week and is trying to cast himself as a pragmatist who can also take on President Donald Trump. Though as governor Hickenlooper prided himself for staying above partisan fights, he has argued his record as a former governor and big-city mayor distinguishes him from a broad field of Democratic hopefuls who are backing ambitious liberal plans on health care, taxes and the climate.\\n\\nHickenlooper has hedged on supporting Democrat rallying cries like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal to combat climate change. He once worked as a geologist for a petroleum company and was roundly criticized for telling a congressional panel he drank fracking fluid while arguing for the safety of the energy extraction technique.\\n\\nIt was after Hickenlooper was laid off from his geologist position during the energy bust of the 1980s that he inadvertently started on his road to politics. He opened a brewpub in a then-desolate stretch of downtown Denver that unexpectedly took off. That enabled Hickenlooper to become wealthy by building a mini-empire of restaurants and bars. It also led to him making a successful run for Denver mayor in 1993.\\n\\nHis first term was marked by a series of disasters and tragedies, some of which he alluded to in his launch video — record wildfires and floods, the assassination of his own prison chief and the 2012 Aurora theater shooting, which killed 12. After that attack and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting massacre in Connecticut months later, Hickenlooper called for gun control legislation and signed bills requiring universal background checks and limiting magazine capacity to 15 rounds.\\n\\nHe backed civil unions for gay couples and signed a law providing them in Colorado in 2013, before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Hickenlooper announced in 2013 that he opposed the death penalty and refused to execute a quadruple-murderer who was on death row. And, as he prepared to leave office and was openly mulling a presidential bid, he ordered the state to adopt California's low-emission vehicle standards to fight climate change.\\n\\nIn the run-up to his announcement, Hickenlooper has repeatedly taken aim at President Trump's policies and personal-style. In a January 31 interview with CNN Tonight, the Colorado Democrat claimed the president has divided the U.S. more than it has been divided in the past century.\\n\\nI think, if you look at President Trump, he has divided the country worst than it's ever been divided in its history — or at least certainly for — in the last 100 years.

{"original": "Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, chief of the Afghan Taliban, has instructed his top officials to avoid second, third, and fourth marriage if there is no need. Constant requests from Taliban officials for extra money to pay for multiple wives reportedly prompted the order.\\n\\n\\n\\nVoice of America News (VOA) obtained Akhundzada's order, written in the Pashtun language, from two Taliban officials. They said they were instructed to share the order with their subordinates.\\n\\nFamilies of several officials of the Islamic Emirate do not have a lot of money. Therefore, more marriages could affect their prestige, trustworthiness, and personality, the Taliban chief instructed his subordinates.\\n\\nOne of VOA's sources said Akhundzada grew weary of the many complaints he received from Taliban officials who needed financial assistance to pay the dowry for multiple wives. Among the Pashtun tribes of Afghanistan, it is customary for the groom to pay a bride price to the bride's family. The going rate for a bride is currently as high as $26,000 U.S.\\n\\nThe source also said Taliban officials are requesting money to pay for separate houses for each of their wives and substantial upkeep costs for them. High-ranking officials have developed a taste for holding elaborate weddings, which is not only a drain on the Taliban treasury but also brings bad publicity to an organization that presents itself to the public as a union of austere, heavily-armed religious scholars.\\n\\nAkhundzada's letter alluded to the bad press these lavish Taliban weddings have generated by advising his officials to protect themselves against accusation and disgrace, including allegations of bribery, misappropriation, and embezzlement, and prioritize gaining trust from the public.\\n\\nVOA noted that the Taliban's version of Islamic law technically allows for men to take up to four wives, but Akhundzada stressed that his injunction against taking more than one had been approved by religious scholars. Along those lines, he pointed out that the companions of Muhammad were known for having simple marriages.\\n\\nAkhundzada's letter mentioned that exceptions could be made for men who seek to marry widows, provided they keep the costs down and convince the public they are spending their own money rather than dipping into the Taliban treasury.\\n\\nThe Taliban has grown extremely wealthy over the past few years, banking huge profits from illegal drugs, illegal mining operations, extorting taxes from the parts of Afghanistan they control, collecting hefty financial donations from supporters in the Middle East, and partnering with the criminal Haqqani Network. They also receive heavy financial support from governments like Russia and China.\\n\\nA confidential NATO report reviewed by Radio Free Europe (RFE) in September estimated the Taliban raked in $1.6 billion last year, an impressive sum when measured against the legitimate Afghan government's budget of $5.5 billion. The cost of multiple wives must be skyrocketing to put significant stress on such a huge income stream.\\n\\nUnless global action is taken, the Taliban will remain a hugely wealthy organization, with a self-sustaining funding stream and outside support from regional countries. Its role as a destabilizing force, not only in South Asia but globally, will only be enhanced by the withdrawal of the United States from the Afghan theater, and its expected return to the power equation in Kabul, the NATO report warned."}

Rape is a weapon even more powerful than a bomb or a bullet, she said.\\n\\nThese women are victims of the most atrocious abuse of power that you can imagine, she said. In Eastern Congo, she said more than 200,000 women and children were raped during periods of conflict.\\n\\nShe said these rapes and sexual crimes often tear at the fabric of a society.\\n\\nWomen, if they survive, she said, rarely tell anyone, since they could be shunned from their families and their societies. If a woman becomes pregnant from a rape, her husband will often throw her out of the house, or become abusive towards her and the child.\\n\\nMore than 50,000 children have been born of rape in Eastern Congo, she added.\\n\\nIn Rwanda, where up to half a million women and children were violently raped, assaulted, or murdered, she said when peacekeeping troops arrived, things did not necessarily get better. Peacekeeping soldiers recruited girls in refugee camps for sex work, she said.\\n\\nWhen the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) took over the Sinjar Province in northern Iraq, they captured 3,000 Yezidi women, and sold them in open markets for sexual slavery, she said.\\n\\nWomen were sold 25 to 30 times within one year, she explained. A Yezidi gynecologist in Iraq told her that she met a woman who had tried to escape an ISIS camp with her friend. Her friend was beheaded right in front of her.\\n\\nAs in Congo, women who become pregnant are considered dirty and tainted, and their babies considered evil. Either they have to abandon their children, or leave their families, she said. The women have no recourse.\\n\\nWomen become victims of war in other ways, by stigmatizing and isolating them from society, Arriaga went on to say.\\n\\nShe said in Afghanistan, there are at least 2.5 million widows — many of them children who were forced into marriage early. As widows, they are seen as signs of bad luck. Since the vast majority of them cannot read or write, they are forced to beg on the streets.\\n\\nShe said religious freedom in a country helps women. One of the most significant improvers of life for women in these countries is religious freedom.\\n\\nFor example, she said, according to Sharia law, when a husband dies, the husband's family takes everything, but if there is religious plurality in a society, there is recourse for a woman.\\n\\nArriaga also urged young people to educate themselves on these atrocities, so that they can lobby their policymakers, or perhaps become a lawmaker themselves.\\n\\nNo life is worth living if it is not given to others, she said."}

{"original": "As Jussie Smollett's apparently fraudulent hate crime house of cards collapsed in spectacular fashion recently, it was awkward timing for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to release the latest incarnation of its notoriously controversial hate map.\\n\\nBy recklessly keeping the nation in a perpetual state of agitation on matters of race, immigration and gender, the SPLC all but guarantees that we will get more fake hate crimes in the future. This will only serve to polarize the nation even further, and it needs to end immediately.\\n\\nTo be sure, there are fringe groups in our country that truly espouse hatred, and they deserve to be marginalized. Fighting groups such as the Ku Klux Klan several decades ago gave the SPLC stature and credibility. Sadly, the SPLC has squandered that heritage by now acting as a left-wing thought police bully, hurling the hate group slur at people and organizations who simply have different political views.\\n\\nHate groups are on the rise! That was the message from breathless reporting on the new hate map by media enthusiastic to advance the SPLC's narrative. Why are hate groups allegedly on the rise? One reason might be that the SPLC has watered down the definition of a hate group to the point where anyone advancing a traditional or pro-American position is deemed guilty.\\n\\nNumerous Christian churches have been added to the SPLC's list along with racial supremacist groups, under the guise that these religious groups are anti-LGBT. Have these churches ever committed acts of violence against LGBT Americans? No, most simply believe, because of their religious faith, that marriage should be between a man and a woman.\\n\\nTargeted groups quickly find that character assassination is just the beginning. The SPLC's ultimate goal is to destroy the groups on its hate map by bankrupting them through online de-platforming and encouraging banks, insurance companies and other vendors to treat them as pariahs. This is modern-day racketeering on a scale that would make Al Capone proud.\\n\\nMy own organization, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), has been targeted by the SPLC. Our crime? Defending the interests of American citizens and legal immigrants of all backgrounds while politicians, corporations and well-funded advocacy groups exploit our laws to benefit foreign nationals. The SPLC has come down firmly on the side of illegal aliens, many of whom drive down wages for Americans, act as a drain on our social services and commit felonies that injure or kill innocent Americans.\\n\\nAnother reason why hate crimes might be on the rise is because being a self-appointed hate crime watchdog is a highly profitable enterprise. The poverty part of SPLC's name reeks of Orwellian irony, as the group has raised nearly a half-billion dollars in donations from the likes of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and actor George Clooney. This is in addition to the cozy relationship the SPLC enjoys as the trusted flagger for Big Tech giants, serving as judge, jury and executioner for content on platforms like Google and Facebook. An IRLI investigation revealed that the Department of Defense was using SPLC manuals for its employee training on hate groups and hate crimes until the practice was discontinued in 2017.\\n\\nFor all those who hyperventilate at the unveiling of the latest SPLC hate map, there is an alarming and ever-growing list of fake hate crimes since Donald Trump has been president. Many of these incidents get lavish media coverage when they occur. Significantly less coverage is given when they are later revealed to be the work of politically motivated scam artists.\\n\\nSo why did Jussie Smollett think he could get away with what appears to be a shameless hate crime hoax? Maybe because thanks in part to the SPLC seeing hate under every rock, there is a huge upside to being seen as the victim in 2019 America. When the alleged attackers check the right boxes—in this case white, male Trump supporters—there is no shortage of media talking heads willing to believe it. Only because Smollett's apparent hoax was so implausible did it cause even those wishing it to be true to balk.\\n\\nMuch like it appears with Smollett, the SPLC has been crying wolf to excess with its nonstop accusations of hate. The fact is that most Americans just want to live their lives in peace alongside their neighbors, regardless of their color, faith or orientation. It is only when seen through the politically agenda-driven lens of the SPLC and the mainstream media that America looks like a hopeless cauldron of hate and division. Instead of being treated as a watchdog for extremism, the SPLC should be shunned as the irresponsible, hyper-partisan and financially-motivated extremist group it is.\\n\\nDale L.

{"original": "ROME — Exposing the errors of gender theory is of the utmost urgency for the future of humanity and of Christianity, a Dutch cardinal told an assembly of Catholics in Rome Thursday.\\n\\nCardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk, the archbishop of Utrecht, said that gender theory is a modern development which sets the city of the human race against the City of God, and the world order against the Christian faith, in an address to the Rome Life Forum on the theme City of man vs City of God – Global One World Order vs Christendom, organized by Voice of the Family.\\n\\nThe fact that public opinion today readily accepts the total detachment of gender from biological sex is the result of a 'cocktail' of hyper-individualism and its autonomous ethic, the cardinal said, along with a particular vision of man, today particularly dominant in the English-speaking world.\\n\\nThis viewpoint reduces the human person, whether consciously or unconsciously, to the mind, Eijk said, that is, the rational consciousness and center of the autonomous will, in fact of the highly complex biochemical and neurophysiological functions in the superior nuclei and cortex of the brain.\\n\\nThe ensuing materialistic vision of the human person sees the body as something secondary, not essential for the human person, he said. The 'mind,' as the autonomous human person, determines the purpose and significance of the body, hence also gender identity, without needing to take account of the biological sex of the body.\\n\\nThis vision of almost absolute autonomy fails to take into account that human freedom today is strongly conditioned by the education provided by parents and teachers as well as the influence of friends, public opinion and the mass and social media, he noted.\\n\\nFrom the Christian perspective, the human person is not just its mind, Eijk said, but the union of a spiritual and a material dimension, soul and body. The human person is neither merely its soul, or merely its body, but corpore e anima unus (the union of soul and body).\\n\\nThe human body, he continued, is not a raw datum but, because it belongs to the being of the human person, has its own purposes and meanings which the human person cannot change.\\n\\nChristianity teaches that God made man in his own image, in the image of God He created him; man and female he created them (Gen. 1:27). Men and women are complementary, a fact that extends beyond the spheres of marriage and procreation, the cardinal said, but pertains also to biopsychic differences in their relationship as spouses and with third parties and society as a whole.\\n\\nFurther along, Genesis states: That is why a man is destined to leave his father and mother and cling to his wife instead, so that the two become one flesh (Gen. 2:24), Eijk noted.\\n\\nThe remedy against discrimination and contempt for women, he added, is not obtained by denying the biological and psychological identity of men and women, but through conversion to the recognition that both man and woman are primarily human persons with the same dignity, both created in the image of God.\\n\\nFor obvious reason, the cardinal concluded, gender theory, which detaches gender from biological sex, radically contradicts the Church's teaching that the place of a sexual relationship can only be between a man and woman, within matrimony, and must always be open to procreation.\\n\\nGender theory, which has its origin in radical feminism, also promotes the legality of procured abortion – employing the euphemistic terms of sexual and reproductive rights – to prevent a woman who has become unintentionally pregnant from being compelled to assume the role of a mother, viewed as a role imposed on women in the past in Western society and still today in many countries in the world, he said.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

If Omar did marry her brother, she could be found guilty of committing marriage fraud — a felony offense punishable with a prison sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000. The three government agencies said they would not confirm the existence of any ongoing or potential investigation. Congresswoman Omar's office did not respond to request for comment but she has repeatedly denied the allegations — calling them disgusting lies.\\n\\nThe Post's story was first reported by The Blaze.\\n\\nOmar previously claimed that she married Ahmed Hirsi in an Islamic ceremony in 2002, though the couple never married legally. The pair separated in 2008 and later remarried, legally, in 2018. The Minnesota Democrat then legally married Elmi in 2009. After the two wed, Elmi enrolled at North Dakota State University, reported blogger David Steinberg.\\n\\nThe Post's report comes after Omar formally divorced Ahmed Hirsi in November, one month after filing a petition stating there had been an irretrievable breakdown in their marriage. The two were married since January 2018 but had been longtime partners. Hirsi is the father of three children with her.\\n\\nOmar filed for divorce after the Post first reported allegations that she was involved in an extramarital affair with political strategist Tim Mynett. In August, Mynett's wife filed for divorce after the consultant allegedly confessed to her that he was romantically involved with Omar and revealed he was in love with the freshman congresswoman.\\n\\nIn a counterclaim, Mynett alleged his estranged wife made up the story as part of a negative campaign to seemingly in an effort to ruin his career.\\n\\nThe alleged affair could pose legal problems for Omar, who is the subject of a formal complaint from a conservative watchdog that accuses the lawmaker of illegally using campaign money to conduct her alleged affair with Mynett.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported:\\n\\nFederal campaign finance records show that Omar's campaign has paid nearly $230,000 since 2018 to the E. Street Group, a political strategy firm of which the lawmaker's alleged married lover, Tim Mynett, is a partner of. On Tuesday, Mynett's wife, Dr. Beth Jordan Mynett, filed for divorce in a D.C.-area court, alleging her spouse confessed to having an affair with Omar in April, the same month FEC documents show that the lawmaker's campaign began issuing payments to E. Street Group for travel expenses. According to FEC filings, the Minnesota Democrat's campaign made eight payments totaling $21,547 to E. Street Group for travel costs between April and June. The divorce filings, first reported by the New York Post, also states Tim Mynett made a shocking declaration of love for the Minnesota Democrat to his wife and left her soon after. The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), the right-leaning non-profit group behind the complaint against Omar, alleges the timelines of the affair and travel payments overlap. As per FEC guidelines, lawmakers are forbidden from using campaign money for personal travel expenses unless the candidate pays the money back using their personal funds.\\n\\nIf Ilhan for Congress reimbursed Mynett's LLC for travel so that Rep. Omar would have the benefit of Mynett's romantic companionship, the expenditures must be considered personal in nature, reads the complaint. Rep. Omar's filings do not reveal subsequent reimbursements for Mynett's travel.\\n\\nNeither Omar or her office have commented on the Post's report or the complaint."}
{"original": "Britain could cut net migration by 100,000 a year after leaving the European Union by implementing some very simple policy changes, the head of a leading migration watchdog has claimed.\\n\\nWriting in The Spectator, Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, says that in the event of Brexit Britain would be able to significantly reduce migration by making small changes that are currently forbidden under EU law.\\n\\nLord Green says the main thing that needs to be controlled is work permits. If EU migrants were subjected to the same requirements as non-EU citizens it could sharply reduce immigration without damaging the economy.\\n\\nHe estimates that net migration could be cut by 100,000 a year just through this simple policy in a post-Brexit Britain.\\n\\nTourism would not suffer, he adds. Obviously, there would be no need to require tourist visas for EU citizens any more than we do for Americans now. Nor would there be any need for restrictions on students, or genuine marriage. Even freedom to live elsewhere could be protected: EU citizens could still come to live in the UK provided they had the means to support themselves.\\n\\nLord Green also argues that Britain should eschew an Australian points-based system if it wants to reduce immigration and instead adopt a tough system of work permits confined to the highly skilled while, as far as possible, preserving free movement in both directions for other purposes.\\n\\nIt would be enforced by extending current penalties (hefty fines and possible imprisonment) to any citizens – European or otherwise – who were found to be working here without a permit, he says.\\n\\nAnother advantage would be the ability to check all incomers to the UK against a watch list: criminals could be removed or deported in accordance with UK law, rather than much softer EU regulations.\\n\\nThe comments come after Migration Watch UK published a report today suggesting that up to half a million migrants could enter the UK after 2020 once they have been granted citizenship in other EU countries.\\n\\nThe report said that between 240,000 and 480,000 may travel to Britain thanks to EU free movement rules.\\n\\nWhile the UK has so far been largely shielded from the crisis in southern Europe, this potential flow can only add to the impact of migration which is already seriously affecting communities across the country, Lord Green said."}
{"original": "A Super PAC supporting Joe Biden poured more than one million dollars into Iowa in December to bolster the former vice president's standing in the first caucus state.\\n\\nUnite the Country, which was created by a foreign agent for the government of Azerbaijan in October, spent nearly $1.2 million to underwrite Biden's candidacy. The money was primarily spent on targeted ad buys throughout the month of December in Iowa, where Biden finds himself trailing both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\\n\\nThe PAC made its first large scale expenditure on December 6 when it paid Old Town Media LLC, a Virginia-based public relations firm, $623,922 for media placements. The payment was earmarked specifically for Iowa's media markets. On the same day that buy was made, the PAC also paid more than $31,000 to Putnam Partners, LLC., a Washington, D.C.-based political messaging company, for ad production. In total, the PAC spent more than $655,000 in one day, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\\n\\nBoth payments came as Unite the Country unveiled a new advertisement on YouTube titled Courage, touting the former vice president's support for marriage equality and ending violence against women, among others.\\n\\nSlightly more than a week after its first six-figure expenditure, the PAC made another large investment in Iowa, this time for more than half a million dollars. Unite the Country paid Old Town Media $500,000 on December 16 for media placements in the first caucus state. The following day, December 17, the group paid Putnam Partners a further $31,900.02 for ad production—bringing the PAC's spending total to more than $531,000 for the two days.\\n\\nOnce again, the expenditures coincided with the release of new ad by Unite the Country. This one, titled Refuse to Give Up, intermixes Biden's position on gun control with portions of a speech the former vice president delivered on the topic.\\n\\nOverall, in the week and a half time span between December 6 and December 17, Unite the Country spent more than $1.19 million to boost Biden's position in Iowa. It is unclear exactly how the PAC was able to raise such a large amount of money since launching on October 28. Reports of how much the group raised and spent have yet to be released by the FEC, provided they were filed by the appropriate campaign finance deadline.\\n\\nUnite the Country, which can raise and spend unlimited funds, was formed after Biden jettisoned opposition to help from outside super PACs amid anemic fundraising and sinking poll numbers. Larry Rasky, the PAC's founder, is a high-powered Washington, D.C. lobbyist with longstanding ties to the former vice president and his family. Prior to forming his own lobbying firm, Rasky served as the communications director for Biden's failed 2008 presidential campaign. Since joining the lobbying world, Rasky has signed on to represent corporate giants like IBM and the defense contractor Raytheon.\\n\\nRasky's initial decision to form Unite the Country was controversial because of his relationship with the government of Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic. In April 2019, the same month that Biden launched his presidential campaign, Rasky registered as a foreign agent to lobby on Azerbaijan's behalf. Officially, Rasky was to be paid $15,000-per-month for his services, according to documents filed with the Department of Justice (DOJ).\\n\\nIt remains uncertain if Rasky still works for the foreign regime, as his contract was scheduled to end in late-October, but had the possibility of being extended. Breitbart News was unable to find any records filed with the DOJ indicating his employment with Azerbaijan had ceased.\\n\\nThe super PAC's investment in Iowa comes after Biden's campaign signaled it would make an effort to win the state, despite having written it off earlier. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa, but still remains within striking distance of his top rivals.\\n\\nA recent poll out of the state, conducted shortly after Unite the Country made its initial ad buy, found Biden garnering 15 percent among Iowa Democrats. Biden trailed not only both Buttigieg (24 percent) and Sanders (21 percent) but also Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who landed in this third place with 18 percent support\\n\\nGiven the narrowness of the margin separating all of the candidates, Biden has launched a fullscale effort to catapult into first place ahead of the February caucuses. Unite the Country appears to be following suit, as evidenced by its heavy spending campaign.\\n\\nSomewhat ironically, though, Biden has attempted to improve his standing in Iowa by playing to the state's long history of backing populist causes and candidates. As such, the former vice president has lambasted lesser-known rivals, like billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, for using their personal fortunes to boost their White House ambitions.\\n\\nSince the day that this campaign launched, we have relied on grassroots support to power this campaign, Biden's team wrote when attacking Steyer, only days before Unite the Country launched its first six-figure ad buy in Iowa."}

{"original": "Sen. Marco Rubio's Road to Majority conference speech on Thursday hinted heavily toward his criticism of the Trump administration's negotiations with China, warning that American children could inherit a world dominated by the Asian power.\\n\\nThe Senator has been a harsh critic of the Trump administration's trade negotiations with China and of a potential deal lifting Trump administration-imposed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications company ZTE that could be lifted under a new deal.\\n\\nRubio spoke at the conference of seven decades ago, as the United States was coming out of WWII an optimistic nation. He continually looked to the podium throughout his speech. He continued saying that two years later the nation faced challenges that could soften that optimism. He then spoke of moves that led to economic advances as well as new families that drove the baby boom.\\n\\nHe then turned to the current day and the new set of challenges facing America today. He talked about jobs being transformed and eliminated by machines, technology and globalization.\\n\\nHe then pointed to new geopolitical challenger China for systematically executing on what the Soviet Union never could, supplanting the United States to become the world's premier technological, economic, geopolitical, and military power.\\n\\nHe said that while these are significant challenges, that they pale in comparison to recovering from the second world war or living under threat of a third.\\n\\nOur obstacle right now is of the institutions that make us strong have grown weak, said Rubio. Weakened by an economic elitism that has replaced a commitment to the dignity of work and cultural elitism, among other contributing factors. He said it has isolated us from one another and made people susceptible to conspiracy theories and a loss of patriotism. He argued that people are not being treated as people.\\n\\nRubio went on to describe four pillars of America's strength that are required to deal with any challenge that it faces.\\n\\nThe first pillar he listed was an economy that's built on the dignity of work.\\n\\nHe said today America's economic debate is based on a valueless financial self-interest and a view of Americans as simply consumers. He warned there are immense consequences to this view.\\n\\nHe spoke of American jobs and production of advanced goods in technology. We cannot allow China to cheat and to steal their way into a position of dominance in these industries.\\n\\nThe second pillar he identified as the family. He spoke of values and the percentage change in children born outside of a marriage, from fewer than five percent in the 1950s to over 40 percent today. He added that many families today are buffeted by economic pressures and social engineering. He lauded the Faith and Freedom Coalition and used these are reasoning for him fighting to expand the child tax credit and for fighting alongside Ivanka Trump to expand paid family leave\\n\\nThe third pillar of our strength Rubio listed was the ability to work together in community.\\n\\nRubio moved from talking about individualism that transcends the left into other areas of business and politics, to talking about those who equate wealth with being good. He said this is why we have a financial elite that outsources American jobs to countries that do not share our values and views the traditional beliefs of regular Americans as backwards.\\n\\nHe continued:\\n\\nThat's how we have multinational corporations who have no problem chasing a profit in a repressive, communist dictatorship like China, but they won't do business in the state of North Carolina. It's how Google won't help develop technology for the American military, but they're willing to partner with Chinese spy companies like Huawei.\\n\\nThey have chosen financial self-interest and ideological division over country, said Rubio, who added it increasingly feels like a democracy of the fittest.\\n\\nHe said the resulting deep divisions not only paralyze Americans from taking action but are used against America by international adversaries.\\n\\nRubio then said that Russian President Vladimir Putin sought not to elect Donald Trump by interfering in the 2016 election, but to weaken America by exploiting divisions and bitter politics.\\n\\nHe told the audience this is why they must work to invigorate community, defend religious liberty, create space for communities to flourish, and provide positive examples of moral communities that advance a vision of the common good.\\n\\nThe fourth and final pillar Rubio listed was the belief that doing all of this is worth it because America is a special country. And that this does not mean forgetting sins of the past, but remembering that America has overcome them: the end of slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights, end of segregation, a number of social causes.\\n\\nHe said his journey over the past seven years has provided him with the benefits of the broader perspective.\\n\\nRubio said the American people need to learn to work together even if they disagree and if they don't then they will pay the terrible price that their children will grow up where dignified work is only available to a few. He added that their children would also inherit a democracy that is an island in an ocean of tyranny and that their children would live in a world dominated by China. He said in this future world dominated by China, where they will have to depend on them for the latest medical advances in technology and where privacy and free speech, and religious liberty, and human rights are no longer protected, because China, the most powerful country at that point, is a serial violator of each one of these things. And if God forbid, that day should ever come, it will have been because those of us here now allowed it to happen.\\n\\nIn late May Rubio blasted the Trump administration, accusing it of not winning in trade talks with China. He said China is winning and cited a proposed deal with U.S.-sanctioned Chinese telecommunications company ZTE.\\n\\nDays after blasting the administration, Rubio claimed on CBS's Face the Nation that there would be a supermajority in Congress to block Trump's impending deal on ZTE.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the same day as Rubio's conference speech, a bipartisan group of Senators found common ground and introduced a bill to block the tentative deal between the U.S. and Chinese company ZTE.\\n\\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana"}

He says no agent will grab little babies from the arms of their mothers.\\n\\nSanders says this does not send a message that when a Democrat is in the White House, the border is open.\\n\\n9:09 PM: Biden says his administration will look like America and will pick a woman to be his vice president. In previous interviews, Biden seemed to indicate he was looking for someone like Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). Sanders says, in all likelihood, he will.\\n\\n8:59 PM: Sanders says he said the country can't deal with a pathological liar who is the most dangerous president in history. Sanders says if he doesn't win the nomination, he is willing to do anything that is humanely possible to defeat Trump.\\n\\nSanders pivots back to the Green New Deal and begins to go after Biden from taking cash from the fossil fuel industry before the debate cuts to a break.\\n\\n8:58 PM: Biden is asked how he will appeal to Sanders supporters. He says he will back Sanders if Sanders is the nominee because Trump is the existential threat. He says he hopes Sanders will do the same. Biden says both he and Sanders agree that health care is a right. He also says they both agree on the New Green Deal.\\n\\nBiden also says Trump is the one who wants to cut Social Security, Medicare.\\n\\n8:54 PM: Sanders says it is circular logic that Biden wants to reform the bill he voted for. He says they may not have to reform it had Biden rallied around others to vote against it. Sanders now pressing Biden on gay marriage. He says he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act and Biden voted for it. He says he against the Iraq War and NAFTA while Biden voted for it. Sanders says he voted against the Hyde Amendment while Biden voted for it. Sanders says it take courage sometimes to do the right thing.\\n\\nBiden says Sanders voted against background checks five times and is now calling out Sanders on guns. He is criticizing Sanders for voting to ensure that gun manufacturers can't get sued. Biden also says he started a ripple effect when he was the first major player in the Obama administration that said he supported gay marriage.\\n\\nSanders says in this time of crisis, the people of America know his record. He says he has stood with working families and taken on every special interest that is out there for 30 years. Sanders says that is what he will do in the White House and that is a totally different record than Joe's.\\n\\n8:51 PM: Sanders says this is about leadership and says Biden wrote some of the bill. He says the bankruptcy bill prevented students from getting out of student debt. Sanders says he voted against it in the House and he was right. He says leadership is having the guts to take unpopular votes. Biden seems agitated and snaps and claims he didn't help write the Bankruptcy Bill. Sanders says he's proud of his leadership on many issues and says Joe has come around. Biden seems like someone who is entitled and doesn't like being called out on inconsistencies. In many ways, he's reminding Democrats of what they hate about Trump.\\n\\n8:50 PM: Biden now asked about his support for the bankruptcy bill. Biden says it passed overwhelmingly and claims he improved it with two amendments. He says he did not like the rest of the bill. Biden says he talked to Warren about her proposal and this is the first chance they had to make substantial change.\\n\\n8:45 PM: Sanders now calling out Biden on Social Security and Medicare. He asks if Biden ever went on the Senate floor calling for cuts to Social Security or for Bowles-Simpson. Sanders asks people to go to YouTube and wants Biden to tell the truth.\\n\\nSanders wants Biden to be straight with the American people. Biden says that is not true when Sanders asks if he has ever been on the Senate floor time and time again calling for cuts to Social Security. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sanders says. He says Biden just contradicted yourself. Sanders says one minute he said he was not on the floor and now he's bringing up deficit. Biden tries to weasel himself out by saying he never voted to cut Social Security but that is not what Sanders asked.\\n\\nSanders asks Biden for the third time. Biden denies. Sanders asks Americans to go to YouTube because he can't deny reality.\\n\\nSanders camp tweeting this video:\\n\\nJoe Biden is not telling the truth at the #DemocraticDebate. Here's the video — please retweet right now: pic.twitter.com/BJ2xh7Ron0 — David Sirota (@davidsirota) March 16, 2020\\n\\n8:39 PM: Biden says Sanders' revolution will disrupt a lot of things and he again goes after the cost for Medicare for all. He says people want results now and not a revolution. Sanders asks why America is the only major country that doesn't guarantee health care and doesn't provide paid sick leave. He says it all comes down to the power structure. He says donors who control the legislative agenda have the power. He says you need to take on Wall Street, the drug companies, and the insurance companies, and the fossil fuel industries. He says you don't take campaign contributions from them.\\n\\nBiden calls for federal funding of all elections via a Constitutional amendment. Sanders doesn't want Biden laughing after Sanders calls on Biden to condemn his Super PACs that are running negative ads against Sanders. He says he won't give Biden a break because Biden has condemned Super PACs in the past.\\n\\n8:36 PM: Bash mentions that those who are over 60 or have underlying conditions are the most vulnerable. She says Sanders is over 60 and has had a heart attack and asks what he is doing to keep safe.\\n\\nSanders says he is not shaking hands and is very careful about people he is interacting with. He is using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers. He is grateful he does not have any symptoms.\\n\\nBiden says he is also fortunate he doesn't have any of the symptoms. Biden says he is taking all the precautions anyone would take. He is not shaking hands. His staff is working from home. He is not doing rallies. He's not going into crowds. He says he makes sure he doesn't touch his face.\\n\\n8:35 PM: Debate turns to immigration. Calderon asks about legal and illegal immigrants and the coronavirus.\\n\\nBiden says anyone who shows up to get tested for coronavirus would be held harmless. Biden says it's even the xenophobe's interest for illegal immigrants to come forward to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\\n\\nSanders says we have this absurd situation in which undocumented people who want to do the right thing to prevent coronavirus from spreading are thinking if ICE is going to detain them. Sanders says we have to end these terrible ICE raids that are terrorizing communities. He then calls for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for all illegal immigrants.\\n\\n8:30 PM: Sanders asked if he would support bailouts for industries being harmed by the corona virus. Sanders says we need to stabilize the economy but we can't do what we did in 2008. He says Biden voted for the Wall Street bailouts and he didn't.\\n\\nBiden, defending his bailout vote, claims if the banks wend under, all the little people Sanders cares about would have been in big trouble. But Biden says he agrees with Bernie that some of them should have gone to jail.\\n\\nBiden and Sanders disagree on whether Sanders voted against the auto bailouts.\\n\\nBiden swipes Bernie's wealth tax and keeps defending the bailout (doing himself a disservice the more he keeps defending the bailouts).\\n\\n8:25 PM: Sanders says the crisis (keeps saying Ebola but means corona) exposes the cruelty of America's economy. He says multimillionaires will get through this but half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. He says the lesson to be learned is we have to move aggressively to address the fragility of economy and how unjust it is that so few have so much.\\n\\nBiden says people don't want a revolution. He then keeps talking about making people whole so people don't have significant financial disabilities because of the (says sars but means corona) virus.\\n\\nSo far, Sanders has called this coronavirus Ebola and Biden has called this coronavirus SARS — Kathryn Watson (@kathrynw5) March 16, 2020\\n\\n8:23 PM: Biden says we need a major bailout package that makes individuals whole and doesn't reward corporations. Biden says the Fed will be of little consequence now because they have used all of their leverage. Biden says people need to be know their mortgages, rents will be paid and their child care will also be paid for during the coronavirus crisis. Biden again cuts himself off. Becoming more awkward each time.\\n\\n8:21 PM: Sanders says this is not the time to be punishing people when asked about China's role in the coronavirus crisis. He says we have to work with China, Italy, WHO, etc. Biden says he has insisted that we should have our experts in China and make it clear to China there would be consequences if we were denied access. Sanders says we must tell the big companies that this is not a time for profiteering.\\n\\n8:19 PM: Sanders says we need to learn from the last bailout that the government only cared about Wall Street. Biden claims we have learned this lesson (terrible answer by a candidate who seems like he is also winging a lot of this). Biden's hectoring tone is also not the most reassuring.\\n\\n8:18 PM: Sanders, when asked if he would deploy the military, says he would use all disposable tools. He says the New York did the right thing calling up the National Guard. Sanders goes right back to talking about the economic fallout. He asks what happens to workers who will lose their jobs after restaurants are shut down. He says if Trump can provide $1.5 trillion to the banks, workers should get a check to be made whole.\\n\\nBiden says he would call up the military now because they have the capacity to help hospitals with the anticipated surge.\\n\\n8:16 PM: Biden doesn't want to argue anymore on this and says this is like a war and a national emergency and it's like being attacked from abroad.\\n\\n8:15 PM: Biden says this is not about co-pays and Sanders says there are various loopholes that will still make Americans pay for treatments. Sanders says we need a simple system that exists in countries like Canada–if you are an American, you get the health care that you need. Sanders wonders if we have the guts to take on the health care/pharmaceutical industries that are funding Biden's campaign.\\n\\n8:11 PM: Sanders says Trump only exacerbates the health crisis (disfunction) that is obvious to anyone right now. Sanders says the experts are saying that one of the reasons we are unprepared is because we don't have a system and instead the country has thousands of private insurance plans.\\n\\n8:09 PM: Biden, when asked about a national quarantine, says he would call a meeting in the Situation Room of all the experts and ask them what the country has to do. Biden says there is a single-payer system in Italy and it doesn't work there. But Biden says the government should ensure that nobody should have to pay for treatment. Biden says instead of doing this in the United States, he would bring together the leading experts in the world like the Obama administration did with the Ebola crisis. He says governors are making sound decisions in the absence of such leadership.\\n\\n8:08 PM: Sanders says we aren't prepared for this pandemic. People can't afford prescriptions because we have a bunch of crooks running Big Pharma who are ripping us off. He says rural hospitals are shutting down and people are not insured. He says Pharma execs are salivating about profits right now and wants to ensure people that drug companies won't rip us off.\\n\\n8:06 PM: Biden says we have to be providing for hospitals that are going to be needed because the present system can't handle the surge that is likely to come. He accidentally says we did this before with the coronavirus before correcting himself and talking about the H1N1 virus.\\n\\n8:05 PM: Sanders says the most important he would do tonight to save American lives is to shut this president up right now because he is undermining doctors and scientists by blabbering with unfactual conclusions.\\n\\nSanders says every person should be assured that if they get sick with the coronavirus, they won't have to pay for treatment and testing.\\n\\n8:02 PM: Biden, when asked what he would say to Americans confronting the new reality, says his heart goes out to people who have lost loved ones and calls for a national rallying. Biden says we have to take care of those who have been exposed and are likely to be exposed with test kits. Second, he wants to make sure every state has at least 10 drive-thru testing centers. He talks about the need for additional hospital beds. Says Department of Defense and FEMA can set them up. Biden says we have to deal with the economic fallout. He again says that he sees his time is up in what is becoming a very awkward crutch.\\n\\nBiden coughs into his hand about six works into his first response.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) elected blistered former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday morning for representing the old guard of the Democratic Party that stands in near complete opposition to where the center of the energy is in the party today.\\n\\nJustice Democrats, the group that was founded after the 2016 elections by former supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and has vowed to primary Democrats who are demographically and ideologically out of touch with their districts, tore into Biden just hours after he officially announced his presidential candidacy, signaling that Biden's road to the nomination will be far from being smooth. Ocasio-Cortez, the headliner for Justice Democrats, recently said that a Biden candidacy does not animate her in the least. The group highlighted Biden's past support for the Iraq War, the Crime Bill, and the Bankruptcy Reform Act while also pointing out his previous opposition to gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.\\n\\nJoe Biden stands in near complete opposition to where the center of energy is in the Democratic Party today. Democrats are increasingly uniting around progressive populist policies like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, free college, rejecting corporate money and ending mass incarceration and deportation, Alexandra Rojas, the group's executive director, said in a statement. We don't need someone who voted for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and for the Bankruptcy Reform Act while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.\\n\\nThe old guard of the Democratic Party failed to stop Trump, and they can't be counted on to lead the fight against his divide-and-conquer politics today.

The party needs new leadership with a bold vision capable of energizing voters in the Democratic base who stayed home in 2016.\\n\\nThe left-wing group said they would support Biden if he becomes the nominee but insisted that a centrist like Biden will only divide Democrats. Presumably referencing policies like the Green New Deal that establishment Democrats oppose while using one former President Barack Obama's trademark lines on the stump, Justice Democrats said Biden will turn Democrats into the party of No, we can't.\\n\\nStatement from Justice Democrats, a progressive organization that helped launch AOC: pic.twitter.com/uQTEtwD62H — Grace Segers (@Grace_Segers) April 25, 2019\\n\\nWhile left-wing activists have been highlighting Biden's treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court hearings and his past opposition to school busing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) this week perhaps signaled that Biden's rivals will begin to focus what could be Biden's true Achilles' heel—his past support for big banks and credit card companies.\\n\\nPerhaps ringing the bell on these potential lines of attack, Warren told Anderson Cooper at a town hall event this week that she became a Democrat in the 1990s when she realized that while all of the Republicans were for the big banks, only half of the Democrats were for big corporations and bankers. Warren said she had been working over and over and over on what's happening to America's working families, to America's middle class, how it is that people who work hard, who play by the rules are just finding the path steeper and rockier year by year, and for people of color even steeper and even rockier.\\n\\nThis is my life's work. And so I keep working on this about what's changing in America. I'm studying families that go bankrupt. And the credit card companies, half-dozen giant credit card companies figure out that if they can get the bankruptcy laws changed, that what will happen is they can improve their bottom line by just a little by keeping people locked out of bankruptcy, Warren said.  Never mind that there's people are head over heels in medical debts, that they've had job losses that have put them way behind, that they've had a death or divorce in the family, but they've been cheated by credit card companies and mortgage companies. Never mind any of that. Just improve the bottom line for the credit card companies.\\n\\nWarren said she looked around in the middle of that fight and realized all the money was on one side and all the hurting was on the other.\\n\\nAnd that's when I jumped in politically. I got in that fight, and I fought it for 10 years. And by the end of that fight, I fully understood that every single Republican stood there for the banks and half of the Democrats did, Warren said.\\n\\nBut implicit in her criticism was that Democrats like Delaware's Joe Biden represented the corporate-wing of the party and the interests of banks and credit card companies over those of working-class Americans when Biden backed the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which was one of the issues Justice Democrats highlighted.\\n\\nLong before Warren started to hone in on Biden's past corporate alliances, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer first exposed and extensively documented the Biden family's so-called new corruption in his blockbuster best-selling book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.\\n\\nIn fact, Biden was reportedly uneasy about entering the 2020 race because of the questions he and his son Hunter are likely going to face in 2020 because of Schweizer's revelations.\\n\\nIn Secret Empires, as Breitbart News has noted, Schweizer revealed that in 2013 Hunter Biden's firm signed a billion-dollar deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government's Bank of China just 10 days after Joe and Hunter Biden flew to China aboard Air Force Two."}

Christians are supposed to strive to be like Christ and while we all fall short, through his actions Buttigieg has proven himself to be a lying bully and a total prick.\\n\\nDid Christ tell Buttigieg to lie about Vice President Mike Pence, a lie so brazen even the phony fact checkers at the Washington Post could not find a way to make it true?\\n\\nNevertheless, we conclude there is little evidence that Pence supported conversion therapy, the Post was forced to grudgingly report after the Mean Little Mayor ran around for weeks lying like Joe Isuzu about Pence's support for conversion therapy.\\n\\nDid Christ tell Buttigieg to launch his presidential campaign by bullying everyday evangelicals and Pence, a man who has never said an unkind word about him, a man who treats everyone with respect and dignity?\\n\\nLook at this and this and this and this…\\n\\nLook at all this…\\n\\nWe all know what Buttigieg is doing here… Bullying and lying about evangelicals and Pence is a cynical but extremely effective way to attract glowing media attention and a pile of money from Hollywood — you know, just like Jesus would do.\\n\\nAnd that's a point worth stressing. This mean little liar isn't just attacking the powerful, he is also a wannabe theocrat attacking everyday Christians who aren't acceptable Christians — but in Mayor Pete's theocracy you will accept gay marriage, open borders, and bigger government:\\n\\nIt's something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that's not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church where it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you're supposed to conduct yourself.\\n\\nYes, the small man with the log in his eye is going to tell us how to conduct ourselves.\\n\\nButtigieg also believes his marriage is more traditional than Trump's marriage.\\n\\nIf somebody who wants to raise the question of which one of us has the more traditional attitude on marriage we can have that fight, he told MSNBC last week.\\n\\nHe knows he's married to a guy, right?\\n\\nListen, normally I would never dream of bringing this up. If Mean Little Mayor Pete believed in lowering taxes, killing terrorists, securing the border, and protecting religious freedoms, I would vote for him if he were married to six bikers, a bottle of tequila, and a moon rock. Honestly, I could not care less… But I do care when someone lies about the Faith, when a hypocritical and self-righteous snake oil salesman twists and weaponizes the Faith into something unrecognizable as a means to become The Most Powerful Man In The World.\\n\\nGood grief, Buttigieg is openly blaspheming God by blaming God for his sin.\\n\\nDuring one of his attacks on Pence, Buttigieg actually said the following:\\n\\nThat's the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator. It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife.\\n\\nOnce again he is cynically attacking a straw man, pretending to defend himself in a fight he started, but that is the least of it. Read his quote again because what we have here is a man strutting around playing the Perfect Christian as he publicly blames God for his sin… Forget about the insufferable self-regard, the self-righteous moralizing — which is beyond creepy and off-putting (and likely explains his stall in the polls) — Buttigieg is living his life in defiance of God and blaming God for that defiance.\\n\\nThere is nothing sinful about being a homosexual. There are plenty of gay men and women who strive to live a Christian life. May God bless all of them. And homosexuals are not uniquely burdened because we are all tempted by sin in our own way. The question is do we give in to it?\\n\\nThe more important question, though, is do we regret it when we fall short? Do we repent?\\n\\nGood Christians sin. Good Christians fall short. Good Christians give in to temptation. Good Christians sometimes do terrible things. But good Christians also feel shame, regret, guilt, and an overwhelming desire to repent and ask for another chance.\\n\\nMean Little Mayor Pete, though, is not only sure he's a better Christian than everyone else, he blames God for his sin, a brazen act of blasphemy I have never before seen from a public figure.\\n\\nImagine if Bill Clinton or John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson or Franklin Roosevelt blamed their adulterous affairs on God for giving them a strong libido.\\n\\nNow imagine Trump saying such a thing. Imagine Trump lording his Christianity over everyone else.\\n\\nThat's how outrageous Buttigieg sounds.\\n\\nA brazen liar, a hypocrite, a theocrat, a bully…\\n\\nMean Little Mayor Pete might be a Christian but he's truly terrible at it and needs our prayers, even though he probably doesn't believe he needs them.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "A new manifesto by leading Evangelical Christians has drawn fire for its embrace of traditional sexual morality based on biblical norms.\\n\\nThe declaration, billed as the Nashville Statement and signed by more than 150 Evangelical leaders, reaffirms Christian teaching on God's creation of human beings as male and female, an assertion that flies in the face of recent attempts to proclaim a nearly infinite gender fluidity based on autonomous preferences.\\n\\nThe authors state that the path to full and lasting joy through God's good design for his creatures is being replaced by the path of shortsighted alternatives that, sooner or later, ruin human life and dishonor God.\\n\\nOur true identity, as male and female persons, is given by God. It is not only foolish, but hopeless, to try to make ourselves what God did not create us to be, the text reads.\\n\\nThe Nashville Statement immediately came under fire from LGBT activists as well as secular mainstream media, who denounced the document as bigoted, prejudiced and antiquated.\\n\\nIn one headline, the Daily News proclaimed that the manifesto is straight out of the 1980s, suggesting that sexual norms have moved beyond traditional biblical morality.\\n\\nThe Huffington Post dubbed the statement Anti-LGBTQ for its denial of the moral goodness of homosexual relations and transgenderism. The Chicago Tribune similarly labeled the text as Anti-LGBT while offering a more loving statement of its own that basically says that any sex is good sex.\\n\\nSalon magazine predictably blasted the statement as bigotry-filled, alleging that the manifesto contains many discriminatory positions and has rightly been denounced as un-American toilet paper written by hypocrites.\\n\\nThe Nashville Statement was fruit of meetings of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, which convoked a meeting of evangelical leaders, pastors and scholars Friday at the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission's annual conference in Nashville.\\n\\nThe content of the Statement goes no further than to teach what Christians have always believed about sexual morality and God's plan for men and women.\\n\\nLast year, Pope Francis made similar comments, reaffirming Catholic teaching on gender and sexuality, which also earned him the ire of the LGBT lobby.\\n\\nIn several statements, the Pope denounced gender ideology, which he called a global war against the family. He also decried the evils of indoctrinating children with the idea that gender is a fluid concept, disconnected from biological sexual differences, saying that gender theory is against the nature of things.\\n\\nFrancis DeBernardo, the director of a nominally Catholic LGBT group called New Ways Ministry, published a statement attacking the Pope for his comments, accusing him of being out of touch with reality for his reliance upon so-called 'gender theory' and 'ideological colonization.'\\n\\nIn a 2016 letter on marriage and the family, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), Pope Francis said that sex education should teach respect and appreciation for sexual differences, as a way of helping the young to overcome self-absorption. This respect includes self-acceptance and learning to embrace the body one is born with, rather than playing with fictional identities that deny reality.\\n\\nAn appreciation of our body as male or female, he added, is necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves.\\n\\nAn effort to cancel out sexual differences based in anatomy is a symptom of a society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he wrote.\\n\\nModern gender confusion contradicts the plan of God, Francis said last October, who has entrusted the world and history to the alliance between man and woman.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "A specter is haunting America — the specter of socialism.\\n\\nWe have gotten a nasty preview of it during the Coronavirus epidemic. We've experienced empty shelves, food shortages, limits on what you can buy, and also the attack on civil liberties, on freedom of assembly, on religious liberty, on privacy. So we've endured on a temporary basis what, under socialism, we are likely to endure on a permanent basis.\\n\\nYet socialism has somehow entered the mainstream of political debate. Suddenly, almost out of nowhere, we have these strange socialist characters — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Bernie Sanders — and a whole political party that seems magnetically drawn toward the socialist camp. This development by itself is surpassingly strange, because socialism is arguably the most discredited idea since slavery.\\n\\nSlavery lasted for centuries — even millennia — before it was recognized as a thoroughly wicked and tyrannical regime of human exploitation. Socialism, which dates back to 1917, when Lenin founded the world's first socialist state, has had a much shorter shelf life. It, too, collapsed across the world because it was understood by the people who lived under it to be a form of slavery.\\n\\nWe see the connection between socialism and slavery in all the important works on socialism. Friedrich Hayek's critique of socialism is appropriately titled The Road to Serfdom. George Orwell depicted the tyrannical dimension of socialism in his two immortal novels Animal Farm and 1984. Using both the techniques of fiction and nonfiction, Alexander Solzhenitsyn in a series of works — The Gulag Archipelago, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich — depicted Soviet socialism as a vast network of slave camps stretching from Europe to the farthest reaches of Asia.\\n\\nSlavery in its classic form has been abolished worldwide, although enslavement in other forms — sex trafficking for instance—continues as a gruesome relic of this barbaric practice. Even so, no serious person today could advocate the return of slavery! How ridiculous it would be to hear someone say, The failures of slavery were all failures of implementation. This time we're really gonna make it work!\\n\\nYet here we have socialism in America attempting a comeback, and on precisely those terms: This time we're gonna get it right. Serious people advocate it; there is a sustained cultural push to apotheosize it; a major political party is pushing aggressively toward it. How is this possible? Apparently socialism means never having to say you're sorry.\\n\\nSocialism has proved to be a living hell pretty much everywhere it has been tried. It has been tried pretty much all over the world. Let's not forget that within about a century since Marx wrote, and less than half a century since the Bolshevik Revolution, some 60 percent of the world's people were living under governments that embraced some form of socialism. At once time, Josh Muravchik writes, it was the most popular political idea ever invented, arguably the most popular idea of any kind about how life should be lived or society organized.\\n\\nThe biggest socialist experiment was the Soviet bloc, an orbit of countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and East Germany. Prior to the Soviet occupation of its eastern region, Germany tried its own distinct version of socialism, National Socialism or Nazism for short, for 12 years, from 1933 to 1945. In Asia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and China experimented with socialism. In South America, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Venezuela tried it. Most of Africa went socialist in the aftermath of colonialism: Angola, Ghana, Tanzania, Benin, Mali, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. I count here 25 experiments in socialism, all ending in unmitigated disaster.\\n\\nThe worst forms of socialism proved not only totalitarian, but also murderous to an unprecedented degree. In the Soviet Union alone, socialist regimes killed some 20 million of their own citizens and enslaved tens of millions of others. The Chinese socialists, in the period known as Mao's Cultural Revolution, killed another 20-25 million. The Nazis murdered in comparable numbers, including Jews and gypsies and other occupied peoples, Poles, Russians, Eastern Europeans and others. Orwell's description from 1984 seems appropriate here: A boot stamping on a human face.\\n\\nSocialists today disavow this historical record, insisting that these were authoritarian forms of socialism that they have no intention of copying. While socialism may have been the economic program of Communism and early Fascism, modern socialists seek to dispense with the tyranny and merely keep the economic program. Yet it's worth stressing that socialism wasn't merely a political failure; it was also an economic failure.\\n\\nOrwell somehow missed this. Interestingly, neither of his two novels offers an economic critique of socialism. There is no economic problem in Animal Farm; the only problem is that the pigs seize power. In 1984, the ruling party creates poverty and scarcity to keep people in line. Great as he is, Orwell confines himself to a political critique; he exposes the totalitarian tendency of socialism. But he never shows how socialism creates this totalitarianism, and he leaves open the possibility of a more benign socialism that avoids it.\\n\\nYet in the real world, the political collapse of socialism was brought about by its economic failure. This was certainly true in the Soviet Union, where Gorbachev's rescue efforts — glasnost and perestroika — failed spectacularly, first bringing down the Soviet empire, then the Communist ruling party, and finally the socialist system itself. China, too, abandoned socialism for its economic shortcomings. And look how poorly socialism is faring in Zimbabwe, Cuba and Venezuela today. So how can one adopt socialist ideas once again without considering the economic track record of socialist regimes?\\n\\nRarely in history is there is a chance to actually compare social systems to see which one works better. One might compare the Plantagenet kings of England with the Tang Dynasty in China, but even if we line up the dates we are talking about two completely different societies: different people, different culture. Consequently, England's superiority and China's inferiority — or the other way round — can hardly be attributed to their rival systems of government, since so many other factors could be involved.\\n\\nIn the case of socialism, however, we have two perfect test cases: North and South Korea, and East and West Germany. The perfection of these examples comes from the fact that we are dealing with the same people, same background, same culture, merely two rival economic systems. North Korea is socialist; South Korea capitalist. East Germany was socialist; West Germany capitalist.\\n\\nWhen the results came in, they were decisive. At reunification the per capita gross domestic product in socialist East Germany was just about one third of the capitalist West German level, with other measures of economic performance displaying a similar chasm. Even the poorest part of West Germany, Schleswig-Holstein, was two and a half times as wealthy as the richest East German region, Saxony. To this day, the eastern part of Germany gets nearly 15 percent of its gross domestic product in net transfers from the western part of Germany.\\n\\nThe Korean example is even more telling, in part because the separation of the two societies has lasted longer and continues to this day. South Korea now is more than 20 times richer than North Korea, a difference manifested in virtually all indicators of human welfare. South Koreans are obviously freer than North Koreans but they also seem happier than North Koreans; have you ever seen a North Korean smile? South Koreans are also taller, healthier and live about 12 years longer than North Koreans. Every year many thousands of North Koreans risk their lives seeking to escape to South Korea.\\n\\nI grew up under Indian socialism — which was democratic socialism — and experienced its two signature institutions. The first was everyday corruption; literally nothing could be done without paying some petty bureaucrat under the table. The second was the ration card, which specified the paltry ration of sugar or cooking oil that a family was permitted to purchase each month.\\n\\nDuring this era, India was widely known as the begging bowl of the world. Americans told their children, Eat your food because there are millions of starving people in India. Gandhi spoke wistfully about wiping a tear of every Indian face. A whole generation of young Indians in the 1960s and 1970s saw no future for themselves and fled to sea, like my brother, or to Dubai to do manual labor, like some of my cousins, or to Australia, Canada and America, like me.\\n\\nToday's young Indians plan no such mass exit, because there are now opportunities for them at home. Now I go back to India and see Indian families who used to endure the sweltering summer heat and go to the sea to wash their clothes now enjoy the full benefits of modern technology, including air conditioning and washing machines. India is doing measurably better, and now there is a large and newly-prosperous middle class. Even the country's global reputation has changed. Today Americans tell their children, Study hard because there are millions of Indians waiting to take your jobs.\\n\\nHow did the change come about? It came about through economic liberalization, otherwise known as free market capitalism. And how did India decide to move in that direction? It was not inspired by the Indians reading Adam Smith. Rather, Indians looked across the Chinese border and saw that millions of once-impoverished peasants now lived in clean homes and nice apartments. The Chinese now shopped in well-stocked grocery stores. They drove new cars.\\n\\nThere was no question how the Chinese did it. The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. Under Mao, factories were nationalized and the land of the peasants was expropriated. Mao targeted traders and businessmen — the bourgeoisie — attempting in his own words to destroy the property owning class by killing at least one landlord in every village via public execution. Mao's Great Leap Forward, announced in 1958, accelerated the collectivization of farms; in fact, all private farming was banned. The result was the greatest man-made famine in history.\\n\\nThen, in 1966, Mao launched his Cultural Revolution, an attempt to erase all remaining capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society. The Communist Red Guard enforced a purge of all dissidents. Mao issued his famous book of quotations, The Little Red Book, that became a central part of the curriculum of every school. Chinese citizens were expected to have a copy of Mao's writings with them at all times. Even so, Maoist socialism represented a disastrous alloy of deprivation, starvation and tyranny.\\n\\nThe change came in the late 1970s, when the Chinese, under Deng Xiaopping, abandoned the socialism of Mao for its own brand of capitalism. In doing so the Chinese inaugurated a new experiment in social organization. Call it totalitarian capitalism. The Chinese did not relinquish their Communist dictatorship; rather, they married dictatorial political control to free market liberalization. Some say it was an awkward marriage, yet in economic terms, it worked.\\n\\nSo the Indians decided to follow in the economic path the Chinese had marked out. Large parts of the Indian economy are still government regulated, but the trend for three decades now has been away from that, toward privatization, deregulation, economic liberalization. And India too has seen spectacular results. Technological capitalism has realized Gandhi's dream of wiping millions of Indian tears. As for Indian socialism, the leftist writer Pankaj Mishra frets that it shows no signs of revival.\\n\\nIf socialism has produced a worldwide record of misery and tears, and if countries must flee socialism to experience prosperity, what then are American socialists up to? Why would they want to import misery and tears? They insist they are not doing this. In a sense, they disavow history, both the political and the economic legacy of all professed socialist regimes. They insist that everyone else got it wrong. They emphasize that at least some of those depressing examples, maybe all of them, were not real socialism.\\n\\nHow coherent is this idea of real socialism? If an economic idea fails once or twice or even three times, one can still insist it was a fine idea that was merely implemented poorly. But if an idea fails 25 times, all over the world, everywhere it has been tried, without even one counterexample of a socialist regime that works well, it strains credulity to insist that there is still some undiscovered form of socialism, heretofore unattempted, that will finally prove its viability. Yet another go at socialism now feels like Elizabeth Taylor's eighth marriage, a triumph of hope over experience.\\n\\nSo why doesn't the failed track record of socialist regimes deter the socialists of today? What keeps socialism alive for them? The answer is: the socialist dream! Yes, there is a socialist dream just as there is an American dream. And evidently the socialist dream is one that survives all empirical refutation. No purely empirical argument—and no set of economic arguments—is sufficient to send socialism to its grave.\\n\\nThis is why conservative and libertarian critiques of socialism have gotten nowhere. The conservatives and libertarians keep chanting, Socialism doesn't work, and they produce charts and tables to prove it. The socialists glance over the charts and tables and then they clamor for more socialism. They don't care about data because no amount of data can refute a dream. The socialist mantra is, We don't care if it hasn't worked. We will figure out a way to make it work. The critics are focused on yesterday, while the socialists are all about tomorrow. Owen Jones expresses this futuristic hope, A socialist society…doesn't exist yet, but one day it must.\\n\\nI'm reminded of the early scene in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress where the pilgrim, Christian, is warned by the Evangelist to pursue eternal life and flee the wrath to come. But how, Christian asks, do I do this? The evangelist points to a wide field. Do you see yonder wicket gate? No. Do you see yonder shining light? Christian looks hard; he can barely see it. He thinks he sees something. The evangelist is undeterred; he urges Christian to follow the light, and he will reach his desired destination.\\n\\nWhen Christian's wife and children discover that he is about to leave on a quest, having no idea when, if ever, he will return, they summon the neighbors and together the whole group rails against Christian, mocking and threatening him. They tell him he is a fool, and that he is neglecting his responsibilities and pursuing an illusion. But none of this deters Christian, who in Bunyan's words, put his fingers in his ears and ran on, crying Life! Life! Eternal life!\\n\\nSo it is with the socialists. They are on a grand quest, and they refuse to look back. The insist that they are the champions of a moral ideal. The only way to refute them is to refute their moral ideal, to expose their dream as a nightmare, to capsize their utopia. Normally people try to defeat utopia by showing it is a fantasy. But this is inadequate, because a fantasy continues to hold its appeal even when it is exposed as a fantasy. So we have to expose the socialist utopia not as an illusion but rather as a racket.\\n\\nSure, there is a socialist temptation, and this is the same temptation that some cult leaders and TV evangelists hold out to their gullible audience. They offer the temptation of paradise, freed from the normal drudgery and travails of life, with manna dropping into their laps from heaven. This is pretty much what the socialists promise, too. The main difference is that the televangelist promises these wonders in the next life; the socialist in this one. All you are expected to give up is your ownership of yourself, including your right to keep what is yours, your personal autonomy and dignity, and your independence of mind.\\n\\nIn both cases, the enterprise is driven by lust for money and lust for power, the libido dominandi that Augustine warns about. In principle, no less than in practice, socialism is the ideology of thieves and tyrants. As for the people who fall for the temptation, they are connivers attracted by the rip-off scheme. But they end up a suckers, because the scheme is not designed to benefit them. We cannot persuade the thieves and tyrants, but we should try to reach the conniving suckers, to show them a better way to get ahead, and we need an effective battle plan to finally and ultimately defeat the socialists.\\n\\nThis is adapted from the Preface to Dinesh D'Souza's new book United States of Socialism, published by St. Martin's Press."}

{"original": "Appearing Thursday on Fox News Channel's Outnumbered Overtime, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway dismissed her husband's Never Trump PAC, The Lincoln Project, stating that the political consultants in it all failed to get their preferred candidates into the White House in 2016.\\n\\n(Watch: 10:40)\\n\\nA partial transcript is as follows:\\n\\nHARRIS FAULKNER: The president has been in a pretty public battle this week with a group of Never Trump Republicans after they released an attack ad on his COVID-19 response. Now the co-founder of that group, your husband George Conway, warning in an op-ed: Trump's narcissism deadens any ability he might otherwise have to carry out the duties of a president in a manner that the constitution requires. He's so self-obsessed, he can only act for himself and not for the nation. It's why he was impeached and why he should have been removed from office. And it's why he reacts with such rage. He fears the truth. He fears being revealed for what he truly is. Before I get your reaction on this, this is not about your husband, this not about your marriage. This is about that group. It just so happens that George Conway wrote that op-ed today. What is the response to this? Because this group now is getting a lot of light and lifting from the president tweeting about them.\\n\\n…\\n\\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: It certainly is about my husband, or you would have quoted other people in the group, particularly all the other ones who are political consultants who never achieved what I achieved, which is success as a presidential campaign manager.\\n\\nFAULKNER: Well, quite frankly, Rick Wilson's is a little too blue for our tastes. I didn't want to read that on the air, but there are others. This one was clean.\\n\\nCONWAY: I can't even say I've seen it. But, to my point: they've all failed. They've never succeeded the way I did as campaign manager, and they never got their candidate where my candidate got. He's president of the United States."}

I thought I was going to cry, Fraser says of the alleged 2003 encounter, in a GQ profile titled, What Ever Happened to Brendan Fraser?\\n\\nThe incident, Fraser said, left him depressed and miserable. He says didn't go public because he didn't want to let the alleged assault become his narrative.\\n\\nI didn't want to contend with how that made me feel, or it becoming part of my narrative.

That summer wore on—and I can't remember what I went on to work on next.\\n\\nBerk denied Fraser's version of events that allegedly occurred that night at the Beverly Hills Hotel during a Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) luncheon and recounted the encounter in his memoir, writing that he merely pinched Fraser's butt. Berk also told GQ that he wrote a letter to Fraser, but insists he never confessed to any wrongdoing.\\n\\nNevertheless, Fraser says the situation made me retreat. It made me feel reclusive.

{"original": "The new superior of the worldwide Jesuit religious order said recently that, as Jesus Christ's words about marriage were never recorded, there is no basis for a black and white church doctrine centering on lifelong marriage between one man and one woman.\\n\\nIn a recent interview with Vatican journalist Giuseppe Rusconi of the Italian Catholic blog Rossoporpora , Father Arturo Sosa Abascal states that Jesus's words about marriage must be contextualized and discerned.\\n\\nHuman reality is much more nuanced and never black and white, said Abascal, who was elected superior of the Society of Jesus in October.\\n\\nLifeSiteNews has published the translation of the interview – which included the topic of remarriage following divorce. Abascal, who is from Venezuela, was asked by Rusconi about Jesus's teaching regarding marriage as provided in the Gospel of Matthew:\\n\\nHe said to them, Have you not read that He Who made them in the first place made them man and woman? 5 It says, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will live with his wife. The two will become one.' 6 So they are no longer two but one. Let no man divide what God has put together.\\n\\nRusconi stated to Abascal that the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith, Cardinal Gerhard Műller, observed the words of Jesus were clear, and that no power in heaven and on earth, neither an angel nor the pope, neither a council nor a law of the bishops has the faculty to modify them.\\n\\nAt that time, no one had a recorder to take down his words, the Jesuit superior responded. What is known is that the words of Jesus must be contextualized, they are expressed in a language, in a specific setting, they are addressed to someone in particular.\\n\\nAsked whether the words of Jesus, then, have an absolute value, Abascal replied:\\n\\nOver the last century in the Church there has been a great blossoming of studies that seek to understand exactly what Jesus meant to say… That is not relativism, but attests that the word is relative, the Gospel is written by human beings, it is accepted by the Church which is made up of human persons… So it is true that no one can change the word of Jesus, but one must know what it was!\\n\\nAsked whether he is questioning Jesus's words, Abascal said he agrees with Pope Francis – also a Jesuit. One does not bring into doubt, one brings into discernment… the superior said.\\n\\nRusconi replied that, with discernment, the final decision is based on a judgment relative to different hypotheses, and, thus, brings the word of Jesus into doubt. Abascal responded that he did not mean, the word of Jesus, but the word of Jesus as we have interpreted it… Discernment leads to a decision: one must not only evaluate, but decide.\\n\\nThe Jesuit superior continued that the Church has always made personal conscience a priority.\\n\\nDoctrine is a word that I don't like very much, it brings with it the image of the hardness of stone, Abascal said. Instead the human reality is much more nuanced, it is never black or white, it is in continual development."}

Indeed, here are conserved the walls that, according to tradition, come from Nazareth, where the Holy Virgin pronounced her 'yes,' becoming the mother of Jesus, the pontiff noted in his address.\\n\\nThe house of Mary is the house of the family, Francis said. In the delicate situation of today's world, the family based on the marriage between a man and a woman assumes an essential importance and mission.\\n\\nIt is necessary to rediscover the plan drawn up by God for the family, to reiterate its greatness and irreplaceability in the service of life and of society, he continued. In the house of Nazareth, Mary lived the multiplicity of family relations as daughter, betrothed, wife and mother. For this reason every family, in its different members, finds here acceptance and inspiration to live its own identity.\\n\\nIn the past, the pope has insisted that the natural family is under attack from gender ideology, which seeks to blur essential differences between men and women.\\n\\nGender confusion contradicts the plan of God, who has entrusted the world and history to the alliance between man and woman, the pope said during a 2016 address.\\n\\nBy its very nature, he said, this alliance requires the ability to recognize sexual differences as a richness and a promise, not as a reason of subjection and abuse.\\n\\nAt the current juncture, marital and family ties are tested in many ways, he added.\\n\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church underscores the nature of the family as founded on the marriage between a man and a woman.\\n\\nA man and a woman united in marriage, together with their children, form a family, it reads. This institution is prior to any recognition by public authority, which has an obligation to recognize it. It should be considered the normal reference point by which the different forms of family relationship are to be evaluated.\\n\\nThe pope's words in defense of the natural family come just days before the celebration of the World Congress of Families XIII, which will begin this Friday in the northern Italian city of Verona. Bringing together leaders and influencers from around the world, the Congress upholds the enduring importance of the natural family for the future of civilization.\\n\\nThe town of Loreto lends itself to becoming, for the Church that is in Italy, a place to propose a continuation of the world meetings of young people and of the family, Francis said Monday.

{"original": "Will the Real Jeff Bezos Stand Up?\\n\\nIs Jeff Bezos just an unfaithful horndog? Or is he also an international provocateur? The answers to these questions are important, because Bezos is not only the richest man in the world; he's also one of the world's most powerful corporate and media chieftains. Through his many holdings—including Amazon, Amazon Web Services (which works in cloud-computing, including for the CIA), Alexa, his Ring home-surveillance system, and the Washington Post—he has reach into just about every corporate suite, every national capital, and billions of homes. And if one adds his Blue Origin space exploration company, his ambitions stretch far beyond this globe.\\n\\nYet if Bezos has this much financial and political power, we should know the whole truth about him, so that we can know whether he is exercising it responsibly.\\n\\nSo now, turning to a recent Bezos-inspired news story, let's ask ourselves:\\n\\nWhich headline is true? Is it the Guardian's header on January 21, Revealed: the Saudi heir and the alleged plot to undermine Jeff Bezos? Or is it the Wall Street Journal's header three days later, on January 24: Prosecutors Have Evidence Bezos' Girlfriend Gave Texts to Brother Who Leaked to National Enquirer?\\n\\nAs we can immediately see, there's a big difference between the Guardian's story, which alleges that Saudi Arabia apparently hacked Bezos's cell phone, and the Journal story, which suggests that Bezos's girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, having received racy texts and photos from Bezos, in turn gave them to her brother, Michael Sanchez—and Michael then sold them to the National Enquirer for a reported $200,000.\\n\\nThese two diverging headlines are the latest in a long skein of allegations and insinuations stemming from the steamy news of photos and texts that ran in the National Enquirer back in January 2019. According to the Guardian, it was international skullduggery, involving the leader of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and perhaps the Israeli digital firm NSO; the allegation is that the Saudi royal and the Israeli company jointly conspired to hack Bezos's phone. (The Saudi government immediately denied the accusation, as did NSO.)\\n\\nBy contrast, according to the Journal, the truer and simpler story is that this was a case of Bezos carelessly sexting—sextings that went badly, and embarrassingly, awry.\\n\\nIt matters, of course, which journalistic account is true—or at least which is more true. If the Guardian is correct, then we have the stuff of a serious international incident—involving major players in Saudi Arabia, in Israel, and maybe also in the United States. And if all that's true, then one can only guess at the laws that might have been violated, norms trampled, and torts committed. But if the Journal version is right, then we just have a . . . salacious sex scandal.\\n\\nFlashback to 2019\\n\\nWho can forget the story of Bezos, and of siblings Lauren and Michael Sanchez? That story blew up Bezos's marriage; he settled with his now ex-wife for $35 billion, a matrimonial record.\\n\\nIndeed, in the annals of raunchy tabloid items, the Enquirer stories of the Amazon tycoon and his love life—adultery! texts! pictures! divorce! billions!—seemed to have everything that a scandal-lover could hope for. Even Donald Trump, no stranger to tab news, jumped in, zinging Bezos, owner of the Washington Post—which is not, of course, the president's favorite newspaper.\\n\\nSo for a little while there, in early 2019, the Bezos story seemed be nothing more than juicy spice.\\n\\nYet soon, new elements entered into the picture. In February 2019, the month after the Enquirer stories ran, Bezos escalated the story by telling his version of it; he posted an article under his own name, declaring that the Enquirer had tried to use extortion and blackmail on him. That allegation was hot enough right there, but then Bezos got even hotter. Citing the work of his hired security expert, Gavin de Becker, he intimated that perhaps Trump and the government of Saudi Arabia were in cahoots with the Enquirer, as part of some larger nefarious plot against the Seattle mogul.\\n\\nThe Trump angle seemed possibly pertinent, because he and the Post had long been at odds over the Post's caustic coverage of him. And the Saudi angle seemed relevant because the year before, in 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi-born columnist for Bezos's Post—or, as wiseguys call it, the Bezos Post—was apparently murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.\\n\\nTo be sure, Khashoggi's death was a shocking crime. And in response, the Post had, understandably, taken a hard reportorial and editorial line against the Saudi government. So the implication of Bezos's article was that perhaps the Saudis had something to do with the original leak from Bezos's phone because they wanted to hit back at him for his newspaper's pursuit of the Khashoggi story.\\n\\nIntrigued by these many spidery lines of inquiry, Virgil first wrote about the Bezos story on March 10, 2019. In particular, he quoted various media observers who said that one result of Bezos's published escalation was to reposition himself in the public eye. That is, if he was attacking Saudi Arabia and Trump, he was no longer a billionaire who just got caught in the dirty. Instead, his escalation was elevation: elevating himself, that is, so that he was now a champion of the free press, the First Amendment, and the protection of journalists. (In that piece, Virgil couldn't help but notice, also, that Bezos bears a resemblance to Ernst Blofeld, a fictional villain from the James Bond movies.)\\n\\nThen, the following month, March 2019, de Becker—the man whom Bezos had hired as his security consultant—himself published a piece, boldly bannered, Bezos Investigation Finds the Saudis Obtained His Private Data. De Becker acknowledged that Michael Sanchez had gotten hold of Bezos's saucy cell-phone stuff, but in addition, de Becker declared, Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos' phone, and gained private information.\\n\\nSo there we had it, from both Bezos and de Becker: Yes, Michael Sanchez was a lowlife—in the wake of the leak, he and his sister were estranged, wrote de Becker—but the Saudis, too, were lowlifes, if not worse.\\n\\nIn other words, in the Bezos/de Becker telling, the whole messy saga was more than just what it seemed to be at first—that is, a sorry tale of infidelity, indiscretion, and perhaps intra-family treachery. Instead, maybe it was more of a spy-thriller epic: an international conspiracy, reaching from the Saudi capital of Riyadh, to the Enquirer's offices in Manhattan, to the president in the White House.\\n\\nVirgil wrote on April 5, 2019, and again on April 20 that Bezos's escalated allegations were, indeed, sensational and astounding—if that is, they were true. Still thinking of Bezos's resemblance to Bond-villain Blofeld, Virgil added that the story could well be remembered as some fantastic tale, like something that Ian Fleming might have written for his character James Bond.\\n\\nYet once again, to say that the allegations are sensational and astounding is not the same thing as saying that they are true.\\n\\nSo there the matter sat, for nearly a year. The Post has continued to pursue the Khashoggi story, peppering the Trump administration with criticism of its still warm relationship with Saudi Arabia. Indeed, the Post worked with other journalistic and activist groups to further chorus the criticism of the Saudi government.\\n\\n2020: The Rumble Resumes\\n\\nThen as we have seen, this January 21 came a new eruption—that Guardian story, citing a technical report, damning the Saudis, from a firm called FTI Consulting, which had been retained by Bezos. That Guardian piece was followed by a flood of other stories in the Main Stream Media, all of which echoed, at least at first, the basic Bezos/de Becker storyline, namely that Michael Sanchez notwithstanding, the Saudis are the real nogoodniks.\\n\\nIn fact, even the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights weighed in, deploring the situation and demanding an investigation of Saudi Arabia's supposed hack. (Yes, the hacking case might seem to be more of a technical issue than a human rights issue—and the U.N. might not seem credible for its expertise on human rights, either—but that's a topic for another time.)\\n\\nThe Post, of course, covered the resurgent Saudi story heavily, and on January 23, the newspaper put its weight behind a ponderous editorial, which sought to weave together many strands of suspicion, including not only of Trump and the Saudis, but also of White House aide Jared Kushner.\\n\\nYet then came the next turn of the news cycle, as the quality of FTI's technical forensics came under challenge. On January 24, the Wall Street Journal published an article headlined, Bezos Hack Report Puzzles Cyber Experts. In the Journal's careful—and no doubt well-lawyered—language, the FTI tech report relied heavily on circumstantial evidence to make the case that a WhatsApp account associated with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was probably used to hack into the iPhone of Mr. Bezos. The story quoted experts who relayed, The audit left several major technical questions about the incident unexplained and in need of more examination.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz went even further, headlining its piece, The Question Isn't Whether NSO Hacked Jeff Bezos' Phone—but Whether It Was Even Hacked at All. The article quoted one expert as saying, There is zero information and 100 percent conjectures. We don't know if there was even an infection, we simply suspect it. There is zero information that allows us to determine if it is NSO, NSA [U.S. National Security Agency] or the paranoia and fears of Jeff Bezos.\\n\\nSo now the narrative tide turned, as still more tech experts challenged the FTI findings. Thus that January 21 Guardian story, the one that kicked off this renewed flurry, started to look a little, uh, questionable.\\n\\nAnd then, as a kind of capper, later in the day, on January 24, came that latest Journal article, the one we saw earlier, the one that reported, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have evidence indicating Jeff Bezos' girlfriend provided text messages to her brother that he then sold to the National Enquirer for its article about the Amazon.com Inc. founder's affair, according to people familiar with the matter.\\n\\nIn response, what say the parties in question? As the Journal put it, Ms. Sanchez didn't respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Mr. Bezos declined to comment.\\n\\nAmidst these no comments, we might surmise this much: If it's the case that Lauren Sanchez simply gave, or otherwise transferred, the naughty Bezos items to her brother Michael—and prosecutors seem to have evidence that it was just a simple hand-off— then it's harder to believe that the Saudis, or that Israeli company, or any other larger force, were also involved.\\n\\nIndeed, if we apply the timeless wisdom of Ockham's Razor (if everything else is equal, then choose the simpler explanation), we are left with an uncomplicated case of pillow talking—make that pillow-texting—gone wild.\\n\\nWe can also add that on January 28, Bezos's newspaper, the Washington Post, dipped a careful toe into this murky pool; its reporter, perhaps mindful of her career, was careful to print both sides of the story: Three people close to AMI [owner of the Enquirer], she wrote, say that Lauren Sanchez's brother Michael Sanchez—a talent manager in Hollywood who had previously placed stories in AMI publications—is the only source for their report on the Bezos affair.\\n\\nOkay, so that's not so good for Team Bezos, the idea that the Saudis had nothing to do with the hack. Then the Post added, covering itself, at least a little, with the big boss, But the Bezos investigation, as echoed by the U.N. report, asserts that it has evidence of a Saudi hack of his phone.\\n\\nAnd we might also add that on January 31, the Guardian–which seems to be Bezos's go-to journalistic outlet–reported that in 2019, the FBI interviewed Bezos about his allegations of a hack, as part of, the newspaper said, a larger investigation of that Israeli company, NSO. So while it's possible that Team Bezos is just blowing more smoke, it's also possible that there's some fire there, somewhere.\\n\\nIn the meantime, The Daily Beast reports that also on January 31, Michael Sanchez filed suit against Bezos alleging defamation. And on February 3, Jeff Bezos counter-sued, formally accusing Michael Sanchez of extortion. That's a heavy legal concept, extortion. Interestingly, the Saudis don't seem to be accused of being involved here. The absence of the Saudis, we can observe, supports the idea that the elaborate scenario of Saudi involvement, was just a red herring–a diversion–thrown on the trail by Team Bezos, as a way of shifting attention from a simpler scenario of a family feud.\\n\\nAs the New York Post reported on February 6, Michael Sanchez's lawsuit against Bezos suggests that he had been conspiring with his sister Lauren–who is now, he suggests, engaged to Bezos–back in 2018 to leak the news of the romance. And so the idea that he leaked the story to the Enquirer is all just a big misunderstanding.\\n\\nBezos's Responsibility to the Truth\\n\\nSo at least for now, maybe we're back to square one on this story—which is to say, the basic facts as they could be known back in January 2019. That is, Bezos did things he shouldn't have done; his actions were harmful to his personal dignity and professional reputation. Moreover, his deeds cost him his marriage and that $35-billion divorce settlement. And yes, perhaps Amazon's suitability for sensitive government contracts–especially contracts involving the CIA and similar institutions—might need to be examined.\\n\\nAs for whatever might have been done by, or happened to, Lauren and Michael Sanchez, well, there are probably laws about that. And yet the violations, while perhaps egregious, are still in the larger scheme of things small potatoes.\\n\\nYet at the same time, there's a more serious possibility at play here. Much more serious. Big potatoes.\\n\\nThat is, it's possible that Bezos knew, or should have known, that he was just in the midst of a stinky situation, and yet as part of a sort of cover-up, he chose to escalate his accusations, as a way of, in effect, changing the subject away from himself as an adulterer, and toward others alleged to be aggressors.\\n\\nBy this possible reckoning, Bezos raised serious allegations about the Saudi government, that Israeli company NSO, the National Enquirer, and the Trump administration. And maybe possibly, in so raising those allegations, Bezos legally defamed someone.\\n\\nMoreover, it also seems obvious that Bezos stirred up an international hornet's nest. Using the big megaphone afforded to him by his enormous fortune and clout, Bezos has potentially jeopardized American security relationships in the Middle East, as well as perhaps undermined American foreign policy overall.\\n\\nIn fact, given what we know of Bezos's behavior, and misbehavior, Virgil thinks it's a fair question to ask: whether or not any entity connected to Bezos should be entrusted with state secrets. That question would, in fact, be a good one for Congress to take up in oversight hearings. In particular, perhaps we should examine why Amazon Web Services, Bezos's cloud-computing company, is allowed to be a major player in the cloud-computing space, including for American national security agencies.\\n\\nSo yes, let's investigate all this. Let's find out if this was just a sordid affair that got amplified globally, because Bezos wanted to drown out the noise of his own misbehaving. Let's find out if Bezos is a victim of global heavyweights—or just of his own hot-bloodedness.\\n\\nIf it turns out that Bezos is just a cheating husband who got caught, then, you know, he might want to have a long talk with lovebird Lauren about how the public came to learn of his lust.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the rest of us have enough to worry about without having to worry about fake news from a fatcat."}
{"original": "At least one in five Brits believe Jesus, Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. were extremists, a recent survey has revealed.\\n\\nThe poll, carried out by ComRes for the Evangelical Alliance earlier this month, asked over 2000 British adults nationwide whether they considered certain figures to be extreme.\\n\\nIt was found that 28 per cent of UK residents considered Jesus an extremist. A quarter of those asked also believed Martin Luther King was an extremist, and 20 per cent thought the same of Mahatma Gandhi.\\n\\nDr David Landrum, director of advocacy for the Evangelical Alliance, commented: The poll shows the scale of moral confusion in our society with the public having no way of deciding whether something is extreme or not.\\n\\nThe poll also found that 36 per cent of the public thought it was extreme for the UK to leave the EU, while 30 per cent thought it was extreme to remain in it.\\n\\nThe willingness to classify political views which should be respected, such as leaving or staying in the EU, as 'extreme', shows the danger of focusing the extremism debate on beliefs we may find uncomfortable or disagree with, rather than on actions that threaten lives, Landrum said.\\n\\nOther results showed 41 per cent of the British public found it extreme to believe marriage should be between a man and a woman and 37 per cent didn't think it was extreme for children not to be assigned a gender at birth.\\n\\nThe survey comes after Theresa May announced plans to set up a Commission for Countering Extremism, an idea which she reiterated in a statement at Downing Street last month.\\n\\nThere has been far too much tolerance of extremism in our country over many years – and that means extremism of any kind, including Islamophobia.\\n\\nThis is why this government will act to stamp out extremism and hateful ideology, both across society and on the internet, she said.\\n\\nA parliamentary report last year revealed ministers 'struggled to define extremism' and stated 'it was far from clear that there is an accepted definition of what constitutes extremism, let alone what legal powers there should be, if any, to combat it.'\\n\\nLandrum fears this confusion about the definition of extremism could create problems when trying to deal with it.\\n\\nDetached from terrorism and incitement to violence, extremism does not work as a litmus test for judging peaceful beliefs and opinions. Indeed, the government have tried and failed over the last two years to define extremism without any precision and this poll shows that the public share that confusion.\\n\\nIt therefore seems unlikely that a newly established quango, such as extremism commission, will solve such problems. It is not wise to foster a society where volatile public opinion can be used to determine what might be extreme or acceptable views, he said."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of requests by men to bring in child and adolescent brides to live in the United States were approved over the past decade, according to government data obtained by The Associated Press. In one case, a 49-year-old man applied for admission for a 15-year-old girl.\\n\\nThe approvals are legal: The Immigration and Nationality Act does not set minimum age requirements. And in weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives.\\n\\nBut the data raises questions about whether the immigration system may be enabling forced marriage and about how U.S. laws may be compounding the problem despite efforts to limit child and forced marriage. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the United States, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.\\n\\nThere were more than 5,000 cases of adults petitioning on behalf of minors and nearly 3,000 examples of minors seeking to bring in older spouses or fiances, according to the data requested by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2017 and compiled into a report.\\n\\nSome victims of forced marriage say the lure of a U.S. passport combined with lax U.S. marriage laws are partly fueling the petitions.\\n\\nMy passport ruined my life, said Naila Amin, a dual citizen from Pakistan who grew up in New York City.\\n\\nShe was forcibly married at 13 in Pakistan and applied for papers for her 26-year-old husband to come to the country.\\n\\nPeople die to come to America, she said. I was a passport to him. They all wanted him here, and that was the way to do it.\\n\\nAmin, now 29, said she was betrothed to her first cousin Tariq when she was just 8 and he was 21. The petition was eventually terminated after she ran away. She said the ordeal cost her a childhood. She was in and out of foster care and group homes, and it took a while to get her life on track.\\n\\nI was a child. I want to know: Why weren't any red flags raised? Whoever was processing this application, they don't look at it? They don't think? Amin asked.\\n\\nThere is a two-step process for obtaining U.S. immigration visas and green cards. Petitions are first considered by USCIS. If granted, they must be approved by the State Department. Overall, there were 3.5 million petitions received from budget years 2007 through 2017.\\n\\nOver that period, there were 5,556 approvals for those seeking to bring minor spouses or fiancees, and 2,926 approvals by minors seeking to bring in older spouses, according to the data. Additionally, there were 204 for minors by minors. Petitions can be filed by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\\n\\nIt indicates a problem. It indicates a loophole that we need to close, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told the AP.\\n\\nIn nearly all the cases, the girls were the younger person in the relationship. In 149 instances, the adult was older than 40, and in 28 cases the adult was over 50, the committee found. Among the examples: In 2011, immigration officials approved a 14-year-old's petition for a 48-year-old spouse in Jamaica. A petition from a 71-year-old man was approved in 2013 for his 17-year-old wife in Guatemala.\\n\\nThere are no nationwide statistics on child marriage, but data from a few states suggests it is far from rare. State laws generally set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, yet every state allows exceptions. Most states let 16- and 17-year-olds marry if they have parental consent, and several states — including New York, Virginia and Maryland — allow children under 16 to marry with court permission.\\n\\nFraidy Reiss, who campaigns against coerced marriage as head of a group called Unchained at Last, researched data from her home state of New Jersey. She determined that nearly 4,000 minors, mostly girls, were married in the state from 1995 to 2012, including 178 who were under 15.\\n\\nThis is a problem both domestically and in terms of immigration, she said.\\n\\nReiss — who says she was forced into an abusive marriage by her Orthodox Jewish family when she was 19 — said that often cases of child marriage via parental consent involve coercion, with a girl forced to marry against her will.\\n\\nThey are subjected to a lifetime of domestic servitude and rape, she said. And the government is not only complicit; they're stamping this and saying: Go ahead.\\n\\nThe data was requested in 2017 by Johnson and then-Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee's top Democrat. Johnson said it took a year to get the information, showing there needs to be a better system to track and vet the petitions.\\n\\nOur immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.\\n\\nUSCIS didn't know how many of the approvals were granted by the State Department, but overall only about 2.6 percent of spousal or fiancee claims are rejected.\\n\\nSeparately, the data show some 4,749 minor spouses or fiancees received green cards to live in the U.S. over that same 10-year period.\\n\\nThe head of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna, said in a letter to the committee that their request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages. The agency noticed some issues in how the data was collected and has resolved them. Officials also created a flagging system that requires verification of the birthdate whenever a minor is detected.\\n\\nThe country where most requests came from was Mexico, followed by Pakistan, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and Yemen. Middle Eastern nationals had the highest percentage of overall approved petitions.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Colleen Long on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/ctlong1"}

For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female.\\n\\nThe gay lobby wants Graham's money but they do not want the Christian worldview that inspires people to give money to his organization or to volunteer their time to serve others. Accountable for Equality and other LGBT advocacy groups have expressed their revulsion at the idea that a Christian charitable organization should openly appeal for Christian volunteers as Franklin Graham does.\\n\\nChris Fleming, spokesman for Accountable for Equality, stated that this behavior is despicable and flat out blasphemous.\\n\\nOn its website, Samaritan's Purse offers a list of frequently asked questions, including: Do I have to be a Christian to volunteer? The response is this:\\n\\nThe primary mission of Samaritan's Purse is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and we seek volunteers who have the same mindset. We ask that volunteers review our Statement of Faith and agree to support the ministry guidelines of Samaritan's Purse.\\n\\nIn other words, as an overtly Christian association, Samaritan's Purse requires that volunteers share the same values and ideals that inspire the group. Groups like PETA and Greenpeace do the same thing, looking only for volunteers who share their commitment to animal rights and the protection of the environment. Apparently, this commonsense principle does not apply to Christians.\\n\\nLGBT groups have viciously suggested that as a Christian organization, Samaritan's Purse volunteers will turn away gays and lesbians infected with the virus, leaving them on their own to find care elsewhere.\\n\\nGraham has long fought for religious hospitals, or even individual staff members, to be able to do just that, wrote Ross Murray, senior director for GLAAD.\\n\\nGay Star News similarly wrote that Samaritan's Purse may be able to force volunteers to refuse treatment to LGBT+ people.\\n\\nIn response to such groundless accusations, Graham said that Samaritan's Purse treats everyone we help the same.\\n\\nWe do not make distinctions about an individual's religion, race, sexual orientation, or economic status.

{"original": "Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog has taken the top spot at the box office for the second weekend in a row.\\n\\nIt is a win of sorts for Jim Carrey, who makes a comeback in a leading role as the movie's villain, Dr. Robotnik. But unfortunately for Carrey, who has built a second career as a vociferous critic of President Donald Trump, Sonic is a deeply conservative film — which may explain its success.\\n\\nFirst of all, the (human) hero of the film is a small-town police officer, Tom Wachowski, played by James Marsden. The villain is a Deep State agent who uses high-tech drones and surveillance technology and operates above the law in his quest to capture Sonic, a traveler from another dimension whose powers are deemed a national security threat.\\n\\nDr. Robotnik is almost a parody of the American elite, constantly sneering at the plebeians with whom he must deal, presuming his intellectual pedigree entitles him to rule. One almost expects him to refer to them as deplorables. Carrey may have contempt for Trump and his supporters in real life but on screen, he plays a caricature of himself — and portrays the type of villain who fits perfectly into the MAGA movement's populist narrative.\\n\\nThe action is set in the fictional rural Idaho town of Green Hills, whose inhabitants are portrayed, for the most part, as ordinary, decent, and tolerant people — if a bit boring. The fact that the hero happens to have an interracial marriage, with veterinarian Dr. Maddie Wachowski (Tika Sumpter), plays no role at all, except — possibly — for Dr. Sumpter's urbane sister, who disapproves of the marriage for reasons that are never quite made clear. But the town simply overlooks race.\\n\\n***Spoilers ahead***\\n\\nUltimately, what is most conservative about the film is that the hero, Wachowski, chooses his life in small-town America over a new career opportunity in San Francisco. Through saving Sonic the Hedgehog, he comes to realize that the ordinary things he does for people in his town are more precious than the high drama of police life in the big city.\\n\\nThese are fundamentally conservative themes.

{"original": "Two former romantic partners of embattled star Johnny Depp have cast doubt on Amber Heard's claim that the actor repeatedly physically abused her during their 15-month marriage, describing the Pirates of the Caribbean star as a soft person who never so much as raised his voice against them.\\n\\nVanessa Paradis — the French model who was with Depp for 14 years and is the mother of his two children — and Lori Anne Allison, to whom Depp was married between 1983 and 1986, have both released statements testifying to what they claim is Depp's gentle character.\\n\\nOn Friday, Heard, 30, filed for a restraining order against her 52-year-old husband, claiming he regularly verbally and physically abused her during their marriage.\\n\\nThe latest incident was alleged to have occurred Saturday, when Heard claims Depp wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw a cell phone at her face, striking her in the eye and cheek. The actress reportedly brought photos of her bruised face to the courtroom on Friday as evidence.\\n\\nThe Rum Diary star filed for divorce from Depp on Monday.\\n\\nI believe with all my heart that these recent allegations being made [against Depp] are outrageous, Paradis wrote in an open letter obtained by TMZ. In all the years I have known Johnny he has never been physically abusive with me and this looks nothing like the man I lived with for 14 wonderful years.\\n\\nIn a statement to the UK Sun newspaper over the weekend, Depp's attorney, Laura Wasser, accused Heard of fabricating the domestic violence claims in order to secure a larger financial settlement in what is expected to be a highly contentious divorce.\\n\\nAmber is attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse, Wasser told the paper. Amber is a successful model and actress who earns her own income and is capable of supporting herself.\\n\\nLori Anne Allison, who was married to Depp for three years before their divorce in 1986, has reportedly friends that she does not believe Heard's claim of domestic violence, saying he never physically assaulted her during their marriage, according to TMZ. Allison described the Pirates of the Caribbean star as a soft person who hardly even raised his voice.\\n\\nThe gossip site reports that the former couple are still close; Allison reportedly called Depp to offer her condolences after the actor's mother died earlier this month.\\n\\nIn court documents Friday, Heard said that Depp's temper and paranoia is exceptionally scary for me as it has proven many times to be physically dangerous and/or life-threatening to me.\\n\\nPolice arriving at the couple's Los Angeles apartment on Saturday told TMZ that they found no evidence of physical violence consistent with the abuse Heard has accused Depp of. The actress reportedly declined to file a police report.\\n\\nA judge reportedly denied Heard's request for $50,000 per month in spousal support and refused to order Depp into mandatory anger management. Heard is reportedly staying in the family home while Depp played a concert overseas with his band, the Hollywood Vampires, and promoted his latest film, Alice Through the Looking Glass.\\n\\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"}
{"original": "The Supreme Court's recent decision on whether a Christian baker can be forced to make a wedding cake for a gay marriage (no) arriving on the same day that Bill Clinton reared his syphilitic head on NBC's Today reminded me how liberals always use black people as props.\\n\\nMidway through the last century, bedrock legal principles about property rights and freedom of association were abrogated to deal with a specific, intractable problem: We could not get Democrats to stop discriminating against blacks.\\n\\nSo Republicans, with very little Democratic help, passed a slew of laws saying: No, even though you own that restaurant, you cannot discriminate against black customers. And no, even though we are a free people, you cannot refuse to associate with black people in your clubs, universities or sports teams.\\n\\nThis should have been a one-time exception to the law for one specific group of people based on an emergency.\\n\\nBut Democrats, never wild about freedom in the first place, saw civil rights as a great gig. Instead of civil rights being used to remedy historic injuries done to a specific group of people, they'd use civil rights as a false flag for all their pet projects.\\n\\nJust six years after passage of the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act, Democrats in New York had dropped black people from the equation and moved onto legalized abortion. State senator Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan explained why killing the unborn was a right: It was the end of the civil rights era, and we viewed [abortion] as a civil right.\\n\\nIn the 1991 case Kreimer v. Morristown, a Carter-appointed federal district judge, H. Lee Sarokin, ruled that a public library's discrimination against smelly, frightening homeless people violated the equal protection clause because it had a disparate impact on people who refuse to bathe compared to those who bathe regularly. Three years later, President Clinton promoted him to an appellate judgeship. (The judge, not the homeless person.)\\n\\nIn 2007, then-governor Eliot Spitzer vowed that New York state will continue to be a beacon of civil rights — when proposing a state law that would guarantee access to late-term abortions.\\n\\nIn June 2012, The New York Times chirpily reported gay rights the fastest-moving civil rights movement in our nation's history!\\n\\nThese days, you could be forgiven for not realizing that civil rights ever had anything to do with black people. According to Equal Opportunity Employment Commission statistics, for a least a decade, 65 percent of all civil rights claims have had absolutely nothing to do with race discrimination.\\n\\nThe gay wedding cake caper is only the most recent example of our majestic civil rights.\\n\\nInstead of basing favored treatment under the law on a history of brutal and widespread injustice in America, liberals thought it should also be based on other forms of suffering, such as: being a woman, being a Muslim, wanting an abortion, having been born in Mexico, being a smelly homeless person stinking up the public library and — according to Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week — being a gay couple who wants to force a Christian to bake a cake for your wedding.\\n\\nIt must make blacks feel great being compared to daft women, smelly homeless people and bossy gays harassing a Christian baker.\\n\\nAnd apes!\\n\\nPrinceton ethics professor Peter Singer compares black people to apes, citing the black liberation movement as a model for the liberation of apes. We must extend to other species, Singer says, the basic principle of equality that we extend to all members of our own species.\\n\\nThis wasn't an Ambien-induced Twitter rant by a comedian. Singer wrote it, calmly and deliberately, in a book on ethics.\\n\\nStill, I believe the greatest insult black Americans have had to endure from liberals was when they called Bill Clinton the first black president.\\n\\nI notice that he was not the first black president when Democrats were singing Fleetwood Mac at his inauguration, nor when he was appointing the first woman attorney general or passing welfare reform. Only after Clinton was caught in the most humiliating sex scandal in U.S. history did he suddenly become the first black president. (Which is not true, according to Monica Lewinsky's description of Clinton's private parts.)\\n\\nDuring the House impeachment hearings, Rep. Maxine Waters ferociously defended Clinton, saying, I am here in the name of my slave ancestors. She said she had woken up in the middle of the night, with flashes of the struggles of my African ancestors for justice.\\n\\nWhat this had to do with Clinton perjuring himself about molesting a chubby Jewish White House intern was anyone's guess.\\n\\nAlways the master of subtlety, as soon as the Lewinsky scandal broke, Clinton promptly invited the Rev. Jesse Jackson to the White House to pray with him. Two months later, he took off on an 11-day, six-nation $43 million trip to — guess where? Africa!\\n\\nHaven't black people suffered enough without this horny hick piggybacking on their oppression?\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT 2018 ANN COULTER"}

John McCain (R-AZ). The Glory Days crooner supported Obama again in 2012, calling him the best choice to get us and keep us moving in the right direction.\\n\\nWe're still living through very hard times but justice, equality and real freedom are not always a tide rushing in. They are more often a slow march, inch by inch, day after long day. I believe President Obama feels these days in his bones and has the strength to live them with us and to lead us to a country '…where no one crowds you and no one goes it alone,' Springsteen said at the time.\\n\\nObama awarded Bruce Springsteen with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a star-studded ceremony in November 2016, celebrating him as one of several Americans who have lifted our spirits, strengthened our union, pushed us towards progress and crediting Springsteen for crafting anthems of our America, the reality of who we are and the reverie of who we want to be.\\n\\nThe news comes as Springsteen continues to face fallout over a November 14 DWI arrest, facing charges which include driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, and consuming alcohol in a closed area. He is expected to appear in court on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe former president is hardly the only Democrat politician to expand into podcasts in recent months. Spotify launched the The Michelle Obama Podcast featuring former first lady Michelle Obama last year. She made waves in one episode after criticizing white Americans, contending that they treated her as if she did not exist.\\n\\nThat is so telling of how white America views people who are not like them, like we don't exist. And when we do exist, we exist as a threat. And that's exhausting, she said.\\n\\nTwice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also launched a podcast ahead of the 2020 presidential election titled You and Me Both with Hillary Clinton, interviewing a range of personalities, from activist Gloria Steinem to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has followed suit, launching his podcast Why Am I Telling You This? with iHeartMedia.\\n\\nHe has the rare gift of having both a deep intellect and an innate ability to relate to people from all walks of life, John Sykes, president of entertainment enterprises for iHeartMedia said of Clinton, describing him as a born storyteller.

{"original": "As tributes pour in for basketball legend Kobe Bryant after his tragic death in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, on Sunday at the age of 41, some fans are remembering how Bryant's Catholic faith sustained him during a difficult period of his life and inspired his philanthropy.\\n\\nThe former Laker and father of four was raised Catholic and spent his childhood in Italy, where his father, Joe Bryant, played professional basketball in Italian leagues. Bryant and his wife were married at a Catholic parish in Southern California in 2001 and are regular parishioners in Orange County, California, according to Catholic News Agency.\\n\\nLos Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez issued condolences on Sunday. I am praying for him and his family. May he rest in peace and may our Blessed Mother Mary bring comfort to his loved ones, the archbishop tweeted.\\n\\nSo very sad to hear the news of #KobeBryant's tragic death this morning. I am praying for him and his family. May he rest in peace and may our Blessed Mother Mary bring comfort to his loved ones. #KobeBryantRIP pic.twitter.com/QYMRL7RvCL — Abp. José H. Gomez (@ArchbishopGomez) January 26, 2020\\n\\nSinger Cristina Ballestero shared a story on Instagram about encountering Bryant at a weekday mass at Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, California.\\n\\nRight as mass begins I see a huge shadow in my right peripheral vision and hear a decently loud creak from probably a big man. I double took to see… it was KOBE BRYANT IN THE SAME PEW AS ME ON THE OTHER END! Ballestro wrote. As we went up to communion, he waited for me to go. If you grew up in the Catholic Church, you understand this is a respectful thing men do in church as a sign of respect to women. He said I have a beautiful voice. I said thank you and went up to communion.\\n\\nBallestero said that Bryant's most inspiring trait was his decision to turn to his faith in God and receive God's mercy and to be a better man after a regretful decision.\\n\\nThe regretful decision Ballestero was referring to was the circumstances that led to Bryant's arrest in 2003 for allegedly raping a woman in a hotel room in Colorado. The case was eventually dismissed after the accuser declined to testify. Bryant would later settle a civil lawsuit with the woman and issue a public apology to her acknowledging that she did not consider the encounter to be consensual.\\n\\nFirst, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year, Bryant stated in his 2004 public apology. Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.\\n\\nIn an interview with GQ magazine in 2015, Bryant shared how his Catholic faith helped him cope with the damage done to his personal relationships and his professional image following the 2003 rape case.\\n\\nThe [loss of the] endorsements were really the least of my concerns, Bryant told GQ. Was I afraid of going to jail? Yes. It was twenty-five to life, man. I was terrified. The one thing that really helped me during that process—I'm Catholic, I grew up Catholic, my kids are Catholic—was talking to a priest. It was actually kind of funny: He looks at me and says, 'Did you do it?' And I say, 'Of course not.' Then he asks, 'Do you have a good lawyer?' And I'm like, 'Uh, yeah, he's phenomenal.' So then he just said, 'Let it go. Move on. God's not going to give you anything you can't handle, and it's in his hands now. This is something you can't control. So let it go.' And that was the turning point.\\n\\nIn the same GQ interview, Bryant discussed his determination to fight for his marriage:\\n\\nIn 2011, Bryant's wife Vanessa filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Yet those differences were reconciled, thirteen months later. They remain a married couple. I'm not going to say our marriage is perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, Kobe says. We still fight, just like every married couple. But you know, my reputation as an athlete is that I'm extremely determined, and that I will work my ass off. How could I do that in my professional life if I wasn't like that in my personal life, when it affects my kids? It wouldn't make any sense.\\n\\nBryant's faith also reportedly influenced his family's charitable giving, via the Kobe & Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation.\\n\\nBryant was quick to acknowledge that everyone has made poor choices in their life, including himself. He said that's no justification for people to turn their backs on those who have been reduced to what he called 'white noise,' noted a 2012 Los Angeles Times profile of Bryant's work with the homeless.\\n\\nI don't want to be too cheesy and quote 'Spider-Man' but with great power comes great responsibility, Bryant told the Times about his philanthropic work.\\n\\nI got a lot of people saying, 'Come help us out. I want to turn my life around,' he told reporters in 2012. My response was, 'Well, that's why I'm here.' \\n\\nBryant is survived by his wife, Vanessa, and three of their daughters. The couple's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, was also killed in the helicopter crash that took Bryant's life and seven others.\\n\\nRebecca Mansour is Senior Editor-at-Large for Breitbart News and the host of Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125, which broadcasts live weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6-9:00 p.m. Pacific).

{"original": "FBI Director James Comey highlighted his agency's first-ever female genital mutilation arrests in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday.\\n\\nThis is among the most important work we do, protecting children especially, Comey said in his prepared remarks.\\n\\nComey described the shocking case of Doctors Jumana Nagarwala and Fakhruddin Attar, which made headlines around the world last month as the very first prosecution for FGM in the United States:\\n\\nFor the first time since Congress passed a statute making it a crime in the United States to engage in female genital mutilation, to mutilate little girls — it's been a felony in the United States since 1996 — we made the first case, last week, against two doctors in Michigan for doing this terrifying thing to young girls all across the country.\\n\\nFGM, a practice most popular among certain parts of the Muslim world, had not been well-known before recently in the United States. The practice involves cutting a pre-pubescent girl's genitals in a ritual designed to make her clean before her eventual marriage. There are differing forms of mutilation, some more extreme than others, but all involve the removal of varying amounts of a young girl's clitoris, labia majoria, and labia minora. The most extreme form of FGM is called infibulation, in which virtually all external genitalia is removed and the wound is sewn together, leaving only a single tiny hole from which to urinate and menstruate until the girl is married.\\n\\nIt is unclear how prevalent FGM is in the United States, but Comey's FBI believes Nagarwala and Attar's FGM operation has been operating for over a decade and has mutilated girls from across the American Midwest. Both the doctors and their named victims are part of the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim sect, named only as a particular religious and cultural community in the complaints. Dawoodi Bohra is based in India and boasts over a million members across the world, with increasing numbers in the United States. The sect's leadership has made clear time and again that FGM is absolutely necessary as an act of religious purity and a religious obligation for all women and girls.\\n\\nDirector Comey closed his remarks by praising his agents who made these arrests possible. It was done by great work that you don't hear about a whole lot all across the country by the FBI, he told the committee."}
{"original": "The Democrats chosen to participate in CNN and the Des Moines Register's presidential debate on Tuesday wanted to make very clear to the world: They like women.\\n\\nThey also went out of their way to attack President Donald Trump for taking a hardline stance against Iran, one of the world's most repressive countries for women to live in.\\n\\nAll candidates who mentioned the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal, expressed support and promised to return to the negotiating table with Iran. Later in the debate — largely thanks to an increasingly acrimonious feud between Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — all posed as enlightened feminists, ready to put taxpayers' dollars to work to make American women's lives better, without acknowledging their vow to almost certainly make Iranian women's lives worse.\\n\\nThe reality of Iran's regime is that it brutally subjugates the will of its women, liberally imposing the death penalty on those who defy strict Islamic laws that have little cultural basis in pre-revolutionary Iran. When free-thinking Iranians take to the streets in protest, women are often the first to receive beatings or bullets, bleeding out in their native streets. Watching live sports is haram, a sin, for women unless Iran desperately needs good publicity on any given week.\\n\\nThe Iran nuclear deal financially subsidized Iran's atrocities against women. It is fundamentally incompatible with feminism.\\n\\nThe Democrats may have likely sensed this, as the issues of containing Iran and empowering women never crossed paths during their discussion. The debate opened with discussion on Iran, leaving the candidates open to condemn Trump for weakening the Islamic revolutionary regime.\\n\\nAs you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together, and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon, Sanders asserted.\\n\\nI was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world, including some of the folks who aren't friendly to us. And it was working, former Vice President Joe Biden claimed, falsely. It was working. It was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon.\\n\\nFormer South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lamented the collapse of the nuclear deal, initially refusing to affirm if he would work to ensure that Iran does not procure a nuclear weapon. He then claimed that overturning an agreement Iran was openly violating would bring Iran closer to joining the nuclear club.\\n\\nBy gutting the Iran nuclear deal — one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran — by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war, Buttigieg stated.\\n\\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) boasted that she worked on the nuclear deal and similarly applauded it.\\n\\nI would start negotiations [with Iran] again, she promised. And I won't take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting — Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.\\n\\nThe nuclear deal handed Iran over $150 billion, which Iran mostly invested in attempting to colonize friendly actors in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq. The money that stayed home, as made clear this week, went largely to suppress protests against the regime heavily attended by women.\\n\\nIran is one of the world's most repressive nations against its women and girls. The Islamic revolution of 1979 undid decades of progressive laws and policies towards the nation's women that allowed them to work outside the home, maintain public personas, and function largely as equals in society, relative to how many other nations at the time treated women. As Haleh Esfandiari wrote for the Atlantic Council, the regime rapidly went about erasing women from society:\\n\\nOvernight the age of marriage for girls was reduced from eighteen to nine; it took ten years of effort by women activists to raise it again, but only to thirteen. Women lost the right to seek a divorce and the right to child custody. Family protection courts were dissolved, eventually replaced by civil courts, and women no longer could become judges. Polygamy once again was permissible under the law. … The streets became a sea of black, brown, and navy manteaus (ankle-long coats) and head covers; bright colors were banned. Smiling was frowned upon. Only loose women, it was assumed, would smile at strangers or laugh out loud in public.\\n\\nIn 2014, when the United Nations Human Rights Council published its routine report on human rights in the country, it found growing repression of women: proposed laws to ban women from working in public locations like coffee shops and the cancellation of artistic performances after the government became aware women were involved.\\n\\nIranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, ranging from issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody, to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators, Human Rights Watch declared a year later, noting that the violation of women's rights extended outside the typical venues — family rights, the right to work, medical rights — into realms like the prohibition on women watching sports in public arenas.\\n\\nWomen routinely bear the brunt of Iran's violent repression of protesters. The face of the 2009 green revolution, a pro-democracy movement crushed by then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was Neda Agha-Soltan, a 26-year-old woman shot in broad daylight amid the protests. Other protesters recorded the shooting and her expiration, outraging the world.\\n\\nOver a decade later, Iran's women are once again taking the streets. During the protests against the regime on Monday, video surfaced of another woman, whose identity remains unknown, bleeding profusely in the streets of Tehran, apparently from a gunshot wound to the leg.\\n\\nNoting the tide in public sentiment against repression of women, pressuring change even in nations like neighboring Saudi Arabia, the Iranian regime has rolled back only the least important of its abusive policies against women in the hope of receiving international praise. Last year, the regime let some women watch a soccer match at a stadium, then demanded applause.\\n\\nSimilarly, two years ago, it declared that women caught not wearing hijab in public would not go directly to prison, but be matriculated into Islamic values classes to be guilted about showing their hair. The policy applied only to first-time offenders, of course; women who repeatedly rejected the Islamic headscarf could face criminal prosecution.\\n\\nBased on a society-oriented, educational approach, the police will not arrest those who don't respect Islamic values, Brig. Gen. Hossein Rahimi, proclaimed at the time.

They took me wherever they wanted. Whatever they said I wore. Every sentence they ordered I repeated. Whenever they saw fit, they exploited me, she said in a statement.

I have no other wish except for Taekwondo, security and a happy and healthy life.\\n\\nNot one candidate on the debate stage Tuesday mentioned Kimia Alizadeh, or Neda Agha-Soltan, or any of the millions of women Iran has executed, abused, tortured, or exploited. Instead, they focused on supporting the women on stage — some of the wealthiest, most privileged, and most powerful women in the world.\\n\\nThe Democrats' voter base will likely fail to recognize the dissonance between their candidates' stances on Iran and their performative support for women. The left rarely condemns repressors if it means acknowledging anything positive about Trump. But no two issues exist in isolation, and Democrats must address the incompatibility of what policies they support with what they state their values are.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

{"original": "The Catholic Archbishop for the Military Services issued a statement this week defending President Trump's reinstatement of a policy disqualifying transgender individuals from military service, noting that gender ideology undermines basic Christian anthropology.\\n\\nArchbishop Timothy P. Broglio cited the President's reasons for the ban including a detriment to military readiness and the cost associated with gender reassignment surgeries and therapies, but suggested that the underlying issue goes even deeper than those real but pragmatic concerns.\\n\\nWhile military readiness is of utmost importance to our servicemen and women who selflessly risk personal safety to defend the values and freedoms of our Nation, Broglio wrote, the essence of the issue goes to the heart of the dignity of the human person.\\n\\nThe dignity of the human person is rooted in the fact that people are created in the image and likeness of God – God who in the fullness of his divinity assumed humanity to redeem the world, Broglio said.\\n\\nThe Military Archbishop, in charge of all Catholic military chaplaincies, quoted from a recent conference, titled Framing a Catholic Response to Gender Ideology, which declared that gender ideology undermines basic Christian anthropology by defining the person as a disembodied mind and the body as a mere instrument.\\n\\nSexual orientation and gender identity issues reflect a rapidly increasing and incorrect societal attitude that individual behaviors in life should pursue immediate and personal choices rather than eternal truth, Broglio stated.\\n\\nWhenever making personal choices, he said, the bigger issues of the meaning of human existence must be addressed.\\n\\nIt is opportune to reaffirm that personal choices in life, whether regarding the protection of the unborn, the sanctity of marriage and the family, or the acceptance of a person's God-created biology, should be made not solely for a penultimate reality on this earth but in anticipation of the ultimate reality of sharing in the very life of God in heaven, he said.\\n\\nBroglio's words echoed similar expressions on gender ideology penned by Pope Francis in his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si'. In it, the Pope condemned the relativism at the heart of gender theory and urges those struggling with gender identity issues to accept their bodies as God made them.\\n\\nThe acceptance of our bodies as God's gift, Francis wrote, is vital for welcoming and accepting the entire world as a gift from the Father and our common home, whereas thinking that we enjoy absolute power over our own bodies turns, often subtly, into thinking that we enjoy absolute power over creation.\\n\\nIn the framework of responsible stewardship for creation, Francis suggested, the manipulation of gender implies an assault on the Creator and a disrespect for his designs.\\n\\nShortly after the publication of the Pope's letter, the Vatican reaffirmed the binary male-female distinction of human beings, banning transgender persons from being godparents posing as the opposite sex from which they were born.\\n\\nThe case that came to the attention of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith involved a 21-year-old transgender person from Cádiz, Spain. Alex Salinas was born a girl but as of February 2014 holds an ID card identifying her as a male. At the time, Alex was on a waiting list to receive sex reassignment surgery.\\n\\nWhen Alex applied to be the godfather of her nephew, the local bishop sent a consultation to the Vatican's doctrinal office, asking what to do in this case.\\n\\nThe Vatican Congregation responded that beyond the obvious problem with a female wishing to present herself as a godfather, there were other moral issues at play as well, since transsexual behavior publicly reveals an attitude contrary to the moral imperative of resolving the problem of one's sexual identity according to the truth of one's sexuality.\\n\\nThe Congregation said that discrimination had nothing to do with its refusal to allow Alex to sponsor her nephew, but rather based its decision on the lack of the qualities needed to assume the responsibility of being a godparent in the Church.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "A few days ago I had a dust-up on Twitter with National Review's Jonah Goldberg. Our conflict was about Trump's fitness to be president, a subject that has been broached millions of times on social media by other Internet partisans.\\n\\nTwitchy posted the exchange and promoted it this way: It's On! Jonah Goldberg, David Horowitz Duke It Out Over Trump's Character. The donnybrook led to 500,000 impressions off my Twitter feed, including legions of anti-Trump zealots eager to demonstrate how creative they could be in devising insults to throw at me for defending Trump: beyond dumb, in need of psychiatric help, and probably receiving payments through offshore bank accounts.\\n\\nAs it happens, I've known Jonah for twenty years or more, admired his wit and insights, promoted his books, and put him on my platforms. I was distressed when he joined the chorus of Never Trumpers, but never wrote a critical word about him, hoping I guess that, as Trump systematically undid the damage that the Obama regime had inflicted on the country, Jonah would return to his senses.\\n\\nOther Never Trump conservatives, on the other hand, just jumped to the other side. Bill Kristol even went so far as to collude with the Brennan-instigated witch-hunt by spreading talking points from the Steele dossier. It was easy to write these renegades off, though still wondering how they rationalized the betrayal of their lifetime principles, or were able to deny that they were doing so.\\n\\nBut a group of Never Trumpers like Jonah adopted a less radical stance and conceded that many or even most of Trump's policy actions were actually conservative, and ones they agreed with. What made them Never Trumpers was his horrible, defective character. Most prominent among this group was Bret Stephens, whom I have also admired and promoted in the past. At the end of Trump's first year, Bret wrote an op-ed for the New York Times – the position being an obvious reward for his defection – called Why I'm Still A Never Trumper. In it he praised Trump's major policy actions since entering the White House. But then he attacked Trump's character as un-presidential and indefensible. And he averred: I still wish Hillary Clinton were president.\\n\\nWhen I read his column, the first question that popped into my mind was this: how can indefensible and un-presidential bad character lead to such admirable presidential decisions? I am not aware of any attempt by Bret Stephens or Jonah Goldberg or similar Never Trumpers to provide an answer.\\n\\nThe posture of these Never Trumpers is transparently self-serving. It preserves their intellectual credentials as conservatives, and simultaneously takes them out of the line of fire from an increasingly vicious left whose goal is to destroy Trump and his presidency, and – incidentally – conservative America. Sitting on the fence affords them new career opportunities — appearances on CNN and MSNBC and columns in the NY Times. All that's required is that they avoid taking sides in the political war that is engulfing the country. All this reminds me of a memorable Trotsky sneer about liberals, whom he accused of being reluctant to step into the stream of political conflict because they were afraid to get their moral principles wet.\\n\\nSo, when this tweet from Jonah Goldberg appeared on my feed, I abandoned my self-restraint and answered it:\\n\\nRe-asking a question I've been posing for three years: Please come up with a definition of good character that Donald Trump can clear. — Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) August 15, 2018\\n\\nThis was followed by a re-tweet and a new comment:\\n\\nThis is easily the most triggering question you can ask of Trumpist snowflakes. https://t.co/zUzMiBe8Yg — Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) August 16, 2018\\n\\nI don't know whether it was the snide-ness of this comment or its absoluteness that triggered me, but it seemed so pig-headedly self-righteous, so oblivious of the complexities of human character, not to mention the nuclear dimensions of the left's war against Trump, that I responded, and in doing so walked into a hornets' nest.\\n\\nHe has an amazing family. He's loyal to a fault. He loves the country that gave him a privileged life, He works around the clock for ordinary Americans, & their security. He would never appoint a treacherous individual to head the CIA. Wake up Jonah.Its a war & u cant be neutral. https://t.co/52J1etR9cz — David Horowitz (@horowitz39) August 16, 2018\\n\\nWhich drew this retort:\\n\\nThis is total nonsense David. He's not loyal to a fault. He's not loyal to his wives. Read up on how he treated Roy Cohn ffs. He doesn't work around the clock. He won't read and won't stop watching TV. I can't tell if your head is up your ass or his. https://t.co/IzeE8FIrPs — Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) August 16, 2018\\n\\nThe nastiness of that last sentence shocked me. Evidently the hatred of Trump is so fevered it can burn through twenty years of cordiality and acquaintance. I wonder if Jonah would be so hostile to someone who shared his view of Trump's character but thought Trump's policies were racist and tyrannical.\\n\\nAs it happens I am well aware of the vulnerabilities of what I tweeted. I should never have written it and fallen into the Twitter trap. Tweets don't provide enough space to account for the complexities of this subject or provide sufficient examples to make one's case. Character is notoriously mercurial and complex to judge.\\n\\nAs it happens, in referring to Trump's loyalty I had in mind two episodes. The first was the topic of the week: Omarosa. Why did he stick with such a wretched individual for so long, despite warnings from everyone around him that she was no good? Loyalty to a fault. The second was when the left showed its teeth in his first days in the White House and maliciously attacked Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions as white nationalists and racists and even neo-Nazis. Any other Republican, freshly in office, would have thrown them under the bus, however false the accusations. Trump's fortitude, his refusal to back down under withering fire, is also a character trait, and an admirable one – actually the key to his success where Bush and congressional Republicans had repeatedly failed. Loyalty.\\n\\nSince Jonah brings up Trump's three marriages let me ask the question: who can see inside another person's marriage? I thought, moreover, that since Reagan, who had two wives, entered the White House and performed as a conservative hero, Republicans would have gotten over their puritanical prejudices. All politicians have flawed characters. It's the nature of the job, which requires compromises, prevarications, dirty deals, and the like. In Trump's case what is important is not his loyalty to his wives (and none of them seem to be complaining), but his loyalty to the cause he champions and the people who support him.\\n\\nHas Trump kept his promises to his supporters? Has he stayed the course he set for himself of making America great again? That loyalty is the character trait that matters most in a leader, and should matter most in any assessment of Trump. He has taken great personal risks and incurred great personal costs. His reputation for example, was pretty good before he ran against Democrats and their media, who fueled an epidemic of hate portraying him as a racist and neo-Nazi.\\n\\nI'm betting there isn't another Republican who would not have wilted under these attacks. Who would have had the fortitude to stay the course and keep his promises. That's really good character. And its presidential."}

{"original": "In his soon to be released book, former FBI Director James Comey describes how he pushed back against a request from President Donald Trump to investigate the most infamous charge made inside the anti-Trump dossier – the widely mocked and entirely unsubstantiated claim that the politician hired prostitutes to urinate on a hotel room bed in Moscow.\\n\\nComey also describes numerous other conversations with Trump in which the president complained about the dossier allegations.\\n\\nComey's description of events makes clear that he failed to tell the president on multiple occasion that his FBI was already fully aware that the dossier had been paid by Trump's primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\\n\\nComey apparently also did not inform Trump that his own FBI had determined the dossier to be only minimally corroborated, as documented by a four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority.\\n\\nIndeed, according to the GOP memo, senior officials at the FBI were aware that Clinton and the DNC financed the dossier when Comey himself cited the questionable document upon signing a FISA court application on October 21, 2016 to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer campaign foreign policy adviser. Comey signed three more FISA applications also citing the dossier. The FBI was also aware that the dossier was produced by the controversial Fusion GPS political opposition research outfit.\\n\\nA rebuttal of the GOP memo authored by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee confirmed that Comey's FBI and the DOJ were fully aware when they applied for the FISA warrant that the dossier was funded by Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and DNC via the Perkins Coie law firm.\\n\\nThe GOP memo also relates that after dossier author Christopher Steele was terminated months earlier as an FBI source a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally corroborated.\\n\\nStill, Comey saw fit, according to the Republican and Democrat memos, to utilize the dossier in the FISA documents. He seemingly failed to tell Trump about the origins of the dossier on multiple occasions, as his new book spotlights.\\n\\nABC News and the Washington Post released extensive reports on the contents of Comey's 304-page book, titled A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.\\n\\nConsistent with his June 8, 2017 prepared remarks before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey relates in the book that he briefed Trump on the dossier charges at a pre-inauguration intelligence briefing at Trump tower.\\n\\nComey writes that Trump called him up one week later, on Jan. 11, and he was fixated on the allegation that he consorted with prostitutes in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013.\\n\\nThe Post relates:\\n\\nComey writes that Trump called him and said he was concerned about the dossier being made public and was fixated on the prostitutes allegation. The president-elect argued that it could not be true because he had not stayed overnight in Moscow but had only used the hotel room to change his clothes. And after Trump explained that he would never allow people to urinate near him, Comey recalls laughing.\\n\\nI decided not to tell him that the activity alleged did not seem to require either an overnight stay or even being in proximity to the participants, Comey writes. In fact, though I didn't know for sure, I imagined the presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow was large enough for a germaphobe to be at a safe distance from the activity.\\n\\nIt was not clear why Comey failed to inform Trump of the specific activity described in the dossier, the claim that he hired a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers' (urination) show in front of him.\\n\\nComey describes how, during a one-on-one dinner on Jan. 27, he pushed back against Trump's suggestion of probing the prostitution claim.\\n\\nComey relates that Trump brought up the topic of the dossier: He may want me to investigate it to prove that it didn't happen. And then he says something that distracted me because he said, you know, 'If there's even a 1 percent chance my wife thinks that's true, that's terrible.'\\n\\n'And I remember thinking, 'How could your wife think there's a 1 percent chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow?' I'm a flawed human being, but there is literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true. So, what kind of marriage to what kind of man does your wife think [that] there's only a 99 percent chance you didn't do that?\\n\\nComey quoted Trump ask saying, I may order you to investigate that.\\n\\nComey, however, writes that he urged the president to approach the possibility of an investigation with caution.\\n\\nI said, 'Sir, that's up to you. But you'd want to be careful about that, because it might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally, and second, it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen,' Comey said.\\n\\nComey had other chances to inform Trump about the highly questionable origins of the dossier, and that his own FBI already investigated the document and found it to be only minimally corroborated.\\n\\nIn March, Comey writes that Trump called him up to complain that the Russia investigation was a cloud impeding his ability to govern, drawing attention again to the golden showers allegation.\\n\\nFor about the fourth time, he argued that the golden showers thing wasn't true, asking yet again, 'Can you imagine me, hookers?'  Comey writes of the call. In an apparent play for my sympathy, he added that he has a beautiful wife and the whole thing has been very painful for her. He asked what we could do to 'lift the cloud.' \\n\\nThe Post continued:\\n\\nComey recalls telling the president the FBI was investigating it as quickly as possible, and that he had told Congress that Trump was not personally under investigation, to which the president repeatedly told him, We need to get that fact out. Two weeks later, on April 11, Trump called Comey again to check on his request to get out that he is not under investigation, Comey writes. He seemed irritated with me, Comey recalls. I have been very loyal to you, very loyal. We had that thing, you know, Trump told him, according to the book, apparently referring to the loyalty dinner.\\n\\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

{"original": "Alibaba head and Chinese multimillionaire Jack Ma used remarks at his company's annual mass wedding to encourage Chinese couples to have sex six times a week for marathon sessions, outlets reported on Tuesday, a message in tune with the Communist Party's efforts to increase national fertility as the country faces a population death spiral.\\n\\nAfter decades of imposing a brutal one-child policy where the communist regime routinely forced women to kill illegal fetuses and still blacklists children born without the blessing of the state, Beijing has found a lack of appetite among Chinese couples for becoming parents. Communist Party chief Xi Jinping has attempted to change the tide of population decline by expanding the policy to two children, but rather than triggering a baby boom, the national fertility rate fell.\\n\\nMa, who revealed his membership in the Communist Party last year despite his status as the wealthiest man in China, appeared to be doing his part to help the government promote fertility while officiating a mass wedding of his employees, a tradition that occurs every May 10, Ali Day. Ma has previously promoted a 996 work week – 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week – a brutal schedule his detractors and human rights advocates have called abusive and deadly. He told newlyweds that marriage has its own rigorous 669 schedule: sex six days a week, with duration being the key. He reportedly did not specify what the 9 stood for in his remarks, other than an extended session.\\n\\nAt work, we emphasise the spirit of 996. In life, we should follow 669. What is 669? Six days, six times, with duration being the key, Ma said, according to a post on Alibaba's Weibo page. Weibo is a Chinese social media network the government controls. The page posted a meme image of Ma with the quote on its page, accompanied by a winking face emoji:\\n\\nJack Ma (via Alibaba Weibo page)\\n\\nMa reportedly urged sex marathons not for pleasure, but for procreation.\\n\\nThe first KPI [key performance indicator] of marriage is to have results. There must be products. What is the product? Have children, he said. Marriage is not for the purpose of accumulating wealth, not for buying a house, not for buying a car, but for having a child together.\\n\\nMa did not specify to his company's newlyweds whether he follows the 669 rule or not. Ma married his college sweetheart, Cathy Zhang, and has himself contributed two children to Chinese communist society. Zhang left her job at Alibaba to care for the children. She has publicly referred to her husband as not a handsome man.\\n\\nMa's remarks triggered some outrage on social media given his promotion of the strenuous 996 schedule, which many noted leaves little time for family life, much less sex. In response to the controversy, an Alibaba spokeswoman issued a statement saying that Ma offered lighthearted life and marital advice to 102 newlywed couples, saying the key to a successful marriage is to forget the negatives and embrace the positives of each other and that the value of love, unlike coding, can't be measured or calculated.\\n\\nInternational observers wishing to claim that China has somehow become capitalist have long upheld Ma as an example of a self-made entrepreneur. Yet Ma, like every Chinese executive, is a lifelong member of the Communist Party, a revelation he made in late 2018. Chinese state media rapidly came to his defense, publishing pieces challenging centuries of Marxist thought by claiming there is no conflict at all between being a Party member and doing business.\\n\\nMa now seems to be picking up the work the Communist Party began three years ago to maintain a stable national population. China imposed a two-child policy in 2016, expecting a massive population boom from parents longing to expand their families. Instead, the annual birth rate fell from 17.9 million children in 2016 to 17.2 million in 2017. Some estimates project that the birth rate could drop to as few as 16 million by next year. Communist Party central planners expected the birth rate to rise to 20 million by 2017.\\n\\nTwo major factors are contributing to the population decline: decades of indoctrination urging families to limit themselves to one child and the inevitable result of that indoctrination in a sexist society, 70 million fewer women than men nationwide. Even if women wanted to have more children, the mass killing of female fetuses has not left enough women of child-bearing age alive to sustain the population.\\n\\nIn late April, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the People's Daily, used the Weibo hashtag Why Aren't You Getting Married? to inquire why young people in China seem to have a distaste for starting families. In addition to couples not having children, statistics show that more and more people are less willing to get married every year, the newspaper reported, according to the site What's on Weibo. The marriage rates for 2018, the site noted, hit a new five-year low. Social stigma surrounding older marriage is also partly to blame, the site stated, citing a survey that found that, despite the stark disparity in male to female population, half of Chinese men think that women who are still single at the age of 25 are 'leftovers,' meaning their single status is attributable to something undesirable about them and thus makes them a poor match.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}
{"original": "Welfare is much worse than a way of life for many Americans—it now appears to be a new way of death, according to an expanding body of data and social studies.\\n\\nWhite Death is the shorthand way of describing the frightening rise in mortality rates for middle-aged, middle- and low-income white Americans. Since the trend was first propelled into the headlines in the fall of 2015, we've gradually recognized it as a symptom of generational despair, with drug abuse and death serving as the exit from lives without hope.\\n\\nThis is a cultural horror, and as a new Lancet study reported by Business Insider noted, it's affecting American Indians and Alaska natives as well:\\n\\nDeath at any age is devastating for those left behind, but premature death is especially so, in particular for children and parents, said senior study author Amy Berrington of the National Cancer Institute in a press release. The study, which analyzed death certificate data ranging from 1999 to 2014, found that mortality rates for 30-year-old white women rose up to 2.3% per year over that time period; those for 30-year-old white men rose .6% per year; annual rates for 30-year-old Native Americans rose 4.3%; and rates for 30-year-old Alaska Natives rose 1.9% per year. For white Americans, that represents a reversal, but the authors write that premature death rates for middle-aged American Indians and Alaska Natives have risen for every birth cohort since 1948. The researchers write that these sorts of increases are extremely unusual in high-income countries. They say increases this high are on par with premature mortality spikes at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the US (mid-80s to mid-90s) or in Russia in the post-economic crisis late-1990s.\\n\\nThe study went on to observe that mortality rates for many other groups have fallen since the turn of the century, including Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and most dramatically black Americans, although their death rates remain generally much higher than whites. The study that originally highlighted rising mortality rates in 2015 explained it was really more a matter of the rates for white Americans of recent generations flattening out, while most other groups saw significant improvement over the past 15 years. The improvements have been attributed to successful crusades against smoking, drug abuse, and other unhealthy lifestyle choices, combined with expanded treatment for maladies like HIV.\\n\\nAt the close of 2016, the Centers for Disease Control reported that the overall U.S. life expectancy dropped for the first time since 1993, with the under-65 demographic hit particularly hard. The 1993 dip came at the height of the AIDS epidemic.\\n\\nReporting on this development, NPR quoted researchers who blamed an epidemic of obesity—which leads to increased deaths from heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and possibly Alzheimer's—as well as the epidemic of prescription opioid painkillers and heroin abuse.\\n\\nAgain, such broad behavioral trends demand a cultural explanation. Why are so many people in certain demographic groups behaving in ways that reduce their lifespans, at a time when medical science is pushing average lifespan ever higher? University of Pennsylvania sociologist Irma Elo suggested rising mortality could be related to the economic circumstances that many Americans have experienced in the last eight years, or so, since the recession.\\n\\nBut certainly we've faced far more dire economic circumstances in the past, without such an increase in mortality. The White Death isn't about people starving. On the contrary, according to the researchers quoted by NPR, rampant obesity is a significant factor.\\n\\nPastor Paul Grodell spoke of despair in a December New York Post article on the opiate epidemic in rural and post-industrial America:\\n\\nThe root of the addiction comes from the hopelessness that people feel in towns like Elyria, said Grodell. When you are in a state of hopelessness, you reach for something that gives you relief, that helps you escape. Too often government programs and the political rhetoric that promotes them keep people trapped in that hopelessness, tethering them to the life of handouts and government dependency.\\n\\nGrodell was himself a heroin addict, whose gateway drug was prescription pain pills to manage the pain from powerlifting competitions. Many studies of the rise in mortality rates point to the easy availability of prescription pain medication as the first step toward serious addiction; it has been theorized that working-class whites were hit so hard because they're more likely to visit a doctor, complain about chronic pain, and be given painkillers.\\n\\nNew York Post author Salena Zito postulated that Donald Trump's presidential campaign was one of the first times our political elite deigned to notice the devastation in post-industrial America and promise to do something about it. Those communities are usually dismissed in a way the inner cities are not. Their residents have been told to suck it up and accept their diminished prospects as the price of prosperity for diverse others. They're told to think of themselves as privileged simply because of their skin color, and that means they aren't permitted to complain about government policies or cultural trends that put them at a disadvantage.\\n\\n(Not that it's better to have the full benevolent attention of the Nanny State turned upon you, as the situation in the inner cities demonstrates. Inter-generational welfare dependence is precisely what the creators of the Great Society promised would not happen, back when they swore the success of their programs would be measured by how many people no longer needed them. Today, defenders of the welfare state insist its success should be measured by how comfortable and sustainable poverty has become.)\\n\\nA December guest editorial at ZeroHedge described the growing sense that the American Dream is fading, specifically citing stagnant income and social mobility, declining home ownership, and studies that show children often fare worse than their parents.\\n\\nPerhaps one reason that sense weighs so heavily upon the last couple of generations is the growth of mass media and the Internet, giving even the poorest Americans a sense of cultural awareness—including keen awareness of their own plight—that wasn't possible in the days when there were only a handful of stations on the TV set.\\n\\nStudents of poverty often point to the general increase in our material standard of living, coupled with generous welfare assistance, to note that poverty in the 21st Century is often objectively better than middle-class life 75 or 100 years ago. And yet, we have a generation killing itself—often actively killing itself, given the rise in suicide rates. That didn't happen in far more hardscrabble times, although it would be fair to note that lower average life expectancies and more primitive data-gathering methods would have made a mortality spike more difficult to detect, if one did occur.\\n\\nMaybe what we're missing most acutely are the resources for coping with despair—resources of family, community, and church that were more plentiful in times gone by. Ronald Bailey touched on this in a Reason article from January, written after his return to McDowell County, West Virginia some four decades after his family moved away.\\n\\nMcDowell County has the lowest average life expectancy for males in the United States, a problem attributed to poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and murder. The poverty is largely due to the ongoing collapse of the coal industry, and the mechanization of the work that remains. The place has so few jobs that WalMart closed its store at the county seat.\\n\\nBailey noted that McDowell County has a surfeit of social services agencies and programs, with a staggering 47 percent of the county's income coming from Social Security, disability insurance, and the food-stamp program. One of the officials responsible for administering these programs told Bailey that residents have developed an entitlement mentality, believing that everybody owes them a living, housing, clothing, and food.\\n\\nIt is further noted that the provision of such extensive welfare payments creates a poverty trap that prevents the remaining impoverished citizens of McDowell County from moving away, as so many others have already done. In other words, every form of ambition has been destroyed, leaving behind an atmosphere of sustained despair, and government money will ensure it grinds on forever.\\n\\nSome of the most interesting, and horrible, passages of Bailey's account concern the demise of families. Young people in their 20s and 30s are described as strung out and walking around like zombies instead of working and raising their children. Their parents failed to pass along parenting skills, and the moral imperative to use them. Instead, the cycle of drug addiction is the most likely inheritance for kids to get from their families. Evidently, almost half the children in the country are living with someone other than their biological parents—often grandparents or other family members, stepping in to raise the children of broken homes. Seventy-seven percent of these children live in households where no one has a job.\\n\\nAnd there are plenty of those children, even though subsidized birth control is readily available. Teens and twentysomethings simply aren't bothering to use it, because they know their families and the government will take care of accidental children, and besides, a semi-accidental pregnancy might provide them with some emotional purpose in life.\\n\\nIt's not just the children who suffer from the demise of traditional families and the loss of good parenting skills. The parents find themselves hitting middle age without the financial, social, and emotional resources of an intact family—without children to give them purpose as they begin productive adult lives, without grown sons and daughters to help them as they get older, without financial assets accumulating from one generation to the next.\\n\\nBailey quotes from Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance: Growing up around a lot of single moms and dads and living in a place where most of your neighbors are poor really narrows the realm of possibilities. It means that you don't have people to show you by example what happens when you work hard and get an education.\\n\\nThat's the exact opposite of what fashionable liberals have told us for generations now: marriage is a silly formality, there's nothing special about marriage between men and women, the nuclear family is obsolete, it's monstrous for society to expect women to sacrifice their career ambitions to focus on raising kids, and single parenting is every bit as good as the traditional family (with a little help from Big Government to cover for Dad's missing paycheck). Those who warned about the dangers of family breakdown three decades ago were relentlessly mocked for their obsession with outmoded, overrated, narrow-minded family values.\\n\\nWhat joy and purpose await the dissolute 20- and 30-year-old substance-abusing absentee parents of Bailey's story when they roll into late middle age? What do they have to look forward to, beyond more of the damaging lifestyle their bodies can no longer sustain? They don't even have the meager spiritual nourishment of waging a successful struggle to stay alive. When benevolent social programs ensure that survival is no struggle at all, there is nothing left to accomplish, and oblivion is easy to accept.\\n\\nWe were mad to think we could fix poverty with public money.

It states that marriage is a civil institution, originating in a civil contract whereby a man and a woman mutually agree to become husband and wife and to discharge toward each other the duties imposed by law.\\n\\nFederal district judge Juan Perez-Gimenez based his ruling on the contention that the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to Puerto Rico, which allowed him to uphold the commonwealth's ban on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nIn his ten-page opinion, Perez-Gimenez said that the Supreme Court's decision last June in Obergefell v. Hodges was based on that amendment alone, and a series of century-old Supreme Court rulings put the island outside of that provision.\\n\\nOne might be tempted to assume that the constant reference made to the 'States' in Obergefell includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Perez-Gimenez wrote in his decision. Yet, it is not the role of this court to venture into such an interpretation.\\n\\nIn his decision, Perez-Gimenez cites Murphy v. Ramsey, an 1885 Supreme Court Ruling against polygamy, which examined the case of Utah, which at the time enjoyed pre-state status not unlike that of Puerto Rico today.\\n\\nThe SCOTUS decision reads:\\n\\nFor, certainly, no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth, fit to take rank as one of the co-ordinate states of the Union, than that which seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement.\\n\\nObergefell v. Hodges, which wiped out all existing state laws regarding the identity of marriage as consisting in the union of one man and one woman, was perhaps the most contested Supreme Court decision in U.S. history and one of the most egregious cases of radical judicial activism.\\n\\nIn an unprecedented show of disapproval, all four dissenting U.S. Supreme Court justices rendered independent dissenting opinions for the case, employing some of the fiercest rhetoric imaginable to register their disgust with the sloppy jurisprudence underlying the majority ruling.\\n\\nIn his 27-page dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts lamented the Court's usurpation of democratic process by legislating its own view of marriage. Under the Constitution, he noted, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. The majority decision, he declared, is indefensible as a matter of constitutional law.\\n\\nThe majority's decision is an act of will, not legal judgment, Roberts stated. The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this Court's precedent.\\n\\nSimilarly, Justice Samuel Alito argued that the majority decision usurps the constitutional right of the people to decide whether to keep or alter the traditional understanding of marriage.\\n\\nIn a prophetic gaze forward, Alito observed that the ruling will be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.\\n\\nToday's decision shows that decades of attempts to restrain this Court's abuse of its authority have failed, Alito concluded.\\n\\nPuerto Rico's legal resistance to the Obergefell ruling underscores the fact that just because five unelected justices can impose their will on the American people, it doesn't mean the issue will go away.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "WASHINGTON – Today, Fadia Najib Thabet lives in Vermont, where she is attending an American university. But for many years before leaving her country, she helped boys who got caught up in the violence through recruitment, kidnapping and even some at the urging of their parents.\\n\\nThabet left her native Yemen in the wake of armed conflict between the government, Houthis rebels, and terrorist groups– including the local affiliate of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), or Ansar al Sharia.\\n\\nFor many years, Thabet worked with the United Nations and other non-government international agencies to help boys as young as nine years old regain their lives and rejoin their family and larger community. She also helped young girls who married terrorists in a country with high poverty and no laws banning child marriage.\\n\\nWhen we are approaching any case, we are not just only collecting evidence, we are trying to approach those cases as a human being, Thabet told Breitbart News during her visit to Washington, D.C. last week to be honored at the International Women of Courage event at the State Department. We are not considering them as cases, we're considering them as kids.\\n\\nSo it's a long relationship that we are trying to build, Fadia said.\\n\\nThe relationship is built by offering the children and their families counseling, financial aid and in some cases prosthetics for boys who lost limbs or suffered other disabling injuries on the battlefield.\\n\\nMost communities welcome back their boys, Thabet said.\\n\\nBecause they are children, it is really emotional and moving, Thabet said. So they will forgive very quickly.\\n\\nThey know they've been brainwashed, said Thabet, adding that terrorists easily attract children with promises of money, weapons, and status.\\n\\nShe said that the Yemeni government had agreed to a U.N. Plan of Action to make 18 the legal age for military service, but the latest outbreak of war that began in 2015 has put off its implementation.\\n\\nWe had our allies in the government and we also had our enemies, Fadia said. Nothing now functions because of the war.\\n\\nAccording to Human Rights Watch's World Report 2017, children have been devastated by the armed conflict in Yemen:\\n\\nThe UN secretary-general included the Houthis, government forces, pro-government militias, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and, for the first time, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition on his annual 'list of shame' for grave violations against children during armed conflict. The coalition was responsible for 60 percent of the 785 children killed and 1,168 children wounded, and nearly half of the 101 attacks on schools and hospitals, according to the report. Houthi forces, government and pro-government forces, and other armed groups have used child soldiers, an estimated one-third of the fighters in Yemen. The UN found in 2015 that 72 percent of 762 verified cases of child recruitment were attributable to the Houthis, with an overall five-fold increase in recruitment of children and a shift towards forced or involuntary recruitment. Under Yemeni law, 18 is the minimum age for military service. In 2014, the government signed a UN action plan to end the use of child soldiers. Without an effective government in place, the action plan has not been implemented.\\n\\nThe Middle East Eye reported on Friday that al-Qaeda's presence is growing in Yemen, including in the city of Taiz, but the makeup of those involved in the conflict is complicated.\\n\\nTen groups are fighting under the banner of the Popular Resistance in Yemen, including the Salafis, Muhamashin, and al-Qaeda, all united against the Houthis rebels.\\n\\nTaiz is not a stronghold of al-Qaeda and we did not hear any mention of al-Qaeda in Taiz before the war, a source told the MEE. But there are some members of al-Qaeda who have come to Taiz from the southern provinces during the last two years.\\n\\nNow they have spread to the east of the city, the source said."}
{"original": "President Trump is facing a lawsuit over a portion of the $2 trillion CARES Act, which extends cash relief to U.S. citizens but prevents those without a valid Social Security number, including illegal immigrants — as well as individuals filing with a non-citizen spouse — from receiving the cash benefit.\\n\\nHaving a valid Social Security number is among the few requirements to receive the $1,200 relief outlined in the CARES Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed at the end of March. Those with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN), which includes foreign nationals and those residing in the country illegally, are not eligible for the cash relief. Married couples are also not eligible if one of the spouses does not have a Social Security number — a point that sparked the lawsuit.\\n\\nThe plaintiff in the suit is a U.S. citizen and Illinois resident identified as John Doe, who was not eligible for a relief check because he files with his immigrant spouse, who has an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. He contends that this rule, preventing him and his family from receiving relief, is discriminating against U.S. citizens based solely on whom he chose to marry.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are also listed as defendants in the suit and are accused of failing to treat him as equal to his fellow United States citizens based solely on whom he chose to marry.\\n\\nHe has lawfully filed taxes in the United States, yet he is being denied the rights and privileges under the CARES Act, the suit alleges.\\n\\nCBS News reports:\\n\\nThe suit also states that his children are excluded because one parent is an immigrant. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, families with children under the age of 17 are entitled to stimulus funds of $500 per child.\\n\\nIt's our humble opinion that U.S. citizens are U.S. citizens, said Lana B. Nassar, an attorney at Blaise & Nitschke, PC, who is representing John Doe. He and others in his situation aren't asking for preferential treatment — they want to be treated like U.S. citizens.\\n\\nTime and time again the court has found there is a fundamental right to marriage, Nassar continued.\\n\\nIf you are discriminating on the basis of marriage, the government has to show there is a compelling government interest that justifies this exclusion. It's a very high burden to meet, she added.\\n\\nAccording to Nassar, John Doe has two children under 17, meaning he is missing out on an additional $1,000.\\n\\nThat's money he could use to feed his kids and pay his bills, Vivian Khalaf, another attorney representing John Doe, said. The person suffering here is the U.S. citizen — not the person who doesn't have the Social Security number.\\n\\nAs CBS reported, there are two exceptions to the rule:\\n\\nFirst, if either spouse is a member of the Armed Forces at any time during the tax year, only one of them is required to have a valid Social Security number, the IRS says. Second, taxpayers who are citizens and file separately from their immigrant spouses who lack a Social Security number will receive half of the payment for married couples, or $1,200, according to the IRS. That second exception could give some couples a chance to file their taxes separately, given that the 2019 filing deadline has been pushed back to July 15. However, many taxpayers have already filed their returns for 2019.\\n\\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attempted to address the issue this month, proposing legislation, the Recovery Rebates Improvement Act, that would extend the cash relief payments to mixed status families.\\n\\nReps. Lou Correa (D-CA), Judy Chu (D-CA), and Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) also introduced a measure, the Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act, to amend the CARES Act, extending the cash benefits to those without Social Security numbers.\\n\\nThe Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act amends the CARES Act to ensure that all taxpayers are eligible for their $1,200 relief check, the release stated.\\n\\nEvery individual taxpayer irrespective of citizenship status should receive government assistance, the release added."}

{"original": "After Monday's big victory for the Little Sisters of the Poor against Obamacare, Pope Francis has made a robust case for religious freedom, arguing that it is absolutely essential for a modern secular state.\\n\\nIn a long interview with the French Catholic daily La Croix, Francis contended forcefully that a pluralistic, secular state is a good thing, as long as it firmly defends freedom of conscience and religion.\\n\\nA state should be secular, Francis declared, because confessional states end up badly and are a-historical.\\n\\nI think that secularity accompanied by a solid legislation guaranteeing religious freedom offers a model for moving forward, he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Pope's reasoning, religious freedom and a healthy pluralism go hand in hand with the Christian belief in the fundamental equality and dignity of all human persons.\\n\\nAs children of God, we are all equal with our dignity as persons, Francis said. But each one should have the freedom to express his faith. If a Muslim woman wants to wear a veil, she should be able to. In the same way, if a Catholic wants to wear a cross. Everyone should be able to profess his faith–not outside the culture, but at the very heart of the culture.\\n\\nEven in the case of legislation allowing such things as euthanasia or same-sex marriage, Francis said, people of faith should be able to opt out, without suffering negative repercussions.\\n\\nAsked about these specific cases, Francis argued that they should come as a result of the democratic process. Once a law has been voted in by the people, he said, the State should still respect the consciences of citizens. In every juridical structure, he maintained, conscientious objection should be present, since it is a human right.\\n\\nIn case there should be any doubt, he added that this is also true for a government official, who is a human person as well.\\n\\nSumming up, the Pope declared that such a state would be living a true secularity. It's not right to disparage or discount the opinions of religious people in society, he said, just because they are grounded in Christian thought.\\n\\nIn this regard, the Pope addressed the situation of France, noting that the one criticism he would offer is that the country tends to exaggerate its secularism [laïcité].\\n\\nThis comes from a way of considering religions as a sub-culture rather than an integral part of culture.

{"original": "House Democrats have passed the radical Equality Act once again, claiming it will merely amend federal civil rights law to ensure sexual orientation and gender identity are protected classes, even though the Constitution already provides protection for the rights of all American citizens, regardless of their identity group.\\n\\nIf enacted, however, the Equality Act would have a major impact on children and their parents, potentially upending the culture as American families now know it. Lawsuits filed against Americans who adhere to the science of biological sex and the First Amendment rights of citizens would now have a federal law backing them up that states gender identity supersedes biological sex.\\n\\nThe Equality Act is legislative malpractice that turns equality on its head. It isn't drafted as a shield to protect vulnerable minorities from unjust discrimination, but as a sword to persecute those who do not embrace new sexual and gender ideologies. https://t.co/YSWJpB6R7m — Ryan T. Anderson (@RyanTAnd) February 19, 2021\\n\\nBelow are seven radical demands in the Equality Act:\\n\\nThe bill would end the federal legal recognition of complementary male and female sex in favor gender identity.\\n\\nThe Act states discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity can take many forms:\\n\\nDiscrimination based on sexual orientation includes discrimination based on an individual's actual or perceived romantic, emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to other persons, or lack thereof, on the basis of gender. LGBTQ people, including gender nonbinary people, also commonly experience discrimination because of sex-based stereotypes. Many people are subjected to discrimination because of others' perceptions or beliefs regarding their sexual orientation. Even if these perceptions are incorrect, the identity imputed by others forms the basis of discrimination.\\n\\nMary Rice Hasson, fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) explains:\\n\\nThe concept of gender identity is a steamroller obliterating the significance of male and female in our language, relationships, laws and spaces. Under the Equality Act, gender identity determines access to public accommodations, a category the act redefines to include just about everywhere.\\n\\nHasson observes as well the Equality Act appears purposefully vague.\\n\\nIt makes no mention of what sex actually is, she writes, the unchangeable reality that a person is either 'male' or 'female.'\\n\\nThe science of the biology of sex that people have been taught for centuries would no longer hold a place in federal law with the enactment of this legislation.\\n\\nFeminist groups, such as the Women's Liberation Front (WoLF) also voiced their concerns about the bill:\\n\\nWhile the Equality Act is being sold on promising good things for women, and on ending unfair treatment of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people—which almost everyone agrees are worthy and important goals—it's poisoned with the destruction of the law's ability to allow any accommodations for women on the basis of sex.\\n\\nWoLF noted as well many Americans may be unaware the Equality Act's gender identity rules would pose a danger to women and children:\\n\\nThe bill's authors made clear that gender identity is to take precedence over and replace sex as a protected category. The bill doesn't mention individuals with clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria, or undertaking surgical or hormonal transition, thus making clear that self-declared gender identity would be sufficient to claim protected legal status.\\n\\nThe bill would eliminate the traditional right to privacy of women and girls in public facilities, in favor, instead, of gender identity.\\n\\nThe text of the Equality Act reads:\\n\\nAn individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.\\n\\nThat language indicates the privacy of women and girls in public facilities, such as school bathrooms and locker rooms, would no longer be honored.\\n\\nIn the case of school-age children, boys who identify as, or claim to be, girls, could share their bathrooms and shower rooms at school. Parents who objected would be viewed as discriminating against children identifying as another gender.\\n\\nThe Equality Act would eviscerate women's and girls' sports.\\n\\nMen and boys who identify as female could compete on women's and girls' athletic teams, easily snatching away choice championship awards and scholarships.\\n\\nFor example, Selina Soule, a female runner from Connecticut, lost to males who claimed to identify as female in championship competitions. In addition to losing those races, she also lost out on scholarships for which she likely would have qualified had biological males not been permitted to compete against females.\\n\\nStudies have shown that male athletes who claim to be female still hold an intolerable advantage over females even though they have undergone cross-sex hormone treatments.\\n\\nThe Equality Act would be used to mandate school curricula that affirm and promote sexual orientation and gender identity views.\\n\\nInside the classroom, the bill could allow for the normalization of gender ideology and abortion in school curricula.\\n\\nMelanie Israel of the Heritage Foundation explained at the Daily Signal that, under the Act, parental rights could take a far back seat to mandated school programs:\\n\\nThe Equality Act could lead to changes in school curricula, such as texts that affirm and promote controversial sexual orientation and gender identity viewpoints. The Equality Act could also be used to override states that have prohibited sexual orientation and gender identity curricula. Where states have conversely mandated sexual orientation and gender identity curricula, parents and schools do not have access to opt-out options.\\n\\nIsrael observed as well that Planned Parenthood, a giant of both the lucrative abortion and transgender medical industries, would likely have greater access to young people in sex education programs under a federal Equality Act.\\n\\nShe elaborated on the possibilities:\\n\\nIf the Equality Act were to become federal law and public school curricula become further entwined with sexual orientation and gender identity ideology, Planned Parenthood is well-positioned to further its presence in public schools and take advantage of an additional avenue to promote both sexual orientation and gender identity ideology as well as the organization's hormone treatment services. In other words, additional sexual orientation and gender identity curricula could become yet another marketing tool for America's abortion giant.\\n\\nThe Equality Act would be used to remove custody rights from parents who refuse to have their minor children undergo transgender medical interventions and procedures.\\n\\nThe medical and psychological professions have become further politicized as transgender activists have infiltrated professional societies and associations.\\n\\nMonica Burke explained at the Heritage Foundation such politicization is creating increased conflict in relationships among parents, medical professionals, and government.\\n\\nA federal sexual orientation and gender identity law would jeopardize parental rights nationwide, Burke warned.\\n\\nRep. Vicki Hartzler (R-MO) recalled during a presentation at the Heritage Foundation the story of parents in Ohio who lost custody of their daughter several years ago because they opposed her desire to transition to male. A judge allowed the girl's grandparents to take custody of her because they supported her medical transition.\\n\\nIt is just heart rending to think that parents were not able to determine the health care, what they thought was best for their daughter, and the judge actually stepped in and took away their custody, Hartzler said.\\n\\nA federal sexual orientation and gender identity law would make these cases more common, Burke said.\\n\\nSince the Equality Act exempts itself from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, religious schools, hospitals, and adoption agencies could face federal sanctions for upholding their teachings with regard to life, sexuality, and marriage under the legislation.\\n\\nThe legislation states:\\n\\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title. The Equality Act also states actions based on the belief in traditional marriage between a man and woman is discrimination against a married same-sex couple and relegates such faith beliefs to the status of a sex stereotype that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples. This language suggests faith-based adoption agencies that restrict adoptions to homes with a father and mother could be considered as discriminating against same-sex couples. A lawsuit alleging such discrimination would then have the weight of federal law behind it. Catholic League President Bill Donohue warned the Equality Act would promote the most comprehensive assault on Christianity ever written into law. Similarly, the U.S. Catholic Bishops' Conference asserted the legislation would discriminate against people of faith and punish faith-based organizations, such as charities and schools who serve everyone in their communities, simply because of their beliefs.\\n\\nThe Equality Act's text that names a form of discrimination on the basis of pregnancy would be used to punish healthcare providers who refuse to perform an abortion or to outlaw policies that ban funding for the procedure.\\n\\nThe bill states:\\n\\nDiscrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.\\n\\nIsrael explained the legislation would force the term sex in the Civil Rights Act to mean pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and the last of these — related medical conditions — has already been interpreted to include abortion by both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\\n\\nThus, discrimination on the basis of sex could include refusing to perform an abortion or provide funding for the procedure.\\n\\nRyan Anderson, president of EPPC, called the Equality Act legislative malpractice that turns equality on its head.\\n\\nIt isn't drafted as a shield to protect vulnerable minorities from unjust discrimination, but as a sword to persecute those who do not embrace new sexual and gender ideologies, he asserted.\\n\\nRead more about the radical Equality Act here, here, here, and here."}

After she rejected his advances, he planned a revenge attack.\\n\\nHer father, Yaqoob Masih, claimed in his First Information Report filed with Sialkot's Civil Lines Police that Rizwan had ambushed Asma by knocking on the door.\\n\\nOn April 17, my son Maqsood and I went to Zaman's house around to meet Asma and to inquire after the health of Zaman's mother, Mashi said.

Seeing young Asma in such pain is heart-wrenching for all of us in the West, but the authorities of Pakistan just seem to accept this as the culture of Pakistan.

Oh yeah, look, it's like this: if you're gonna complain about Christian bakeries being prosecuted for refusing to bake gay cakes because of they violate their religious principles, you're just being hypocritical complaining when YouTube puts restrictions on PragerU videos because they violate their liberal principles. Either you believe in free markets or you don't.\\n\\nIf you're a) you're with Victor Davis Hanson who outlines his case here.\\n\\nIf you're b) you're with Kevin Williamson, who has now unfathomably accepted the King's Shilling to take on the job of house libertarian at that famous bastion of free speech, liberty and alternative viewpoints The Atlantic.\\n\\nI'm with Victor Davis Hanson. And like Hanson, I resent deeply Williamson's sly implication that if you believe in state regulation for the internet you're really no better than all the worst progressive big government control freaks.\\n\\nThis argument is playing into the hands of the enemy, for there is nothing that makes liberals bigger in their underpants than using free market philosophy as a stick with which to beat their right-wing enemies.\\n\\nBut as that first great champion of free markets Adam Smith recognized in his Wealth of Nations – published 1776, so this knowledge has been out there for as long as the U.S. has existed – for capitalism to function properly there must be a degree of regulation: not because government intervention is necessarily ideal but because without it the market cannot function effectively.\\n\\nSmith was thinking specifically of monopolies and cartels which he considered a conspiracy against the public.\\n\\nIt seems to me a perfectly tenable position to believe that Christian bakeries should be free not to bake – say – gay marriage cakes because they do not hold a monopoly market position.

In terms of online expression, these outlets are the de facto Internet. Restricting people's access to these platforms based on their political beliefs is a human rights issue. Just as the phone company should not be able to disconnect you because of the content of your conversations, people should not be banned for their ideology, except in extreme circumstances when laws are being broken. We need to rally lawmakers to make holding big tech accountable one of their top priorities. We need to demand Google, Facebook and Twitter adhere to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which dictates they remain non-partisan, or face losing their legal immunity for user content. We need transparency, we need an amnesty on all those who have been unfairly banned by big tech. This is one of the defining issues of our generation and we cannot afford to lose this battle.\\n\\nIf we didn't haven't President Trump in the White House, we would have lost it already."}
{"original": "CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly, the R&B star who has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves, is due in court Saturday after being charged with aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims, including at least three between the ages of 13 and 17.\\n\\nIn a brief appearance before reporters, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx on Friday announced the 10 counts against the 52-year-old Grammy winner, whose real name is Robert Kelly. She said the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade. She did not comment on the charges or take questions.\\n\\nKelly was driven to a Chicago police station in a dark colored van with heavily tinted rear windows around 8:15 p.m. Friday. He did not respond to questions from gathered reporters as he walked inside the building.\\n\\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted a short time later that Kelly was under arrest. He was expected to be held overnight before an appearance Saturday in bond court.\\n\\nKelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, told reporters following the singer's arrest that one of the charges he faces appears to be tied to a decade-old child pornography case.\\n\\nDouble jeopardy should bar that case, Greenberg said. He won that case.\\n\\nKelly, who was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008, has consistently denied any sexual misconduct.\\n\\nGreenberg said he thinks prosecutors rushed to judgment Friday in charging Kelly, calling the singer an innocent man.\\n\\nMr. Kelly is strong, Greenberg added. He's got a lot of support and he's going to be vindicated on all these charges.\\n\\nThe arrest sets the stage for another #MeToo-era celebrity trial. Bill Cosby went to prison last year, and former Hollywood studio boss Harvey Weinstein is awaiting trial.\\n\\nBest known for hits such as I Believe I Can Fly, Kelly was charged a week after Michael Avenatti, the attorney whose clients have included porn star Stormy Daniels, said he gave prosecutors new video evidence of the singer with an underage girl.\\n\\nAt a news conference earlier Friday in Chicago, Avenatti said a 14-year-old girl seen with R. Kelly on the video is among four victims mentioned in the indictment. He said the footage shows two separate scenes on two separate days at Kelly's residence in the late 1990s.\\n\\nDuring the video, both the victim and Kelly refer to her age 10 times, he said.\\n\\nAvenatti said he represents six clients, including two victims, two parents and two people he describes as knowing R. Kelly and being within his inner circle for the better part of 25 years.\\n\\nI don't know what the tape is, Greenberg said of the video Avenatti gave prosecutors. We haven't seen it. No one's showed us the tape.\\n\\nThe new charges marked a watershed moment, Avenatti said, adding that he believes more than 10 other people associated with Kelly should be charged as enablers for helping with the assaults, transporting minors and covering up evidence.\\n\\nThe video surfaced during a 10-month investigation by Avenatti's office. He told the AP that the person who provided the VHS tape knew both Kelly and the female in the video.\\n\\nThe jury in 2008 acquitted Kelly of child pornography charges that arose from a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13. He and the young woman allegedly seen with him denied they were in the 27-minute video, even though the picture quality was good and witnesses testified it was them, and she did not take the stand. Kelly could have gotten 15 years in prison.\\n\\nCharging Kelly now for actions that occurred in the same time frame as the allegations from the 2008 trial suggests the accusers are cooperating this time and willing to testify.\\n\\nBecause the alleged victim 10 years ago denied that she was on the video and did not testify, the state's attorney office had little recourse except to charge the lesser offense under Illinois law, child pornography, which required a lower standard of evidence.\\n\\nEach count of the new charges carries up to seven years in prison. If Kelly is convicted on all 10 counts, a judge could decide that the sentences run one after the other — making it possible for him to receive up to 70 years behind bars. Probation is also an option under the statute.\\n\\nGreenberg said he offered to sit down with prosecutors before charges were filed to discuss why the allegations were baseless. But they refused, he said.\\n\\nUnfortunately, they have succumbed to the court of public opinion, who've convicted him, he said.\\n\\nLegally and professionally, the walls began closing in on Kelly after the release of a BBC documentary about him last year and the multipart Lifetime documentary Surviving R. Kelly, which aired last month. Together they detailed allegations he was holding women against their will and running a sex cult.\\n\\n#MeToo activists and a social media movement using the hashtag #MuteRKelly called on streaming services to drop Kelly's music and promoters not to book any more concerts. Protesters demonstrated outside Kelly's Chicago studio.\\n\\nAs recently as Thursday, two women held a news conference in New York to describe how Kelly picked them out of a crowd at a Baltimore after-party in the mid-1990s when they were underage. They said Kelly had sex with one of the teens when she was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol and could not consent.\\n\\nLatresa Scaff and Rochelle Washington were joined by lawyer Gloria Allred when they told their story publicly for the first time.\\n\\nIn the indictment, the prosecution addressed the question of the statute of limitations, saying that even abuse that happened more than two decades ago falls within the charging window allowed under Illinois law. Victims typically have 20 years to report abuse, beginning when they turn 18.\\n\\nThe singer and songwriter, whose legal name is Robert Kelly, rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side and has retained a sizable following. He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. His collaborators have included Jay-Z and Usher.\\n\\nKelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, 12 Play, which produced such popular sex-themed songs as Bump N' Grind and Your Body's Callin'.\\n\\nMonths after those successes, the then-27-year-old Kelly faced allegations he married 15-year-old Aaliyah, the R&B star who later died in a plane crash in the Bahamas. Kelly was the lead songwriter and producer of Aaliyah's 1994 debut album.\\n\\nKelly and Aaliyah never confirmed the marriage, though Vibe magazine published a copy of the purported marriage license. Court documents later obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times showed Aaliyah admitted lying about her age on the license.\\n\\nJim DeRogatis, a longtime music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, played a key role in drawing the attention of law enforcement to Kelly. In 2002, he received the sex tape in the mail that was central to Kelly's 2008 trial. He turned it over to prosecutors. In 2017, DeRogatis wrote a story for BuzzFeed about the allegations Kelly was holding women against their will in Georgia."}

Glazov's account was suspended for violating Twitter's rules relating to hateful conduct.\\n\\nThe tweets that resulted in Glazov's temporary suspension related to Sahih Bukhari's texts discussing Mohammed's marriage to Aisha when she was six years old and a quote posted by Glazov from the Quranic Suras that mandates the Hijab for women and sanctions sexual slavery. These direct quotes from Islamic religious texts were apparently enough to result in Glazov's account being locked until he deleted the offending tweets.\\n\\nThe offending tweets can be seen below:\\n\\nGlazov commented on his suspension to Breitbart News saying:\\n\\nTwitter has bowed to Islamic blasphemy laws and is now going after truth-tellers about Jihad and Sharia oppression. That is why Tommy Robinson and Shazia Hobbs are banned permanently from Twitter, it why Twitter suspends the accounts of people like ex-FBI agent John Guandolo and illustrator Bosch Fawstin. These are people who are simply trying to defend freedom as well as to protect Muslim and non-Muslim people from Jihad and Sharia. I have been suspended in this case because they are saying I violated their rules against hateful conduct. I have engaged in no hateful conduct whatsoever. I am a human rights activist fighting on behalf of Muslim women and girls who suffer under Sharia oppression. All that my two tweets in question did is refer to the verses in the Hadith and Qur'an that record Mohammed's marriage to Aisha when she was 6 years old and that sanction sex slavery. This is not me saying it. I am simply referring to Islamic texts that say it. For them to allege that Islamic texts are hateful is a grave insult to Muslims across the world. But this is the key: If a Muslim had referred to these same texts in support of child marriage and sex slavery, he would not be suspended. It is referring to these texts if you are against child marriage and sex slavery that constitutes the problem on Twitter. It is a sad day for free speech and for the effort to protect Muslim women and girls from oppression. It is hateful conduct to turn our backs on suffering people and on the causes of their suffering.\\n\\nJust last month, Glazov was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of abuse he received on the platform. In an article on his website, Glazov posted screenshots of an exchange he had with another Facebook user named Muhammad Irfan Ayoub. Glazov claims that Ayoub began rebuking him for daring to bring attention to the persecution of women and girls under Sharia and telling Jamie to convert to Islam.\\n\\nIn one exchange, Ayoub reportedly told Glazov that Allah will defeat you, Glazov replied; Allah will defeat us? I thought Islam was a religion of peace? Ayoub replied; Peace for those who obey Allah and His Prophet. but those who oppose them their [there] is no peace for them. A screenshot of the exchange can be seen below.\\n\\nIn another exchange, Ayoub said to Glazov; I will break your mouth,\\n\\nThe posting of these exchanges resulted in a seven-day ban of Glazov's account by Facebook.\\n\\nListen to Glazov discuss the Twitter ban on the Wednesday edition of Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM Patriot:"}

{"original": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — President-elect Mauricio Macri's promises to revitalize Argentina's sagging economy with free-market reforms and improve strained relations with the United States resonated with voters, carrying him to a historic win that ended 12 years of often-conflictive rule by President Cristina Fernandez and her late husband.\\n\\nBut when the business-friendly opposition candidate takes office Dec. 10, he will inherit a country with around 30 percent inflation, near-zero economic growth and entrenched government social spending that private economists warn is not sustainable. He also lacks majorities in either chamber of Congress to pass his deep reforms.\\n\\nMacri will begin his mandate in a difficult political position, wrote Daniel Kerner from the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. He will have to make difficult economic adjustments and face serious political constraints.\\n\\nWith 98 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's election, Macri had 51.5 percent support compared to 48.5 percent for ruling party candidate Daniel Scioli, Fernandez's hand-chosen successor. Scioli conceded defeat and Macri claimed victory.\\n\\nToday is a historic day, Macri crowed while his supporters celebrated. It's the changing of an era.\\n\\nThe era he hopes to end is that of Fernandez and her late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner who rewrote Argentina's social contract and dominated the nation's political scene with a mix of patronage, charisma and withering attacks on opponents. Fernandez battled international creditors, had strained relations with Washington and allied her country with late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro.\\n\\nDuring the election campaign, Macri vowed he would listen more and talk less than Fernandez.\\n\\nAddressing thousands of supporters late Sunday, Macri said his presidency would not be about revenge or settling scores, but rather helping the country progress.\\n\\nI feel so happy because today we put an end to the mafia of ruling party rule, said Felisa Sanchez, a Macri supporter waving an Argentine flag. They claimed to be Robin Hood helping the poor with social welfare plans when the poor are really helped with jobs and education.\\n\\nBut fulfilling his campaign promises may prove difficult.\\n\\nMacri, 56, has pledged to lift unpopular controls on the purchase of U.S. dollars and thus eliminate a booming black market for currency exchange. Doing that would likely lead to a sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso. With foreign reserves around $26 billion, low for such a large economy, the government would desperately need an immediate infusion of dollars.\\n\\nThat could come from many different places, but ultimately would require structural changes to a largely protectionist economy, solving a debt spat and developing warmer relations with the United States and other nations.\\n\\nAnd Macri's background will feed Argentina's political polarization after more than a decade of left-leaning government.\\n\\nHe hails from one of the country's richest families and rose to prominence as president of the popular Boca Juniors soccer club. On the campaign trail, he sometimes talked about being kidnapped in the early 1990s, an experience he said helped him understand the needs of others and he credits with pushing him into politics.\\n\\nLater, as major of Buenos Aires, he was known for a technocratic manner that stressed efficiency over style.\\n\\nHe campaigned for president on promises to jumpstart the economy by lifting many tariffs, lowering taxes and attracting foreign investment. He promised to solve a long-standing New York court fight with creditors in the U.S. who Fernandez called vultures and has refused to negotiate with, which kept Argentina on the margins of international credit markets.\\n\\nScioli, the former governor of Buenos Aires province, had been expected to win by 10 or more points in last month's six-candidate, first round of voting. His failure to do so set up Sunday's runoff vote with Macri.\\n\\nScioli tried to regain momentum by frequently attacking Macri. He said a Macri win would subject this nation of 41 million people to the market-driven policies of the 1990s, a period of deregulation that many Argentines believe set the stage for the financial meltdown of 2001-2002.\\n\\nThis is a painful day for Argentines, said Rocio Robador, a government supporter who was crying in the iconic Plaza de Mayo. Robador, 36, said she was able to get pregnant and have a child thanks to a government that helps poor women get fertility treatments.\\n\\nMacri's win signals a clear end to the era of Fernandez and her late husband. The power couple who gained popularity by spending heavily on programs for the poor, raising tariffs to protect local economies and passing several progressive laws, including the legalization of gay marriage in 2010.\\n\\nMacri frequently repelled Scioli's attempts to paint him as a 1990s neoliberal, saying he would lead with 21st century development as opposed to 21st century socialism.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Macri increasingly talked about international relations, signaling some of his foreign policy priorities.\\n\\nHe said he would push to expel Venezuela from the South American trade bloc known as Mercosur because of the jailing of opposition leaders under Maduro.

{"original": "NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Former Attorney General Kathleen Kane was sentenced Monday to 10 to 23 months in jail for illegally disclosing details from a grand jury investigation to embarrass a rival and lying about it under oath.\\n\\nKane was also sentenced to eight years of probation by a Montgomery County judge who said Kane's ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law.\\n\\nJudge Wendy Demchick-Alloy said Kane assumed an off with your heads mentality as she ran the state's top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political neophyte who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office.\\n\\nThis case is about ego – the ego of a politician consumed with her image from Day One, Demchick-Alloy said. This case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant … felt had embarrassed her in the press.\\n\\nKane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was handcuffed in court and led out a side door. She will remain in custody until she posts $75,000 cash bail, higher than she had previously posted.\\n\\nAfter she posts bond, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction.\\n\\nShe had been a stay-at-home mother, and former assistant county prosecutor, before using her husband's trucking fortune to run for statewide office in 2012. She quickly became a rising star in the state Democratic Party before her office devolved into turmoil as career prosecutors came and went.\\n\\nKane and her husband are now estranged and share custody of their teenage boys.\\n\\nYour children are the ultimate … collateral damages. They are casualties of your actions, the judge said. But you did that, not this court. \\n\\nEarlier Monday, Kane's 15-year-old son, Chris, pleaded for leniency while her former deputies described an office demoralized by her leadership and terrorized by Nixonian espionage.\\n\\nKane, 50, had argued that the loss of her career, law license and reputation was punishment enough. She had asked the judge to sentence her to probation or house arrest so she could be home to raise her sons.\\n\\nI really don't care what happens to me, Kane said during before leaning toward the defense table to grab tissues. There is no more torture in the world than to watch your children suffer and know you had something to do with it.\\n\\nThe one-term attorney general said her younger son, 14-year-old Zachary, did not attend Monday's sentencing because he couldn't even bear it.\\n\\nKane's family declined to comment after the sentencing.\\n\\nProsecutors called her crimes egregious and pushed for jail time. They said a paranoid Kane ruined morale in the 800-person office and the wider law enforcement community through a calculated scheme to embarrass rival prosecutors who had left the office.\\n\\nKane didn't testify at her trial. She was convicted in August of two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges, and she resigned the next day.\\n\\nOn Monday, former deputy Clarke Madden said in court that a dark cloud permeated every corner of the attorney general's office and victims, witnesses and other law enforcement agencies feared working with them.\\n\\nThrough a pattern of systemic firings and Nixonian espionage, she created a terror zone in this office, said Erik Olsen, a career prosecutor who is now the chief deputy attorney general.\\n\\nKane enjoyed mostly good press early on as she supported gay marriage, ramped up a child predator unit run by her twin sister and questioned her predecessor's handling of the Penn State sex assault case.\\n\\nBut turmoil inside the office became apparent as top deputies and career prosecutors headed for the doors. Kane's feud with one of them, Frank Fina, who had helped run the Penn State probe and other sensitive investigations, led to the leak.\\n\\nKane, taking aim at him, had a campaign consultant pass confidential files to a reporter about a corruption case Fina had declined to charge before he left the office. She then tried to frame someone else for the leak, aides testified at the perjury and obstruction trial.\\n\\nAside from the conviction, Kane's political career will be remembered for her investigation of pornography that she said was being traded on state computers by judges, lawyers and other public employees. Two state Supreme Court justices resigned amid the fallout."}

In Russia, there are millions of homosexuals, and almost none of them participate in [anti-Putin] demonstrations. Therefore, homosexuals support President Putin's towards LGBT people.

Many gay people in our country say, Putin is our President. Gays are for Putin!\\n\\nAfter submitting their request to local authorities, the group reportedly congregated at a local church service to pray for the success of the good endeavor.\\n\\nPlans for the rally come days after a homophobic campaign video supporting Putin appeared on social media, warning that his opponents will take the country into a nightmare future where people are forced to cohabitate with gays and lesbians.\\n\\nThe video, which has already attracted over three million views on Facebook alone, shows the thoughts of a middle-aged man imagining a Russia without Putin, where a man can be seen in his kitchen and suggestively eating a banana and filing his nails.\\n\\nThe advert is intended as a contrast to Putin's opponent Ksenia Sobchak, who has called for the legalization of same-sex marriage and seeks to move the country in a less socially conservative direction.\\n\\nPresenting LGBT people as a threat in a homophobic country is no joke, she wrote in an Instagram post, while also condemning the video as vile.\\n\\nSobchak has faced widespread claims that she is actually part of a controlled opposition designed to give the impression that the election will be free and fair.\\n\\nOther opposition leaders, such as anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, claim that the election will be rigged in Putin's favor after being barred from running, meaning that he is extremely likely to win another six-year term.\\n\\nSince returning to the presidency in 2012, Putin has backed laws restricting the rights of LGBT people, which include a ban on loosely-defined homosexual propaganda in a bid to uphold Russia's traditional conservative values.\\n\\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com."}
{"original": "The loose confederation of churches affiliated with the worldwide Anglican communion is experiencing growing tensions over the issue of homosexuality, with the U.S. Episcopalian church tugging toward the liberal embrace of all things LGBT and the African churches struggling to maintain a more Biblically based sexual morality.\\n\\nThe Anglican Church of Nigeria has announced it will boycott the next international meeting of Church leaders over the matter, and is now requesting special status in the worldwide church to allow it to faithfully preserve its position on homosexuality.\\n\\nIn a forceful statement, the Nigerian Anglican primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, said that the Anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.\\n\\nTraditional Anglicans like the Nigerian Church, he said, are walking into a well-rehearsed scheme to gradually apply persuasion, subtle blackmail, coercion on any group still standing with the Scriptural Provision as we know it, to join the straight jacket of the revisionists and be politically correct.\\n\\nArchbishop Okoh said his province will shun next month's Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Lusaka, Zambia over the way the worldwide church has handled the wayward Episcopal Church in America, which he described as a toxic relationship.\\n\\nAt a meeting of Anglican Primates in January of this year, it was decided that for a period of three years The Episcopal Church (TEC) should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or policy. The measure was intended as a sanction over TEC's approval of gay marriage and consecration of openly gay bishops.\\n\\nThose sanctions proved to be hollow, Okoh said, and disapproval shifted toward those still embracing traditional beliefs regarding sexuality. Okoh said that during the Canterbury meeting, those who hold the orthodox view of human sexuality and marriage were denounced as 'homophobic,' underscoring that we were in the wrong place, he said.\\n\\nOkoh's impression was that the Anglican authorities thought they were exercising patience in order to gradually persuade the scripture-believers to embrace homosexual doctrine, something he says they will never do.\\n\\nIn his statement, Okoh reminds readers that Nigeria was one of the provinces that protested against the consecration of the gay American bishop Gene Robinson, that boycotted the 2008 Lambeth Conference and helped set up the conservative Global Anglican Future Conference in Jerusalem that same year.\\n\\nAs a result, Okoh has requested special status for the Provinces who will never embrace the sexual culture being promoted by some Provinces of the Church over and against the Bible.\\n\\nHe compared the idea of special status to the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, where total union is impossible, but some degree of cooperation is deemed useful.\\n\\nThe Anglican church claims some 85 million members worldwide and is divided into 38 provinces. Only eight of these are favorable to changing doctrine on marriage to allow for same-sex unions, namely, the U.S., Canada, Scotland, Wales, New Zealand, South India, South Africa and Brazil.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "She goes by the name Sa'a because — even three years after jumping from a moving truck to escape the Boko Haram terrorists that had kidnapped her and 275 other mostly Christian schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria — she fears for her safety and that of the rest of her family.\\n\\nMy message to everyone is that it's been three years now, Sa'a told Breitbart News three years to the day of her abduction.\\n\\nNot three days, or three months, but three years, Sa'a, who now lives in the United States, said at an event at the Newseum's Religious Freedom Center in Washington D.C. to mark the anniversary of the event. Every individual that has power to do something that would bring those girls back should just do something.\\n\\nSince that fateful day, 57 girls, including Sa'a, escaped from the radical Islamic terrorists. Last October, the Nigerian government worked out a deal with Boko Haram to return 21 more of the girls, many of whom has been raped, some returning with children in tow.\\n\\nThat leaves 195 girls who are still missing.\\n\\nIt is fitting that this happened on Good Friday, said Emmanuel Ogebe, a Nigerian human rights attorney based in Washington D.C. who has sponsored 15 young women survivors from Nigeria, including Sa'a, to come and study in the United States.\\n\\nWhen Jesus died the sun hid its face in shame because of what happened, Ogebe said. Now the world should hide its face in shame because it has forgotten the 195 girls that are still missing.\\n\\nOgebe, who has traveled to Nigeria on many occasions to help survivors and to lobby the Nigerian government to do more to secure the release of the remaining victims, said he knows that some of the girls have died. One girl, he said, was stoned to death when she refused to convert to Islam.\\n\\nThis is way beyond just hashtags, Ogebe said of the social media #bringbackourgirls movement that happened after one of the largest mass abductions in modern history.\\n\\nThere are practical things that can be done, Ogebe said, adding that keeping the story in the public consciousness is one of those things.\\n\\nAnd, Ogebe said, Boko Haram continues to abduct Nigerian girls and uses them for the unspeakable practice of suicide bombing.\\n\\nThis week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) confirmed that fact.\\n\\nUNICEF emphasized Wednesday that beyond the high-profile Chibok abductions, the practice of kidnapping children and forcing them to associate with the armed group has been prevalent, the Associated Press reported.\\n\\nYoung girls are spotted in the markets, and nighttime raids drag them from their beds, UNICEF reported. In some cases, parents are killed in front of the girls during the process.\\n\\nThis is typically followed by an extended journey to a Boko Haram base in the forest where the girls are forced into early marriage and sexual slavery, UNICEF reported.\\n\\nOgebe said that the Nigerian government is not transparent about its dealings with Boko Haram or about the girls who were released in October. All remain in the custody of the government and have not been reunited with their families.\\n\\nWe don't think the Nigerian government is doing anything much about rescuing the girls, Seshugh Akume of the Bring Back Our Girls organization, told USA Today on Thursday. We are disappointed.\\n\\nThe general attitude is they wish everybody to keep quiet about it and move on because they get angry whenever the missing Chibok girls are mentioned, Akume said.\\n\\nBut Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari marked the anniversary by calling it one of the worst crimes committed against his country.\\n\\nI wish to reassure the parents of the Chibok girls, all well-meaning Nigerians, organizations and the international community, that as a government, we are unrelenting on the issue of the safe return of our children, said Buhari, who campaigned for office by promising to recover the victims.\\n\\nIf I stop telling my story people will forget my classmates, Sa'a said."}

A supporter of both the LGBT agenda and abortion rights, she joined forces with Planned Parenthood last year for its most lucrative benefit auction, which raised $2.3 million for the abortion business from the sale of works by various artists.\\n\\nAs Artnet reports, Minter earned Planned Parenthood's Woman of Valor award.\\n\\nThis is a really vital time, I think, the artist said during her acceptance speech. I want Planned Parenthood to start coming out of the closet, and I want to take our cues and inspiration from the marriage-equality movement.\\n\\nMinter, who designed Planned Parenthood pins that say, Don't F**K With Me, Don't F**K Without Us, says she chose to photograph Cyrus because she's an activist and she has 40.5 million Instagram followers.\\n\\nShe's been famous since she was 11 and she's a great artist, so she doesn't care about making money—she wants to give back, she continued. She founded the Happy Hippie Foundation, which supports LGBTQ youth. She flies commercial because she's conscious of her carbon footprint. Now she's going to help us with Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nAsked by Artsy about why she chose Planned Parenthood as her charity, Minter replied:\\n\\nThat was 2014, and laws were being passed that were shaving women's right to make their own choices with their bodies. We hadn't had to worry about that kind of thing since Bill Clinton was elected—we thought that war was over. Laurie, Cindy, and I—and so many others—worked so hard for abortion rights in the '70s and '80s, and all of a sudden that work started to unravel. Planned Parenthood has been attacked more in the last 2 years than in the last 20.\\n\\nIn addition to states passing more laws banning abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy, requiring higher levels of safety in abortion clinics, and eliminating taxpayer funding from the abortion group, Planned Parenthood is still reeling from a series of videos exposing its apparent practices of selling the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and altering the positions of babies during abortion in order to be able to harvest the most intact organs.\\n\\nThough Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in October announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. The organization and its leftwing media supporters continue to insist the videos, produced by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), were deceptively edited.\\n\\nHowever, a Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion – hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos — said while their analysts observed the videos had been edited, The analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.\\n\\nAdditionally, Fusion noted, [A]nalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff.\\n\\nAn analysis by Coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were not manipulated and that they are authentic.\\n\\nThe great @mintermarilyn being honored by Planned Parenthood for her important advocacy for the… https://t.co/JP652iYVh5 — Nancy Spector (@nespector) April 15, 2016\\n\\nLooking back on the feminist influences in her life, Minter said she has been an activist since high school, when she was always getting kicked out of class and in the dean's office.\\n\\nThen it was Civil Rights, and later it was the Vietnam War, she recalled. I was there when they shut down the Pentagon; I've been going on protest marches my whole life … And now, this fight against controlling and policing women's bodies feels like a war.\\n\\nMinter, who said she was on cloud nine when Obama was elected president, explained she was incensed when she heard on the radio that some Planned Parenthood clinics were closing down due to their failure to meet the new safety laws some states have passed.\\n\\nBut soon after, people—and public figures—started getting behind Planned Parenthood publicly, she said. Lena Dunham was one of the first, and all the women who contributed to her PSA, and then Miley [Cyrus], and now Marc [Jacobs].

{"original": "The New York Times editorial board says the Trump administration is quietly advancing an anti-science agenda by supporting teen pregnancy prevention programs that encourage young people to refrain from sex to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STD).\\n\\nIn an editorial Sunday, the board condemns the promotion of abstinence among teens by the current Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The reproach is delivered without one word about the scientific fact that the only certain way young teens can avoid having to deal with the unfortunate situations of an unplanned pregnancy or being infected with an STD is to not have sex.\\n\\nThe administration is promoting a 'just say no' approach and is 'poised to shift Title X family planning dollars … toward programs that advocate abstinence outside of marriage, says the editorial board, sure that only horrific outcomes will ensue from encouraging young people to delay sex until they are older, have completed school, and have met someone special.\\n\\nThe administration's approach defies all common sense, the editors write, claiming there is no evidence that teaching young people to make healthy decisions about sex will reduce teen pregnancies or STDs.\\n\\nThe Times continues that comprehensive sex education (CSE) programs of the sort promoted by the Obama administration are the reason why teen pregnancy has declined in the United States in recent years.\\n\\nA senior HHS official, however, recently told Breitbart News that this narrative is not supported by research data from the federal government itself.\\n\\nA 2016 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows nearly 60 percent of high school students today have never had sex, an increase of 28 percent since 1991. This data complements research that also shows a historic drop in teen pregnancy rates since 1991.\\n\\nYet, despite this scientific data that was produced during his own tenure, in his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2017, former President Barack Obama eliminated funding in his administration's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) for sex education programs that focus on reinforcing the healthy decision to delay sex made by many adolescents. His administration proposed only funding CSE programs, which assume all middle school children need to know where to get the morning-after pill and how to use a condom.\\n\\nThe previous administration tried an approach that just didn't work, the HHS official said. And our commitment requires that we change that approach.\\n\\nAn HHS document points to 37 evaluations of TPP programs performed for grant applications to fund the programs.\\n\\nOverall, of the 37 funded and evaluated projects, 73% either had no impact or had a negative impact on teen behavior, with some teens more likely to begin having sex, to engage in unprotected sex, or to become pregnant, HHS explained. Very few positive results were sustained over time.\\n\\nAdditionally, as CDC has also observed, while teen sex and pregnancy rates are at record lows, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are at record highs. HHS said sex education, therefore, should be centered on science in the promotion of optimal health outcomes.\\n\\nIf we know that more teens are waiting to have sex today than 25 years ago, then shouldn't we be reinforcing those healthy decisions and building upon that? HHS asked. Similarly, we know that teen pregnancy rates have decreased and yet sexually transmitted diseases and infection have increased to record levels. There's something going on there, and we need to learn what it is and to make sure we make some amendments to the messages we're communicating, because we can't be satisfied with those numbers.\\n\\nThe Times editors, however, are more concerned about keeping up appearances at places like the U.N., where, they gasp, Trump administration officials have been heard referring to the United States as a pro-life nation.\\n\\nThe editorial board further condemns what it calls Trump officials engaging in savvy rebranding of teen sex ed programs by using innocuous sounding terms like 'sexual risk avoidance' and 'healthy relationships.' The editors do not apparently take offense, however, at the abortion industry's attempt to smooth over the elective ending of an unborn child's life by defining the procedure as women's health care.\\n\\nMany parents throughout the United States say they have had enough, in fact, of the pornographic and gender-bending sex education curricula taught by organizations like Planned Parenthood – which profits from abortion and also boasts that it educates students about how to have LGBT-inclusive sex:\\n\\nWe are disgusted that our taxpayer money is going to teach children how to question their gender, perform anal and oral sex, and masturbate, said Elizabeth Johnston, the Activist Mommy, who led an international Sex Ed Sit Out in April.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood's ideas about sex education have been exposed on other occasions.\\n\\nPro-life organization Live Action produced a video in 2014 that highlighted the abortion vendor's normalization of Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, Masochism (BDSM) for young people.\\n\\nMore recently, Planned Parenthood itself released a video titled How to Tell Someone You Have an STD, in which the group minimizes the significance of sexually transmitted disease.\\n\\nSo, you've got an STD, the video's narrator nods casually. Guess what? So do lots of other people. Half of all people will get an STD at some point in their life. Seriously. Not kidding – half. It's OK.\\n\\nFor the New York Times editors, however, teaching young people to delay sex until they are older and might have better judgment about relationships is anti-science and more.\\n\\nSuch education keeps all people who are subjected to it in the dark about critical aspects of their health, and treats a normal part of life — sexuality, and women's sexuality in particular — as aberrant and shameful, they say.\\n\\nScience, however, is not pro-sex or pro-abortion. And encouraging young teens to respect themselves and their bodies – and to view their sexuality as a special part of who they are – does not equate to teaching sex is abnormal, aberrant, or shameful."}

This is about voting rights, whether or not democracy fundamentally works in this country. This is one of those moments where Justice Kennedy has been the swing vote.

That fight – true to our nation's highest ideals – has achieved historic progress, but we still have a long way to go. As president, I will work to protect every member of the LGBTQ+ community from hatred, violence, and discrimination. We will close disparities in health care access and quality, stop violence against transgender people, and advocate for equal rights across the world. We cannot settle for anything less – and I won't.\\n\\nBloomberg's radical transgender agenda included supporting the Do No Harm Act that would gut the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's provision to protect Americans right to live and act according to their religious convictions.\\n\\nMike will … end the Trump administration's practice of granting federally funded organizations a license to discriminate against people based on their religious beliefs, sexual orientation or gender identity, the website stated.\\n\\nBloomberg also supports passage of the Equality Act, which would bar governments and sports organizations from recognizing the biological/physiological difference between men and women and replace it with gender identity.\\n\\nThe website stated:\\n\\nMike will also protect and expand ACA enrollment efforts and restrict the sale of plans that don't meet ACA standards, ensuring coverage for medically-necessary gender-affirming care (e.g., gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy).\\n\\nBloomberg vowed to restore and enforce the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Equal Access Rule to ensure that transgender people are able to stay in shelters that match their gender identity.\\n\\nThis housing agenda would allow transgender women to stay in homeless and domestic violence shelters based on gender identity.\\n\\nBloomberg also would prioritize transgender rights in federal law enforcement:\\n\\nAs president, Mike will establish a comprehensive approach to addressing violence against LGBTQ+ people, especially transgender women of color. Mike will make hate and bias crimes a top federal priority, directing the FBI to take the lead on bias crime investigations, training local authorities to identify hate and pressing states to report all hate crimes to the federal government, and improving data collection on violent deaths of LGBTQ+ people.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported, Bloomberg and the left are embracing the transgender ideology despite scientific facts:\\n\\nAttorney and writer Jane Robbins observed at the Witherspoon Institute's Public Discourse:\\n\\nThe concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. An individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. And as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. But the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania. Physicians who have embraced transgender ideology are enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. Transgender treatment for those with gender dysphoria has grown into an elaborate industry. The cost of top surgery, for example, is over $10,000.\\n\\nBloomberg also said he would restore U.S. leadership on LGBTQ+ rights at home and around the world, even if the Trump administration launched a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality.\\n\\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}
{"original": "Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has introduced a series of sweeping foreign policy bills, including one that would let Congress limit the president's power to place international sanctions and declare national emergencies.\\n\\nOmar describes the legislative package, titled Pathway to PEACE (Progressive, Equitable, and Constructive Engagement), as a bold progressive vision to rethink the country's approach to foreign policy by centering human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America's engagement in the world, and making military action a last resort in a press release. I believe in a world where there are no young girls living through war, and no nations that are being destroyed, she declared in the statement.\\n\\nEndless war is not making our country safer. It is costing lives, destroying futures, and damaging our reputation in the world. Today, I'm introducing the #PathwaytoPeace, a new vision for American foreign policy based on peace and diplomacy. https://t.co/TpG8oqk1X7 — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 12, 2020\\n\\nShe spoke about the bills at a panel discussion on Capitol Hill Wednesday, framing them as a globalized approach to U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nThese sets of bills are not about a single country or singling out one particular country, said Omar, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It's about setting a common set of standards for the world.\\n\\nOne of the bills, the Congressional Oversight of Sanctions Act, would give Congress power to limit the executive branch's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare national emergencies and place economic sanctions.\\n\\nWe need to restore congressional oversight, Omar said. She explained that the bill requires an explanation for what foreign policy goal is supposed to be achieved with the given sanction and what the process for delisting an individual, entity or country should be.\\n\\nOmar has telegraphed her practical aims for this particular policy. In the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as Iran and Venezuela. Last April, she accused President Trump of declaring a fake emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allowed him to direct funding towards the construction of physical barriers.\\n\\nThis is a fake emergency! Donald Trump is lying about the border in order to build his monument to racism. https://t.co/hVOVzLYDHw — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) April 3, 2019\\n\\nOne of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.\\n\\nAnother bill redirects defense spending – something Omar refers to as military intimidation and coercion – and gives it to the State Department.\\n\\n[The] Global Peace Building Act… would authorize a one-time transfer of $5 billion dollars from the Pentagon's Overseas Contingency Operation budget to the State Department to create a new multi-lateral peacebuilding fund, she said.\\n\\nHer press release does not specify this entity's relationship to the United States Institute of Peace, created in 1984 and funded annually by Congress. The institute describes its work as  a vital investment in reducing violent international conflicts that threaten U.S. national security in its latest budget justification letter sent to Congress.\\n\\nTwo more bills would require the United States to cede authority and sovereignty to global institutions.\\n\\nOmar called it an international embarrassment that the United States has not signed onto the controversial United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\\n\\nHowever, that agreement would severely undermine U.S. sovereignty, as explained in a legal white paper from Americans United for Life in 2010:\\n\\nUnder Article VI of the United States Constitution, all treaties made shall be the supreme Law of the Land. Therefore, ratification of the UNCRC will make the document binding under American law and it would supersede any relevant, existing federal or state laws. This will also ultimately limit United States sovereignty by placing American family law and parental rights under international regulation and scrutiny.\\n\\nOmar also called on the United States to join the International Criminal Court, a global entity that President Donald Trump blocked from launching an investigation into alleged atrocities committing during the war between 2003 and 2004, including by U.S. troops, Afghan forces, and the Taliban.\\n\\nTrump has denounced the ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes court, for its 'broad, unaccountable, prosecutorial powers,' Reuters reported. Washington revoked travel visas for ICC personnel in response to its work on Afghanistan.\\n\\nOmar's press release touts support for the bills from left-wing heavyweights like Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor to Barack Obama.\\n\\nCongresswoman Omar is putting forward an ambitious and comprehensive package that outlines progressive approaches to some of the most important issues facing the United States and our world today, Rhodes said.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch's Andrea Prasow praised Omar as a leader on the subject:  With an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that Congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.\\n\\nOmar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.\\n\\nMore recently, Omar has been mired in more personal controversies. In late 2019, she filed for divorce from Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her children, amid swirling reports of an affair with Democratic operative Tim Mynett. She is now facing scrutiny for alleged campaign payments to his consulting firm. Likewise, long-simmering questions about her marriage to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009 — which critics have alleged was a marriage to her brother for immigration purposes — have reportedly reached the FBI.\\n\\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}
{"original": "A court in India ruled on Monday that the term Hindu bride must also include transgender women, thus directing authorities to register a marriage solemnized between a man and a transgender woman.\\n\\nJustice G R Swaminathan of the Madras high court, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, issued a ruling on Monday that the term bride as defined by the Hindu Marriage Act must also include transgender women, who are biologically male. The case was brought by a man and his transgender partner after registration authorities refused to certify their marriage, citing Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1956 that states that a transgender woman cannot be considered a bride.\\n\\nSwaminathan chose to discard the ruling by referring to cases such as the recent decriminalization of homosexuality while observing that equal rights are afforded to transgenders under the Indian Constitution.\\n\\nAfter making an exhaustive reference to the human rights jurisprudence worldwide in this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Article 14 of the Constitution of India which affirms that the State shall not deny to 'any person' equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India would apply to transgenders also, he said in his ruling.\\n\\nTransgender persons fall within the expression 'person' and hence entitled to legal protection of laws in all spheres of State activity as enjoyed by any other citizen of this country, he continued.\\n\\n\\n\\nSwaminathan observed that gender identity falls within the domain of her personal autonomy and involves her right to privacy and dignity, arguing that it was not for State authorities to question this self-determination of the second petitioner herein.\\n\\nWhen the right of the transgender persons to marry has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the very nature of things, they cannot be kept out of the purview of the Hindu Marriage Act, he added. One can have a civil marriage. One can also have a sacramental marriage. The petitioners' marriage was solemnized in a temple. Therefore, their fundamental right under Article 25 has also been infringed in this case.\\n\\nSwaminathan also took steps to outlaw gender reassignment surgeries on children who identify as intersex, saying that they required more time and maturity to make such a decision. However, he said the government must launch campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the issue so that parents and children did not feel a sense of shame.\\n\\nParents must be encouraged to feel that the birth of an inter-sex child is not a matter of embarrassment or shame, the court ruled. Any intersex child is entitled to stay within the folds of the family, he observed. The running away to the margins and beyond is a fatal journey that must be arrested. Time has come when they are brought back from the margins to the mainstream.\\n\\nDespite being known for its ultra-conservative society, India has taken steps to implement various LGBT rights over recent years.

{"original": "The Vatican under Pope Francis is consolidating its opposition to gender theory, the notion that maleness and femaleness can be separated from biological sex, according to veteran Vatican analyst John L. Allen, Jr.\\n\\nAlthough prior popes were also critical of gender theory, Allen writes in a March 15 essay, opposition has intensified on Francis's watch.\\n\\nThe pope has repeatedly warned against the dangers of ideologies that separate sexual identity from biology, decrying gender theory as against the nature of things. It seems, Allen writes, that folks at the Vatican have picked up on Francis' war on gender theory and have decided to throw themselves into the fray.\\n\\nAs an example, Allen cites a conference at Rome's Santa Croce University this week that featured a forceful critique of gender theory, notably during a panel chaired by German Archbishop Georg Gänswein, aide to emeritus Pope Benedict XVI and currently the Prefect of the Papal Household.\\n\\nThe paper was prepared by canon lawyer Vincenzo Turchi, which served to throw some doctrinal heft behind the pope's sometimes casual statements on the subject.\\n\\nAllen condenses the Church's opposition to gender theory into three bullet points, all contained in Turchi's talk:\\n\\n– It undermines the objective moral norms governing sexual behavior by proposing that sexual identity and orientation are not given in nature, but rather the result of contingent historical and cultural factors.\\n\\n– In the hands of educators, it jeopardizes the right of parents to be the primary teachers of their children.\\n\\n– It threatens traditional Christian morality by casting it as discriminatory and bigoted.\\n\\nGender theory is based on the primacy of culture over nature, Turchi's paper read. Since gender theory views nature and biology data as marginal, sexual differences are fluid and changeable and can be fashioned on the basis of individual self-determination.\\n\\nCommenting on educational programs where gender theory is currently employed, Turchi spoke of a pilot curriculum in Spain where children are encouraged to pretend that they are members of the opposite sex to break down their natural identification with their bodies.\\n\\nThis includes acting out fairy tales, where boys are encouraged to play the part of Little Red Riding Hood, while girls are invited to play the part of the wolf, Allen notes.\\n\\nAdded to this, Turchi cited developments in northern Europe, such as the adoption of gender-neutral pronouns in Swedish schools and sexual education in Denmark that includes the possibility for guest speakers such as a transsexual prostitute.\\n\\nFrancis denounced gender theory for its denial of the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman and for its dream of a society without sexual differences in a lengthy 2017 teaching letter on marriage and the family called The Joy of Love (Amoris Laetitia).\\n\\nAn appreciation of our body as male or female, he wrote, is necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves and is far from the unisex utopia that some would like to impose.\\n\\nEfforts to blot out sexual differences based on anatomy are symptomatic of a sick society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he added.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

In a sign of the Democrats' possible weakening resolve to uniformly oppose all Trump judicial picks, three of the nominees received some Democratic votes in support. The appellate nominee, Kurt Engelhardt for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was approved 15-6.\\n\\nThe only one approved on a straight 11-10 party-line vote was Howard Nielson, nominated for the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. Nielson is a well-respected former law clerk to a top appellate judge and then worked at the elite Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) at the U.S. Department of Justice.\\n\\nDemocrats are opposing Nielson because of his work defending traditional marriage at the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2013, as well as his work at OLC defending presidential power to subject enemy combatants to enhanced interrogation. He is a partner at Cooper & Kirk, the powerhouse law firm headed by one of the most accomplished lawyers in the nation, Chuck Cooper, who headed OLC as its assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and Attorney General Ed Meese. Cooper is also a savvy political figure in D.C. and a close ally and personal lawyer to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\\n\\nEven Nielson's critics acknowledge that he is well-qualified for a judgeship, and attempts to stop him will likely look like partisan obstruction that continues to diminish Democrats' political currency.

Brennan's nomination has been slow-walked because home-state Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)—an aggressive partisan who is vulnerable for re-election in 2018—has refused to return her blue slip consenting to a committee hearing.\\n\\nBlue slips are a courtesy that Senate Democrats have abused during the Trump presidency, which formerly allowed a home-state senator to insist on consultations but which were never intended as a one-senator veto on a nominee with majority support. Democrats' misuse of blue slips to derail nominees led to Grassley's discarding of the process, and last month, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) led the full Senate to confirm the first Trump nominee to be initially blocked by a blue slip, Judge David Stras to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\\n\\nBrennan and the other held-over nominees are expected to eventually be confirmed as well.

It also professes a commitment to an ecumenical atmosphere open to diversity.\\n\\nFor its part, Chick-fil-A CEO management has articulated a biblical understanding of marriage that exactly mirrors Catholic teaching, while also emphasizing that they do not discriminate in any way, and are more than happy to serve anyone who wishes to eat at their establishment.\\n\\nIn 2012, Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A, stated: We are very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.\\n\\nWe know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles, he said.\\n\\nLambda Gay-Straight Alliance, the LGBT student organization on campus, considers Chick-fil-A's commitment to traditional marriage potentially offensive to gay students, despite the obvious fact that no one is required to patronize the restaurant who doesn't want to.\\n\\nAt the March 26 meeting, Lambda executive board member Niko Martini proposed that the Student Government Association (SGA) pass a resolution asking the university to reconsider the inclusion of Chick-fil-A as a dining option for students. Martini said he made the proposal on his own behalf and not Lambda's.\\n\\nChick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, Martini said. I think it's imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.\\n\\nMartini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus.\\n\\nMeanwhile Lambda President Rachel Coury expressed worries that the safety of LGBT students might be at risk.\\n\\nI've tried very hard within the last semester and a half to promote this safe environment for the LGBTQ+ community, Coury said.

{"original": "BOSTON (AP) — Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric Co. into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate and parlayed his legendary business acumen into a retirement career as a corporate leadership guru, has died. He was 84.\\n\\nHis death was confirmed Monday by GE. The cause of death was renal failure, his wife Suzy told The New York Times.\\n\\nWelch became one of the nation's most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as GE's chairman and chief executive, from 1981 to 2001. He personified the so-called cult of the CEO during the late-1990s boom, when GE's soaring stock price made it the most valuable company in the world.\\n\\nA chemical engineer by training, Welch transformed the company from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse. During his tenure, GE's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.\\n\\nWelch's results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping GE turn a financial corner, although some of the success came at the expense of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in Welch's relentless efforts to cut costs and rid GE of unprofitable businesses.\\n\\nBusiness success and outspokenness brought him wide fame.\\n\\nIn 1999, Fortune magazine named Welch as its Manager of the Century.\\n\\nFor his first book, Jack: Straight From the Gut, Welch received a $7.1 million advance. Although released on the very morning of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the book became a best-seller, and led to frequent speaking engagements where he took his candor on stage.\\n\\nFrom the day I joined GE to the day I was named CEO, 20 years later, my bosses cautioned me about my candor, Welch wrote in 'Straight from the Gut.' I was labeled abrasive and consistently warned my candor would soon get in the way of my career … and I'm telling you that it was candor that helped make it work.\\n\\nWelch did not slow down after leaving GE.\\n\\nHe became a senior advisor with private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice in 2001. He also taught a course on business leadership at MIT's Sloan School of Management in 2006. In 2009, Welch founded the Jack Welch Management Institute, an online MBA program that is now part of Strayer University.\\n\\nWhile Welch was known for being hypercompetitive, he also stressed giving everyone a fair shake.\\n\\nIn the 2005 book, Winning, Welch wrote that he would like to be remembered as a huge advocate of candor and meritocracy, and believing everyone deserves a chance. And I'd like to be remembered for trying to make the case that you can never let yourself be a victim.\\n\\nAlong with Welch's fame came greater scrutiny. Welch found himself defending his retirement compensation. Amid a wave of corporate scandals, details of Welch's GE perks emerged in court papers during his 2002 divorce from his wife of 13 years, Jane Beasley. He received millions of dollars in benefits, including unlimited personal use of GE's planes, office space and financial services.\\n\\nAfter the perks became public, Welch reimbursed the company for many of them, and paid for use of aircraft and other services.\\n\\nHis first marriage, to Carolyn, ended amicably in divorce after 28 years in 1987. Plans for his second divorce were disclosed shortly after Harvard Business Review editor Suzy Wetlaufer revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while working on a story about him.\\n\\nWelch didn't blame the media for the attention the affair generated.\\n\\nChrist, if I was a journalist, I'd write a scandalous story, Welch told the CBS television news magazine 60 Minutes in a 2005 interview. I mean, it's a good story, but I don't care. I fell in love.\\n\\nWetlaufer resigned the Harvard editing post in 2002 because of a furor caused by her relationship with Welch. In a January 2012 interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, when asked how he persuaded Wetlaufer to marry him, Welch replied, My charm and probably my wallet.\\n\\nWe had a little scandal at the beginning, he continued. And it's been the greatest 10 years of our lives.\\n\\nThe couple wrote a regular column, called The Welch Way, in Business Week magazine for four years. They also wrote management books, including Winning in 2005.\\n\\nThe Welches resumed writing a regular column in 2012, this time for Reuters. They used the column to dole out advice for business and political figures, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, whom they supported.\\n\\nWelch was also active on Twitter, where he opined on everything from politics to business to sports and had 1.4 million followers.\\n\\nSome of those opinions generated controversy.\\n\\nHe questioned a monthly jobs report in October 2012 that showed the unemployment rate had fallen below 8% for the first time in three and a half years. The report came two days after President Barack Obama had performed poorly in his first debate with Romney and a month before the election.\\n\\nUnbelievable jobs numbers, he tweeted. These Chicago guys will do anything…can't debate so change numbers.\\n\\nObama hailed from Chicago. While some Republican members of Congress echoed his views, his criticism was mostly derided by economists and by former Labor Department officials from the Bush administration, who vouched for the accuracy of the data.\\n\\nIn his writing and speaking, Welch shared the wisdom he gained in a GE career that began right after he left grad school. He quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and CEO in 1981, at age 45. Welch quickly shook up GE, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname Neutron Jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. Welch also divested GE of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be No. 1 or 2 in their markets. The early moves dismantled GE's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.\\n\\nHe's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, Noel Tichy, the author of a 1993 book on Welch and a former leader of GE's vaunted training programs, said in 2001. He'll make snap judgments. He's a human being that has temper tantrums.\\n\\nWith all that, I think he's the greatest business leader I ever met, Tichy said.\\n\\nAnd Welch freely acknowledged his mistakes. One was Calma, a computer design firm that GE bought in 1981. The company wound up losing $50 million annually until GE sold it in 1988.\\n\\nWelch delayed his retirement for one last bold move, a $41 billion bid to buy Honeywell International.\\n\\nWelch predicted easy government approval for the largest acquisition GE had ever attempted, but European regulators rejected the deal as bad for competition.\\n\\nIn 1986, Welch made one of his boldest moves, a $6.4 billion acquisition of RCA, including the NBC television network. The deal energized GE, which made hundreds more acquisitions as the company moved aggressively into financial services, medical equipment and jet engines.\\n\\nOne of Welch's greatest accomplishments, his supporters say, is the talent GE has created by placing a premium on developing leaders. Many former GE executives now lead Fortune 500 companies.\\n\\nAmong the leaders Welch groomed was his GE successor, Jeffrey Immelt. Welch has written that picking his successor leading up to the 2001 leadership transition was the most important and agonizing decision he ever made.\\n\\nIn April 2008, Immelt became the target of Welch's blunt talk when GE missed a quarterly earnings target, a month after Immelt had promised investors the company would meet its goals. The disappointment sent GE shares down nearly 13% in a single day, prompting Welch to say that he would get a gun out and shoot Immelt if he allowed GE to miss earnings targets again.\\n\\nAfter making the comment on CNBC, Welch went back on the GE-owned cable station the next day to renounce his harsh talk, saying, Nothing, nothing, nothing is as disgusting to me as some old CEO chirping away about how things aren't as good under the new guy as they were under him.\\n\\nAnd he never strayed far from GE.\\n\\nWhen I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, 'So how exactly are you running the company?' Jack was still in it – committed to GE's success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling, said GE's current CEO, Larry Culp.\\n\\nHe will be deeply missed by me and the entire GE team. And we'll continue to honor his legacy by doing exactly what Jack would want us to do: win. We extend our thoughts and sympathies to Suzy and his family during this time.\\n\\nBorn Nov. 19, 1935, as the only child of an Irish working-class family in Salem, Mass., Welch graduated from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. He later obtained master's and doctoral degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois, finishing in 1960.\\n\\nWelch joined GE that year as a junior engineer in Pittsfield, Mass.\\n\\nHe rose through the ranks, and built GE's plastics business into one of the company's fastest growing business units. He became a senior vice president in 1977, and vice chairman in 1979. In 1995, Welch suffered chest pains and underwent heart bypass surgery.\\n\\nThe setback led to speculation that GE could be seeking a quick successor to Welch, but he remained at the helm another six years.\\n\\nWelch moved to Boston after his career at GE, living in a townhouse in the city's Beacon Hill section.\\n\\nIn his later years, Welch also devoted more time to passions such as baseball — specifically, the Boston Red Sox.\\n\\nHe is survived by his third wife, Suzy Welch, and four children from his first marriage."}

Sen. McCain was censured by the state party in 2014. He went on to win re-election two years later, defeating current party chair Kelli Ward in the GOP primary.\\n\\nI'm not surprised by the continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward . . . She's shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections — her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins, McCain said in a statement released to the Arizona Republic late Tuesday.\\n\\nWard is a former state legislator who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Arizona and is a strong supporter of President Trump.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal said resolutions addressing Flake and Ducey will also be considered at the January 23 meeting of the Arizona Republican Party.\\n\\nA separate resolution to censure Flake cites his opposition to President Trump's re-election, and a third resolution to censure Ducey cites his failure to remove emergency coronavirus pandemic restrictions."}
{"original": "South Bend Mayor and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg suggested Tuesday that Vice President Mike Pence is not as sincere in his Christian faith as he claims to be, judging based on his political alliance with President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe section in my book about Mike Pence begins with that quote from Lincoln where he says, Both sides in great contests invoke God, think and hope that God's on their side. Both may be, and one must be, wrong, Buttigieg told Father Edward Beck in a wide-ranging interview on faith and public service for CNN. The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit.\\n\\nMichael D'Antonio, co-author of The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence, told CNN in August 2018 that Pence believes him becoming vice president was divine intervention. Absolutely everything that Mike Pence does is oriented towards him becoming President… by the time he left high school, he had decided he was going to be President of the United States.\\n\\nAnd as he rose through life, becoming a member of Congress and then Governor of Indiana, he actually sort of heard in his being God's direction, D'Antonio told New Day co-host John Berman. The author went on to claim how Pence thought that God was calling him to now be Vice President and function as a President-in-waiting.\\n\\nIn his discussion with Beck, Buttigieg took aim at Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation that Pence, then governor of the state, signed into law in 2015. The law allows both individuals and business to assert as a defense in legal proceedings that their religion has been burdened. The small town mayor called it a license to harm others in the name of religion.\\n\\nIt was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion, he said. Like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now? Making it easier to harm people in its name?\\n\\nIn another portion of the pair's discussion, Buttigieg spoke about why he believes same-sex marriage is a contentious issue in religious circles.\\n\\nIt saddens me because when I think about the blessings of marriage, first of all it's one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional, the 37-year-old said. It is morally one of the best things in my life. Being married to Chasten makes me a better person. I would even say it moves me closer to God.\\n\\nAnd so the idea that this of all things is what people are attacking each other over and excluding each other over, when God is love, we are taught, he went on. Of all the things to beat people up over on theological grounds, it just seems to me that loving shouldn't be one of them. So it's a painful thing to watch.\\n\\nIf you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then I think it takes you to a pretty specific place, he added. I've learned that it's an expression of love, at least it can be. And I guess I believe it ought to be.\\n\\nThe interview comes after Buttigieg announced his campaign had raised more than $7 million in the first quarter."}

And being that we don't practice Scientology, and that we aren't particularly interested in opening religious centers in general, we have no plans to open a Scientology center, the actor said.\\n\\nQuite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he added. We're not here to buy up or change or take over Denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. We're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of Denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.\\n\\nIn an essay for Gawker last year, Lee's first wife Carmen Llywelyn blamed Scientology for the breakup of their marriage. Lee and Llewelyn were married from 1995 to 2001.\\n\\nI was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work, she wrote.  I did what I thought was right. But I made the mistake of immersing myself completely in his world. I did what so many other people who join Scientology do: I lost all sense of individual identity in the name of the cult.\\n\\nLee joins several other recent high-profile defectors from the controversial Church, including actress Leah Remini, musician Lisa Marie Presley, director Paul Haggis, and actor Jason Beghe.\\n\\nIn March of last year, documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney released an HBO exposé on the controversial religion called Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. The film — which won three Emmy Awards — detailed the controversial behind-the-scenes working of the church and made several explosive allegations regarding its most devoted celebrity adherents, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\\n\\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dnzussbaum"}

{"original": "Mark Anthony Conditt died on Wednesday morning when he exploded a device in his car as police attempted to take him into custody. Less than 12 hours later, information about who the Austin Serial Bomber is beginning to emerge.\\n\\nThe man described by his former employer as quiet and introverted went on a three-week rampage that left two people dead, five people injured, and people across Austin, Travis County, and FedEx stores and processing facilities terrorized.\\n\\nEducation:\\n\\nConditt's family homeschooled him before he graduated and attended Austin Community College. He attended the local college for about two years, but did not graduate, KVUE reported. His formal education at the school ended in 2012.\\n\\nDuring his college years, Conditt appears to have written some conservative blog posts as part of an assignment, NBC News reported. The blog, Defining My Stance, provided a platform for a host postings ranging from anti-gay marriage to his positions on free abortions to why sex offender registrations should be ended. The posts were allegedly authored by a Mark A. Conditt, but NBC News said they were unable to confirm with school officials if the bomber actually wrote the posts.\\n\\nEmployment:\\n\\nConditt does not appear to have any kind of military or law enforcement service in his background. He worked for Crux Manufacturing for about four years, overlapping the time he spent at Austin Community College, the Austin ABC affiliate reported. His former boss said he hired the then-19-year-old because he seemed like a smart kid who showed a lot of promise. He reportedly worked in sales and purchasing and did a little bit of everything. However, after his performance slipped and he received several unheeded warnings, Crux Manufacturing let him go in August 2017.\\n\\nHis former employers described him as a quiet and introverted man who would prioritize things in his own way, KVUE reported.\\n\\nConditt listed work as a computer repair technician, according to his profile on a job recruiting website, the Austin American Statesman reported.\\n\\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott told KXAN's Phil Prazan that Conditt was unemployed when he died and had no military background.\\n\\nPolitics:\\n\\nThe college blog posts allegedly written by Conditt paint a picture of a politically conservative person.\\n\\nI am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended, the blog page's profile states. The reasons I am taking this class is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.\\n\\nAgain, NBC could not confirm is the same Mark A. Conditt authored the posts on this blogsite.\\n\\nSome of the headlines on the 2012 blog read:\\n\\nWhy Gay Marriage Should be Illegal\\n\\nMy View on Free Abortions\\n\\nWhy We Might Want to Consider Doing Away with Sex Offender Registration\\n\\nAn Argument for the Death Penalty\\n\\nPersonality:\\n\\nConditt's neighbors paint a picture not dissimilar to that of his former employer. Jeff Reeb told NBC News that Conditt was a very normal kid and that his family was extremely nice.\\n\\nReeb told the Statesman that he struggled to wrap his mind about Conditt's actions. I know this is a cliché but I just can't imagine that, he explained about Conditt's involvement in the bombings. He said his grandson grew up with Conditt and they played together.\\n\\nHe is reported to be the oldest of four children.\\n\\nThe Bombings:\\n\\nThere is no reported criminal history in Conditt's past, several news outlets reported. That clear recorded ended on March 2 when Conditt allegedly delivered a package to the northeast Austin home of Anthony House. The package exploded and killed the 39-year-old black man.\\n\\nOn March 12, Conditt struck again by killing 17-year-old Draylen Mason in East Austin when a package exploded after he brought it inside his home. Mason's mother was also injured in the attack. A few hours later, Conditt also injured a 75-year-old Hispanic woman after she picked up a package on her front steps.\\n\\nOn March 19, two other young men were injured when Conditt changed his tactics. This time a tripwire bomb exploded — sending the two men to a local hospital.\\n\\nAustin Interim Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters that investigators believe the use of a tripwire in the fourth bomb shows a higher level of sophistication than already been demonstrated. He said it also indicates a shift in the serial bomber's strategy of targeting specific people to a more random style.\\n\\nThe randomness expanded when a package exploded at a FedEx processing facility in Schertz, Texas. A woman suffered ringing in her ears after the package exploded on an automated conveyor belt near her work location. Police tracked down a second package at a FedEx Ground facility in East Austin. Police later determined that package was an unexploded device.\\n\\nThe packages appeared to have been shipped from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, Texas, near the location of the fourth bombing.\\n\\nU.S. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-TX) told the Statesman that federal investigators obtained videos that could possibly show a suspect connected to the Schertz bombing.\\n\\nMcCaul told reporters that he hoped the bomber's biggest mistake was going through FedEx.\\n\\nIt was.\\n\\nLess than 24 hours later, law enforcement officials tracked down Conditt through a variety of techniques and identified the young man from Pflugerville as the suspect. Using cell phone technology, police tracked Conditt to a motel parking lot in neighboring Round Rock. A few hours later, Conditt killed himself by exploding a device inside his car.\\n\\nMotivation:\\n\\nThis is what we do not know about Mark Conditt. Police are continuing to investigate the young man's background and his Pflugerville home to search for clues as to why Conditt would suddenly launch a bombing attack that would kill two people, injur six others, and eventually take his own life."}

{"original": "Actor Terry Crews detailed his life-long battle with an addiction to pornography and revealed how it almost derailed his marriage in a three-part video series posted to Facebook.\\n\\nThe 47-year-old former NFL player and Brooklyn Nine-Nine star released his latest Dirty Little Secret Facebook video on Tuesday. In the first video posted earlier this month, the actor revealed he went to rehab for his addiction, and said it had really, really messed up life in a lot of ways.\\n\\nDirty Little Secret Posted by Terry Crews on Thursday, February 11, 2016\\n\\nIt became a thing where I didn't tell anybody, Crews says in the first video. It was my secret, nobody knew, and that allowed it to grow, and it got bad. If day turns into night and you are still watching, you probably got a problem, and that was me. I didn't tell my wife, didn't tell my friends, nobody knew.\\n\\nThe actor added that pornography can change the way human beings view each other, not as people but as objects and body parts.\\n\\nMy issue was and is with pornography is it changes the way you think about people. People become objects, people become body parts, they become things to be used rather than people to be loved, Crews said. You start to use people, you start to feel like you're the man and they're just whatever.\\n\\nIn the second clip, Crews said it was important not to let a sense of shame interfere in the battle against overcoming addiction.\\n\\nDirty Little Secret Part 2 Posted by Terry Crews on Wednesday, February 17, 2016\\n\\nShame doesn't say you did something bad, shame says you are bad, he said. And when you think and believe that you are bad, there's no way out. You say: 'You know what, forget it, I might as well use drugs, I might as well overeat, I might as well use porn.' Because if you believe that are bad, then you act accordingly. What you have to change is that paradigm in your life, you have to believe that you are good.\\n\\nDirty Little Secret part 3 Posted by Terry Crews on Tuesday, February 23, 2016\\n\\nIn the clip posted Tuesday, the actor revealed his pornography addiction became so bad he felt like my wife owed me sex.\\n\\nWhen you have a sense of entitlement, it's extremely dangerous, Crews said. What entitlement does is it gives you self-pity. And self-pity — it feels good. It feels good.\\n\\nEvery man out there desires intimacy. Every time you look at pornography, it's a desire for intimacy, he said. You are trying to fight your feelings of being alone by filling it with pornography in an attempt to feel that you are with someone and you know someone. But pornography is an intimacy killer. It kills all intimacy.\\n\\nCrews also cautioned both men and women to take more responsibility to combat the problem.\\n\\nYou cannot accept any pornography in your man's life. Anything that will make you feel denigrated, make you feel less than, you cannot accept it, he said.\\n\\nI'm calling on men to be more accountable. A true man and a true woman is a person who takes responsibility for everything in his life, good and bad, he added.\\n\\nWatch Crews' three-part Dirty Little Secret Facebook series above."}
{"original": "Things are about to change. Don't worry: it won't last forever. These things never do. It's a phase, and if you fly over it at 30,000 feet, what you will see is that all this social justice-systemic racism-defund the police nonsense comes down to one thing… The Democrat Party is returning to its soft-on-crime roots, and in the end, this will not end well for Democrats.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it's going to take a while for voters to come to their senses. Things are going to get worse before they get better — thankfully, this worsening will be contained in Democrat-run cities.\\n\\nNevertheless, the radical left is now emboldened and have the Democrat Party, academia, the media, countless district attorney offices, the government bureaucracy, corporate America, and Hollywood on the run… So until things get better (and I promise things will get better), here's my handy-dandy guide to surviving the coming era of social justice mob rule…\\n\\nGet the Hell Out of Democrat-Run Cities\\n\\nThis isn't an easy one to accomplish. I know because I've done it twice already. But you have to get out. The Democrats that run these cities did not only stand by as their cities were burned and looted, as predominantly black neighborhoods were burned and looted by predominantly white, left-wing terrorist groups like Antifa — these Democrats encouraged and continue to encourage burning and looting.\\n\\nI'm sorry, but the cities are lost to us now, and will be for years…\\n\\nWhen Democrats are releasing violent criminals, encouraging illegal immigration, and passing laws to disarm you while turning the police into eunuchs, it's over… Minneapolis is preparing to disband the police. Los Angeles just slashed police funding. New York is gearing up to slash police funding. I'm telling you, it's over…\\n\\nSo you have to get out now, especially if you own property because that property is about to become worthless.\\n\\nThis is not hyperbole. This is history repeating itself. The gangs and cartels are about to take over your city. Welcome back to the urban blight of the 1970s.\\n\\nNow… If you're a Democrat, you need to stay put. We don't need you voting to Californicate the rest of the country.\\n\\nMove to Rural America\\n\\nYou can try moving to the suburbs, I guess… But as your nearest Democrat-run city descends into hell, your taxes will explode. Plus, you'll be funding rotting schools, potholes, corrupt Democrat political machines, and self-destructive social justice programs.\\n\\nAlso, eventually, the blight moves outside the cities and into surrounding areas. Let me put it this way… If you do move to the suburbs, be prepared to move again the moment you see graffiti. Graffiti is always the beginning of the end.\\n\\nThe reason I recommend Rural America is because Democrats hate Rural America. They want their foofoo theaters and their foofoo cafes and their foofoo nightclubs. Rural America is Red America… I love it out here. Calm, peaceful, serene… Not a single drop of this social justice madness has touched my community.\\n\\nTo those of us out here in Rural America, all this mayhem is just a reality TV show we like to call Toldjaso!\\n\\nPrepare to Home School\\n\\nIf you can afford private school, great. If the public schools in your area are not yet polluted with social justice propaganda, great. But you must be prepared to home school because with the left emboldened and almost entirely in charge of academia, the last thing public schools will be teaching is reading, writing, and arithmetic.\\n\\nYou need to keep a close eye on what your school is teaching because the left only wants to teach your kids to engage in loveless sex, the sanctity of abortion, why America is evil, that men are women and women are men, and that Global Warming is real. (It's not.)\\n\\nBe prepared to home school.\\n\\nBuy Guns and Plenty of Ammo\\n\\nThis is not a troll. This is not an attempt to be inflammatory. There's only one reason the left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter always-always-always focused their marauding in left-wing cities: they know the populace is defenseless.\\n\\nThese terrorists also know that once they move out into the suburbs, people are more likely to own guns.\\n\\nAnd they damn well know Rural America is armed to the teeth, so they will never come out here.\\n\\nFirearms are not only necessary for self-defense and for you to honor your primary responsibility in life, which is to protect your family and property; they're an excellent deterrent. I own four firearms. Two are within reach of my bed. Peace of mind, baby.\\n\\nIt's time to arm yourself.\\n\\nI would also recommend obtaining a conceal carry permit.\\n\\nCancel Your Cable TV\\n\\nCable news is poison. Hollywood's idea of entertainment today is either pushing sex on your children or straight-up propaganda. Why are you paying to pump this garbage into your home? What, you like paying $125 a month to have CNNLOL deliberately misinform you and then call you racist, to have MTV glorify degeneracy?\\n\\nThere are all kinds of streaming options out there, many of them free. You'll save money, protect your kids, and best of all, push CNNLOL, MSNBC, and the rest one step closer to history's dustbin.\\n\\nI've written extensively on this. Please click here, here, and here — okay, that last click is to celebrate the weekend.\\n\\nKeep Hard Copies of Your Favorite Books, Movies, and TV Shows\\n\\nSix years ago, almost to the day, I was roundly laughed at for warning people to hold on to their hard copies of Blazing Saddles and Gone with the Wind.\\n\\nYou see, I've been around long enough to have learned one very important lesson about the left: no matter how outrageous the idea might sound at the time, the left — with the help of its media machine — will eventually mainstream that idea.\\n\\nHey, we went from zero to gay marriage in ten years. We went from zero to drag queen story hour in ten seconds.\\n\\nSo when America's leftists began to complain about classic films and television shows that are problematic, I knew it was only a matter of time… Well, the time has come.\\n\\nAlready, and even though he is innocent of the allegation, Woody Allen — one of our greatest living filmmakers — had his latest film blacklisted, along with his career. The Walt Disney Company has blacklisted its own Song of the South. The creator of The Simpsons has blacklisted an episode of his own show. The Library Journal published an article calling for a ban on books guilty of whiteness, whatever the hell that is. The Little House books are being burned.\\n\\nAnd now the blacklisting push is ramping up….\\n\\nJust this week, the far-left Washington Post demanded an immediate and total shutdown of all police movies and TV shows.\\n\\nLegos is already blacklisting its own toys.\\n\\nLet me tell you exactly how this is going to work…\\n\\nThe fascist mob is going to declare certain toys, books, movies, and television shows problematic, and these corporations, that are either cowardly or infested with social justice warriors, are going to disappear these things. Problematic books, movies, and TV shows will vanish off proverbial store shelves — physical and digital.\\n\\nAnother possibility is that they will be mutilated by censors. Problematic scenes, moments, characters, and words will be removed.\\n\\nA couple of years ago, I decided to move my movie collection to digital. But after The Simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, I've gotten smarter. Even if I already have a digital copy, I went back and purchased hard copies of movies and TV shows that are wonderfully problematic.\\n\\nLet me tell you right now, if you don't own hard copies of Manhattan (and probably all of Woody Allen's movies), Married with Children, Gone with the Wind, and pretty much every one of Normal Lear's 1970's sitcoms (All in the Family, Sanford & Son, etc.), you will eventually lose them.\\n\\nSame with problematic books. Amazon will remove them from your Kindle.\\n\\nStock Up on Food and Water\\n\\nThe left-wing Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists will probably try to attack the suburbs and Rural America in an indirect way — going after power stations and the like. And if things get bad enough in the cities, we might see supply chains interrupted, so be prepared.\\n\\n—\\n\\nListen, out here in Rural America, we're going to be just fine. Don't be stressed. Don't live in fear — just be prepared. Being prepared is a great way to relieve anxiety.\\n\\nOverall, and as I said earlier, the left is eating its own. Let them fight. Enjoy the show. It's a total waste of time to try and care about people more than they care about themselves. Democrats are getting the blue on blue violence they voted for. It's not your problem.

It's right here…\\n\\nBut-but-but they fight bigotry, Cuomo argues — which is like arguing we need to remember Mussolini kept the trains running on time, Hitler built the autobahn, Mao fought for equality, and Stalin threw good dinner parties…\\n\\nNow listen to Cuomo attempt to justify mob violence if it's in service to a good cause.\\n\\nYou can talk about Antifa, I've watched them in streets protesting in different situations, OK? Cuomo argued. There are certainly aspects of them that are true to a cause, that is a good cause, they want social justice, they want whatever they want in that context.\\n\\nCNN's Chris Cuomo says Antifa is a good cause pic.twitter.com/mCMgoyPszQ — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 30, 2019\\n\\nSorry, decent people do not split hairs to excuse, champion, and encourage evil. Decent people remember that every one of history's monsters, from Hitler to Lenin to Castro to Pol Pot, believed they were fighting a good cause — some even believed they were fighting against bigotry and for social justice. So let's use this opportunity to examine Cuomo's definition of social justice.\\n\\nSome of you might remember that Fredo's twisted idea of social justice is to expose young girls to a penis without their consent.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget that Cuomo's warped idea of social justice also includes a return to McCarthyism, to a dark era where we blacklist people who express inappropriate ideas.\\n\\nCuomo's guest Steve Cortes tried reasoning with him.\\n\\nChris, Antifa is not a good cause, he said. Antifa does not have good aims, Antifa wants power, wants political power, taken through force. That's what Antifa is all about.\\n\\nBut Cuomo already knows this. Fredo's watched Antifa assault police offers, assault journalists, terrorize Tucker Carlson's wife, assault everyday people simply enjoying their right to assemble, and like the Southern Democrats of old, he's watched Antifa bully a black woman out of a restaurant.\\n\\nForget all that, though, and ask yourself on what planet does a decent person even attempt to defend a gang of thugs who dress all in black, wear masks, and brandish weapons?\\n\\nWell, that planet is called CNN.\\n\\nYou see, Antifa is okay with CNN because Antifa are their brownshirts, their terrorists, their violent gang of thugs taking it to we Trumptards who dare to point and laugh at CNN, who dare not recognize CNN's authority and wisdom.\\n\\nHere's some truth: CNN thrills over the petty ultra-violence Antifa unleashes against the political right. In the sick and sinister minds that run that Hate Network, Trump supporters got it coming, which is why — and this is important…\\n\\nCuomo and his far-left confederates regularly encourage these terrorists.\\n\\nThat's what's really going on here.\\n\\nCuomo's not just splitting the Hitler-and-the-autobahn hair to keep the debunked Charlottesville Hoax alive, he is using every opportunity to fire off a dogwhistle, to give his brownshirts a wink of encouragement and a nod of approval.\\n\\nCNN's association with, encouragement of, and affection for political violence has been well documented over the years, and as we get closer to the 2020 presidential election, it is only going to get worse… Much worse.\\n\\nAll Cuomo is doing here is prepping a battlefield CNN wants to see bloodied.\\n\\nP.S.

It will make five autonomous flights above the surface of Mars in 2021.\\n\\nThe miniature aircraft will spin its rotors at about ten times the speed of a terrestrial one, due to the extremely low density of Mars' atmosphere — only about one percent of Earth's. JPL Mars Helicopter Project Manager MiMi Aung explained that the altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet [12,000 meters], and when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet [30,000 m] up. Therefore, designers had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.\\n\\nIn an official statement posted to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration website, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said, NASA has a proud history of firsts. The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to Mars.\\n\\nTexas Representative John Culberson praised the effort. It's fitting that the United States of America is the first nation in history to fly the first heavier-than-air craft on another world, Culberson said. This exciting and visionary achievement will inspire young people all over the United States to become scientists and engineers, paving the way for even greater discoveries in the future.\\n\\nThe craft will launch onboard the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July 2020 and is expected to arrive on Mars in February 2021. Because of its immense distance — Earth will be several minutes away, traveling at the speed of light — Aung said that direct control will be impossible. Instead, the craft will have an autonomous capability that will be able to receive and interpret commands from the ground, and then fly the mission on its own.\\n\\nNASA Science Mission Directorate Associate Administrator Thomas Zurbuchen said that the project exemplifies a successful marriage of science and technology innovation and is a unique opportunity to advance Mars exploration for the future.\\n\\nAfter the Wright Brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained, and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, he said, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world."}

{"original": "Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the Vatican's former doctrinal czar, warned against Catholics who long for a meta-religion of world unity in a January 1 homily in Phoenix.\\n\\nSome Catholics want the Church to modernize, abandoning its doctrines for the sake of building a new religion of world unity, Müller warned thousands of Catholics gathered in Phoenix for the 2020 Student Leadership Summit hosted by the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS).\\n\\nIn order to be admitted to this meta-religion, the only price the Church would have to pay is giving up her truth claim, the cardinal told the students. No big deal, it seems, as the relativism dominant in our world anyway rejects the idea that we could actually know the truth and presents itself as guarantor of peace between all world views and world religions.\\n\\nThe post-Christian world welcomes these efforts to remake the Church as a convenient civil religion, Müller said.\\n\\nThe German cardinal tied his remarks to claims by the late Jesuit cardinal Carlo Maria Martini that the Church was 200 years behind the times and needed to modernize in order to catch up.\\n\\nFor some, the Catholic Church is lagging behind by 200 years compared to where the world is today. Is there any truth to this accusation? Müller asked the group.\\n\\nIt is surely no coincidence that Pope Francis had cited this same quotation in a positive sense just days before Christmas in an address to the Roman Curia, calling for epochal change while insisting that resistance to change always hides some mental disorder.\\n\\nThe Church has remained 200 years behind the times. Why has it not been shaken up? Are we scared? Fear instead of courage? Pope Francis cited Martini to the Curia, adding that these are words that should make us think.\\n\\nThere is always a temptation to fall back on the past, Francis continued in his Dec. 21 address, because it is more reassuring, known and, certainly less conflictual. Yet this too is part of the process and the risk of undertaking significant changes.\\n\\nIt would not be unreasonable to suggest that Cardinal Müller's homily Wednesday was in fact a response to the pope's call for modernization.\\n\\nAccording to Müller, the crisis facing the Catholic Church today has arisen from attempts to align with secular culture while abandoning the teachings of the faith in the process.\\n\\nThe crisis in the Church is man-made and has arisen because we have cozily adapted ourselves to the spirit of a life without God, the cardinal said.\\n\\nThe poison paralyzing the Church is the opinion that we should adapt to the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, and not the spirit of God, he said, that we should relativize God's commandments and reinterpret the doctrine of the revealed faith.\\n\\nSome people in the Church are longing for a Catholicism without dogmas, without sacraments, and without an infallible magisterium, Müller proposed.\\n\\nIn his homily, Müller told the students that the antidote to secularization within the Church is a life of faith, since people of faith do not crave the gratifications that the world offers.\\n\\nThe one who believes needs no ideology, he said. The one who hopes will not reach for drugs. The one who loves is not after the lust of this world, which passes along with the world. The one who loves God and his neighbor finds happiness in the sacrifice of self-giving.\\n\\nWe will be happy and free when in the spirit of love we embrace the form of life to which God has called each one of us personally: in the sacrament of marriage, in celibate priesthood, or in religious life according to the three evangelical counsels of poverty, obedience and chastity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, he said.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}
{"original": "For the first time in more than 130 years of record-keeping, young adults in the United States are more likely living with mom and dad than they are living with a spouse or partner.\\n\\nThirty-two percent of millennials adults aged 18-34 were living in their parents' home in 2014, compared to 31.6 percent of millennials who live with a spouse or significant other, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data.\\n\\nAnother 14 percent of millennials live alone, or else are single parents. Twenty-two percent live in other circumstances.\\n\\nThis turn of events is fueled primarily by the dramatic drop in the share of young Americans who are choosing to settle down romantically before age 35, Pew's analysis reads.\\n\\nDating back to 1880, the most common living arrangement among young adults has been living with a romantic partner, whether a spouse or a significant other, it continues. This type of arrangement peaked around 1960, when 62% of the nation's 18- to 34-year-olds were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, and only one-in-five were living with their parents.\\n\\nAs Pew reports, the trend is most prevalent among young men, with 35 percent of male millennials opting for the comforts of mom and dad's home, compared to 28 percent who were living with a spouse or partner in their own place.\\n\\nYoung women, on the other hand, are actually more likely to be living with a spouse (35 percent) than their parents (29 percent).\\n\\nMarriage and cohabitation have been on the decline since 1990, according to Pew, which projects that one-in-four millennials will never marry. In addition to the decline in marriage, Pew also cites the economy as a central fact causing the adults' retreat to mom and dad's house — simply put, fewer young men have decent jobs.\\n\\nThe share of young men with jobs peaked around 1960 at 84%. In 2014, only 71% of 18 to 34-year-old men were employed, Pew reports. Similarly with earnings, young men's wages (after adjusting for inflation) have been on a downward trajectory since 1970 and fell significantly from 2000 to 2010. As wages have fallen, the share of young men living in the home of their parent(s) has risen.\\n\\nThe phenomena also varies among racial and ethnic groups. Black (36 percent) and Hispanic (36 percent) young adults are more likely to live at home than are white (30 percent) young adults.\\n\\nWhite young adults are more likely to be living with a spouse or partner (36%), the report reads. But the trends are similar for all major racial and ethnic groups including whites: Since 1960, a greater share are living at home and fewer are married or [are] cohabiting and living in their own household."}

Many inside and outside the church had expected Paul to overturn traditional teaching on contraception, along with the majority of the members of a special commission Paul had set up to study the question.\\n\\nAs Paul himself noted:\\n\\nWithin the commission itself, there was not complete agreement concerning the moral norms to be proposed, and … certain approaches and criteria for a solution to this question had emerged which were at variance with the moral doctrine on marriage constantly taught by the magisterium of the Church.\\n\\nPope Francis has significantly chosen the year 2018—the fiftieth anniversary of Humanae Vitae—for the canonization of Pope Paul VI. Francis has often voiced his personal esteem for Paul VI and has held up Humanae Vitae as a critically important document for today's world.\\n\\nIn his 2016 letter, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), Francis cited Humanae Vitae four times, praising the way that Paul had brought out the intrinsic bond between conjugal love and the generation of life.\\n\\nThe teaching of the Encyclical Humanae Vitae ought to be taken up anew, Francis wrote, in order to counter a mentality that is often hostile to life.\\n\\nPope John Paul II spent the first five years of his 27-year papacy explaining the theology underlying Humanae Vitae in a series of weekly addresses in what he described as a theology of the body. As Michael Waldstein has written, One of the main goals of the theology of the body is the defense of Paul VI's prophetic encyclical Humanae Vitae.\\n\\nTen years ago, in a conference commemorating Humanae Vitae's 40th anniversary, Pope Benedict XVI referred to the encyclical as crucial for humanity's future, declaring that it constituted on the part of Paul VI a significant show of courage in reasserting the continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition.\\n\\nVatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin reportedly said Tuesday that the canonization ceremony of Paul VI and Oscar Romero will take place in late October following a meeting of the Synod of Bishops.\\n\\nPope Francis beatified Paul VI in 2014 after a first miracle was attributed to his intercession.

It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.\\n\\nNot a very convincing performance. Is there any other Amendment to the Constitution the president would downplay in this way? Saying, It's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th Amendment.\\n\\nIf the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. President Obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.\\n\\n1.) Here's the president swearing repeatedly, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\\n\\nAs it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. In November 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. As you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.\\n\\nA month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. It was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.\\n\\n2.) It wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about Obamacare. He also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.\\n\\nUnfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.\\n\\n3.) Before he became president, Obama told Pastor Rick Warren, I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJhQBZ1La0w\\n\\nHard to be more clear than that. Obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. And then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. Finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. But had he really? According to chief strategist David Axelrod, Obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:\\n\\nAxelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.\\n\\nObama reportedly told Axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, I'm just not very good at bullshitting. Based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd Amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it."}

He then turned it over to the Archbishop of Indianapolis, the superintendent and Chuck Weisenbach [Roncalli school principal].\\n\\nThe report continues that Fitzgerald, who had been employed at the school for 15 years, says she met with the school's administrator and principal and was given the options of resigning, dissolving her marriage, or wait it out and stay quiet and maybe I can make it the rest of the year, but they will not renew my contract next year.\\n\\nI love my wife very much, Fitzgerald said. I didn't have any intention to resign a job that I adore. For me to walk out was like saying I didn't want to be there anymore and that wasn't the case.\\n\\nIndiana state Rep. Dan Forestal, a Democrat, said he will intervene in the case by trying to block schools whose religious beliefs oppose same-sex marriage from receiving taxpayer voucher funds.\\n\\nAccording to the report:\\n\\nRoncalli is a private school but they also receive state funding through Indiana's School Choice Voucher program. An annual report from the Indiana Department of Education shows that the school received more than $1.5 million in taxpayer dollars last year.\\n\\nRoncalli should not be rewarded with state dollars if they choose to discriminate against employees simply based on who they love, Forestal said.\\n\\nAs Fox59 reported, Fitzgerald has hired an attorney, David Page, who refused to give details about his client's signed contract due to the possibility of future litigation.\\n\\nIn a statement, the Catholic school has said as role models for students, the personal conduct of every teacher, guidance counselor, administrator and staff member, both at school and away from school, must convey and be supportive of the teachings of the Catholic Church, the report continued.\\n\\nPage said his client was barred from the campus and her school email account.\\n\\n[S]he was heartbroken and stunned, Page said. Stunned is the word she uses most often.\\n\\nThe attorney added that everyone at the school knew she was gay.\\n\\nFitzgerald has received an outpouring of support via an online petition signed by over 15,000 supporters.\\n\\nThe petition states:\\n\\nAfter a nosey member of the community found out Shelly Fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. Not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. For 15 years, Shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School (RHS), a Catholic High School in Indiana. And when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. They gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. Shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. And she plans to hire a lawyer. But should she have to? The school says they have every right to force Shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the Catholic Church both in and out of school. That includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.\\n\\nOne Roncalli board member, Daniel Parker, resigned from his post in support of Fitzgerald because she has been his child's guidance counselor.\\n\\nClearly, we are doing something right when our young students and graduates understand better than some older adults that love is love, commitment is commitment, and marriage is marriage no matter who opens their heart to those wonderful gifts from God, Parker said.\\n\\nRoncalli High School is named for Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, who became Pope John XXIII and, since his canonization, is now referred to as Saint John XXIII."}

The existence of matchmaking sites like secondwife.com and the prevalence of unregistered marriage is particularly concerning.\\n\\nHer report said that there were approximately 100,000 Sharia marriages, many of which are not recognised by UK law and therefore do not offer the same legal protections to women in cases of divorce. A sizeable proportion of these 'marriages' are thought to be polygynous (specifically where a man has multiple wives).\\n\\nBaroness Cox, a cross-bench member of the House of Lords, said in October that polygamy is commonplace within Muslim communities in Britain, with husbands fathering as many as 20 children by four wives.\\n\\nShe explained: Under sharia law, a husband is entitled to up to four wives providing he takes responsibility for making appropriate provision for all. In many Muslim communities in this country, polygamy is commonplace although as a nation bigamy is legally forbidden.\\n\\nWitnesses to the Commons Home Affairs Committee, as part of the broader inquiry into Sharia councils, have warned that the number of polygynous marriages is on the rise.\\n\\nThey point out that whilst polygamy is illegal, there is no requirement for a civil, legal, ceremony to precede a Sharia marriage. This means that imams are under no obligation to refuse to perform a marriage because the man is already married.\\n\\nAina Khan, a leading family lawyer specialising in Islamic marriages, said that the Marriage Act was out of date.\\n\\nIt dates back to 1949 and only Anglicans, Jews and Quakers must register their religious ceremony with the register office . . . Now nearly three million Muslims, with origins from many countries, live here.\\n\\nNoting that having more than one wife was an outward sign of religiosity, Ms. Khan said that of the couples who came to her seeking to separate, a quarter involved polygynous issues.\\n\\nIt is not a recipe for a happy marriage.

[Economist Raj] Chetty attributed most of this erosion to slower GDP growth and a change in the distribution of GDP favoring higher earners: GDP would have to rise by 6% a year to get the same impact, he said, and wealth would have to be distributed much more evenly.\\n\\nMillennial women are individually better off than their mothers — but the women's husbands are the millennial men.\\n\\nMissing from Axios, however, is any mention of the causes, such as the federal government's immigration policy of importing one new worker for every four Americans who graduate school or college each year.\\n\\nThis massive 25 percent inflation of the labor supply is widely ignored by economists who struggle to understand why young men earn so much less than their parents. The new-labor inflation is made worse by the government's policy of importing temporary workers for good jobs in the expanding professional sectors. Roughly 1.5 million foreign guest-workers now hold jobs in healthcare, technology, academia and other sectors, even as young American college graduates struggle to pay off debts.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump's Hire American campaign would modestly curb the inflow of immigrants and foreign workers, but it is strongly opposed by progressives, Democrats and business-first Republicans.\\n\\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market — but the government provides green cards to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and temporary work-permits to roughly 3 million foreign workers.\\n\\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with foreign labor. That process spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. The policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions."}
{"original": "A new study shows there's much more depression, obesity and suicidal tendencies among adults raised by same-sex couples than among adults raised by a normal family of complementary male and female parents.\\n\\nAccording to the study, which tracks the development of children to adulthood, 51 percent of those raised by same-sex couples had experienced depression, compared to only 19.7 percent of those raised in normal married households.\\n\\nBy age 28 a cohort of children raised by same-sex parents are 2.25 times more likely to experience depression than is the general population. Adult onset depression is associated with a more frequent history of abuse victimization, obesity, stigma, and distance from one or both parents.\\n\\nThirty percent of adults from gay households fanaticized about suicide as an adult, compared to 7 percent from normal households. A whopping 71.9 percent of adults raised in gay homes reported obesity, compared to 37 percent from opposite-sex homes.\\n\\nThe study shows more kids raised by gays reported that a parent or caregiver had slapped, hit, or kicked them. More of them said they were touched in a sexual way or forced to touch someone in a sexual way or were forced into sex relations.\\n\\nThe study flies in the face of recent claims by gay advocates that there is no difference between being raised by gays or by straights.\\n\\nThe study used data from the non-partisan National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and was produced by Professor Paul Sullins of the Leo Initiative. He's worked with the Department of Sociology at the Catholic University of America for many years.\\n\\nThe major limitation of of the study is that the database contained information on kids raised by only twenty same-sex couples. But there are very few children raised by gays at all, let alone over a long period. Even so, as sociologist Mark Regnerus says of this study, This makes the same-sex household estimates displayed in the graph imprecise, but it does nothing to undermine the significance of the differences between groups.\\n\\nThe study has already come under attack from gay blogs that tend to pounce on any negative data.\\n\\nAt the urging of gay bloggers, in 2012, Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin was investigated by his university and attempts were made to bring him up on charges and get him fired for reaching much the same conclusions as Sullins has reached. Though the University of Texas backed him up and the journal that published his paper has not withdrawn it, he still comes under bitter criticism from gay advocates.\\n\\nThinkProgress has tried to smear Sullins for his religious faith and his priesthood. The author, Zack Ford, a columnist and not an expert in sociological research, called the study hugely flawed and ran a picture of Sullins in his priestly garb. He also complained that the study was carried out on children raised by gays prior to the legalization of gay marriage, proposing that marriage will make all the difference in outcomes for kids.\\n\\nEven liberal advocates admit that children do best when raised by their own mom and dad. Secular sociologist Sara McLanahan of Princeton University and other secular experts have reported for decades that children do best within normal families."}

{"original": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened the program by reacting to Sen-elect Mitt Romney's (R-UT) public critique of President Donald Trump.\\n\\nCarlson reminded viewers of Romney's path to prosperity at Bain Capital and how his exploitation of the finance-based economy had implications on real Americans. Carlson said it was indicative of the broader problem of how the ruling class is harming the country overall, which led to the election of Trump.\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nGood evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\\n\\nRomney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\\n\\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\\n\\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\\n\\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?\\n\\nThese are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\\n\\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\\n\\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\\n\\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\\n\\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\\n\\nThere was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.\\n\\nTwo different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\\n\\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\\n\\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\\n\\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.\\n\\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\\n\\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.\\n\\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\\n\\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\\n\\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\\n\\nInternalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\\n\\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first."}

Please forgive me for those I've hurt. But in an Instagram post, he simply stated:\\n\\nI rather obey the Lord's command than obeying the desires of the flesh. Im not condemning anyone, but I'm just telling the truth of what the Bible says.

Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men. God Bless everyone i love you all.\\n\\nIn 2012, the Los Angeles shopping center The Grove banned Pacquiao from its grounds after an interview in The National Examiner wrongly attributed remarks to Pacquiao. The 57-6-2 fighter later told The Los Angeles Times, What I said is a reporter asked me about gay marriage … I am against gay marriage, but I'm not condemning gays. I have family — a cousin — who's gay, and friends too. I'm just against gay marriage.

For the last two years global temperatures have dropped and this year, so far, has certainly been a cool one.\\n\\nUnemployment has reached record lows. Wages are rising. Manufacturing jobs are coming back. Inflation is almost non-existent…\\n\\nThis, my friends, is what peace and prosperity look and feel like. This is it. Take it from a middle-aged guy who lived through Watergate, Vietnam, the Carter years, 9/11, Iraq, and Barry Obama's managed decline — this is as good as America gets.\\n\\nBut with a Republican in office, most especially a Republican named Donald Trump, the media are desperate to distract us from this inconvenient good news, and so they are manufacturing a fabricated reality where Mississippi is still burning, white supremacism is on the march, the Chinese are about to Red Dawn our economy, everyone's going to be shot at school, democracy itself teeters on the brink, and women are about to be forced back into the kitchen.\\n\\nHere's a quick round up of the latest nonsense our corrupt media are hoaxing the country with.\\n\\nTrump's Tariff War with China Is Going to Kill the Economy\\n\\nThis, to me, is the dumbest crisis of them all. To begin with, none of the tariffs Trump has so far raised have had any effect on consumer prices or economic growth. In fact, in almost every area, our economy is doing much better than our lousy experts predicted last year.\\n\\nHow many times can the media turn a single day stock market drop into a financial crisis before we all roll our eyes and turn the channel?\\n\\nI find this hysteria tedious.\\n\\nGlobal Warming Will Kill You\\n\\nI guess it's a good thing Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy is backing off her claim we will all die in 12 years, but she's still assuring us Global Warming is a real threat that will kill us, but you'll have to pardon me if I don't take my climate advice from a 29-year-old who freaks out over her first look at a garbage disposal.\\n\\nIt's May 15, I live in the South, and when I woke up this morning it was 36 degrees. There was even a little frost on the ground.\\n\\nThe planet appears to be doing just fine, much better than the eternally neurotic Ocasio-Crazy.\\n\\nSchool Shooting Epidemic\\n\\nTo gin up this lie, media outlets, most especially CNN, are spreading provably false statistics — lies easily debunked by anyone who can Google.\\n\\nThe truth is that when it comes to these terrible shootings, our schools are much safer than they were 20 years ago.\\n\\nTrump's 'Constitutional Crisis'\\n\\nIn a woefully transparent act of collusion between Democrats and the establishment media, the media repeated the phrase constitutional crisis 386 times between May 8 and 12.\\n\\nA perfect example courtesy of NewsBusters: On Friday, CNN's Erin Burnett asked indignantly: If this is a constitutional crisis, how can Democrats not move forward with impeachment hearings?\\n\\nMuch of this hysteria is based on the Trump administration fighting congress over document requests and all those subpoenas being issued so that sore loser Democrats can come up with a Russia Collusion Hoax do-over — you know, because Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his gang of partisan Democrats spending three years and $35 million to locate a dry collusion/obstruction hole means nothing.\\n\\nThe executive branch has been fighting the legislative branch over this stuff since the creation of our government and nothing is a constitutional crisis until the executive branch defies a Supreme Court order, or the equivalent of one, to cooperate with congress. .\\n\\nSorry, that's just a fact.\\n\\nWe cannot be in a constitutional crisis when the executive branch is 1) complying with court orders and 2) using constitutional means to tell congress to shove it.\\n\\nActually, this is the opposite of a constitutional crisis; this is the constitution at its best: the war is political and legal as opposed to physical.\\n\\nGod bless America.\\n\\nWhite Supremacism Epidemic\\n\\nHand-picked experts are telling the conspiracy theorists at CNN that white supremacism is on the rise and a contagion and must be labeled as terrorism so it can be treated like ISIS.\\n\\nYeah, there's a good idea: treat our own citizens like foreign terrorists.\\n\\nFirst off, the so-called boost in hate crimes is a hoax based solely on the fact that more agencies have been added to those reporting hate crimes.\\n\\nSecondly, if white supremacism was a real problem in America, CNN and the rest of the media would not be forced to manufacture one hate crime after another: Remember Hands Up, Don't Shoot; George Zimmerman the White Hispanic; the KKKids from KKKovington High School; Jussie Smollett? All hoaxes.\\n\\nIn fact, most hate crimes end up being debunked as hoaxes.\\n\\nRiddle me this: How much white supremacism can there be in America when the long-dead Kate Smith has to be disinterred for a Two Minute Hate? Good grief, there is so little racism in America, we are forced to dig up corpses just so we can have something to virtual signal at. And even then, the racism charge is still a hoax. Kate Smith was no racist.\\n\\nI've lived in the south for nearly 20 years and my interracial marriage has never brought my wife and I so much as a double take.\\n\\nThe Return of Back Alley Abortions\\n\\nThank God states like Alabama are aggressively looking to put an end to the holocaust of abortion. Regardless, the worst case scenario for the pro-infanticide crowd is that the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, and as unlikely as that is to happen, it would still not outlaw the killing of the unborn for convenience purposes.\\n\\nOverturning Roe v. Wade means the states get to decide on the legality of abortion, which means it will always be legal somewhere. With all the government money they receive, I'm sure Planned Parenthood will be able to offer a free bus pass with every child murder.\\n\\nTo be fair, though, Alyssa Milano's sex strike, her refusal to have sex with anyone until she gets her way on abortion would have been a legitimate crisis … in 1998.\\n\\nFox News Is the Devil\\n\\nIn an ocean of leftist news outlets Fox News is a lonely buoy that offers some right-of-center opinion. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) (aka Indian Princess Lies-Like-a-Rug) is only the latest example of the hate poured all over Fox, but according to CNN and other media outlets, Fox is a disease helping to spread all six of the phony crises listed above.\\n\\nThis is how intolerant the left and media are — they don't even want one buoy in their ocean of lies.\\n\\n—\\n\\nSeriously, y'all, it's all a hoax, it's all fake news, and summer is on the horizon. So unless you live in a city like Baltimore, Chicago, or San Francisco — a city exclusively run by Democrats for the last 50 or so years that is now filled with poverty, the homeless, and poop; take a vacation from the media, take a breath, take a step outside, and take a long look around… Life is good in Trump's America, about as good as it gets… And all of this hysterical BS, this crises propaganda, these lies, are all being manufactured to take our eye off that fact.\\n\\nThe media cannot defeat Trump in 2020 based on the mostly positive results of his policies; they cannot argue against the first era of peace and prosperity we've enjoyed in almost two decades, so they're trying to stress us out with these absurd hoaxes even though the planet is cooling, eggs are 98 cents a dozen, and our guys are not dying in futile overseas wars.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "An offshoot of the Chinese Communist Youth League published a video featuring Chinese celebrities promoting the nation's totalitarian social credit system to young people, urging them to give thumbs up to integrity, Australia's ABC News reported on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe music video, titled, Live Up to Your Word, features a variety of Chinese actors and musicians who cater to young audiences, including 24-year-old actor Xu Weizhou, popular boy band member Wang Yuan, and romantic comedy star Wei Daxun.\\n\\nBeginning with a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of early 2000s American punk-pop, the video features its stars in various public settings encouraging the listener to participate in communist society as the Party decrees, whether at school, in the workplace, or playing sports. The stars lead business meetings, study in libraries, and grocery shop, the implicit message of the video being that only by obeying the Party can a young person have access to the necessary resources to participate in society.\\n\\nAccording to ABC News' translation, the lyrics urge the viewer to be a trustworthy youth.\\n\\nLet's give the thumbs up to integrity, and unite in building Credit China together, the video suggests. Live every day carefully.\\n\\nAlthough the lyrics don't specifically mention the Social Credit System (SCS), actors and singers are seen demonstrating how to be a trustworthy citizen in a range of scenarios such as shopping at an unmanned store, renting a shared bike, reading at a public library, and finalising a business deal, the ABC report notes.\\n\\nThe video is reportedly a production of China Youth Credit Action, a campaign to promote the social credit system supervised by the Communist Youth League. The Youth League is responsible for recruiting young communists, ensuring that young people do not deviate away from communist values, and controlling nearly every aspect of the lives of its members. The group has worked to promote banning participation in Western festivities such as Christmas, and launched a dating service in 2017 to promote marriage and reproduction among communists (and, presumably, to keep communists from falling in love with unauthorized persons who may hold alternative points of view).\\n\\nThe social credit system is an all-encompassing control method in which the government assigned a numerical value to the credit of a person to society. The number is based on both loyalty to the Party and general courtesy in public – both political dissidence and general misbehavior, such as littering or jaywalking, could hurt a person's score. The consequences of a low score make it harder for a person to participate in society by limiting access to flights, trains, and public transportation or depriving people of access to government services.\\n\\nThe system will not fully go into place until 2020, so the government has begun publishing promotional material for it now. It is currently partially operational, however, and blocked Chinese citizens from buying 23 million airplane and train tickets as of March 2019.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper reported that the Communist Party is considering adding unpaid parking tickets to the metric that determines a person's credit score. The article discusses traditional financial credit scores but states that the People's Bank of China (PBC) is working to integrate its credit system into a government-controlled personal credit score. It quotes a Chinese professor promoting the use of all human behavior to determine a financial credit score.\\n\\nDong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday that it is important to establish a comprehensive credit system, rather than a one-sided database that only focuses on financial activities, in order to regulate social behavior, the newspaper reports, noting that Dong believes this system is not possible without having strict privacy protection in place so that only the repressive Communist Party has access to the information.\\n\\nThe Global Times also ran a column Wednesday by a senior PBC official urging the establishment of a credit score for local governments, so that the national Communist Party can keep them under tight control.\\n\\nGovernment credibility is an important part of establishing a social credit system, which should supervise government activities and debt risks, the article argued.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}
