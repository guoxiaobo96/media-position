NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Former Attorney General Kathleen Kane was sentenced Monday to 10 to 23 months in jail for illegally disclosing details from a grand jury investigation to embarrass a rival and lying about it under oath.\n\nKane was also sentenced to eight years of probation by a Montgomery County judge who said Kane's ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law.\n\nJudge Wendy Demchick-Alloy said Kane assumed an off with your heads mentality as she ran the state's top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political neophyte who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office.\n\nThis case is about ego – the ego of a politician consumed with her image from Day One, Demchick-Alloy said. This case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant … felt had embarrassed her in the press.\n\nKane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was handcuffed in court and led out a side door. She will remain in custody until she posts $75,000 cash bail, higher than she had previously posted.\n\nAfter she posts bond, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction.\n\nShe had been a stay-at-home mother, and former assistant county prosecutor, before using her husband's trucking fortune to run for statewide office in 2012. She quickly became a rising star in the state Democratic Party before her office devolved into turmoil as career prosecutors came and went.\n\nKane and her husband are now estranged and share custody of their teenage boys.\n\nYour children are the ultimate … collateral damages. They are casualties of your actions, the judge said. But you did that, not this court. \n\nEarlier Monday, Kane's 15-year-old son, Chris, pleaded for leniency while her former deputies described an office demoralized by her leadership and terrorized by Nixonian espionage.\n\nKane, 50, had argued that the loss of her career, law license and reputation was punishment enough. She had asked the judge to sentence her to probation or house arrest so she could be home to raise her sons.\n\nI really don't care what happens to me, Kane said during before leaning toward the defense table to grab tissues. There is no more torture in the world than to watch your children suffer and know you had something to do with it.\n\nThe one-term attorney general said her younger son, 14-year-old Zachary, did not attend Monday's sentencing because he couldn't even bear it.\n\nKane's family declined to comment after the sentencing.\n\nProsecutors called her crimes egregious and pushed for jail time. They said a paranoid Kane ruined morale in the 800-person office and the wider law enforcement community through a calculated scheme to embarrass rival prosecutors who had left the office.\n\nKane didn't testify at her trial. She was convicted in August of two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges, and she resigned the next day.\n\nOn Monday, former deputy Clarke Madden said in court that a dark cloud permeated every corner of the attorney general's office and victims, witnesses and other law enforcement agencies feared working with them.\n\nThrough a pattern of systemic firings and Nixonian espionage, she created a terror zone in this office, said Erik Olsen, a career prosecutor who is now the chief deputy attorney general.\n\nKane enjoyed mostly good press early on as she supported gay marriage, ramped up a child predator unit run by her twin sister and questioned her predecessor's handling of the Penn State sex assault case.\n\nBut turmoil inside the office became apparent as top deputies and career prosecutors headed for the doors. Kane's feud with one of them, Frank Fina, who had helped run the Penn State probe and other sensitive investigations, led to the leak.\n\nKane, taking aim at him, had a campaign consultant pass confidential files to a reporter about a corruption case Fina had declined to charge before he left the office. She then tried to frame someone else for the leak, aides testified at the perjury and obstruction trial.\n\nAside from the conviction, Kane's political career will be remembered for her investigation of pornography that she said was being traded on state computers by judges, lawyers and other public employees. Two state Supreme Court justices resigned amid the fallout.
President Donald Trump announced late Tuesday night that he had pardoned and commuted the sentences of 143 people in the final hours of his presidency.\n\nThe president issued 73 pardons and 70 commutations.\n\nThe list included pop culture figures including rapper Lil Wayne, who was pardoned, and Kodak Black, whose sentence was commuted.\n\nThe president also pardoned several Republicans, including former Deputy National Finance Chair of the Republican National Committee Elliott Broidy, former Rep. Duke Cunningham of California, and former Rep. Rick Renzi of Arizona.\n\nHe also issued a pardon for his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was charged with fraud for his work on the We Build the Wall crowdfunding campaign fueled by Trump supporters to build a wall on the Southern border.\n\nTrump also commuted the sentence of wealthy Democrat donor Dr. Salomon Melgen, who was convicted on 67 felony counts of Medicaid fraud in April 2017. The White House cited support for the pardon by Sen. Bob Menendez and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. Melgen was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2018.\n\nThe president also commuted the sentence of former Mayor of Detroit Kwame Malik Kilpatrick, a Democrat, citing strong support by members of the Detroit Community as well as Alveda King, Alice Johnson, and Diamond and Silk. Kilpatrick served seven years of a 28-year sentence for his role in a major corruption scandal, convicted of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud, and other charges.\n\nTrump also issued a full pardon to former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, sentenced to 18 months in prison in August 2020 for stealing a trade secret from Google related to self-driving cars before changing jobs to work at Uber.\n\nThe president also commuted the prison sentence of William Walters, a professional gambler who was convicted in 2017 for insider trading and sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nTrump's list also included many nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to prison.\n\nThe long-awaited final list of pardons and commutations in Trump's presidency was released early Wednesday morning just hours before he planned to leave the White House to his post-presidency home in Florida.\n\nThe president did not pardon Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, two whistleblowers who illegally shared America's intelligence and national security secrets. The two individuals enjoyed bipartisan support for a pardon as their supporters had hoped that the president would ignore the intelligence community elites and prominent members of Congress in Washington who were deeply opposed to a pardon.\n\nTrump also did not issue preemptive pardons for himself, members of his family, or even some of his staff for future crimes if they face persecution as a result of their connection to the Trump administration. He also did not issue a preemptive pardon for his personal lawyer and ally former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nRead the full list below:\n\nTodd Boulanger – President Trump granted a full pardon to Todd Boulanger.

Notably, there was no evidence that any of the individuals were motivated by greed. And in fact, the sentencing judge called the likelihood that there was any personal financial motivation infinitesimal. The judge imposed a range of sentences from probation to 3 years' imprisonment, reflecting the conduct as an aberration from these individuals' otherwise law-abiding lives. Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay are described as devoted to their family and their communities, and have weathered their convictions without complaint.\n\nDavid Rowland – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Rowland.

A group supportive of Russian president Vladimir Putin have announced their intention to hold a Gays for Putin rally ahead of March's presidential election, despite the country's stringent laws on homosexuality.\n\nThe Moscow Times reports that the group, which calls itself Gays for Putin!' has asked authorities in St. Petersburg for permission to hold a rally with around 600 supporters.\n\nWe decided to express the impetus of the gay community by openly supporting Vladimir Putin as a presidential candidate, the group, led by organizers Vyacheslav Vereshchagin and Alexei Nazarov, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThey continued:\n\nPeople often say that activists are cut off from the people. In Russia, there are millions of homosexuals, and almost none of them participate in [anti-Putin] demonstrations. Therefore, homosexuals support President Putin's towards LGBT people. Putin signs laws that serve the strengthen the moral and spiritual foundations of Russian society. Notable homosexuals are awarded with orders and medals. Many gay people in our country say, Putin is our President. Gays are for Putin!\n\nAfter submitting their request to local authorities, the group reportedly congregated at a local church service to pray for the success of the good endeavor.\n\nPlans for the rally come days after a homophobic campaign video supporting Putin appeared on social media, warning that his opponents will take the country into a nightmare future where people are forced to cohabitate with gays and lesbians.\n\nThe video, which has already attracted over three million views on Facebook alone, shows the thoughts of a middle-aged man imagining a Russia without Putin, where a man can be seen in his kitchen and suggestively eating a banana and filing his nails.\n\nThe advert is intended as a contrast to Putin's opponent Ksenia Sobchak, who has called for the legalization of same-sex marriage and seeks to move the country in a less socially conservative direction.\n\nPresenting LGBT people as a threat in a homophobic country is no joke, she wrote in an Instagram post, while also condemning the video as vile.\n\nSobchak has faced widespread claims that she is actually part of a controlled opposition designed to give the impression that the election will be free and fair.\n\nOther opposition leaders, such as anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, claim that the election will be rigged in Putin's favor after being barred from running, meaning that he is extremely likely to win another six-year term.\n\nSince returning to the presidency in 2012, Putin has backed laws restricting the rights of LGBT people, which include a ban on loosely-defined homosexual propaganda in a bid to uphold Russia's traditional conservative values.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
The loose confederation of churches affiliated with the worldwide Anglican communion is experiencing growing tensions over the issue of homosexuality, with the U.S. Episcopalian church tugging toward the liberal embrace of all things LGBT and the African churches struggling to maintain a more Biblically based sexual morality.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Nigeria has announced it will boycott the next international meeting of Church leaders over the matter, and is now requesting special status in the worldwide church to allow it to faithfully preserve its position on homosexuality.\n\nIn a forceful statement, the Nigerian Anglican primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, said that the Anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.\n\nTraditional Anglicans like the Nigerian Church, he said, are walking into a well-rehearsed scheme to gradually apply persuasion, subtle blackmail, coercion on any group still standing with the Scriptural Provision as we know it, to join the straight jacket of the revisionists and be politically correct.\n\nArchbishop Okoh said his province will shun next month's Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Lusaka, Zambia over the way the worldwide church has handled the wayward Episcopal Church in America, which he described as a toxic relationship.\n\nAt a meeting of Anglican Primates in January of this year, it was decided that for a period of three years The Episcopal Church (TEC) should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or policy. The measure was intended as a sanction over TEC's approval of gay marriage and consecration of openly gay bishops.\n\nThose sanctions proved to be hollow, Okoh said, and disapproval shifted toward those still embracing traditional beliefs regarding sexuality. Okoh said that during the Canterbury meeting, those who hold the orthodox view of human sexuality and marriage were denounced as 'homophobic,' underscoring that we were in the wrong place, he said.\n\nOkoh's impression was that the Anglican authorities thought they were exercising patience in order to gradually persuade the scripture-believers to embrace homosexual doctrine, something he says they will never do.\n\nIn his statement, Okoh reminds readers that Nigeria was one of the provinces that protested against the consecration of the gay American bishop Gene Robinson, that boycotted the 2008 Lambeth Conference and helped set up the conservative Global Anglican Future Conference in Jerusalem that same year.\n\nAs a result, Okoh has requested special status for the Provinces who will never embrace the sexual culture being promoted by some Provinces of the Church over and against the Bible.\n\nHe compared the idea of special status to the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, where total union is impossible, but some degree of cooperation is deemed useful.\n\nThe Anglican church claims some 85 million members worldwide and is divided into 38 provinces. Only eight of these are favorable to changing doctrine on marriage to allow for same-sex unions, namely, the U.S., Canada, Scotland, Wales, New Zealand, South India, South Africa and Brazil.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

She goes by the name Sa'a because — even three years after jumping from a moving truck to escape the Boko Haram terrorists that had kidnapped her and 275 other mostly Christian schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria — she fears for her safety and that of the rest of her family.\n\nMy message to everyone is that it's been three years now, Sa'a told Breitbart News three years to the day of her abduction.\n\nNot three days, or three months, but three years, Sa'a, who now lives in the United States, said at an event at the Newseum's Religious Freedom Center in Washington D.C. to mark the anniversary of the event. Every individual that has power to do something that would bring those girls back should just do something.\n\nSince that fateful day, 57 girls, including Sa'a, escaped from the radical Islamic terrorists. Last October, the Nigerian government worked out a deal with Boko Haram to return 21 more of the girls, many of whom has been raped, some returning with children in tow.\n\nThat leaves 195 girls who are still missing.\n\nIt is fitting that this happened on Good Friday, said Emmanuel Ogebe, a Nigerian human rights attorney based in Washington D.C. who has sponsored 15 young women survivors from Nigeria, including Sa'a, to come and study in the United States.\n\nWhen Jesus died the sun hid its face in shame because of what happened, Ogebe said. Now the world should hide its face in shame because it has forgotten the 195 girls that are still missing.\n\nOgebe, who has traveled to Nigeria on many occasions to help survivors and to lobby the Nigerian government to do more to secure the release of the remaining victims, said he knows that some of the girls have died. One girl, he said, was stoned to death when she refused to convert to Islam.\n\nThis is way beyond just hashtags, Ogebe said of the social media #bringbackourgirls movement that happened after one of the largest mass abductions in modern history.\n\nThere are practical things that can be done, Ogebe said, adding that keeping the story in the public consciousness is one of those things.\n\nAnd, Ogebe said, Boko Haram continues to abduct Nigerian girls and uses them for the unspeakable practice of suicide bombing.\n\nThis week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) confirmed that fact.\n\nUNICEF emphasized Wednesday that beyond the high-profile Chibok abductions, the practice of kidnapping children and forcing them to associate with the armed group has been prevalent, the Associated Press reported.\n\nYoung girls are spotted in the markets, and nighttime raids drag them from their beds, UNICEF reported. In some cases, parents are killed in front of the girls during the process.\n\nThis is typically followed by an extended journey to a Boko Haram base in the forest where the girls are forced into early marriage and sexual slavery, UNICEF reported.\n\nOgebe said that the Nigerian government is not transparent about its dealings with Boko Haram or about the girls who were released in October. All remain in the custody of the government and have not been reunited with their families.\n\nWe don't think the Nigerian government is doing anything much about rescuing the girls, Seshugh Akume of the Bring Back Our Girls organization, told USA Today on Thursday. We are disappointed.\n\nThe general attitude is they wish everybody to keep quiet about it and move on because they get angry whenever the missing Chibok girls are mentioned, Akume said.\n\nBut Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari marked the anniversary by calling it one of the worst crimes committed against his country.\n\nI wish to reassure the parents of the Chibok girls, all well-meaning Nigerians, organizations and the international community, that as a government, we are unrelenting on the issue of the safe return of our children, said Buhari, who campaigned for office by promising to recover the victims.\n\nIf I stop telling my story people will forget my classmates, Sa'a said.
Nearly 1,200 forced marriage cases were logged by the government's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) last year, new data shows, with the body saying the number may not reflect the full scale of the abuse.\n\nOf the 1,196 cases flagged 2017, more than one in four victims were younger than 18-years-old, and one in five were males, the FMU said in a report.\n\nThe document reveals that that, since 2012, the unit has logged between 1,200 and 1,400 cases each year, involving more than 90 foreign countries. In 2016, the FMU recorded over 1,400 victims, up from 1,200 in 2015, as reported by Breitbart London.\n\nA massive 439 of the marriages in 2017 either took place or were due to take place in Pakistan, followed by Bangladesh with 129 reports, and 91 in Somalia. The list continues with India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Romania, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nDespite the vast majority forced marriages taking part in Islamic states or predominantly Muslim countries, the report does not provide a breakdown of reported cases to the FMU by religion, claiming that, no major faith in the UK advocates forced marriage.\n\nIn 2017, there were 355 cases involved victims under 18-years-old, 353 victims aged between 18 and 25, and 186 cases when the victim involved was just 15 or younger.\n\nBombshell: UK Govt Review into Sharia Admits Systemic Discrimination Against Women, Unknown Number of 'Councils', Forced Marriage Victim Made to Appear with Abusers https://t.co/2D4ljDKNbn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2018\n\nIn a statement, the FMU told the Guardian: Forced marriage is a hidden crime, and these figures may not reflect the full scale of the abuse.\n\nA spokesman for the children's charity the NSPCC told the paper the figures corroborate reports to their phone help service Childline, which revealed levels of force marriage had hit record levels in August last year.\n\nThe said that children as young as 13 [are] contacting us worried about being forced into marriage yet fearing they will be cut out of their community if they refuse.\n\nThe charity also said the practice was a form of abuse and explained the true scale of the problem was hard to grasp because of a culture of secrecy, shame, and threats.\n\nThe worry and fears children face in this situation can also lead them to self-harm, to run away from home putting them at risk of further abuse, or even to contemplate taking their own lives, the spokesman added.
The once wholesome Miley Cyrus has partnered with feminist artist Marilyn Minter to raise funds for Planned Parenthood, the abortion business announced Thursday in New York.\n\nMinter photographed Cyrus, now 23, as if she was behind a steamy shower door. Only 50 of the limited edition prints are being sold at Artsy for $5,500 each, with 100 percent of the proceeds supporting Planned Parenthood. For those with a smaller piggy bank, Marc Jacobs will sell t-shirts featuring other more sexually provocative images from Minter's session with Cyrus, including Miley Hearts Planned Parenthood, and Pro Choice Miley. The cost of the t-shirts is $60 each and will be available at Marc Jacobs shops on May 16.\n\nSoon 2 be Unveiled pic.twitter.com/pvr70lJPnQ — Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) April 13, 2016\n\nAs Artsy reports, Minter – now in her 60s – has been known for her depictions of women in the throes of sexual pleasure or adorned with dirt and diamonds since the 1970s. A supporter of both the LGBT agenda and abortion rights, she joined forces with Planned Parenthood last year for its most lucrative benefit auction, which raised $2.3 million for the abortion business from the sale of works by various artists.\n\nAs Artnet reports, Minter earned Planned Parenthood's Woman of Valor award.\n\nThis is a really vital time, I think, the artist said during her acceptance speech. I want Planned Parenthood to start coming out of the closet, and I want to take our cues and inspiration from the marriage-equality movement.\n\nMinter, who designed Planned Parenthood pins that say, Don't F**K With Me, Don't F**K Without Us, says she chose to photograph Cyrus because she's an activist and she has 40.5 million Instagram followers.\n\nShe's been famous since she was 11 and she's a great artist, so she doesn't care about making money—she wants to give back, she continued. She founded the Happy Hippie Foundation, which supports LGBTQ youth. She flies commercial because she's conscious of her carbon footprint. Now she's going to help us with Planned Parenthood.\n\nAsked by Artsy about why she chose Planned Parenthood as her charity, Minter replied:\n\nThat was 2014, and laws were being passed that were shaving women's right to make their own choices with their bodies. We hadn't had to worry about that kind of thing since Bill Clinton was elected—we thought that war was over. Laurie, Cindy, and I—and so many others—worked so hard for abortion rights in the '70s and '80s, and all of a sudden that work started to unravel. Planned Parenthood has been attacked more in the last 2 years than in the last 20.\n\nIn addition to states passing more laws banning abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy, requiring higher levels of safety in abortion clinics, and eliminating taxpayer funding from the abortion group, Planned Parenthood is still reeling from a series of videos exposing its apparent practices of selling the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and altering the positions of babies during abortion in order to be able to harvest the most intact organs.\n\nThough Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in October announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. The organization and its leftwing media supporters continue to insist the videos, produced by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), were deceptively edited.\n\nHowever, a Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion – hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos — said while their analysts observed the videos had been edited, The analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.\n\nAdditionally, Fusion noted, [A]nalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff.\n\nAn analysis by Coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were not manipulated and that they are authentic.\n\nThe great @mintermarilyn being honored by Planned Parenthood for her important advocacy for the… https://t.co/JP652iYVh5 — Nancy Spector (@nespector) April 15, 2016\n\nLooking back on the feminist influences in her life, Minter said she has been an activist since high school, when she was always getting kicked out of class and in the dean's office.\n\nThen it was Civil Rights, and later it was the Vietnam War, she recalled. I was there when they shut down the Pentagon; I've been going on protest marches my whole life … And now, this fight against controlling and policing women's bodies feels like a war.\n\nMinter, who said she was on cloud nine when Obama was elected president, explained she was incensed when she heard on the radio that some Planned Parenthood clinics were closing down due to their failure to meet the new safety laws some states have passed.\n\nBut soon after, people—and public figures—started getting behind Planned Parenthood publicly, she said. Lena Dunham was one of the first, and all the women who contributed to her PSA, and then Miley [Cyrus], and now Marc [Jacobs]. Maybe he'll convince other companies to support, too.\n\nMost young women – and the general population of the United States – are no longer as supportive of abortion as were the old guard feminists in the 60s and 70s.\n\nA recent Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll found a full 81 percent of Americans favor some restrictions on abortion — including limiting the procedure after the first three months — and a continued ban on public funding of abortion.\n\nIn the survey of 1,700 Americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, Abortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.\n\nMinter said she will likely do a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Clinton has already been endorsed in the primary by Planned Parenthood and much of the abortion industry.
The New York Times editorial board says the Trump administration is quietly advancing an anti-science agenda by supporting teen pregnancy prevention programs that encourage young people to refrain from sex to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STD).\n\nIn an editorial Sunday, the board condemns the promotion of abstinence among teens by the current Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The reproach is delivered without one word about the scientific fact that the only certain way young teens can avoid having to deal with the unfortunate situations of an unplanned pregnancy or being infected with an STD is to not have sex.\n\nThe administration is promoting a 'just say no' approach and is 'poised to shift Title X family planning dollars … toward programs that advocate abstinence outside of marriage, says the editorial board, sure that only horrific outcomes will ensue from encouraging young people to delay sex until they are older, have completed school, and have met someone special.\n\nThe administration's approach defies all common sense, the editors write, claiming there is no evidence that teaching young people to make healthy decisions about sex will reduce teen pregnancies or STDs.\n\nThe Times continues that comprehensive sex education (CSE) programs of the sort promoted by the Obama administration are the reason why teen pregnancy has declined in the United States in recent years.\n\nA senior HHS official, however, recently told Breitbart News that this narrative is not supported by research data from the federal government itself.\n\nA 2016 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows nearly 60 percent of high school students today have never had sex, an increase of 28 percent since 1991. This data complements research that also shows a historic drop in teen pregnancy rates since 1991.\n\nYet, despite this scientific data that was produced during his own tenure, in his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2017, former President Barack Obama eliminated funding in his administration's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) for sex education programs that focus on reinforcing the healthy decision to delay sex made by many adolescents. His administration proposed only funding CSE programs, which assume all middle school children need to know where to get the morning-after pill and how to use a condom.\n\nThe previous administration tried an approach that just didn't work, the HHS official said. And our commitment requires that we change that approach.\n\nAn HHS document points to 37 evaluations of TPP programs performed for grant applications to fund the programs.\n\nOverall, of the 37 funded and evaluated projects, 73% either had no impact or had a negative impact on teen behavior, with some teens more likely to begin having sex, to engage in unprotected sex, or to become pregnant, HHS explained. Very few positive results were sustained over time.\n\nAdditionally, as CDC has also observed, while teen sex and pregnancy rates are at record lows, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are at record highs. HHS said sex education, therefore, should be centered on science in the promotion of optimal health outcomes.\n\nIf we know that more teens are waiting to have sex today than 25 years ago, then shouldn't we be reinforcing those healthy decisions and building upon that? HHS asked. Similarly, we know that teen pregnancy rates have decreased and yet sexually transmitted diseases and infection have increased to record levels. There's something going on there, and we need to learn what it is and to make sure we make some amendments to the messages we're communicating, because we can't be satisfied with those numbers.\n\nThe Times editors, however, are more concerned about keeping up appearances at places like the U.N., where, they gasp, Trump administration officials have been heard referring to the United States as a pro-life nation.\n\nThe editorial board further condemns what it calls Trump officials engaging in savvy rebranding of teen sex ed programs by using innocuous sounding terms like 'sexual risk avoidance' and 'healthy relationships.' The editors do not apparently take offense, however, at the abortion industry's attempt to smooth over the elective ending of an unborn child's life by defining the procedure as women's health care.\n\nMany parents throughout the United States say they have had enough, in fact, of the pornographic and gender-bending sex education curricula taught by organizations like Planned Parenthood – which profits from abortion and also boasts that it educates students about how to have LGBT-inclusive sex:\n\nWe are disgusted that our taxpayer money is going to teach children how to question their gender, perform anal and oral sex, and masturbate, said Elizabeth Johnston, the Activist Mommy, who led an international Sex Ed Sit Out in April.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's ideas about sex education have been exposed on other occasions.\n\nPro-life organization Live Action produced a video in 2014 that highlighted the abortion vendor's normalization of Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, Masochism (BDSM) for young people.\n\nMore recently, Planned Parenthood itself released a video titled How to Tell Someone You Have an STD, in which the group minimizes the significance of sexually transmitted disease.\n\nSo, you've got an STD, the video's narrator nods casually. Guess what? So do lots of other people. Half of all people will get an STD at some point in their life. Seriously. Not kidding – half. It's OK.\n\nFor the New York Times editors, however, teaching young people to delay sex until they are older and might have better judgment about relationships is anti-science and more.\n\nSuch education keeps all people who are subjected to it in the dark about critical aspects of their health, and treats a normal part of life — sexuality, and women's sexuality in particular — as aberrant and shameful, they say.\n\nScience, however, is not pro-sex or pro-abortion. And encouraging young teens to respect themselves and their bodies – and to view their sexuality as a special part of who they are – does not equate to teaching sex is abnormal, aberrant, or shameful.
Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is outspoken about his Christian beliefs, but now some critics are attacking him for racy photos posted to social media by his pop singer wife, Ciara.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ciara posted a series of photos to her Instagram account depicting her in some rather intimate situations and scantily clad in some shots.\n\nThe 32-year-old singer was seen wearing nothing but a white button-down shirt arranged to show off parts of her highly toned body, according to Christian Post.\n\nAlso, the photos were apparently taken by her NFL player husband.\n\nThe photos elicited a variety of reactions some praising them, others reportedly lusting after the NFL player's wife. But soon the pair came under fire for seeming to violate their Christian beliefs by posting such intimate images.\n\nOne reply, for instance, jabbed the two saying, These pictures should be seen only by your husband, not on public display. Are you not a Christian family?\n\nAnother post criticized Ciara for perpetuating sex stereotypes.\n\n@Ciara, I adore you and @dangerusswilson, and you have nothing to prove; y'all are the bomb. However, posting semi-naked pics only perpetuates the myth that women are merely sexual objects for all to see, the commenter wrote.\n\nThe NFL player was famous for advocating abstinence before marriage. Before they wed, for instance, Wilson told the audience at a San Diego church event that he and Ciara were doing it the Jesus way and refusing to engage in sexual relations until they took their vows.\n\nWilson did admit that refraining from sex wasn't an easy decision, especially with such a beautiful woman as Ciara. I ain't gonna lie to y'all now, I need y'all to pray for us. I know y'all seen her on the screen, he said.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
Thursday on MSNBC's All In, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy would be someone who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women.\n\nWarren said, Let's talk about what we know for sure is at stake and some of the questions that the nominee is going to face. Donald Trump has already said that he's going to pick somebody who has been prescreened off a list that that was put together by a group whose number one job—an extremist group—is to make sure that Roe versus Wade gets overturned.\n\nShe added, This means that he's looking for a nominee who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women. That's what's at stake in this one. And then from there, so much more. This is about health care cases that are percolating up through the courts, including the one we know about right now about pre-existing conditions. This is about the swing vote in our environmental protections, whether or not giant corporations are going to have the right to poison the water and foul the air. This is about workers' rights and whether or not the Supreme Court is going to stay on the path of trying to bust unions. This is about voting rights, whether or not democracy fundamentally works in this country. This is one of those moments where Justice Kennedy has been the swing vote. Look, I'll be blunt, he swung a lot of times in a direction I don't like, but he's been a swing vote. He was the one who helped stand up for equal marriage. All of that is now at risk—whether he, Donald Trump, gets to replace the swing vote with somebody off a pre-approved extremist list.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Presidential candidate and billionaire Mike Bloomberg released his vision for putting in place a comprehensive policy to ensure LGBTQ+ equality on Tuesday.\n\nThe vision includes transgenders' rights to free sex surgery and hormone treatment, rights to shelter based on gender identity, and forcing law enforcement and health care providers to undergo cultural competency and implicit bias training.\n\nBloomberg said in a statement on his campaign website:\n\nI have been honored to stand with the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for equality and justice, from New York, where we won marriage equality in 2011, to states across the country. That fight – true to our nation's highest ideals – has achieved historic progress, but we still have a long way to go. As president, I will work to protect every member of the LGBTQ+ community from hatred, violence, and discrimination. We will close disparities in health care access and quality, stop violence against transgender people, and advocate for equal rights across the world. We cannot settle for anything less – and I won't.\n\nBloomberg's radical transgender agenda included supporting the Do No Harm Act that would gut the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's provision to protect Americans right to live and act according to their religious convictions.\n\nMike will … end the Trump administration's practice of granting federally funded organizations a license to discriminate against people based on their religious beliefs, sexual orientation or gender identity, the website stated.\n\nBloomberg also supports passage of the Equality Act, which would bar governments and sports organizations from recognizing the biological/physiological difference between men and women and replace it with gender identity.\n\nThe website stated:\n\nMike will also protect and expand ACA enrollment efforts and restrict the sale of plans that don't meet ACA standards, ensuring coverage for medically-necessary gender-affirming care (e.g., gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy).\n\nBloomberg vowed to restore and enforce the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Equal Access Rule to ensure that transgender people are able to stay in shelters that match their gender identity.\n\nThis housing agenda would allow transgender women to stay in homeless and domestic violence shelters based on gender identity.\n\nBloomberg also would prioritize transgender rights in federal law enforcement:\n\nAs president, Mike will establish a comprehensive approach to addressing violence against LGBTQ+ people, especially transgender women of color. Mike will make hate and bias crimes a top federal priority, directing the FBI to take the lead on bias crime investigations, training local authorities to identify hate and pressing states to report all hate crimes to the federal government, and improving data collection on violent deaths of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Bloomberg and the left are embracing the transgender ideology despite scientific facts:\n\nAttorney and writer Jane Robbins observed at the Witherspoon Institute's Public Discourse:\n\nThe concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. An individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. And as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. But the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania. Physicians who have embraced transgender ideology are enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. Transgender treatment for those with gender dysphoria has grown into an elaborate industry. The cost of top surgery, for example, is over $10,000.\n\nBloomberg also said he would restore U.S. leadership on LGBTQ+ rights at home and around the world, even if the Trump administration launched a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has introduced a series of sweeping foreign policy bills, including one that would let Congress limit the president's power to place international sanctions and declare national emergencies.\n\nOmar describes the legislative package, titled Pathway to PEACE (Progressive, Equitable, and Constructive Engagement), as a bold progressive vision to rethink the country's approach to foreign policy by centering human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America's engagement in the world, and making military action a last resort in a press release. I believe in a world where there are no young girls living through war, and no nations that are being destroyed, she declared in the statement.\n\nEndless war is not making our country safer. It is costing lives, destroying futures, and damaging our reputation in the world. Today, I'm introducing the #PathwaytoPeace, a new vision for American foreign policy based on peace and diplomacy. https://t.co/TpG8oqk1X7 — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 12, 2020\n\nShe spoke about the bills at a panel discussion on Capitol Hill Wednesday, framing them as a globalized approach to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThese sets of bills are not about a single country or singling out one particular country, said Omar, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It's about setting a common set of standards for the world.\n\nOne of the bills, the Congressional Oversight of Sanctions Act, would give Congress power to limit the executive branch's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare national emergencies and place economic sanctions.\n\nWe need to restore congressional oversight, Omar said. She explained that the bill requires an explanation for what foreign policy goal is supposed to be achieved with the given sanction and what the process for delisting an individual, entity or country should be.\n\nOmar has telegraphed her practical aims for this particular policy. In the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as Iran and Venezuela. Last April, she accused President Trump of declaring a fake emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allowed him to direct funding towards the construction of physical barriers.\n\nThis is a fake emergency! Donald Trump is lying about the border in order to build his monument to racism. https://t.co/hVOVzLYDHw — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) April 3, 2019\n\nOne of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.\n\nAnother bill redirects defense spending – something Omar refers to as military intimidation and coercion – and gives it to the State Department.\n\n[The] Global Peace Building Act… would authorize a one-time transfer of $5 billion dollars from the Pentagon's Overseas Contingency Operation budget to the State Department to create a new multi-lateral peacebuilding fund, she said.\n\nHer press release does not specify this entity's relationship to the United States Institute of Peace, created in 1984 and funded annually by Congress. The institute describes its work as  a vital investment in reducing violent international conflicts that threaten U.S. national security in its latest budget justification letter sent to Congress.\n\nTwo more bills would require the United States to cede authority and sovereignty to global institutions.\n\nOmar called it an international embarrassment that the United States has not signed onto the controversial United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nHowever, that agreement would severely undermine U.S. sovereignty, as explained in a legal white paper from Americans United for Life in 2010:\n\nUnder Article VI of the United States Constitution, all treaties made shall be the supreme Law of the Land. Therefore, ratification of the UNCRC will make the document binding under American law and it would supersede any relevant, existing federal or state laws. This will also ultimately limit United States sovereignty by placing American family law and parental rights under international regulation and scrutiny.\n\nOmar also called on the United States to join the International Criminal Court, a global entity that President Donald Trump blocked from launching an investigation into alleged atrocities committing during the war between 2003 and 2004, including by U.S. troops, Afghan forces, and the Taliban.\n\nTrump has denounced the ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes court, for its 'broad, unaccountable, prosecutorial powers,' Reuters reported. Washington revoked travel visas for ICC personnel in response to its work on Afghanistan.\n\nOmar's press release touts support for the bills from left-wing heavyweights like Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor to Barack Obama.\n\nCongresswoman Omar is putting forward an ambitious and comprehensive package that outlines progressive approaches to some of the most important issues facing the United States and our world today, Rhodes said.\n\nHuman Rights Watch's Andrea Prasow praised Omar as a leader on the subject:  With an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that Congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.\n\nOmar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nMore recently, Omar has been mired in more personal controversies. In late 2019, she filed for divorce from Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her children, amid swirling reports of an affair with Democratic operative Tim Mynett. She is now facing scrutiny for alleged campaign payments to his consulting firm. Likewise, long-simmering questions about her marriage to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009 — which critics have alleged was a marriage to her brother for immigration purposes — have reportedly reached the FBI.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
A court in India ruled on Monday that the term Hindu bride must also include transgender women, thus directing authorities to register a marriage solemnized between a man and a transgender woman.\n\nJustice G R Swaminathan of the Madras high court, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, issued a ruling on Monday that the term bride as defined by the Hindu Marriage Act must also include transgender women, who are biologically male. The case was brought by a man and his transgender partner after registration authorities refused to certify their marriage, citing Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1956 that states that a transgender woman cannot be considered a bride.\n\nSwaminathan chose to discard the ruling by referring to cases such as the recent decriminalization of homosexuality while observing that equal rights are afforded to transgenders under the Indian Constitution.\n\nAfter making an exhaustive reference to the human rights jurisprudence worldwide in this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Article 14 of the Constitution of India which affirms that the State shall not deny to 'any person' equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India would apply to transgenders also, he said in his ruling.\n\nTransgender persons fall within the expression 'person' and hence entitled to legal protection of laws in all spheres of State activity as enjoyed by any other citizen of this country, he continued.\n\n\n\nSwaminathan observed that gender identity falls within the domain of her personal autonomy and involves her right to privacy and dignity, arguing that it was not for State authorities to question this self-determination of the second petitioner herein.\n\nWhen the right of the transgender persons to marry has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the very nature of things, they cannot be kept out of the purview of the Hindu Marriage Act, he added. One can have a civil marriage. One can also have a sacramental marriage. The petitioners' marriage was solemnized in a temple. Therefore, their fundamental right under Article 25 has also been infringed in this case.\n\nSwaminathan also took steps to outlaw gender reassignment surgeries on children who identify as intersex, saying that they required more time and maturity to make such a decision. However, he said the government must launch campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the issue so that parents and children did not feel a sense of shame.\n\nParents must be encouraged to feel that the birth of an inter-sex child is not a matter of embarrassment or shame, the court ruled. Any intersex child is entitled to stay within the folds of the family, he observed. The running away to the margins and beyond is a fatal journey that must be arrested. Time has come when they are brought back from the margins to the mainstream.\n\nDespite being known for its ultra-conservative society, India has taken steps to implement various LGBT rights over recent years. Last year, the Supreme Court overturned a ruling criminalizing homosexuality, while sexual reassignment surgery remains legal and readily accessible.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
The U.S. Bishops' Conference (USCCB) has again voiced its opposition to the Equality Act, warning it would discriminate against people of faith and inflict numerous legal and social harms on Americans.\n\nIn a strongly worded letter to the U.S. Congress, the bishops assert the Equality Act would impose novel and divisive viewpoints regarding 'gender' on individuals and organizations while dismissing sexual difference and falsely presenting 'gender' as only a social construct.\n\nThe Feb. 23 letter, signed by five leaders of the USCCB, notes sex and gender can be distinguished but not separated, while denouncing underlying ideologies that attempt to sunder what are inseparable aspects of reality.\n\nRather than affirm human dignity in ways that meaningfully exceed existing practical protections, the Equality Act would discriminate against people of faith, they insist.\n\nBecause of its abolition of real sexual differences in favor of subjective gender identities, the proposed legislation would force girls and women to compete against boys and men for limited opportunities in school sports, and to share locker rooms and shower spaces with biological males who claim to identify as women, the bishops contend.\n\nMoreover, the Act would exclude people from the careers and livelihoods that they love, just for maintaining the truth of their beliefs on marriage and sexuality and discriminate against individuals and religious organizations based on their different beliefs, they argue.\n\nIn their litany of the many problems with the proposed law, the bishops also assert it would punish faith-based charities such as shelters and foster care agencies, and in turn their thousands of beneficiaries, simply because of their beliefs on marriage and sexuality.\n\nThe letter was signed by New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, chairman of the Committee for Religious Liberty; Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley, chairman of the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development; Oakland Bishop Michael Barber, chairman of the Committee on Catholic Education; Tulsa Bishop David Konderla, chairman of the Subcommittee for the Promotion and Defense of Marriage; and Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann, chairman of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from her longtime partner Brad Pitt, according to a report.\n\nTMZ reports that the 41-year-old actress and United Nations special envoy filed court papers Monday citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.\n\nThe outlet further reports that Jolie was unhappy with the way Pitt, 52, was raising their children. The couple — who married in 2014 but have been together since 2004 — are parents to six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivenne, both 8.\n\nA source close to the couple told TMZ that Jolie was extremely upset with Pitt's parenting methods.\n\nAn unnamed source also reportedly told the outlet that Jolie was fed up with what the source said was his alleged use of marijuana and anger issues. The source added that Jolie felt the children were in danger around Pitt.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Post's Page Six reports that Jolie had hired a private detective to spy on Pitt on the set of his new London-set movie Allied, where she suspected he had been cheating with co-star Marion Cotillard. The outlet reported that the private eye did catch Pitt cheating with Cotillard.\n\nPage Six also reported several other details related to the split: Jolie reportedly wants to become more involved with her humanitarian work, while Pitt wants to continue to make movies and enjoys Hollywood parties. Jolie appeared at the United Nations just last week to lobby on behalf of Syrian refugees.\n\nThe outlet further reported that Pitt is closer to Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, than she is: Jon's a Hollywood guy, and she's been estranged. Brad hangs out with her father more than she does, a source said.\n\nJolie is reportedly seeking sole physical custody of their six children and asking a judge to grant visitation rights to Pitt.\n\nThe couple — dubbed by celebrity tabloid outlets as Brangelina — first met on the set of their 2003 thriller Mr. and Mrs. Smith. They recently starred as a couple trying to repair their marriage in last year's Jolie-directed drama By the Sea.\n\nJolie has reportedly retained attorney Laura Wasser, who represented actress Amber Heard in her high-profile divorce case against Johnny Depp earlier this summer.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional details.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) noted Thursday on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives that the Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexuality and gender identity, specifically disallows religious exemptions.\n\nJordan was responding to a speech by Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY), who accused Republicans of using freedom of religion as an excuse to hate on gay people, and claimed that religious freedom would still be protected under the Equality Act.\n\nBut Jordan pointed to the text of the bill itself, which states: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) was enacted to protect the First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion except for compelling government interest.\n\nReligion has been at the heart of debates about same-sex marriage, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Democrats tried to short-circuit that debate in the Equality Act, which implies that religion cannot be cited as a basis for discrimination.\n\nFollowing Jordan, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) argued that language in the text of the bill also attempts to create a statutory right to abortion by prohibiting discrimination regarding a related medical condition connected to pregnancy.\n\nThe Equality Act passed the House on a largely party-line vote, 224-206, with only three Republicans joining Democrats in favor.\n\nThe Senate is considered unlikely to pass the Equality Act, for the reasons of religious liberty Jordan mentioned.\n\nJoel B.

A California bakery owned by Christians has been forced to take down its website and social media accounts after a bombardment of criticism and a boycott followed their decision not to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding involving two lesbians.\n\nCathy Miller, the owner of Tastries Bakery in Bakersfield, CA, explained that she was not refusing to serve a certain sort of customer, but rather to patronize a certain sort of event that goes against her religious convictions as a Christian.\n\nA ceremony, when you're getting married is in the eyes of the Lord, okay, and that's a celebration of a union that God has brought together and that's a whole lot different than coming in and wanting a cookie, Miller explained.\n\nEileen Del Rio claimed that she and her girlfriend suffered discrimination because Tastries Bakery refused to grant them a wedding cake tasting due to the Millers' Christian belief in marriage as the union between a man and a woman.\n\nDel Rio wrote about the incident on Facebook, bringing down a bombardment of negativity against Miller. As a result, the owners were forced to take down the Tastries Bakery website and Facebook page.\n\nSo we go to this bakery a week ago to sign up for tasting and choose our wedding cake. The owner met with us today to set up the process, Del Rio wrote. Well this rude ass person says I will make your order but I don't condone same sex marriages and will have no part in this process. Oh but you want to take my order and give it another bakery so that bakery can do it.\n\nShe don't condone same sex marriages so refused to make our wedding cake and set up our order. She wanted all our information to send to another bakery so they could make it, she added, along with a hashtag suggesting the owner was probably a supporter of Donald Trump.\n\nMiller said that she has nothing against gay people but there are certain activities she cannot support because of who she is.\n\nHere at Tastries, we love everyone, Miller said. My husband and I are Christians and we know that God created everyone and he created everyone equal so it's not that we don't like people of certain groups of people.\n\nThere are just certain things that violate my conscience, Miller said.\n\nFor years, Tastries has been referring gay customers who want a wedding cake to a competitor called Gimmee Some Sugar, so they can receive the service they ask for.\n\nI'm really hurt by this. I don't think we should be picked on because of our beliefs, Miller said.\n\nIn the last two days, LGBT activists have loaded a barrage of negative reviews against the bakery on Yelp and TripAdvisor in an effort to tank the business.\n\nLast May, President Trump issued an executive order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty, in which he stated that the executive branch would vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.\n\nThe Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views were integral to a vibrant public square, and in which religious people and institutions were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the Federal Government, he said, noting that the fundamental right to religious liberty is Americans' first freedom.\n\nFederal law protects the freedom of Americans and their organizations to exercise religion and participate fully in civic life without undue interference by the Federal Government. The executive branch will honor and enforce those protections, he said.\n\nFollow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome
A British police officer called a charity to ask if it were acceptable for an Iraqi man to date a 12-year-old girl because he wanted to be culturally sensitive when dealing with a suspected paedophile.\n\nAn unnamed police detective called the charity Karma Nirvana, which tackles forced marriage and other forms of 'honour-based' abuse, after he had arrested a 26-year-old Iraqi man who said that in his culture, it was acceptable for him to be in a relationship with a child, according to the charity's call logs seen by The Times.\n\nAccording to the call log, the policeman said the accused is stating that it is 'completely acceptable in my culture to be with a 12-year-old'.\n\nThe record added that the officer 'just wished to know if it is accepted in Iraqi culture to be with a 12-year-old girl' as he wished to be 'culturally sensitive'.\n\nThe charity advised that he deal with the Iraqi in the same way they would deal with any other suspected child sex predator.\n\nKarma Nirvana said that this call showed the dangers of authorities filtering serious crimes through a 'cultural sensitivity' lens, for fear of being perceived as racist.\n\nChain Migration: UK Govt 'Turns Blind Eye' to Forced Marriage, Hands Visas to Foreign Rapists https://t.co/ExXaJ9pqD2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018\n\nJasvinder Sanghera, the charity's founder, said that We've got a number of professionals who are turning a blind eye. They don't want to rock the multicultural boat.\n\nThe revelation is one of many to be released by The Times after it published a series of reports detailing authorities turning a blind eye to forced and underage marriages by predominately South Asians.\n\nIt was revealed this week that government officials had been handing visas to the husbands of girls who have been forcibly married, raped, and impregnated abroad, allowing them to settle in Britain permanently; at times the victims were mentally disabled.\n\nOf the 3,800 reports of forced marriages or children and young people at risk of being forced into marriage, over the past three years to the government's Home Office, the police have charged less than 80 suspects and the judicial system has convicted suspects in just three cases.
Hungary has offered a model to the West of how to effectively address the widespread demographic crisis, writes Catholic University of America theology professor Chad Pecknold.\n\nWhile European nations languish with rapidly declining birthrates, Hungary stands out with rising marriage rates, falling abortions, and its highest birthrate in 20 years, Pecknold notes in an essay in the Catholic Herald Thursday.\n\nMarriage is up by 43 percent since 2010, while divorce has dropped by 22.5 percent in the same period. This demographic turnaround has not been an accident, but the fruit of deliberate programs to promote marriage and the family while defending Hungary's cultural identity and Christian roots.\n\nAfter we won the election in 2010 with a two-thirds majority, we decided to build a family-friendly country and to strengthen families raising children, said Hungary's Minister for the Family, Katalin Novak.\n\nStanding firm in its position despite fierce opposition from the socialist left, the Orbán government enacted legislation resulting in a comprehensive family-support system, a family-friendly tax system, a housing program, 800,000 new jobs, and many opportunities to create a balance between life and work, Ms. Novak stated.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, the Orbán government has introduced seven family-friendly government programs encouraging Hungarians to have children in response to the European Union's mass migration agenda.\n\nWe are living in times when fewer and fewer children are being born throughout Europe. People in the West are responding to this with immigration, Prime Minister Orbán said at the State of the Nation address in Budapest in February.\n\nHungarians see this in a different light. We do not need numbers, but Hungarian children, the Fidesz party leader added.\n\nThe new law will come into effect July 1 and includes pro-family incentives such as a 3,000 euro mortgage reduction for a second child, a 12,000 euro reduction for a third child, a car-purchasing program for large families, and comprehensive daycare.\n\nAs of 2020, mothers with four or more children will enjoy a lifetime personal income tax exemption.\n\nHungary is proving that pro-family policies are better for nations than those policies which deracinate and diminish the family by the whims of ideological dictate, Pecknold observes.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

As President Obama's last year in office winds down and he comes to the realization that he won't be able to close the Guantanamo Bay terrorist detention facility like he promised in 2008, he's been busy transferring inmates to other countries as a fallback plan. This month, Obama has sent Osama bin Laden's alleged bodyguard to the country of Montenegro.\n\nAbdel Malik Ahmed Abdel Wahab al-Rahabi has been held at Gitmo for 14 years but will now get a change of scenery, with the administration deciding that the bin Laden associate is no longer a threat to the U.S. and recommending his transfer. And according to NBC News, the Department of Defense insists that the transfer is consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures.\n\nAnnouncing the move, the administration thanked the small Eastern European nation for taking the accused terrorist off America's hands\n\nMontenegro, a small country situated between Bosnia, and Herzegovina, and Albania, and across from Italy on the Adriatic Sea, said it would release al-Rahabi once it takes custody of him, allowing him to return to his family.\n\nAl-Rahabi was detained in 2001 by Pakistani forces then transferred to Gitmo a month after his arrest.\n\nPentagon documents say the prisoner is related to bin Laden by marriage and was trained to hijack airliners and fly a suicide mission in conjunction with the 9/11 attacks. For whatever reason, the detainee never committed to the suicide mission.\n\nClaiming to close the Guantanamo facility was one of the first actions Obama took when he first entered office in 2008 when he signed an Executive Order promising he would shut the facility down in the first year of his presidency.\n\nClosing the detention center was one of Obama's main campaign promises, but in spite of his promises and the Executive Order he immediately issued upon entering the White House, Obama never did shutter the facility. Instead, he began a campaign of transferring prisoners from the facility to nations that volunteered to take them.\n\nBut since he began his program of freeing prisoners by transferring them, well over 100 have simply returned to the battlefields to kill westerners in general and Americans in particular.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
The Vatican under Pope Francis is consolidating its opposition to gender theory, the notion that maleness and femaleness can be separated from biological sex, according to veteran Vatican analyst John L. Allen, Jr.\n\nAlthough prior popes were also critical of gender theory, Allen writes in a March 15 essay, opposition has intensified on Francis's watch.\n\nThe pope has repeatedly warned against the dangers of ideologies that separate sexual identity from biology, decrying gender theory as against the nature of things. It seems, Allen writes, that folks at the Vatican have picked up on Francis' war on gender theory and have decided to throw themselves into the fray.\n\nAs an example, Allen cites a conference at Rome's Santa Croce University this week that featured a forceful critique of gender theory, notably during a panel chaired by German Archbishop Georg Gänswein, aide to emeritus Pope Benedict XVI and currently the Prefect of the Papal Household.\n\nThe paper was prepared by canon lawyer Vincenzo Turchi, which served to throw some doctrinal heft behind the pope's sometimes casual statements on the subject.\n\nAllen condenses the Church's opposition to gender theory into three bullet points, all contained in Turchi's talk:\n\n– It undermines the objective moral norms governing sexual behavior by proposing that sexual identity and orientation are not given in nature, but rather the result of contingent historical and cultural factors.\n\n– In the hands of educators, it jeopardizes the right of parents to be the primary teachers of their children.\n\n– It threatens traditional Christian morality by casting it as discriminatory and bigoted.\n\nGender theory is based on the primacy of culture over nature, Turchi's paper read. Since gender theory views nature and biology data as marginal, sexual differences are fluid and changeable and can be fashioned on the basis of individual self-determination.\n\nCommenting on educational programs where gender theory is currently employed, Turchi spoke of a pilot curriculum in Spain where children are encouraged to pretend that they are members of the opposite sex to break down their natural identification with their bodies.\n\nThis includes acting out fairy tales, where boys are encouraged to play the part of Little Red Riding Hood, while girls are invited to play the part of the wolf, Allen notes.\n\nAdded to this, Turchi cited developments in northern Europe, such as the adoption of gender-neutral pronouns in Swedish schools and sexual education in Denmark that includes the possibility for guest speakers such as a transsexual prostitute.\n\nFrancis denounced gender theory for its denial of the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman and for its dream of a society without sexual differences in a lengthy 2017 teaching letter on marriage and the family called The Joy of Love (Amoris Laetitia).\n\nAn appreciation of our body as male or female, he wrote, is necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves and is far from the unisex utopia that some would like to impose.\n\nEfforts to blot out sexual differences based on anatomy are symptomatic of a sick society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he added.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren told attendees at a town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa Sunday that, if she is elected president, her education secretary will have to be approved by a transgender child.\n\nWhen a supporter told Warren public schools need to teach more about LGBTQ history and sex education, the Massachusetts senator replied her education secretary would have to be interviewed by a transgender child.\n\nC-SPAN\n\nI have two qualifications that I have talked about over and over for my secretary of education, Warren said. The first, it has to be someone who has taught in a public school.\n\nThen, Warren said that since the question came from a young trans person who asked about a welcoming community, she would have that trans child interview the nominee for education secretary and look for the child's approval:\n\nI said it starts with the Secretary of Education who has a lot to do with where we spend our money, with what gets advanced in our public schools, with what the standards are. And I said I'm gonna have a Secretary of Education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf and only if this person believes that our secretary or secretary of education nominee is – is committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone, will that person actually be advanced to be Secretary of Education.\n\nWarren has been reaching out to LGBT voters by condemning Christian schools that hold and teach a biblical worldview of human sexuality and marriage.\n\nStates should focus on funding public schools, not private ones—especially not ones that maintain anti-LGBTQ+ policies. We must ensure every kid—especially LGBTQ+ kids—can get a high-quality public education. https://t.co/hxKap5Ofjm — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 26, 2020\n\nAs Breitbart News also reported in January, if elected, Warren has also vowed to fill at least half of her Cabinet with women and non-binary individuals – or those who claim they are neither male nor female.\n\nHowever, as Gallup has observed, only 4.5 percent of U.S. adults identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) in 2017.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Trump administration, Democrats have continually criticized current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos for not having worked as a regular public school teacher. Most Democrat 2020 candidates have represented the views of the teachers' unions whose leadership has condemned the administration's support for school choice, viewing it as a threat to public schools.
WASHINGTON, DC – Chairman Chuck Grassley's (R-IA) Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC) sent four more judicial nominees to the Senate floor and plans to pass another four at its next business meeting, advancing President Trump's persistent march to keep his campaign promise of reshaping the federal judiciary.\n\nSenators on Thursday voted to send three federal trial court nominees and one federal appeals court nominee to the full Senate, where they are expected to be approved. In a sign of the Democrats' possible weakening resolve to uniformly oppose all Trump judicial picks, three of the nominees received some Democratic votes in support. The appellate nominee, Kurt Engelhardt for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was approved 15-6.\n\nThe only one approved on a straight 11-10 party-line vote was Howard Nielson, nominated for the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. Nielson is a well-respected former law clerk to a top appellate judge and then worked at the elite Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nDemocrats are opposing Nielson because of his work defending traditional marriage at the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2013, as well as his work at OLC defending presidential power to subject enemy combatants to enhanced interrogation. He is a partner at Cooper & Kirk, the powerhouse law firm headed by one of the most accomplished lawyers in the nation, Chuck Cooper, who headed OLC as its assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and Attorney General Ed Meese. Cooper is also a savvy political figure in D.C. and a close ally and personal lawyer to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nEven Nielson's critics acknowledge that he is well-qualified for a judgeship, and attempts to stop him will likely look like partisan obstruction that continues to diminish Democrats' political currency. He is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate.\n\nSJC held over four more nominations to be voted on at its next business meeting.\n\nThese include Michael Brennan for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Brennan's nomination has been slow-walked because home-state Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)—an aggressive partisan who is vulnerable for re-election in 2018—has refused to return her blue slip consenting to a committee hearing.\n\nBlue slips are a courtesy that Senate Democrats have abused during the Trump presidency, which formerly allowed a home-state senator to insist on consultations but which were never intended as a one-senator veto on a nominee with majority support. Democrats' misuse of blue slips to derail nominees led to Grassley's discarding of the process, and last month, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) led the full Senate to confirm the first Trump nominee to be initially blocked by a blue slip, Judge David Stras to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n\nBrennan and the other held-over nominees are expected to eventually be confirmed as well. Despite Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) efforts to derail President Trump's agenda, the president's aggressive promise to reorient the nation's courts continues apace.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Alice Johnson, the woman who had her prison sentence commuted by President Donald Trump in 2018, spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday.\n\nMy life has been totally changed by President Trump, she said, thanking the president for realizing her plight and acting to free her.\n\nCPAC attendees were familiar with Johnson after she was featured in a Trump campaign Super Bowl ad in 2020, and his State of the Union speech, but her appearance at the conservative conference allowed her to share the details of her story.\n\nI made a mistake, I take full responsibility for something that was wrong, she said, sharing the story of how she found herself as a divorced single mother of five children after 19 years of marriage. She admitted that she became addicted to gambling, lost her job, and lost a 12-year-old son in a scooter accident.\n\nUnder those circumstances, she admitted, she turned to crime, acting as a phone mule for a multimillion-dollar cocaine ring.\n\nI'm going to call it just what it was; it was an opportunity from hell, she said. You see what's right now but you never ever see the end. Sin will always take you further than you thought you would go.\n\nJohnson drew audible gasps from the crowd after revealed she was sentenced to life in prison with an additional 25 years with no parole.\n\nShe said she was offered three to five years if she entered into a plea deal and had no idea that a life sentence was even on the table.\n\nJohnson said she was sent to a prison 1,500 miles away from home.\n\nI had a family, and they would tell me that visiting me in prison was like visiting a graveyard because they would come and see the place where my body lay but they could never ever take me back home again, she said.\n\nIn prison, she said, she worked to help other women's lives with mentorship and counseling.\n\nI was able to bring light into a place that only is supposed to be darkness because I went there, but I did not go there by myself, she said. The Lord was with me.\n\nJohnson shocked the crowd when she revealed that she spent 21 years, seven months, and six days in federal prison and her appeal was turned down three times.\n\nThe rest is history, as video of her case made it's way on Twitter to celebrity Kim Kardashian, who shared it on Twitter and brought her case to the attention of President Trump.\n\nWe know it was divine intervention, she said, adding that she, had no idea who Kim Kardashian was.\n\nJohnson thanked the president for commuting the sentences of three other women that she singled out for a second chance last week, noting that she had become the face of criminal justice reform.\n\nI became a face of compassion, of redemption, of grace, and of second chances, because that is what this country has been built upon, she said.\n\nShe praised Trump for signing the criminal justice reform bill and making it a significant part of his administration.\n\nIt's more than just a social justice issue, it's a humanitarian issue, she said.
The ongoing saga of LGBT protests of an upcoming Chick-fil-A restaurant on campus at Duquesne University, a Catholic college in Pittsburgh, has taken on biblical dimensions as a test-case of safe spaces and microaggressions in American higher education.\n\nAccording to its mission statement, Duquesne University is a Catholic university founded by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, dedicated to serving God while espousing a profound concern for moral and spiritual values. It also professes a commitment to an ecumenical atmosphere open to diversity.\n\nFor its part, Chick-fil-A CEO management has articulated a biblical understanding of marriage that exactly mirrors Catholic teaching, while also emphasizing that they do not discriminate in any way, and are more than happy to serve anyone who wishes to eat at their establishment.\n\nIn 2012, Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A, stated: We are very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.\n\nWe know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles, he said.\n\nLambda Gay-Straight Alliance, the LGBT student organization on campus, considers Chick-fil-A's commitment to traditional marriage potentially offensive to gay students, despite the obvious fact that no one is required to patronize the restaurant who doesn't want to.\n\nAt the March 26 meeting, Lambda executive board member Niko Martini proposed that the Student Government Association (SGA) pass a resolution asking the university to reconsider the inclusion of Chick-fil-A as a dining option for students. Martini said he made the proposal on his own behalf and not Lambda's.\n\nChick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, Martini said. I think it's imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.\n\nMartini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus.\n\nMeanwhile Lambda President Rachel Coury expressed worries that the safety of LGBT students might be at risk.\n\nI've tried very hard within the last semester and a half to promote this safe environment for the LGBTQ+ community, Coury said. So I fear that with the Chick-fil-A being in Options that maybe people will feel that safe place is at risk.\n\nDebate sparked by the confrontation, swirling around a series of issues from religious liberty to gay rights to a proper academic environment, have now reached a national level, according to the Duquesne Duke, the university's campus newspaper.\n\nIn an interview on Fox and Friends, retired U.S. Army Ranger Sean Parnell, an alumnus of Duquesne University, minced no words in expressing his dissent from the contemporary environment on the campus of his alma mater.\n\nThey're a bunch of babies. College is supposed to prepare you for the real world, not shield you from opposing opinions, and safe spaces do exactly that. Who doesn't want as an undergrad Chick-fil-A on their campus? I would have killed for a c on my campus when I was at Duquesne, he said.\n\nMy message is: toughen up. there are no safe spaces in the real world, he said. If you're going to be successful in this life after you leave college you've got to learn to embrace adversity and open yourself up to a litany of different opinions. You will never be a CEO of a major company or an entrepreneur or a manager if you are not willing to work with people different than you.\n\nHostility toward proponents of traditional marriage was foreseen by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in his potent dissent of the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that made gay marriage the law of the land.\n\nAlito prophesied that the misguided decision would be used to damage citizens who do not share a contemporary view of marriage as an elastic arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons.\n\nIt will be used, he wrote presciently, to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

BOSTON (AP) — Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric Co. into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate and parlayed his legendary business acumen into a retirement career as a corporate leadership guru, has died. He was 84.\n\nHis death was confirmed Monday by GE. The cause of death was renal failure, his wife Suzy told The New York Times.\n\nWelch became one of the nation's most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as GE's chairman and chief executive, from 1981 to 2001. He personified the so-called cult of the CEO during the late-1990s boom, when GE's soaring stock price made it the most valuable company in the world.\n\nA chemical engineer by training, Welch transformed the company from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse. During his tenure, GE's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.\n\nWelch's results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping GE turn a financial corner, although some of the success came at the expense of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in Welch's relentless efforts to cut costs and rid GE of unprofitable businesses.\n\nBusiness success and outspokenness brought him wide fame.\n\nIn 1999, Fortune magazine named Welch as its Manager of the Century.\n\nFor his first book, Jack: Straight From the Gut, Welch received a $7.1 million advance. Although released on the very morning of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the book became a best-seller, and led to frequent speaking engagements where he took his candor on stage.\n\nFrom the day I joined GE to the day I was named CEO, 20 years later, my bosses cautioned me about my candor, Welch wrote in 'Straight from the Gut.' I was labeled abrasive and consistently warned my candor would soon get in the way of my career … and I'm telling you that it was candor that helped make it work.\n\nWelch did not slow down after leaving GE.\n\nHe became a senior advisor with private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice in 2001. He also taught a course on business leadership at MIT's Sloan School of Management in 2006. In 2009, Welch founded the Jack Welch Management Institute, an online MBA program that is now part of Strayer University.\n\nWhile Welch was known for being hypercompetitive, he also stressed giving everyone a fair shake.\n\nIn the 2005 book, Winning, Welch wrote that he would like to be remembered as a huge advocate of candor and meritocracy, and believing everyone deserves a chance. And I'd like to be remembered for trying to make the case that you can never let yourself be a victim.\n\nAlong with Welch's fame came greater scrutiny. Welch found himself defending his retirement compensation. Amid a wave of corporate scandals, details of Welch's GE perks emerged in court papers during his 2002 divorce from his wife of 13 years, Jane Beasley. He received millions of dollars in benefits, including unlimited personal use of GE's planes, office space and financial services.\n\nAfter the perks became public, Welch reimbursed the company for many of them, and paid for use of aircraft and other services.\n\nHis first marriage, to Carolyn, ended amicably in divorce after 28 years in 1987. Plans for his second divorce were disclosed shortly after Harvard Business Review editor Suzy Wetlaufer revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while working on a story about him.\n\nWelch didn't blame the media for the attention the affair generated.\n\nChrist, if I was a journalist, I'd write a scandalous story, Welch told the CBS television news magazine 60 Minutes in a 2005 interview. I mean, it's a good story, but I don't care. I fell in love.\n\nWetlaufer resigned the Harvard editing post in 2002 because of a furor caused by her relationship with Welch. In a January 2012 interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, when asked how he persuaded Wetlaufer to marry him, Welch replied, My charm and probably my wallet.\n\nWe had a little scandal at the beginning, he continued. And it's been the greatest 10 years of our lives.\n\nThe couple wrote a regular column, called The Welch Way, in Business Week magazine for four years. They also wrote management books, including Winning in 2005.\n\nThe Welches resumed writing a regular column in 2012, this time for Reuters. They used the column to dole out advice for business and political figures, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, whom they supported.\n\nWelch was also active on Twitter, where he opined on everything from politics to business to sports and had 1.4 million followers.\n\nSome of those opinions generated controversy.\n\nHe questioned a monthly jobs report in October 2012 that showed the unemployment rate had fallen below 8% for the first time in three and a half years. The report came two days after President Barack Obama had performed poorly in his first debate with Romney and a month before the election.\n\nUnbelievable jobs numbers, he tweeted. These Chicago guys will do anything…can't debate so change numbers.\n\nObama hailed from Chicago. While some Republican members of Congress echoed his views, his criticism was mostly derided by economists and by former Labor Department officials from the Bush administration, who vouched for the accuracy of the data.\n\nIn his writing and speaking, Welch shared the wisdom he gained in a GE career that began right after he left grad school. He quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and CEO in 1981, at age 45. Welch quickly shook up GE, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname Neutron Jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. Welch also divested GE of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be No. 1 or 2 in their markets. The early moves dismantled GE's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.\n\nHe's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, Noel Tichy, the author of a 1993 book on Welch and a former leader of GE's vaunted training programs, said in 2001. He'll make snap judgments. He's a human being that has temper tantrums.\n\nWith all that, I think he's the greatest business leader I ever met, Tichy said.\n\nAnd Welch freely acknowledged his mistakes. One was Calma, a computer design firm that GE bought in 1981. The company wound up losing $50 million annually until GE sold it in 1988.\n\nWelch delayed his retirement for one last bold move, a $41 billion bid to buy Honeywell International.\n\nWelch predicted easy government approval for the largest acquisition GE had ever attempted, but European regulators rejected the deal as bad for competition.\n\nIn 1986, Welch made one of his boldest moves, a $6.4 billion acquisition of RCA, including the NBC television network. The deal energized GE, which made hundreds more acquisitions as the company moved aggressively into financial services, medical equipment and jet engines.\n\nOne of Welch's greatest accomplishments, his supporters say, is the talent GE has created by placing a premium on developing leaders. Many former GE executives now lead Fortune 500 companies.\n\nAmong the leaders Welch groomed was his GE successor, Jeffrey Immelt. Welch has written that picking his successor leading up to the 2001 leadership transition was the most important and agonizing decision he ever made.\n\nIn April 2008, Immelt became the target of Welch's blunt talk when GE missed a quarterly earnings target, a month after Immelt had promised investors the company would meet its goals. The disappointment sent GE shares down nearly 13% in a single day, prompting Welch to say that he would get a gun out and shoot Immelt if he allowed GE to miss earnings targets again.\n\nAfter making the comment on CNBC, Welch went back on the GE-owned cable station the next day to renounce his harsh talk, saying, Nothing, nothing, nothing is as disgusting to me as some old CEO chirping away about how things aren't as good under the new guy as they were under him.\n\nAnd he never strayed far from GE.\n\nWhen I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, 'So how exactly are you running the company?' Jack was still in it – committed to GE's success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling, said GE's current CEO, Larry Culp.\n\nHe will be deeply missed by me and the entire GE team. And we'll continue to honor his legacy by doing exactly what Jack would want us to do: win. We extend our thoughts and sympathies to Suzy and his family during this time.\n\nBorn Nov. 19, 1935, as the only child of an Irish working-class family in Salem, Mass., Welch graduated from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. He later obtained master's and doctoral degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois, finishing in 1960.\n\nWelch joined GE that year as a junior engineer in Pittsfield, Mass.\n\nHe rose through the ranks, and built GE's plastics business into one of the company's fastest growing business units. He became a senior vice president in 1977, and vice chairman in 1979. In 1995, Welch suffered chest pains and underwent heart bypass surgery.\n\nThe setback led to speculation that GE could be seeking a quick successor to Welch, but he remained at the helm another six years.\n\nWelch moved to Boston after his career at GE, living in a townhouse in the city's Beacon Hill section.\n\nIn his later years, Welch also devoted more time to passions such as baseball — specifically, the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHe is survived by his third wife, Suzy Welch, and four children from his first marriage.
The Arizona Republican Party will vote on resolutions to censure Cindy McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, when it meets on January 23.\n\nMcCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), endorsed President-elect Joe Biden over President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arizona Central reported the text of the draft resolution to censure and dissolve any connections between the Republican Party and McCain:\n\nWHEREAS, Cindy Hensley McCain, the wife of the late Arizona US Senator John McCain, has supported leftist causes such as gay marriage, growth of the administrative state, and others that run counter to Republican values, a Republican form of government, and the US Constitution; WHEREAS, Cindy McCain has failed to support Conservative Republican candidates such as President Trump; WHEREAS, Cindy McCain has supported globalist policies and candidates, including Democrats such as Joe Biden, in direct opposition to Republican values, the interests of the American people, and the Constitution of the United States; WHEREAS, Cindy McCain has condemned President Trump for his criticism of her husband and erroneously placed behaviors over actual presidential results; and\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel issued a statement opposing the censure resolution of McCain.\n\nObviously we are upset that a prominent Republican would support Joe Biden whose beliefs are the opposite of what our party stands for, but the language in this resolution is abhorrent, McDaniel said in the statement.\n\nMy hope is that the Arizona Republican Party will not entertain it. This does nothing to grow our party or put us in a better position to win in 2022, McDaniel added.\n\n12 News subsequently reported that the language of the draft censure resolution has been modified:\n\nMcDaniel was reacting to an initial draft of the McCain resolution that included inflammatory language about both Cindy McCain and her late husband, Sen. John McCain. That language was removed from the resolution that will go to a vote in two weeks. The chairman of the Republican Party nationally understands that the chairman of the Republican Party locally is a complete goofball, said Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general and longtime McCain family friend. . . Sen. McCain was censured by the state party in 2014. He went on to win re-election two years later, defeating current party chair Kelli Ward in the GOP primary.\n\nI'm not surprised by the continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward . . . She's shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections — her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins, McCain said in a statement released to the Arizona Republic late Tuesday.\n\nWard is a former state legislator who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Arizona and is a strong supporter of President Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal said resolutions addressing Flake and Ducey will also be considered at the January 23 meeting of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nA separate resolution to censure Flake cites his opposition to President Trump's re-election, and a third resolution to censure Ducey cites his failure to remove emergency coronavirus pandemic restrictions.
South Bend Mayor and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg suggested Tuesday that Vice President Mike Pence is not as sincere in his Christian faith as he claims to be, judging based on his political alliance with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe section in my book about Mike Pence begins with that quote from Lincoln where he says, Both sides in great contests invoke God, think and hope that God's on their side. Both may be, and one must be, wrong, Buttigieg told Father Edward Beck in a wide-ranging interview on faith and public service for CNN. The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit.\n\nMichael D'Antonio, co-author of The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence, told CNN in August 2018 that Pence believes him becoming vice president was divine intervention. Absolutely everything that Mike Pence does is oriented towards him becoming President… by the time he left high school, he had decided he was going to be President of the United States.\n\nAnd as he rose through life, becoming a member of Congress and then Governor of Indiana, he actually sort of heard in his being God's direction, D'Antonio told New Day co-host John Berman. The author went on to claim how Pence thought that God was calling him to now be Vice President and function as a President-in-waiting.\n\nIn his discussion with Beck, Buttigieg took aim at Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation that Pence, then governor of the state, signed into law in 2015. The law allows both individuals and business to assert as a defense in legal proceedings that their religion has been burdened. The small town mayor called it a license to harm others in the name of religion.\n\nIt was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion, he said. Like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now? Making it easier to harm people in its name?\n\nIn another portion of the pair's discussion, Buttigieg spoke about why he believes same-sex marriage is a contentious issue in religious circles.\n\nIt saddens me because when I think about the blessings of marriage, first of all it's one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional, the 37-year-old said. It is morally one of the best things in my life. Being married to Chasten makes me a better person. I would even say it moves me closer to God.\n\nAnd so the idea that this of all things is what people are attacking each other over and excluding each other over, when God is love, we are taught, he went on. Of all the things to beat people up over on theological grounds, it just seems to me that loving shouldn't be one of them. So it's a painful thing to watch.\n\nIf you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then I think it takes you to a pretty specific place, he added. I've learned that it's an expression of love, at least it can be. And I guess I believe it ought to be.\n\nThe interview comes after Buttigieg announced his campaign had raised more than $7 million in the first quarter.
Actor Jason Lee has become the latest celebrity to confirm he is no longer practicing Scientology.\n\nThe 46-year-old My Name is Earl star, who moved to Denton, Texas with his wife Ceren Alkac and their children last year, confirmed his exit from the controversial religion in an interview with local outlet The Dentonite this weekend.\n\nThe actor told the outlet that, contrary to rumors that have been floated about his move to Texas, he has no plans to open a Scientology or any other religious center in the city.\n\nIf Ceren and I had an idea for a business, it certainly wouldn't happen at the cost of someone else's. And being that we don't practice Scientology, and that we aren't particularly interested in opening religious centers in general, we have no plans to open a Scientology center, the actor said.\n\nQuite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he added. We're not here to buy up or change or take over Denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. We're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of Denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.\n\nIn an essay for Gawker last year, Lee's first wife Carmen Llywelyn blamed Scientology for the breakup of their marriage. Lee and Llewelyn were married from 1995 to 2001.\n\nI was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work, she wrote.  I did what I thought was right. But I made the mistake of immersing myself completely in his world. I did what so many other people who join Scientology do: I lost all sense of individual identity in the name of the cult.\n\nLee joins several other recent high-profile defectors from the controversial Church, including actress Leah Remini, musician Lisa Marie Presley, director Paul Haggis, and actor Jason Beghe.\n\nIn March of last year, documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney released an HBO exposé on the controversial religion called Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. The film — which won three Emmy Awards — detailed the controversial behind-the-scenes working of the church and made several explosive allegations regarding its most devoted celebrity adherents, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dnzussbaum
Britain's Labour Party is demanding the UK government impose an imperialistic diktat upon the predominantly black citizens of Bermuda for refusing to adhere to the liberal-left's same-sex marriage demands.\n\nHelen Goodman — Labour's shadow Foreign Office minister — said the devolved, democratic decision taken by Bermuda to repeal gay marriage laws — turns same-sex couples into second class citizens, implying force should be used to impose gay marriage laws.\n\nFor that to happen anyone in the world would be shameful. For it to happen in a British territory, for the legislation signed by a British governor and permitted by a British foreign secretary makes us complicit in something which this House has repeatedly voted against, she argued.\n\nApparently imperialism is fine, but only in the pursuit of leftist goals like those of the LGBTQII++ lobby, in a mostly Christian nation.\n\nThe British government called Bermuda's decision disappointing but resisted getting involved despite the island's status as a British Overseas Territory. It's almost as if the Brits retain some knowledge about holding together an empire. If Bermuda were in the European Union, there'd have probably been some kind of sanctions, or perhaps a gay-migrant quota by now.\n\nRenowned mastermind (click it) David Lammy MP somehow managed to invoke slavery into his pro-imperialist arguments:\n\nThe first slaves we brought to Bermuda in 1620, oppressed, segregated, discriminated against… And that is why leaders like Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Barack Obama have not just fought for race rights, but they have fought for rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.\n\nThis country has been one of the world leaders on this subject – so if this is not the issue on which to refuse assent I don't know which is.\n\nThe Green Party's Caroline Lucas called it an absolute scandal that Britain was not willing to enforce LGBT ideals on another nation.\n\nThe rights of gay couples remain the same as those of straight married couples in Bermuda, but only the verbiage applied to each type of partnership is different.\n\nIn 2016, over 60 per cent of Bermudans rejected both same sex marriages and same sex civil unions in a plebiscite held on the same day as Britain's Brexit referendum. The votes were not binding as they did not pass the 50 per cent turnout threshold. Nevertheless the government sought to compromise on the matter, protecting LGBT rights and attempting to respect the will of the people vis a vis marriage as an institution.\n\nThe new rules — to add further irony — were drafted and passed by the Progressive Labour Party government in Bermuda, a nation of just over 60,000 people.\n\nWalton Brown, Bermuda's Minister of Home Affairs, said this week he was pleased with the decision as Governor John Rankin signed it into law.\n\nHere's the icing on the forcibly-baked-by-threat-of-imprisonment-same-sex marriage cake: Rankin is a 30+ year career diplomat from the British government, propelled into high office by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government in 2003 when he became Britain's Consul-General in Boston. He has since served in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Nepal, and now in Bermuda.\n\nRaheem Kassam is the editor in chief of Breitbart London
The Home Office is allowing women with severe mental disabilities to be forcibly married and raped, in both Britain and Pakistan, so that foreign men can obtain a visa and stay in the country.\n\nMigrant and Muslim families reportedly believe that marrying their disabled children to foreigners will secure them a carer — and are being allowed to because authorities are too politically correct to invene, according to critics.\n\nThe victims include a woman with the mental age of a 7-year-old allowed to marry in a British registry office to a Pakistani man who had overstayed his student visa, The Times reports.\n\nAuthorities had been aware of the case for over ten years and had received warnings the family of the man was paying around £20,000 to the woman's family because he wanted to stay in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe woman had been forced into marriage twice already abroad, beaten, and raped, but council officials allowed the British wedding as they were concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background of those involved, according to court documents.\n\nAnother Muslim woman with a very significant degree of learning disability was forcibly married to a cousin in Bangladesh and raped, before the abuser was handed a British visa.\n\nAt a hearing about the case in the Court of Protection, in 2012, a judge said the victim's husband was physically very rough and abusive, smacking her head, shaking her, and yanking her eyelid.\n\nHe added: I watched the wedding video and [the victim] was slumped in a chair almost comatose.\n\nChain Migration: UK Govt 'Turns Blind Eye' to Forced Marriage, Hands Visas to Foreign Rapists https://t.co/ExXaJ97Pes — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018\n\nThe migrant she was forced to marry twice failed to get a visa and an immigration judge said that her ability to understand and sponsor him was very much in doubt. However, she was then forced to live with him and was raped and impregnated.\n\nHer parents were devout Muslims who saw nothing wrong with the arrangement, spoke little English, and were very largely insulated from mainstream English society and mistrustful of non-Bengalis the court heard.\n\nThe wedding was finally annulled and the child was taken in to care.\n\nIn a similar case the following year, Mr Justice Holman said: I have been told there are a number of incapacitated adults who have been the subject of arranged or forced marriages and that it is important to send a strong signal to the Muslim and Sikh communities that arranged marriages, where one party is mentally incapacitated, simply will not be tolerated.\n\nRachel Clawson, a former social worker and University of Nottingham academic specialising in forced marriage cases with disabled victims, told The Times:\n\nWe've come across all sorts of abusive issues where families have basically sold their son or daughter. Because families don't see these as forced marriages, lots of practitioners don't see them as forced marriages either.\n\nThey're worried about being perceived as racist or culturally insensitive. Most marriages take place overseas and people get visas to come over.\n\nReport: Ex-Labour Councillor and Immigration Lawyer Asama Javed Is Forced-Marriage Fixer for Girls as Young as 15 https://t.co/FChON70O39 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018
Mark Anthony Conditt died on Wednesday morning when he exploded a device in his car as police attempted to take him into custody. Less than 12 hours later, information about who the Austin Serial Bomber is beginning to emerge.\n\nThe man described by his former employer as quiet and introverted went on a three-week rampage that left two people dead, five people injured, and people across Austin, Travis County, and FedEx stores and processing facilities terrorized.\n\nEducation:\n\nConditt's family homeschooled him before he graduated and attended Austin Community College. He attended the local college for about two years, but did not graduate, KVUE reported. His formal education at the school ended in 2012.\n\nDuring his college years, Conditt appears to have written some conservative blog posts as part of an assignment, NBC News reported. The blog, Defining My Stance, provided a platform for a host postings ranging from anti-gay marriage to his positions on free abortions to why sex offender registrations should be ended. The posts were allegedly authored by a Mark A. Conditt, but NBC News said they were unable to confirm with school officials if the bomber actually wrote the posts.\n\nEmployment:\n\nConditt does not appear to have any kind of military or law enforcement service in his background. He worked for Crux Manufacturing for about four years, overlapping the time he spent at Austin Community College, the Austin ABC affiliate reported. His former boss said he hired the then-19-year-old because he seemed like a smart kid who showed a lot of promise. He reportedly worked in sales and purchasing and did a little bit of everything. However, after his performance slipped and he received several unheeded warnings, Crux Manufacturing let him go in August 2017.\n\nHis former employers described him as a quiet and introverted man who would prioritize things in his own way, KVUE reported.\n\nConditt listed work as a computer repair technician, according to his profile on a job recruiting website, the Austin American Statesman reported.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott told KXAN's Phil Prazan that Conditt was unemployed when he died and had no military background.\n\nPolitics:\n\nThe college blog posts allegedly written by Conditt paint a picture of a politically conservative person.\n\nI am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended, the blog page's profile states. The reasons I am taking this class is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.\n\nAgain, NBC could not confirm is the same Mark A. Conditt authored the posts on this blogsite.\n\nSome of the headlines on the 2012 blog read:\n\nWhy Gay Marriage Should be Illegal\n\nMy View on Free Abortions\n\nWhy We Might Want to Consider Doing Away with Sex Offender Registration\n\nAn Argument for the Death Penalty\n\nPersonality:\n\nConditt's neighbors paint a picture not dissimilar to that of his former employer. Jeff Reeb told NBC News that Conditt was a very normal kid and that his family was extremely nice.\n\nReeb told the Statesman that he struggled to wrap his mind about Conditt's actions. I know this is a cliché but I just can't imagine that, he explained about Conditt's involvement in the bombings. He said his grandson grew up with Conditt and they played together.\n\nHe is reported to be the oldest of four children.\n\nThe Bombings:\n\nThere is no reported criminal history in Conditt's past, several news outlets reported. That clear recorded ended on March 2 when Conditt allegedly delivered a package to the northeast Austin home of Anthony House. The package exploded and killed the 39-year-old black man.\n\nOn March 12, Conditt struck again by killing 17-year-old Draylen Mason in East Austin when a package exploded after he brought it inside his home. Mason's mother was also injured in the attack. A few hours later, Conditt also injured a 75-year-old Hispanic woman after she picked up a package on her front steps.\n\nOn March 19, two other young men were injured when Conditt changed his tactics. This time a tripwire bomb exploded — sending the two men to a local hospital.\n\nAustin Interim Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters that investigators believe the use of a tripwire in the fourth bomb shows a higher level of sophistication than already been demonstrated. He said it also indicates a shift in the serial bomber's strategy of targeting specific people to a more random style.\n\nThe randomness expanded when a package exploded at a FedEx processing facility in Schertz, Texas. A woman suffered ringing in her ears after the package exploded on an automated conveyor belt near her work location. Police tracked down a second package at a FedEx Ground facility in East Austin. Police later determined that package was an unexploded device.\n\nThe packages appeared to have been shipped from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, Texas, near the location of the fourth bombing.\n\nU.S. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-TX) told the Statesman that federal investigators obtained videos that could possibly show a suspect connected to the Schertz bombing.\n\nMcCaul told reporters that he hoped the bomber's biggest mistake was going through FedEx.\n\nIt was.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, law enforcement officials tracked down Conditt through a variety of techniques and identified the young man from Pflugerville as the suspect. Using cell phone technology, police tracked Conditt to a motel parking lot in neighboring Round Rock. A few hours later, Conditt killed himself by exploding a device inside his car.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThis is what we do not know about Mark Conditt. Police are continuing to investigate the young man's background and his Pflugerville home to search for clues as to why Conditt would suddenly launch a bombing attack that would kill two people, injur six others, and eventually take his own life.
Former Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Brad Grey died Sunday at his California home after a battle with cancer, his family has confirmed. He was 59.\n\nIn a statement, Grey's family confirmed that the former executive was surrounded by family and loved ones at his house in Holmby Hills when he passed away. A private funeral will be held later this week, while a public memorial service was set to be scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\nGrey exited Paramount in February after running the studio over a 12-year tenure that saw him oversee massive hits with films in the Star Trek and Transformers franchises.\n\nBefore taking the top job at Paramount, Grey co-founded the management agency Brillstein-Grey in the early 1980s, where he helped shepherd The Sopranos and Real Time with Bill Maher onto television, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nGrey was also a co-founder of production company Plan B with actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, where he helped produce Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Departed, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2006.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of our friend Brad Grey, whose tremendous kindness and talent inspired so many of us in the entertainment industry, Viacom owner Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone said in a statement. His vision and leadership at Paramount Pictures brought iconic films and programs to audiences around the world. We are so grateful for Brad's friendship.\n\nGrey is survived by his wife Cassandra, their son Jules, three grown children from a previous marriage, his mother Barbara Schumsky and siblings Michael and Robin Grey.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
Actor Terry Crews detailed his life-long battle with an addiction to pornography and revealed how it almost derailed his marriage in a three-part video series posted to Facebook.\n\nThe 47-year-old former NFL player and Brooklyn Nine-Nine star released his latest Dirty Little Secret Facebook video on Tuesday. In the first video posted earlier this month, the actor revealed he went to rehab for his addiction, and said it had really, really messed up life in a lot of ways.\n\nDirty Little Secret Posted by Terry Crews on Thursday, February 11, 2016\n\nIt became a thing where I didn't tell anybody, Crews says in the first video. It was my secret, nobody knew, and that allowed it to grow, and it got bad. If day turns into night and you are still watching, you probably got a problem, and that was me. I didn't tell my wife, didn't tell my friends, nobody knew.\n\nThe actor added that pornography can change the way human beings view each other, not as people but as objects and body parts.\n\nMy issue was and is with pornography is it changes the way you think about people. People become objects, people become body parts, they become things to be used rather than people to be loved, Crews said. You start to use people, you start to feel like you're the man and they're just whatever.\n\nIn the second clip, Crews said it was important not to let a sense of shame interfere in the battle against overcoming addiction.\n\nDirty Little Secret Part 2 Posted by Terry Crews on Wednesday, February 17, 2016\n\nShame doesn't say you did something bad, shame says you are bad, he said. And when you think and believe that you are bad, there's no way out. You say: 'You know what, forget it, I might as well use drugs, I might as well overeat, I might as well use porn.' Because if you believe that are bad, then you act accordingly. What you have to change is that paradigm in your life, you have to believe that you are good.\n\nDirty Little Secret part 3 Posted by Terry Crews on Tuesday, February 23, 2016\n\nIn the clip posted Tuesday, the actor revealed his pornography addiction became so bad he felt like my wife owed me sex.\n\nWhen you have a sense of entitlement, it's extremely dangerous, Crews said. What entitlement does is it gives you self-pity. And self-pity — it feels good. It feels good.\n\nEvery man out there desires intimacy. Every time you look at pornography, it's a desire for intimacy, he said. You are trying to fight your feelings of being alone by filling it with pornography in an attempt to feel that you are with someone and you know someone. But pornography is an intimacy killer. It kills all intimacy.\n\nCrews also cautioned both men and women to take more responsibility to combat the problem.\n\nYou cannot accept any pornography in your man's life. Anything that will make you feel denigrated, make you feel less than, you cannot accept it, he said.\n\nI'm calling on men to be more accountable. A true man and a true woman is a person who takes responsibility for everything in his life, good and bad, he added.\n\nWatch Crews' three-part Dirty Little Secret Facebook series above.
Things are about to change. Don't worry: it won't last forever. These things never do. It's a phase, and if you fly over it at 30,000 feet, what you will see is that all this social justice-systemic racism-defund the police nonsense comes down to one thing… The Democrat Party is returning to its soft-on-crime roots, and in the end, this will not end well for Democrats.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take a while for voters to come to their senses. Things are going to get worse before they get better — thankfully, this worsening will be contained in Democrat-run cities.\n\nNevertheless, the radical left is now emboldened and have the Democrat Party, academia, the media, countless district attorney offices, the government bureaucracy, corporate America, and Hollywood on the run… So until things get better (and I promise things will get better), here's my handy-dandy guide to surviving the coming era of social justice mob rule…\n\nGet the Hell Out of Democrat-Run Cities\n\nThis isn't an easy one to accomplish. I know because I've done it twice already. But you have to get out. The Democrats that run these cities did not only stand by as their cities were burned and looted, as predominantly black neighborhoods were burned and looted by predominantly white, left-wing terrorist groups like Antifa — these Democrats encouraged and continue to encourage burning and looting.\n\nI'm sorry, but the cities are lost to us now, and will be for years…\n\nWhen Democrats are releasing violent criminals, encouraging illegal immigration, and passing laws to disarm you while turning the police into eunuchs, it's over… Minneapolis is preparing to disband the police. Los Angeles just slashed police funding. New York is gearing up to slash police funding. I'm telling you, it's over…\n\nSo you have to get out now, especially if you own property because that property is about to become worthless.\n\nThis is not hyperbole. This is history repeating itself. The gangs and cartels are about to take over your city. Welcome back to the urban blight of the 1970s.\n\nNow… If you're a Democrat, you need to stay put. We don't need you voting to Californicate the rest of the country.\n\nMove to Rural America\n\nYou can try moving to the suburbs, I guess… But as your nearest Democrat-run city descends into hell, your taxes will explode. Plus, you'll be funding rotting schools, potholes, corrupt Democrat political machines, and self-destructive social justice programs.\n\nAlso, eventually, the blight moves outside the cities and into surrounding areas. Let me put it this way… If you do move to the suburbs, be prepared to move again the moment you see graffiti. Graffiti is always the beginning of the end.\n\nThe reason I recommend Rural America is because Democrats hate Rural America. They want their foofoo theaters and their foofoo cafes and their foofoo nightclubs. Rural America is Red America… I love it out here. Calm, peaceful, serene… Not a single drop of this social justice madness has touched my community.\n\nTo those of us out here in Rural America, all this mayhem is just a reality TV show we like to call Toldjaso!\n\nPrepare to Home School\n\nIf you can afford private school, great. If the public schools in your area are not yet polluted with social justice propaganda, great. But you must be prepared to home school because with the left emboldened and almost entirely in charge of academia, the last thing public schools will be teaching is reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\nYou need to keep a close eye on what your school is teaching because the left only wants to teach your kids to engage in loveless sex, the sanctity of abortion, why America is evil, that men are women and women are men, and that Global Warming is real. (It's not.)\n\nBe prepared to home school.\n\nBuy Guns and Plenty of Ammo\n\nThis is not a troll. This is not an attempt to be inflammatory. There's only one reason the left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter always-always-always focused their marauding in left-wing cities: they know the populace is defenseless.\n\nThese terrorists also know that once they move out into the suburbs, people are more likely to own guns.\n\nAnd they damn well know Rural America is armed to the teeth, so they will never come out here.\n\nFirearms are not only necessary for self-defense and for you to honor your primary responsibility in life, which is to protect your family and property; they're an excellent deterrent. I own four firearms. Two are within reach of my bed. Peace of mind, baby.\n\nIt's time to arm yourself.\n\nI would also recommend obtaining a conceal carry permit.\n\nCancel Your Cable TV\n\nCable news is poison. Hollywood's idea of entertainment today is either pushing sex on your children or straight-up propaganda. Why are you paying to pump this garbage into your home? What, you like paying $125 a month to have CNNLOL deliberately misinform you and then call you racist, to have MTV glorify degeneracy?\n\nThere are all kinds of streaming options out there, many of them free. You'll save money, protect your kids, and best of all, push CNNLOL, MSNBC, and the rest one step closer to history's dustbin.\n\nI've written extensively on this. Please click here, here, and here — okay, that last click is to celebrate the weekend.\n\nKeep Hard Copies of Your Favorite Books, Movies, and TV Shows\n\nSix years ago, almost to the day, I was roundly laughed at for warning people to hold on to their hard copies of Blazing Saddles and Gone with the Wind.\n\nYou see, I've been around long enough to have learned one very important lesson about the left: no matter how outrageous the idea might sound at the time, the left — with the help of its media machine — will eventually mainstream that idea.\n\nHey, we went from zero to gay marriage in ten years. We went from zero to drag queen story hour in ten seconds.\n\nSo when America's leftists began to complain about classic films and television shows that are problematic, I knew it was only a matter of time… Well, the time has come.\n\nAlready, and even though he is innocent of the allegation, Woody Allen — one of our greatest living filmmakers — had his latest film blacklisted, along with his career. The Walt Disney Company has blacklisted its own Song of the South. The creator of The Simpsons has blacklisted an episode of his own show. The Library Journal published an article calling for a ban on books guilty of whiteness, whatever the hell that is. The Little House books are being burned.\n\nAnd now the blacklisting push is ramping up….\n\nJust this week, the far-left Washington Post demanded an immediate and total shutdown of all police movies and TV shows.\n\nLegos is already blacklisting its own toys.\n\nLet me tell you exactly how this is going to work…\n\nThe fascist mob is going to declare certain toys, books, movies, and television shows problematic, and these corporations, that are either cowardly or infested with social justice warriors, are going to disappear these things. Problematic books, movies, and TV shows will vanish off proverbial store shelves — physical and digital.\n\nAnother possibility is that they will be mutilated by censors. Problematic scenes, moments, characters, and words will be removed.\n\nA couple of years ago, I decided to move my movie collection to digital. But after The Simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, I've gotten smarter. Even if I already have a digital copy, I went back and purchased hard copies of movies and TV shows that are wonderfully problematic.\n\nLet me tell you right now, if you don't own hard copies of Manhattan (and probably all of Woody Allen's movies), Married with Children, Gone with the Wind, and pretty much every one of Normal Lear's 1970's sitcoms (All in the Family, Sanford & Son, etc.), you will eventually lose them.\n\nSame with problematic books. Amazon will remove them from your Kindle.\n\nStock Up on Food and Water\n\nThe left-wing Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists will probably try to attack the suburbs and Rural America in an indirect way — going after power stations and the like. And if things get bad enough in the cities, we might see supply chains interrupted, so be prepared.\n\n—\n\nListen, out here in Rural America, we're going to be just fine. Don't be stressed. Don't live in fear — just be prepared. Being prepared is a great way to relieve anxiety.\n\nOverall, and as I said earlier, the left is eating its own. Let them fight. Enjoy the show. It's a total waste of time to try and care about people more than they care about themselves. Democrats are getting the blue on blue violence they voted for. It's not your problem. It's not my problem.\n\nWhile Blue America reaps the whirlwind, the rest of us should clean our guns, grill meat, and enjoy Al Bundy taunting fat women.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

CNN's Chris Cuomo once again defended the left-wing terrorist group Antifa, this time declaring them a good cause.\n\nThe far-left Cuomo's abiding affection for these black-clad, fully masked terrorists and the violence they commit, not just against neo-Nazis, but police officers, journalists, and everyday citizens, reveals a lot about the dangerous radicalism of the basement-rated CNN.\n\nLate last year Cuomo openly embraced political violence against the right with a fascist rant defending Antifa's brutality and bloodshed.\n\nIt's not about being right in the eyes of the law, Cuomo said in defense of Antifa, but you also have to know what's right and wrong in a moral, in a good and evil sense.\n\nThat's why people who show up to fight against bigots are not to be judged the same as the bigots, even if they do resort to the same kinds of petty violence, he added.\n\nFight.\n\nWhat you have there is a CNN anchor justifying violence against bigotry in a world where his fake news network is defining Christians as bigots for opposing gay marriage, Republicans as bigots for not voting for Barack Obama, and 16-year-old boys as bigots for wearing Make America Great Again hats.\n\nIn other words, Cuomo and CNN are justifying violence against all of us, everyone to the right of Bernie Sanders.\n\nCuomo once compared these Antifa terrorists, these modern-day brownshirts who attack police officers and regularly assault journalists, to the American servicemen who stormed the beaches at Normandy.\n\nThat's a not a joke. It's right here…\n\nBut-but-but they fight bigotry, Cuomo argues — which is like arguing we need to remember Mussolini kept the trains running on time, Hitler built the autobahn, Mao fought for equality, and Stalin threw good dinner parties…\n\nNow listen to Cuomo attempt to justify mob violence if it's in service to a good cause.\n\nYou can talk about Antifa, I've watched them in streets protesting in different situations, OK? Cuomo argued. There are certainly aspects of them that are true to a cause, that is a good cause, they want social justice, they want whatever they want in that context.\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo says Antifa is a good cause pic.twitter.com/mCMgoyPszQ — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 30, 2019\n\nSorry, decent people do not split hairs to excuse, champion, and encourage evil. Decent people remember that every one of history's monsters, from Hitler to Lenin to Castro to Pol Pot, believed they were fighting a good cause — some even believed they were fighting against bigotry and for social justice. So let's use this opportunity to examine Cuomo's definition of social justice.\n\nSome of you might remember that Fredo's twisted idea of social justice is to expose young girls to a penis without their consent.\n\nAnd let's not forget that Cuomo's warped idea of social justice also includes a return to McCarthyism, to a dark era where we blacklist people who express inappropriate ideas.\n\nCuomo's guest Steve Cortes tried reasoning with him.\n\nChris, Antifa is not a good cause, he said. Antifa does not have good aims, Antifa wants power, wants political power, taken through force. That's what Antifa is all about.\n\nBut Cuomo already knows this. Fredo's watched Antifa assault police offers, assault journalists, terrorize Tucker Carlson's wife, assault everyday people simply enjoying their right to assemble, and like the Southern Democrats of old, he's watched Antifa bully a black woman out of a restaurant.\n\nForget all that, though, and ask yourself on what planet does a decent person even attempt to defend a gang of thugs who dress all in black, wear masks, and brandish weapons?\n\nWell, that planet is called CNN.\n\nYou see, Antifa is okay with CNN because Antifa are their brownshirts, their terrorists, their violent gang of thugs taking it to we Trumptards who dare to point and laugh at CNN, who dare not recognize CNN's authority and wisdom.\n\nHere's some truth: CNN thrills over the petty ultra-violence Antifa unleashes against the political right. In the sick and sinister minds that run that Hate Network, Trump supporters got it coming, which is why — and this is important…\n\nCuomo and his far-left confederates regularly encourage these terrorists.\n\nThat's what's really going on here.\n\nCuomo's not just splitting the Hitler-and-the-autobahn hair to keep the debunked Charlottesville Hoax alive, he is using every opportunity to fire off a dogwhistle, to give his brownshirts a wink of encouragement and a nod of approval.\n\nCNN's association with, encouragement of, and affection for political violence has been well documented over the years, and as we get closer to the 2020 presidential election, it is only going to get worse… Much worse.\n\nAll Cuomo is doing here is prepping a battlefield CNN wants to see bloodied.\n\nP.S. Eighty-nine million who do not watch CNN are subsidizing this hate. Are you one of them?\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.
NASA's aircraft is roughly the size of a softball and weighs less than four pounds. It will make five autonomous flights above the surface of Mars in 2021.\n\nThe miniature aircraft will spin its rotors at about ten times the speed of a terrestrial one, due to the extremely low density of Mars' atmosphere — only about one percent of Earth's. JPL Mars Helicopter Project Manager MiMi Aung explained that the altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet [12,000 meters], and when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet [30,000 m] up. Therefore, designers had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.\n\nIn an official statement posted to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration website, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said, NASA has a proud history of firsts. The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to Mars.\n\nTexas Representative John Culberson praised the effort. It's fitting that the United States of America is the first nation in history to fly the first heavier-than-air craft on another world, Culberson said. This exciting and visionary achievement will inspire young people all over the United States to become scientists and engineers, paving the way for even greater discoveries in the future.\n\nThe craft will launch onboard the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July 2020 and is expected to arrive on Mars in February 2021. Because of its immense distance — Earth will be several minutes away, traveling at the speed of light — Aung said that direct control will be impossible. Instead, the craft will have an autonomous capability that will be able to receive and interpret commands from the ground, and then fly the mission on its own.\n\nNASA Science Mission Directorate Associate Administrator Thomas Zurbuchen said that the project exemplifies a successful marriage of science and technology innovation and is a unique opportunity to advance Mars exploration for the future.\n\nAfter the Wright Brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained, and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, he said, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world.

Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the Vatican's former doctrinal czar, warned against Catholics who long for a meta-religion of world unity in a January 1 homily in Phoenix.\n\nSome Catholics want the Church to modernize, abandoning its doctrines for the sake of building a new religion of world unity, Müller warned thousands of Catholics gathered in Phoenix for the 2020 Student Leadership Summit hosted by the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS).\n\nIn order to be admitted to this meta-religion, the only price the Church would have to pay is giving up her truth claim, the cardinal told the students. No big deal, it seems, as the relativism dominant in our world anyway rejects the idea that we could actually know the truth and presents itself as guarantor of peace between all world views and world religions.\n\nThe post-Christian world welcomes these efforts to remake the Church as a convenient civil religion, Müller said.\n\nThe German cardinal tied his remarks to claims by the late Jesuit cardinal Carlo Maria Martini that the Church was 200 years behind the times and needed to modernize in order to catch up.\n\nFor some, the Catholic Church is lagging behind by 200 years compared to where the world is today. Is there any truth to this accusation? Müller asked the group.\n\nIt is surely no coincidence that Pope Francis had cited this same quotation in a positive sense just days before Christmas in an address to the Roman Curia, calling for epochal change while insisting that resistance to change always hides some mental disorder.\n\nThe Church has remained 200 years behind the times. Why has it not been shaken up? Are we scared? Fear instead of courage? Pope Francis cited Martini to the Curia, adding that these are words that should make us think.\n\nThere is always a temptation to fall back on the past, Francis continued in his Dec. 21 address, because it is more reassuring, known and, certainly less conflictual. Yet this too is part of the process and the risk of undertaking significant changes.\n\nIt would not be unreasonable to suggest that Cardinal Müller's homily Wednesday was in fact a response to the pope's call for modernization.\n\nAccording to Müller, the crisis facing the Catholic Church today has arisen from attempts to align with secular culture while abandoning the teachings of the faith in the process.\n\nThe crisis in the Church is man-made and has arisen because we have cozily adapted ourselves to the spirit of a life without God, the cardinal said.\n\nThe poison paralyzing the Church is the opinion that we should adapt to the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, and not the spirit of God, he said, that we should relativize God's commandments and reinterpret the doctrine of the revealed faith.\n\nSome people in the Church are longing for a Catholicism without dogmas, without sacraments, and without an infallible magisterium, Müller proposed.\n\nIn his homily, Müller told the students that the antidote to secularization within the Church is a life of faith, since people of faith do not crave the gratifications that the world offers.\n\nThe one who believes needs no ideology, he said. The one who hopes will not reach for drugs. The one who loves is not after the lust of this world, which passes along with the world. The one who loves God and his neighbor finds happiness in the sacrifice of self-giving.\n\nWe will be happy and free when in the spirit of love we embrace the form of life to which God has called each one of us personally: in the sacrament of marriage, in celibate priesthood, or in religious life according to the three evangelical counsels of poverty, obedience and chastity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, he said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
For the first time in more than 130 years of record-keeping, young adults in the United States are more likely living with mom and dad than they are living with a spouse or partner.\n\nThirty-two percent of millennials adults aged 18-34 were living in their parents' home in 2014, compared to 31.6 percent of millennials who live with a spouse or significant other, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data.\n\nAnother 14 percent of millennials live alone, or else are single parents. Twenty-two percent live in other circumstances.\n\nThis turn of events is fueled primarily by the dramatic drop in the share of young Americans who are choosing to settle down romantically before age 35, Pew's analysis reads.\n\nDating back to 1880, the most common living arrangement among young adults has been living with a romantic partner, whether a spouse or a significant other, it continues. This type of arrangement peaked around 1960, when 62% of the nation's 18- to 34-year-olds were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, and only one-in-five were living with their parents.\n\nAs Pew reports, the trend is most prevalent among young men, with 35 percent of male millennials opting for the comforts of mom and dad's home, compared to 28 percent who were living with a spouse or partner in their own place.\n\nYoung women, on the other hand, are actually more likely to be living with a spouse (35 percent) than their parents (29 percent).\n\nMarriage and cohabitation have been on the decline since 1990, according to Pew, which projects that one-in-four millennials will never marry. In addition to the decline in marriage, Pew also cites the economy as a central fact causing the adults' retreat to mom and dad's house — simply put, fewer young men have decent jobs.\n\nThe share of young men with jobs peaked around 1960 at 84%. In 2014, only 71% of 18 to 34-year-old men were employed, Pew reports. Similarly with earnings, young men's wages (after adjusting for inflation) have been on a downward trajectory since 1970 and fell significantly from 2000 to 2010. As wages have fallen, the share of young men living in the home of their parent(s) has risen.\n\nThe phenomena also varies among racial and ethnic groups. Black (36 percent) and Hispanic (36 percent) young adults are more likely to live at home than are white (30 percent) young adults.\n\nWhite young adults are more likely to be living with a spouse or partner (36%), the report reads. But the trends are similar for all major racial and ethnic groups including whites: Since 1960, a greater share are living at home and fewer are married or [are] cohabiting and living in their own household.

The Vatican has announced in a statement this week that Pope Paul VI will be canonized in Rome next October with Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was killed in 1980 while celebrating Mass.\n\nPaul VI was pope from 1963 to 1978 and oversaw the close of the Second Vatican Council, which introduced sweeping changes in the church, including the introduction of the use of local languages in the liturgy and a rapprochement between Catholics and other religions, notably the Jews.\n\nThe pope's most controversial move during his tumultuous, 15-year pontificate was the publication of the 1968 encyclical letter titled Humanae Vitae (On Human Life), which confirmed the church's longstanding teaching regarding the immorality of the use of contraceptives to avoid pregnancy. Many inside and outside the church had expected Paul to overturn traditional teaching on contraception, along with the majority of the members of a special commission Paul had set up to study the question.\n\nAs Paul himself noted:\n\nWithin the commission itself, there was not complete agreement concerning the moral norms to be proposed, and … certain approaches and criteria for a solution to this question had emerged which were at variance with the moral doctrine on marriage constantly taught by the magisterium of the Church.\n\nPope Francis has significantly chosen the year 2018—the fiftieth anniversary of Humanae Vitae—for the canonization of Pope Paul VI. Francis has often voiced his personal esteem for Paul VI and has held up Humanae Vitae as a critically important document for today's world.\n\nIn his 2016 letter, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), Francis cited Humanae Vitae four times, praising the way that Paul had brought out the intrinsic bond between conjugal love and the generation of life.\n\nThe teaching of the Encyclical Humanae Vitae ought to be taken up anew, Francis wrote, in order to counter a mentality that is often hostile to life.\n\nPope John Paul II spent the first five years of his 27-year papacy explaining the theology underlying Humanae Vitae in a series of weekly addresses in what he described as a theology of the body. As Michael Waldstein has written, One of the main goals of the theology of the body is the defense of Paul VI's prophetic encyclical Humanae Vitae.\n\nTen years ago, in a conference commemorating Humanae Vitae's 40th anniversary, Pope Benedict XVI referred to the encyclical as crucial for humanity's future, declaring that it constituted on the part of Paul VI a significant show of courage in reasserting the continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition.\n\nVatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin reportedly said Tuesday that the canonization ceremony of Paul VI and Oscar Romero will take place in late October following a meeting of the Synod of Bishops.\n\nPope Francis beatified Paul VI in 2014 after a first miracle was attributed to his intercession. In early February, a Vatican commission consisting of theologians and doctors approved a second miracle attributed to him by a unanimous vote.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

President Obama's statement on gun control Tuesday included an attempt to dismiss claims he ultimately wants to undermine the 2nd Amendment:\n\nNow, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.\n\nNot a very convincing performance. Is there any other Amendment to the Constitution the president would downplay in this way? Saying, It's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th Amendment.\n\nIf the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. President Obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.\n\n1.) Here's the president swearing repeatedly, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\n\nAs it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. In November 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. As you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.\n\nA month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. It was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.\n\n2.) It wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about Obamacare. He also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.\n\nUnfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.\n\n3.) Before he became president, Obama told Pastor Rick Warren, I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJhQBZ1La0w\n\nHard to be more clear than that. Obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. And then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. Finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. But had he really? According to chief strategist David Axelrod, Obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:\n\nAxelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.\n\nObama reportedly told Axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, I'm just not very good at bullshitting. Based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd Amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it.
A gay guidance counselor suspended from a Catholic high school is pushing to change the policy of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis that bans employees who are in same-sex marriages – even though she signed a contract stating she understood the expectations of employees of the Catholic archdiocese.\n\nShelly Fitzgerald said she was suspended from her job as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School, a Catholic school that is overseen by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, Indiana, after it was discovered she had married another woman.\n\nA report at ABC affiliate rtv6 stated Fitzgerald posted to her Facebook account:\n\nSomeone sought out my marriage certificate from Hancock County and turned it into Joe Hollowell (the school's chief administrator). He then turned it over to the Archbishop of Indianapolis, the superintendent and Chuck Weisenbach [Roncalli school principal].\n\nThe report continues that Fitzgerald, who had been employed at the school for 15 years, says she met with the school's administrator and principal and was given the options of resigning, dissolving her marriage, or wait it out and stay quiet and maybe I can make it the rest of the year, but they will not renew my contract next year.\n\nI love my wife very much, Fitzgerald said. I didn't have any intention to resign a job that I adore. For me to walk out was like saying I didn't want to be there anymore and that wasn't the case.\n\nIndiana state Rep. Dan Forestal, a Democrat, said he will intervene in the case by trying to block schools whose religious beliefs oppose same-sex marriage from receiving taxpayer voucher funds.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nRoncalli is a private school but they also receive state funding through Indiana's School Choice Voucher program. An annual report from the Indiana Department of Education shows that the school received more than $1.5 million in taxpayer dollars last year.\n\nRoncalli should not be rewarded with state dollars if they choose to discriminate against employees simply based on who they love, Forestal said.\n\nAs Fox59 reported, Fitzgerald has hired an attorney, David Page, who refused to give details about his client's signed contract due to the possibility of future litigation.\n\nIn a statement, the Catholic school has said as role models for students, the personal conduct of every teacher, guidance counselor, administrator and staff member, both at school and away from school, must convey and be supportive of the teachings of the Catholic Church, the report continued.\n\nPage said his client was barred from the campus and her school email account.\n\n[S]he was heartbroken and stunned, Page said. Stunned is the word she uses most often.\n\nThe attorney added that everyone at the school knew she was gay.\n\nFitzgerald has received an outpouring of support via an online petition signed by over 15,000 supporters.\n\nThe petition states:\n\nAfter a nosey member of the community found out Shelly Fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. Not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. For 15 years, Shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School (RHS), a Catholic High School in Indiana. And when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. They gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. Shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. And she plans to hire a lawyer. But should she have to? The school says they have every right to force Shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the Catholic Church both in and out of school. That includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\nOne Roncalli board member, Daniel Parker, resigned from his post in support of Fitzgerald because she has been his child's guidance counselor.\n\nClearly, we are doing something right when our young students and graduates understand better than some older adults that love is love, commitment is commitment, and marriage is marriage no matter who opens their heart to those wonderful gifts from God, Parker said.\n\nRoncalli High School is named for Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, who became Pope John XXIII and, since his canonization, is now referred to as Saint John XXIII.
A Muslim from Sunderland who started a polygamy matchmaking website for men seeking multiple Sharia marriages says that monogamy is not in tune with man's nature and believes he has already been responsible for 100 'weddings'.\n\nAzad Chaiwala, 33, who launched Secondwife.com in 2014 followed by Polygamy.com this year, claims that both sites have 70,000 members looking for polygamous marriages.\n\nUnapologetic about his own desire for multiple wives, he told his own wife early on in their marriage, which was arranged by his family, that she would not be the only one.\n\nHowever, in seeking a second wife Mr. Chaiwala admitted that none of his family wanted to help saying there was a taboo about the subject, reports The Times.\n\nNoting that there were dating sites catering to every niche, desire, and fetish, he said: I think polygamy is more in tune with [man's] nature than monogamy.\n\nChaiwala's Sharia marriage websites were directly cited in the review on social integration by cohesion advisor Dame Louise Casey on how foreign cultural practices contrary to British values are being tolerated. The report largely blames the tolerance of regressive cultures for segregation and said that pressure should be put on migrants to integrate.\n\nThe practice of unregistered polygamy appears to be more commonplace than might be expected, Dame Louise said. The existence of matchmaking sites like secondwife.com and the prevalence of unregistered marriage is particularly concerning.\n\nHer report said that there were approximately 100,000 Sharia marriages, many of which are not recognised by UK law and therefore do not offer the same legal protections to women in cases of divorce. A sizeable proportion of these 'marriages' are thought to be polygynous (specifically where a man has multiple wives).\n\nBaroness Cox, a cross-bench member of the House of Lords, said in October that polygamy is commonplace within Muslim communities in Britain, with husbands fathering as many as 20 children by four wives.\n\nShe explained: Under sharia law, a husband is entitled to up to four wives providing he takes responsibility for making appropriate provision for all. In many Muslim communities in this country, polygamy is commonplace although as a nation bigamy is legally forbidden.\n\nWitnesses to the Commons Home Affairs Committee, as part of the broader inquiry into Sharia councils, have warned that the number of polygynous marriages is on the rise.\n\nThey point out that whilst polygamy is illegal, there is no requirement for a civil, legal, ceremony to precede a Sharia marriage. This means that imams are under no obligation to refuse to perform a marriage because the man is already married.\n\nAina Khan, a leading family lawyer specialising in Islamic marriages, said that the Marriage Act was out of date.\n\nIt dates back to 1949 and only Anglicans, Jews and Quakers must register their religious ceremony with the register office . . . Now nearly three million Muslims, with origins from many countries, live here.\n\nNoting that having more than one wife was an outward sign of religiosity, Ms. Khan said that of the couples who came to her seeking to separate, a quarter involved polygynous issues.\n\nIt is not a recipe for a happy marriage. They do not last, she said.\n\nIn 2015 Amra Bone, who was the UK's first female Sharia council judge, said that the government cannot…ask Muslims not to have more than one wife. People have a right to decide for themselves.
A coalition of anti-racist, gay rights and student groups are preparing to sue Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for allegedly hosting hate speech but continuing to censor pornographic content.\n\nFrance's largest anti-racism group, SOS Racism, the Jewish Students' Union (UEJF), and a group called SOS Homophobie have released the results of a social media survey carried out between the 31st of March and the 10th of May.\n\nIt claimed to find 586 examples of content that is racist, anti-semitic or homophobic, denies the Holocaust or seeks to justify terrorism or crimes against humanity. They insist this is in breach of the law in France, which has sweeping protections against hate speech.\n\nAccording to Humanité, the report went on to say that of the 586 reported cases of alleged hate material, only four per cent were removed from Twitter, seven per cent from YouTube, and 34 per cent from Facebook.\n\nThe term hate speech is notably broad and open to wide interpretation. It has been appropriated to cover anything from mild criticism of Islam, gay marriage and mass migration, to neo-Nazi and Islamist propaganda.\n\nIf the French groups win their case, it could result in even more conservative material disappearing from the accused social media platforms.\n\nSacha Reingewirtz, President of UEJF, slammed the tech firms for not removing perceived offensive content or revealing how they choose stories to occupy their trending news section.\n\nGiven the profits Youtube, Twitter and Facebook make in France, and the few taxes they pay, their refusal to invest in the fight against hatred is unacceptable, she said.\n\nShe added: The mystery surrounding the functioning of the moderation teams of social networks prevents any serious progress in reducing racist and anti-Semitic messages. Since the major platforms do not respect French law, not even their own conditions, they will have to face justice.\n\nDominique Sopo, president of SOS Racisme, argued that female breasts should be splashed across social media, saying:\n\nTwitter, YouTube and Facebook cannot continue to use soothing words to cover their inaction on moderation.\n\nThese platforms seem more shocked by toplessness, which is promptly censored, than the incitement to hatred against persons or groups of persons. Our lawsuit against them is to enforce a right that they must now fully comply with.\n\nGilles Dehais President of SOS Homophobia, said: Despite an effort to address hate speech when it is reported, this testing campaign shows the lack of responsiveness to flagged content via the current route.\n\nWe regret that the majority of Internet players still do not implement sufficient means to protect their users from homophobic, biphobic and transphobic sentiments, and enforce French law.
Thirty-year-old millennials' fortunes, sex lives, and income are all pitiful compared to what their fathers enjoyed at age 30, according to Axios.\n\nMillennial men pay 2.5 times as much for college, have triple the debt, have half the chance of being married, fewer kids, and are much less likely to own a home, according to the data presented by Axios.\n\nOver the last 4 decades, young Americans have paid more for education even as their incomes have stayed flat. The result? WAY more debt, and fewer adult rites of passage like marriage and homeownership. Explore the numbers: https://t.co/AfhXddTbim via @axiosvisuals @axios pic.twitter.com/EcF3fq60qv — Harry Stevens (@Harry_Stevens) July 23, 2018\n\nAxios reported that compared to 30 years ago:\n\nMen are more likely to earn less. In 1975, only a quarter of 25 to 34-year-old men made less than $30K per year, but that number rose to 41% in 2016. Going deeper: As a measure of upward mobility, 92% of 30-year-olds in 1970 earned more than their parents at that age, according to a 2016 study led by Raj Chetty, a Stanford economist (h/t Roger Lowenstein). But of those who were 30 in 2014, just half earned more. [Economist Raj] Chetty attributed most of this erosion to slower GDP growth and a change in the distribution of GDP favoring higher earners: GDP would have to rise by 6% a year to get the same impact, he said, and wealth would have to be distributed much more evenly.\n\nMillennial women are individually better off than their mothers — but the women's husbands are the millennial men.\n\nMissing from Axios, however, is any mention of the causes, such as the federal government's immigration policy of importing one new worker for every four Americans who graduate school or college each year.\n\nThis massive 25 percent inflation of the labor supply is widely ignored by economists who struggle to understand why young men earn so much less than their parents. The new-labor inflation is made worse by the government's policy of importing temporary workers for good jobs in the expanding professional sectors. Roughly 1.5 million foreign guest-workers now hold jobs in healthcare, technology, academia and other sectors, even as young American college graduates struggle to pay off debts.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Hire American campaign would modestly curb the inflow of immigrants and foreign workers, but it is strongly opposed by progressives, Democrats and business-first Republicans.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market — but the government provides green cards to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and temporary work-permits to roughly 3 million foreign workers.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with foreign labor. That process spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. The policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
A new study shows there's much more depression, obesity and suicidal tendencies among adults raised by same-sex couples than among adults raised by a normal family of complementary male and female parents.\n\nAccording to the study, which tracks the development of children to adulthood, 51 percent of those raised by same-sex couples had experienced depression, compared to only 19.7 percent of those raised in normal married households.\n\nBy age 28 a cohort of children raised by same-sex parents are 2.25 times more likely to experience depression than is the general population. Adult onset depression is associated with a more frequent history of abuse victimization, obesity, stigma, and distance from one or both parents.\n\nThirty percent of adults from gay households fanaticized about suicide as an adult, compared to 7 percent from normal households. A whopping 71.9 percent of adults raised in gay homes reported obesity, compared to 37 percent from opposite-sex homes.\n\nThe study shows more kids raised by gays reported that a parent or caregiver had slapped, hit, or kicked them. More of them said they were touched in a sexual way or forced to touch someone in a sexual way or were forced into sex relations.\n\nThe study flies in the face of recent claims by gay advocates that there is no difference between being raised by gays or by straights.\n\nThe study used data from the non-partisan National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and was produced by Professor Paul Sullins of the Leo Initiative. He's worked with the Department of Sociology at the Catholic University of America for many years.\n\nThe major limitation of of the study is that the database contained information on kids raised by only twenty same-sex couples. But there are very few children raised by gays at all, let alone over a long period. Even so, as sociologist Mark Regnerus says of this study, This makes the same-sex household estimates displayed in the graph imprecise, but it does nothing to undermine the significance of the differences between groups.\n\nThe study has already come under attack from gay blogs that tend to pounce on any negative data.\n\nAt the urging of gay bloggers, in 2012, Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin was investigated by his university and attempts were made to bring him up on charges and get him fired for reaching much the same conclusions as Sullins has reached. Though the University of Texas backed him up and the journal that published his paper has not withdrawn it, he still comes under bitter criticism from gay advocates.\n\nThinkProgress has tried to smear Sullins for his religious faith and his priesthood. The author, Zack Ford, a columnist and not an expert in sociological research, called the study hugely flawed and ran a picture of Sullins in his priestly garb. He also complained that the study was carried out on children raised by gays prior to the legalization of gay marriage, proposing that marriage will make all the difference in outcomes for kids.\n\nEven liberal advocates admit that children do best when raised by their own mom and dad. Secular sociologist Sara McLanahan of Princeton University and other secular experts have reported for decades that children do best within normal families.
Conservative David Benham was arrested outside of a clinic in North Carolina over the weekend for allegedly violating the state and federal coronavirus rules. Prior to the outbreak, it was legal for pro-life advocates to gather at a certain distance outside of abortion clinics to offer women alternatives to ending the life of their unborn child.\n\nDavid and his twin brother, Jason, gained fame as successful businessmen who were offered a show on the Home and Garden TV channel but were abruptly fired after their Christian worldview was revealed, including their support for traditional marriage between a man and a woman and respecting life from conception to natural death.\n\nDavid Benham posted a video of his interaction with police on the brothers' Facebook page.\n\nThat abortion clinic exceeds the number of ten, David Benham said, referring to the federal government guidance that no groups larger than ten people should gather in one place.\n\nDavid Benham told the police arresting him that he and the others outside of the clinic were there with a group that helps at-risk mothers and babies.\n\nWe are within our rights to be here, David Benham said. We are practicing social distancing. We have cleaned our hands, and we are offering help to these mothers.\n\nAnd if you are saying we don't have the right to be here then go in the abortion clinic and make the arrests there, Benham said to an officer, who said he did not have the authority to go inside the clinic.\n\nI appreciate your serving, David Benham said. I appreciate everything that you do for us, but this is wrong and you know it.\n\nThe Christian Post reported on David Benham speaking with the Daily Wire about his arrest:\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Wire, Benham said, This is selective enforcement of the law. You are coming after us because we're standing in front of an abortion clinic … I am not going to let the government have unlimited power and use this crisis to their advantage. Benham says his federally recognized public charity, Cities For Life, is considered an essential service. However, police officers claimed that more than 10 people had gathered, an accusation that Benham denied.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) offered his friend support on social media, calling the arrest unconstitutional.\n\nMy friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic, Cruz tweeted. If NC deems abortion 'essential,' then pregnancy care services are as well. This is WRONG; Governor Cooper should be ashamed.\n\nWATCH: My friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic.

As President Trump requests full funding for a border wall along the United States-Mexico border, elected Democrats continue to claim that walls are immoral and racist.\n\nFrom the walls surrounding Vatican City to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) iron fence, below, Breitbart News breaks down 20 walls, fences, and barriers from around the world.\n\n1. The Walls of Vatican City and St. Peter's Square\n\nThough Pope Francis has routinely blasted the enforcement of international borders, Vatican City and St. Peter's Square are completely walled off from Italy.\n\n2. Hillary Clinton's Home Privacy Fence in Chappaqua\n\nFailed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lives peacefully in her upstate Chappaqua, New York home, which is walled off from the general public by a giant white privacy wall. Passersby can barely get a glimpse of Clinton's home, as she the wall stretches across the front, and trees act as a natural barrier for security.\n\n3. Israel's Border Fence\n\nIsrael has had one of the most effective border fences and walls in the world, decreasing illegal immigration to the country by 100 percent after it was constructed and built.\n\n4. Hollywood's Walled Off Awards Shows\n\nWhen Hollywood's elite have their annual awards shows, such asthe Academy Awards (Oscars), they have automatic guaranteed security at their ceremonies. Pictured below, the Oscars keep pedestrians and bystanders out of the general area by erecting tall chain link fences around the grounds of the red carpet. The fencing around the borders keeps celebrities safe.\n\n5. North Carolina's Supermax Prison Fence\n\nButner, North Carolina, is home to one of the country's multiple Federal Correctional complexes. As seen in photos, this maximum security prison has various layers of fencing, all covered with barbed wire from top to bottom.\n\n6. Obama's Backyard Brick Barrier\n\nWhen former President Obama moved out of the White House, he moved into this Kalorama Heights neighborhood home in Washington, D.C. The home has a side gate and fence, as well as a full brick and concrete barrier in the backyard.\n\n7. The 2016 Democratic National Convention's Security Walls\n\nThough failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke out against border walls for the U.S., her 2016 Democratic National Convention made sure to keep protesters and Bernie Sanders supporters out of the general area by erecting steel and iron fences. Sanders supporters can be seen standing plastered outside the barriers where police and guards stood opposite, ensuring no person made it past the fence.\n\n8. Barbed Wire Fence at Guantanamo Bay\n\nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, holds some of the most brutal suspected and convicted terrorists in the world. The facility is surrounded, as shown in photos, by not only 24-hour security guards, but also a number of barbed wire fences.\n\n9. The Gates of Chateau de Versailles\n\nThe Castle of Versaille near Paris, France is one of the most recognizable barriers in the Western world. This beautifully gold fence and gate keep the castle safe and secure. Barriers don't have to be eyesores. Versaille proves that.\n\n10. Hungary's Migrant Crisis Fix\n\nPerhaps no other European nation has a border as secure as Hungary. The populist-nationalist Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, decided to fully guard his country's borders with this fence as a response to the continent's migrant crisis.\n\n11. Bill Gates' Gates\n\nTech billionaire Bill Gates professes a globalist worldview, but his own home off of Lake Washington has not only giant gates guarding it from outsiders, but also is meticulously surrounded by natural barriers like trees, hedges, and water.\n\n12. Largest Nuclear Power Plant's Secure Fence\n\nThe country's largest nuclear power plant, Palo Verde Nuclear, in Phoenix, Arizona, is safely secured with multi-layered fencing and barbed wire, even as it sits far into the desert.\n\n13. Elizabeth Warren's Iron Fence\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has repeatedly said she opposes border walls and barriers for the U.S., but her home and yard in Cambridge, Massachusettes,is lined with an iron fence. The fence serves as security to safeguard her home from those walking on the sidewalk.\n\n14. 2020 Olympics Construction Barriers\n\nAs Tokyo, Japan prepares for the 2020 Summer Olympic games, crews have built barriers around construction sites to protect the facilities. These barriers have been captured in photos, where guards can be seen opening and closing the barrier to allow more crew members into the secure location.\n\n15. Royal Gates of Buckingham Palace\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is securely protected by royal guards and a beautiful fence outside her working residence at Buckingham Palace, London, England. Tourists on the street must view the palace from behind the fence, which is adorned with detailed sculpted columns and the Royal Family's crest.\n\n16. Bill de Blasio's Brick Wall\n\nFor a self-professed liberal, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) sure enjoys the protection that comes with having a brick wall around his home, Gracie Mansion, on the Upper East Side. These photos show how de Blasio's house is completely secured by a brick wall and iron gates.\n\n17. Oklahoma's Prison Fence\n\nEl Reno, Oklahoma, is home to one of the country's many Federal Correctional institutions. This facility, which former President Obama visited in 2015, is surrounded by a chain link fence and barbed wire. The entrance of the facility is secured with a steel-slatted gate as prison guards patrol the grounds.\n\n18. Paul Ryan's Personal Sovereignty\n\nDespite former House Speaker Paul Ryan's admiration for open borders, when it comes to his own living quarters, he prefers personal security and sovereignty. Ryan's Wisconsin home is surrounded by a fence and brick columns, coupled with a natural barrier.\n\n(Breitbart News)\n\n19. Bulgaria's Border Fence\n\nSimilar to Hungary, Bulgaria has erected a border fence on the Bulgarian-Turkish border to prevent illegal immigration. Both barriers are lined along the top with barbed wire and guarded by border patrol.\n\n20. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's Mansion\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) has spoken out against border walls for the U.S., but when it comes to his personal security, he prefers iron gates and fences. At this governor's mansion in Albany, New York, Cuomo enjoys security and protection thanks to a chain link fence and sculptured iron gates.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened the program by reacting to Sen-elect Mitt Romney's (R-UT) public critique of President Donald Trump.\n\nCarlson reminded viewers of Romney's path to prosperity at Bain Capital and how his exploitation of the finance-based economy had implications on real Americans. Carlson said it was indicative of the broader problem of how the ruling class is harming the country overall, which led to the election of Trump.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nGood evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\n\nRomney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\n\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\n\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\n\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?\n\nThese are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\n\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\n\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\n\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\n\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\n\nThere was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.\n\nTwo different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\n\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\n\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\n\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.\n\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\n\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.\n\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\n\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\n\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\nInternalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\n\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first.
On Tuesday, Manny Pacquiao, Fighter of the Decade for the 2000s according to the Boxing Writers Association of America and Ring Magazine, apologized for remarks in which he called homosexuality something that even animals don't try.\n\nPacquiao refused to retract his opposition to gay marriage.\n\nPacquiao had responded to an inquiry from the TV5 network in which they asked celebrities about same-sex marriage, which he opposes. He asserted, It's just common sense. Have you seen any animal having male-to-male or female-to-female relations? Adding that even animals understand gender differences, he opined, if you have male-to-male or female-to-female [relationships], then people are worse than animals.\n\nPacquiao's comments sparked outrage, as TV host Jose Marie Viceral, tweeted that lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people are humans, not animals. Danton Remoto, chairman of the LGBT group Ladlad, pointing out Pacquiao's position in the Philippines House of Representatives and his current campaign for a Senate seat, echoed, He is running for a national position and he should be a senator of everybody, not just over-the-hill boxers and straight people. He said that Pacquiao and his advisers should adhere to current political correctness, sniping, Otherwise, they would be left behind in the Dark Ages, when the cavemen ruled and the numbskulls roamed the earth,.\n\nLesbian singer Aiza Seguerra ripped Pacquiao on Instagram: You might've done our country proud but with your statement, you just showed the whole country why we shouldn't vote for you. And yes, I think you are an ignorant, bigoted hypocrite.\n\nPacquiao backed down on a Facebook video, stating: I'm sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals. Please forgive me for those I've hurt. But in an Instagram post, he simply stated:\n\nI rather obey the Lord's command than obeying the desires of the flesh. Im not condemning anyone, but I'm just telling the truth of what the Bible says. The truth from the Bible is what changed me from my old ways. 1 Corinthians 6:9 [9] Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men. God Bless everyone i love you all.\n\nIn 2012, the Los Angeles shopping center The Grove banned Pacquiao from its grounds after an interview in The National Examiner wrongly attributed remarks to Pacquiao. The 57-6-2 fighter later told The Los Angeles Times, What I said is a reporter asked me about gay marriage … I am against gay marriage, but I'm not condemning gays. I have family — a cousin — who's gay, and friends too. I'm just against gay marriage. I don't even want to talk about the issue, but I was asked about it, so I gave my opinion.\n\nPacquiao plans to retire from boxing after his rubber match with Timothy Bradley on April 9.
With the Russia Collusion Hoax debunked forever, the corrupt establishment media are now in a mad scramble to manufacture a different kind of anxiety against President Trump, this time using multiple artificial hysterias.\n\nHonestly, any rational person who lives in the real world — and I like to count myself among that group — must be baffled by the news media's ongoing meltdown; the screech of one crisis after another, which reflects nothing close to reality.\n\nFor example: Yesterday, I paid 98 cents for a dozen eggs. My 401(k) is kicking butt. No one I know is struggling to find work, which was definitely not the case a few years ago. American servicemen are not coming home in body bags. There are no race riots, which also wasn't the case a few years ago. There seems to be fewer domestic terror attacks. For the last two years global temperatures have dropped and this year, so far, has certainly been a cool one.\n\nUnemployment has reached record lows. Wages are rising. Manufacturing jobs are coming back. Inflation is almost non-existent…\n\nThis, my friends, is what peace and prosperity look and feel like. This is it. Take it from a middle-aged guy who lived through Watergate, Vietnam, the Carter years, 9/11, Iraq, and Barry Obama's managed decline — this is as good as America gets.\n\nBut with a Republican in office, most especially a Republican named Donald Trump, the media are desperate to distract us from this inconvenient good news, and so they are manufacturing a fabricated reality where Mississippi is still burning, white supremacism is on the march, the Chinese are about to Red Dawn our economy, everyone's going to be shot at school, democracy itself teeters on the brink, and women are about to be forced back into the kitchen.\n\nHere's a quick round up of the latest nonsense our corrupt media are hoaxing the country with.\n\nTrump's Tariff War with China Is Going to Kill the Economy\n\nThis, to me, is the dumbest crisis of them all. To begin with, none of the tariffs Trump has so far raised have had any effect on consumer prices or economic growth. In fact, in almost every area, our economy is doing much better than our lousy experts predicted last year.\n\nHow many times can the media turn a single day stock market drop into a financial crisis before we all roll our eyes and turn the channel?\n\nI find this hysteria tedious.\n\nGlobal Warming Will Kill You\n\nI guess it's a good thing Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy is backing off her claim we will all die in 12 years, but she's still assuring us Global Warming is a real threat that will kill us, but you'll have to pardon me if I don't take my climate advice from a 29-year-old who freaks out over her first look at a garbage disposal.\n\nIt's May 15, I live in the South, and when I woke up this morning it was 36 degrees. There was even a little frost on the ground.\n\nThe planet appears to be doing just fine, much better than the eternally neurotic Ocasio-Crazy.\n\nSchool Shooting Epidemic\n\nTo gin up this lie, media outlets, most especially CNN, are spreading provably false statistics — lies easily debunked by anyone who can Google.\n\nThe truth is that when it comes to these terrible shootings, our schools are much safer than they were 20 years ago.\n\nTrump's 'Constitutional Crisis'\n\nIn a woefully transparent act of collusion between Democrats and the establishment media, the media repeated the phrase constitutional crisis 386 times between May 8 and 12.\n\nA perfect example courtesy of NewsBusters: On Friday, CNN's Erin Burnett asked indignantly: If this is a constitutional crisis, how can Democrats not move forward with impeachment hearings?\n\nMuch of this hysteria is based on the Trump administration fighting congress over document requests and all those subpoenas being issued so that sore loser Democrats can come up with a Russia Collusion Hoax do-over — you know, because Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his gang of partisan Democrats spending three years and $35 million to locate a dry collusion/obstruction hole means nothing.\n\nThe executive branch has been fighting the legislative branch over this stuff since the creation of our government and nothing is a constitutional crisis until the executive branch defies a Supreme Court order, or the equivalent of one, to cooperate with congress. .\n\nSorry, that's just a fact.\n\nWe cannot be in a constitutional crisis when the executive branch is 1) complying with court orders and 2) using constitutional means to tell congress to shove it.\n\nActually, this is the opposite of a constitutional crisis; this is the constitution at its best: the war is political and legal as opposed to physical.\n\nGod bless America.\n\nWhite Supremacism Epidemic\n\nHand-picked experts are telling the conspiracy theorists at CNN that white supremacism is on the rise and a contagion and must be labeled as terrorism so it can be treated like ISIS.\n\nYeah, there's a good idea: treat our own citizens like foreign terrorists.\n\nFirst off, the so-called boost in hate crimes is a hoax based solely on the fact that more agencies have been added to those reporting hate crimes.\n\nSecondly, if white supremacism was a real problem in America, CNN and the rest of the media would not be forced to manufacture one hate crime after another: Remember Hands Up, Don't Shoot; George Zimmerman the White Hispanic; the KKKids from KKKovington High School; Jussie Smollett? All hoaxes.\n\nIn fact, most hate crimes end up being debunked as hoaxes.\n\nRiddle me this: How much white supremacism can there be in America when the long-dead Kate Smith has to be disinterred for a Two Minute Hate? Good grief, there is so little racism in America, we are forced to dig up corpses just so we can have something to virtual signal at. And even then, the racism charge is still a hoax. Kate Smith was no racist.\n\nI've lived in the south for nearly 20 years and my interracial marriage has never brought my wife and I so much as a double take.\n\nThe Return of Back Alley Abortions\n\nThank God states like Alabama are aggressively looking to put an end to the holocaust of abortion. Regardless, the worst case scenario for the pro-infanticide crowd is that the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, and as unlikely as that is to happen, it would still not outlaw the killing of the unborn for convenience purposes.\n\nOverturning Roe v. Wade means the states get to decide on the legality of abortion, which means it will always be legal somewhere. With all the government money they receive, I'm sure Planned Parenthood will be able to offer a free bus pass with every child murder.\n\nTo be fair, though, Alyssa Milano's sex strike, her refusal to have sex with anyone until she gets her way on abortion would have been a legitimate crisis … in 1998.\n\nFox News Is the Devil\n\nIn an ocean of leftist news outlets Fox News is a lonely buoy that offers some right-of-center opinion. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) (aka Indian Princess Lies-Like-a-Rug) is only the latest example of the hate poured all over Fox, but according to CNN and other media outlets, Fox is a disease helping to spread all six of the phony crises listed above.\n\nThis is how intolerant the left and media are — they don't even want one buoy in their ocean of lies.\n\n—\n\nSeriously, y'all, it's all a hoax, it's all fake news, and summer is on the horizon. So unless you live in a city like Baltimore, Chicago, or San Francisco — a city exclusively run by Democrats for the last 50 or so years that is now filled with poverty, the homeless, and poop; take a vacation from the media, take a breath, take a step outside, and take a long look around… Life is good in Trump's America, about as good as it gets… And all of this hysterical BS, this crises propaganda, these lies, are all being manufactured to take our eye off that fact.\n\nThe media cannot defeat Trump in 2020 based on the mostly positive results of his policies; they cannot argue against the first era of peace and prosperity we've enjoyed in almost two decades, so they're trying to stress us out with these absurd hoaxes even though the planet is cooling, eggs are 98 cents a dozen, and our guys are not dying in futile overseas wars.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

An offshoot of the Chinese Communist Youth League published a video featuring Chinese celebrities promoting the nation's totalitarian social credit system to young people, urging them to give thumbs up to integrity, Australia's ABC News reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe music video, titled, Live Up to Your Word, features a variety of Chinese actors and musicians who cater to young audiences, including 24-year-old actor Xu Weizhou, popular boy band member Wang Yuan, and romantic comedy star Wei Daxun.\n\nBeginning with a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of early 2000s American punk-pop, the video features its stars in various public settings encouraging the listener to participate in communist society as the Party decrees, whether at school, in the workplace, or playing sports. The stars lead business meetings, study in libraries, and grocery shop, the implicit message of the video being that only by obeying the Party can a young person have access to the necessary resources to participate in society.\n\nAccording to ABC News' translation, the lyrics urge the viewer to be a trustworthy youth.\n\nLet's give the thumbs up to integrity, and unite in building Credit China together, the video suggests. Live every day carefully.\n\nAlthough the lyrics don't specifically mention the Social Credit System (SCS), actors and singers are seen demonstrating how to be a trustworthy citizen in a range of scenarios such as shopping at an unmanned store, renting a shared bike, reading at a public library, and finalising a business deal, the ABC report notes.\n\nThe video is reportedly a production of China Youth Credit Action, a campaign to promote the social credit system supervised by the Communist Youth League. The Youth League is responsible for recruiting young communists, ensuring that young people do not deviate away from communist values, and controlling nearly every aspect of the lives of its members. The group has worked to promote banning participation in Western festivities such as Christmas, and launched a dating service in 2017 to promote marriage and reproduction among communists (and, presumably, to keep communists from falling in love with unauthorized persons who may hold alternative points of view).\n\nThe social credit system is an all-encompassing control method in which the government assigned a numerical value to the credit of a person to society. The number is based on both loyalty to the Party and general courtesy in public – both political dissidence and general misbehavior, such as littering or jaywalking, could hurt a person's score. The consequences of a low score make it harder for a person to participate in society by limiting access to flights, trains, and public transportation or depriving people of access to government services.\n\nThe system will not fully go into place until 2020, so the government has begun publishing promotional material for it now. It is currently partially operational, however, and blocked Chinese citizens from buying 23 million airplane and train tickets as of March 2019.\n\nOn Thursday, the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper reported that the Communist Party is considering adding unpaid parking tickets to the metric that determines a person's credit score. The article discusses traditional financial credit scores but states that the People's Bank of China (PBC) is working to integrate its credit system into a government-controlled personal credit score. It quotes a Chinese professor promoting the use of all human behavior to determine a financial credit score.\n\nDong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday that it is important to establish a comprehensive credit system, rather than a one-sided database that only focuses on financial activities, in order to regulate social behavior, the newspaper reports, noting that Dong believes this system is not possible without having strict privacy protection in place so that only the repressive Communist Party has access to the information.\n\nThe Global Times also ran a column Wednesday by a senior PBC official urging the establishment of a credit score for local governments, so that the national Communist Party can keep them under tight control.\n\nGovernment credibility is an important part of establishing a social credit system, which should supervise government activities and debt risks, the article argued.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
