during his second term, inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, bob ferguson, has challenged some of the trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. in a campaign video focused on climate change, inslee announced his white house bid on march 1. issues inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of mr. trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a chinese hoax. he has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in congress. with most 2020 democrats throwing their support for the audacious green new deal proposal introduced by new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. controversy inslee's tenures in congress and as washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.

vice president biden, i want to make -- i want to bring us to another topic. we're in south carolina. it's the first primary with a significant black voting population. your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. and i'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time.
1992: arrested development chrysalis records/emi nominees: billy ray cyrus, sophie b. hawkins, kris kross and jon secada before arrested development became the name of a cult tv show, it was actually the name of an alternative hip-hop group formed in atlanta in 1988. arrested development won two grammy awards in 1993 for best new artist and best rap performance by a duo or group. rolling stone also named arrested development band of the year in 1993, thanks to the group's debut album, 3 years, 5 months & 2 days in the life of..., which spawned the catchy singles tennessee, people everyday and mr. wendel. the band is still together and has consistently released albums over the years, but none as successful as that first one.

fewer consumers say they're as likely to buy food or drinks at starbucks (sbux) following the incident, according to new data from yougov brandindex, a service that tracks brand perception. last week, a philadelphia store manager had two black men arrested when they refused to leave after using the store's restroom without making a purchase.
just weeks after carolyn abel's murder, the investigation by john boatwright was focusing on the two friends who had discovered her body: roommates kathy patrick and sandra ames.
but let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in new york city. and i listened to them. they're in congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. but if you change something like the president, they would. no, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.
show me what you think he did, what he told you he did to michelle. what did he do? smith asked harris.
before long, word of their war would win them another important ally. this one had a worldwide reputation investigating cases at, of all places, ncis itself.
klobuchar: what i think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and i have done together...
peter van sant: all of this was destroyed, correct?
tamara doak: and we were just all in shock. … just trying to figure out … what happened.
starbucks has crafted a brand focused not only on coffee, but also on living up to progressive ideals. now, that brand image is taking a hit following a racial bias incident at one of its stores.

and so, i kind of knew that's what i wanted, but i still didn't know what the region was. i didn't really want to go in the middle east. and one day, i didn't go to class, i never miss class, but one day i decided with a friend, we walked around campus and we got in front of a study abroad kiosk.
peter van sant: what problems are you talking about in this?
right? it sounds circular, but it's true. and then, the analysts go further than that, right? they say if you're going to look at this in a narrow perspective, we don't have many interests, 1971 in east africa. there's not a product that we get there, we don't have economic investment.
in his interpretation, those particles would be unlikely to have hit that area of the wall, if col. stahlman's head had been in the way of the bullet.
kim stahlman: this is a guy that gave his all.
there's going to be an african component to that and we need to be mindful of that. two, and this has been something that i've learned in my career, africa's problems and opportunities don't stop at the water's edge. what happens in africa changes the way the world works. african migration crisis changed european politics. the ebola crisis changes the way we think about global health security. you may remember the piracy off the coast of the horn of africa, it changed actually how maritime commerce worked in the shipping industry.
bloomberg: i never said that. oh, come on.

waters tells castellano: i need you to explain to me what happened. ... we both know, we both know, michelle did not walk out of that apartment.
kim stahlman: we had gotten to the point where we really didn't communicate. … and so we were talking about seeing a counselor for that.
bloomberg: and the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- i'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. we just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. we did what she asked. and, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. and by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across america.

kim says it's also possible col. stahlman had enemies closer than he thought.
steven schroeder: simply, it wasn't true.
mark reynolds: it was never determined. there was no sampling ever done. to go from a grayish particulate matter on a wall … to extrapolate that as being gunshot residue i think is very dangerous leap. it could've been anything on that wall.
steyer: there's something going on here. i have worked for racial justice...

what i said is what barack obama said in terms of cuba, that cuba made progress on education. yes, i think...
sandra ames: she was making her students laugh, and sing, and -- and have fun learning english.

the city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since buttigieg took office. he has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. in the video announcing his exploratory committee, buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in american politics. he also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: we're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. unless we do something different. controversy buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. in his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first african american chief of police of south bend. what trump says president trump has not tweeted about or insulted buttigieg as of now.

is the transaction worth it? in the gospel of mark, jesus asks for what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
it gives a veto to the oil industry. it's going to give a veto on immigration. until we're willing to dig in and say that if mitch mcconnell is going to do to the next democratic president what he did to president obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the american people.
biden: what we did with ebola -- i was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the united states, saved millions of lives. and what we did, we set up, i helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office, on -- on diseases that are pandemic diseases.

biden: here's the deal. here's the deal.

o'donnell: mayor bloomberg, voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views. would you pull all combat troops out of the middle east?
mayor bloomberg, as mayor of new york, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. so if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well?

it was still the previous night back in connecticut, where kim and the kids were visiting her parents. at about 11 p.m., she says she found a cryptic email in her inbox – apparently from her husband. the email became central to this case.
because you can always pull out the autocracy or the democracy that is in recession or is regressing. but if you step back and look at the picture, it's actually very exciting. and what i tell people is, let's not look at this about democracy as up or down, let's look at the forces that have sort of created a status quo around governance are changing. and i expect a lot of volatility.

the death of fotis dulos left michelle troconis in a precarious legal position, says her attorney, jon schoenhorn. i think the right expression here is, 'she's left holding the bag.' authorities still plan on pursuing charges including conspiracy to commit murder against troconis, leaving her facing the possibility of years in prison for the death of a woman she never met and whose body has never been found.
it is amazing. and then the c.i.a., how did you end up at the c.i.a.?

warren: ... and just be race-blind. it is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against african-americans having an opportunity to buy homes.
mike stahlman, son of a u.s. diplomat, had lived in india, jordan and panama as a boy before returning home to become one of a few good men.

buttigieg: the things you just named are things...

well, i mean the whole thing wasn't my finest hour, castellano replied.
o'donnell: we want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the democratic party.
i think he needs to prove, other than say that 'it doesn't matter,' that he has the experience to lead, said runal a. patel, a 20-year-old college student who also volunteered for new jersey senator cory booker's presidential campaign. i really hate that whenever he gets asked that question, he sort of just deflects and says, 'well, you know the last president didn't have any experience.' i always think well, look how that presidency is going. you know, i don't think that that's a good answer.
that he was a game player, my first impression of him was that he thought he was the smartest guy in the room and he wanted everybody to know it, mcgraw replied.
our plan -- we have laid out options all over the place. one of the options is a 7.5 percent payroll tax on employers, which will save them substantial sums of money. another...
yeah, russia is an easier conversation that china, right? i don't need much nuance. there is very few upsides to what russia is doing. essentially, president putin needs permissive environments for his companies to invest in after the sanctions were imposed on his government and he's looking to score points.
yeah, france is still very involved. and in fact, president macron just recently had a summit where he talked about what his government is doing on the sahel. the u.k., the week of this recording, just had its first u.k. africa investment summit. malta, i don't know why i'm sharing this, but malta just came out with their own africa strategy, just to give you a sense of the diversity here.

dr. phil: you said you would show 'em to me. do you have 'em here? can we look at 'em? mark castellano[gets up from his seat]: yeah i'll bring 'em to you, one second. oh, no i don't have 'em -- he's still copying 'em. dr. phil: ok. you can come back. mark castellano: sorry, i thought he brought them back but he didn't. dr. phil: you said you were gonna show those to us and you got up and walked to the door -- and then said, oh, that's right, they're not here. but not 15 minutes before we got here, you told my producer they weren't here. you already knew they weren't here when you got up to get 'em. mark castellano: my mind is scatterbrained right now. i mean i forgot.
king: all right, senator warren, thank you.
he also listed three questions to ask when a relationship is in jeopardy:
when you drive a car and you hit somebody, did you want to hit them, no. you're like, 'it was an accident. ...' you might be at someone's house and they just had brand new carpet put in and you're eating velvet cake and you dropped in on the floor. did you want to do it, no. do you feel bad about it, yes. but still, accidents are still accidents, they are not planned. that's why they're called accidents, castellano went on, shedding a tear.

that didn't work out too well, trump told fox news in an interview on new year's eve. we'll see how she does. i wish her well, i hope she does well. i'd love to run against her. warren frequently taunted mr. trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. asked by fox news whether warren would be able to win, the president said, well, that i don't know. you would have to ask her psychiatrist.
warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run dec. 31. warren and her second husband, bruce mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. they live in cambridge, massachusetts with their golden retriever, bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. key issues warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-wall street crusader. the 69-year-old senator serves on the senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs committee and the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. in one instance, she helped to derail then-president obama's nomination of investment banker antonio weiss to a top position at the treasury department in 2015. fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. i've spent my career getting to the bottom of why america's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. what i found is terrifying. these aren't cracks that families are falling into. they're traps. america's middle class is under attack. how do we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.
warren: ... so that they can tell their stories the way i can tell my story without having the fear they're going to be sued by a billionaire.
1990: mariah carey columbia records nominees: the black crowes, the kentucky headhunters, wilson phillips and lisa stansfield mariah carey's killer voice (with a five-octave vocal range) burst onto the music scene in 1990 with her self-titled debut album. the long island native would soon become a major force on radio, scoring four no. 1 hits off her first effort, including vision of love and i don't wanna cry. carey ended up winning best female pop vocal performance for vision of love, along with the best new artist honor. she would win three more grammys, out of 29 nominations. she's also dabbled in acting (in the ill-fated glitter in 2001), and sat at the judges' table on fox's american idol. in may 2015, she set up shop in las vegas for a residency at the colosseum at caesars palace.
yeah, and to go ahead and actually raise my hands against her, castellano said. i had a gun. i've always had a 9mm. if i really wanted to kill michelle, i would have shot her. ...i would have taken my gun and shot her.

bloomberg: we have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. so you can do it. it's congress that can't seem to do it. and i don't know why we think they're going to do it. the vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the nra. and certainly senator sanders has supported the nra.
right now, my view is we need to expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and do what the american people want, not what the nra wants.
whitaker: vice president biden, black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both democratic and republican administrations. how do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities?
you talk about -- concerned about race. well, my good friend on the end of this platform, he, in fact, bought a system that was a private prison system, after, after he knew that, in fact, what happened was, they hog-tied young men in prison here in this state.
klobuchar: i have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. we need to expand that.

the fatal shot, says maloney, would have been the second one.
peter van sant: and what did you think when you looked at this guy?
bening replied, well, it's what we all want to do as parents. and i think that the tricky part is, that your kids have to go through difficulties and pain. and i didn't even know it, but there was a part of me that thought, if i got it right, i could maybe parent my kids in such a way that they wouldn't have to experience pain, she laughed. which is, of course, ridiculous! you want to shield them.
scouring the reports, kim says she learned her husband had been found in bed, lying on his back, next to a bloodstained nightstand. a bloodied sheet was hanging from the top bunk obscuring his body. a bible and family photo lay next to him. stahlman's 9 mm beretta was on the bed, too. one first responder noted the gun appeared wedged between him and the mattress.
house speaker david ralston, the chamber's top republican, supports the pastor protection act.
the second is that i oversaw all of the strategic analysis that the intelligence community had, national intelligence estimates, et cetera. c.i.a. might have their view, dia may have their view, but what was written under my auspices was a community view.
1991: marc cohn atlantic records nominees: boyz ii men, c+c music factory, color me badd and seal folk-rock singer-songwriter marc cohn is best known for walking in memphis, the single off his 1991 self-titled debut album. the cleveland, ohio-born singer has said the track, which helped land him the best new artist grammy, was mostly autobiographical. walking in memphis also received nominations for song of the year and best pop vocal performance at the 34th annual grammy awards. cohn has continually released albums and toured over the years, but has yet to score another radio hit like he did with walking in memphis.
on this valentine's day, new research shows a revolution is in the works when it comes to finding love that lasts. the concept is called slow love. marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship. now it's the finale, biological anthropologist helen fisher said thursday on cbs this morning.

it continues to be the case that iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength for a lot of voters who i think are very pragmatic in places like south carolina and nevada, who above all, want to see a candidate who can win, buttigieg told reporters at a campaign stop in nevada on january 11.
buttigieg: this is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. this is about 2020. we are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the cold war. and we're not going to win these critical, critical house and senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the democratic party is telling people to look at the bright side of the castro regime. we've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future.
in june, he emailed: …just 2 more months until i come home. missing you terribly!!! and in late july, the day before the shooting: …everything is great!
the events of that day have haunted carolyn abel's family for more than 30 years.
sanders: pete has gotten funding from over 50 billionaires.
once that narrative was complete, and he felt like he had told his story, it was at that point that - i'm now gonna confront you, waters told smith.
but sandra ames' story quickly changed. in official statements, ames wrote that kathy patrick had admitted to cutting carolyn's throat. and today ames claims that the only reason she made that admission was due to false memories implanted by investigators. but she doesn't deny going to the crime scene or handling the murder weapon.
walking distance of here is mother emanuel church, nine people shot dead by a white supremacist.

i cannot imagine not seeing this kid to his or her full potential and just seeing what she's going to do, what she's going to be like, she continued.
gunnery sgt. gary morell: we would receive incoming every now and then. there'd be shots fired.
as for your photograph, i weep when i look at it, ormsby-gore wrote.
since the shooting, kim had been fighting her war alone. but in 2009, she met an important ally: author cilla mccain.
the announcement by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and boy scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18, signaling that an end to the long-time alliance was near.
peter van sant: would you be professionally troubled … if this this case was changed to undetermined?
buttigieg: we will deliver a democracy worthy of the name.
suzanna andrews: my mother still remembers him as the most polite child any of us ever brought home.
mark reynolds [showing the diagram]: did you get that?
i felt i was in a different role as his colleague, that i'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and i felt it was best to handle it in that way, klobuchar told cnn at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. what trump says a few hours after her announcement, president trump mocked klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a midwestern snowstorm. amy klobuchar announced that she is running for president, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. bad timing. by the end of her speech she looked like a snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.
sandra aes: at that point, some of our students drove us to carolyn's apartment. we went into the apartment, and kathy … discovered the body … she was murdered brutally and horribly and in a way she did not deserve.
wanda abel: i think she probably is. … and who knows what would trigger some kind -- that kind of violence again?
she fell in with a bad crowd and she even disappeared a couple of times. and she was arrested for possession of cocaine.
mary louise comes seeking answers about last season's violent death of her son, perry, played by alexander skarsgard.
kim stahlman: i know i'll never meet another mike stahlman.
buttigieg: it's why in my frederick douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues, part of the core of it is a 21st century voting rights act.
tomoyuki ayagaki: apart-- yes. … [via interpreter] it was a huge shock … if that's true, if i stayed in the home of the -- of the murderer, i -- i feel terrible.
i've never been to any of pac's shows by his request. we never had an argument backstage. — jada pinkett smith (@jadapsmith) june 16, 2017
but in carolyn abel's case, any trial seems highly unlikely. in south korea, the statute of limitations for her murder has expired. and the abel family says investigators told them the physical evidence in the case has been destroyed -- evidence that would've been crucial for a trial in the united states.
behind joe biden's search for a running mate 02:04 more democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than america has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. here's a look at all the democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on president trump in november 2020.
i absolutely do not know what michelle saw in mark, said malone.
it's really fun to take on characters who are not an obvious casting choice for me, she said. alice sort of apologizes for the space she takes up in the world and she's extremely low-status and she's repressed and that's just something i haven't gotten to do in my career.
peter van sant: do you believe kathy patrick lied to you?
no air date has been set.
but i want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the american people because this is so serious. i'm not going to give my website right now. i'm going to give the cdc's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here.
peter van sant: a one-night stand with someone?
biden: the only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. i couldn't get that covered. you, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and mitch mcconnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the violence against women act across the board.
sanders: now, if you look -- oh.
the women taught, traveled and partied together.
biden: well, first of all, the latest poll i saw, my numbers -- i'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll.
three weeks after the murder, an autopsy revealed the cause of death: a stab wound to her right lung. the report also confirmed her throat was cut.
john boatwright: each time that she was interviewed later, she kept changing the facts to -- to limit her involvement in the murder. but she never denied that kathy did the murder. and she never denied that she was present just after the murder.
while there a lot of people who are very vocal saying they won't shop at target, some may shop more at target, he said. a year from now, target may be remembered for being one of the first to step up to the plate, which history might prove was the right stance to take.
we're seeing more protests on the streets. we're seeing more people push for change. and so, whether it's the uprising in sudan that ended president al bashir's rule or it is the remarkable changes in ethiopia or just increasingly cyclical transfers of power, i think a number of things are happening that really cut against the grain in both the global trends, as you've talked about, but even the way people think about sub saharan africa.
but either way, maloney says the strongest evidence supporting his theory of homicide is that sheet hanging over stahlman's bed. it had blood on both sides. but, he says, what's most important is a particular type of stain called misting.

king: why would the russians want to be working on behalf of bernie sanders?

peter van sant [with kim]: we have some clips from the interview that we did with mark reynolds that we would like you to listen to.
bloomberg: i know -- wait a second. i know that if i were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve. and i know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. that's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it.
brennan: thank you. next topic. gayle?
in the 2012 video posted online about six months before the couple wed, watts said he was in suburban broomfield, where the watts family once lived.
there were skeptics in the beginning; what do you say to them?
yeah. you know, there wasn't a day that i didn't have a smile on my face walking in that door. i came in on the weekends and not because i had a task there, but because i had a paper that i really wanted to write, research. but every day you are immersed in all this information about the country or issue that you work.
that was my first day working for the u.s. government.
kim stahlman says her husband was right-handed, but his wound was on the left side -- and his job helping rebuild iraq's legal system could easily have made him enemies.

maloney says the bullet hole in the wall, as seen in the investigator's photo, likely came from the assailant's first shot.
kim stahlman: and he stopped, and he got down on his knee and he was talking to the -- these triplets … and i thought, oh, my god. that's someone special right there. and that's when i knew. i knew!
so in a lot of cases, these groups existed already with local grievances and then they took on the name?
it would take four long, hard years to get it back. and today art garfunkel is savoring every moment.
like his south korean counterparts, boatwright decided to question carolyn's colleagues, who told him:
whatever happened to grammy's best new artists?
michael maloney: this is when i began to believe that, perhaps, this wasn't the shot. this wasn't the fatal shot.
steyer: bernie sanders' analysis is right.
the other region that i should spend just a second talking about is the gulf. the gulf is very active in africa and turkey is very active in africa. in some cases, that's not bad, they're doing some of the investments. dp ports is investing in lots of places all over the continent.
sandra ames: to the best of my recollection, we sat in the living room at carolyn's apartment, and … she convinced me, manipulated me, to help her make it look like a robbery.
biden: no, i would not. and i spent more time with xi jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office. this is a guy who is -- doesn't have a democratic, with a small d, bone in his body.
until we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. but the cat's out of the bag. so some states have it, you're not going to take it away. get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession.
haley found the letters locked away in a british country home when the house contents were put up for sale.
yes he is! more than 50 years after paul simon and art garfunkel first hit the pop charts, at 76 art garfunkel is touring solo.
as for those hard drives that seemed to be so important in the early days of the investigation? it turns out they weren't relevant to the case.
the trick is to project yourself into the head of the average academy voter, who – wanting you to keep buying tickets – is trying to project him- or herself into your (the average moviegoer's) head. so, it's a nutty feedback loop.
she says she still talks with brown. yeah, he was here for thanksgiving.
then, graham added, mayor buttigieg says he's a gay christian. as a christian i believe the bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. the bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.
sanders: excuse me, can i respond to the attack?
suzanna andrews: the gun is half under him around his waist but pointed down.

i think they are. she -- particularly the way she signs off you know she says 'with all my love,' haley said. i think this is a real warmth there.
on the ground, national caucus director travis brock is planning to stay in iowa until caucus day. while he usually splits his time between nevada, which also holds a caucus, and iowa, brock recently embarked on a 19-stop tour around the state training volunteers and precinct captains across iowa.

at the center of the prosecution's case - castellano's own words -- that videotaped confession to detective waters:
sanders: ok. what the health and human services have said in analyzing health care costs, what yale -- recent yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. we would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. what every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, medicare for all will save money. ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion.
garrett: ok. mayor bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. i want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what senator warren just said on twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining.
john boatwright: she says, i touched her arm and it was warm. and at that point, i realized that she may be still alive and that she might testify against … kathy. and so i went to the kitchen, got a knife, and came back, and i cut her throat to make sure she was dead.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt), presidential candidate: let us go forward. let's win this thing. let's transform america!
wanda abel: the u.s. attorney in washington state said, no, you can't arrest her because she hasn't committed a crime in the united states. …there was no jurisdiction to arrest her for murder … and that's what pushed my family to say, wait a minute. this isn't right.
krista henery, a spokeswoman for the weld county district attorney's office, declined comment about the video wednesday. watts' public defender, james merson, did not immediately return a phone message.
sanders: well, you're right. the economy is doing really great for people like mr. bloomberg and other billionaires.
oh, no, we are done, she laughed. oh good lord, yes, i can't be pregnant again. this will be our number four total, so we're good.
bell admitted she has an agenda in making this film.
nancy bercaw: not only were we devastated about the loss of carolyn … we of course wondered, who's next?
sometimes you find your partner no longer attractive physically or in their personality, he said in the presentation. when you are in a relationship you have to show desire, lust toward your partner. sometimes when you get married that the lust and the desire kind of fall by the wayside a little bit.
mark's story did not make any sense, said malone.
so as you left, where did you stand with mark castellano? what did you think? smith asked mcgraw.
according to cnn reporter dj judd, one demonstrator yelled, repent! and another said, marriage is between a man and a woman!
buttigieg: look, we know what the president -- what russia wants. it's chaos.
i don't really want to call him there because melania is there, and i don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, ivana said on abc's good morning america. because i'm basically first trump wife, okay? i'm first lady, okay?
detective waters' approach? no tough questions - yet. he is trying to get castellano to trust him:
i love history and in high school, all you can take is u.s. and european. and when i got to college, i just went all over the world: latin america and southeast asia, east asia. but i took a class on the arab revolt, actually, and this seminar class was so incredible, the way in which they talked about how arab nationalism and agency mixed with geo politics.

blagg was found guilty of murder in 2004 in mesa county but his conviction was later overturned because a juror concealed her experience with domestic violence.
the fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. look at what's happening here. we have to win the senate back.
... given nobody pays attention to the clock -- i'm surprised they show up, because i would have thought after i did such a good job in beating them last week, that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that.
gunnery sgt. gary morell: you could get on and get off.
nancy bercaw: and a lot of us … missed work on occasion for various reasons.
king: we would like -- senator sanders, we would like to bring mr. steyer in on this conversation.
biden: because i'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. i beat the nra twice. i got assault weapons banned. i got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. i got them eliminated. except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in florida and it was not reauthorized.
i've been asked to do really interesting characters in the midst of great stories with great writing, bening said. and great writing usually involves flaws. it's not about playing people who are strong. it's about trying to find the humanity in people.
pete buttigieg (d), presidential candidate: the time has come to turn the page and open up a new chapter in the american story.
warren: ... and referred to what i talk about as a sideshow. you know, this is personal for me. when i was 21 years old, i got my first job as a special education teacher. i loved that job. and by the end of the first year, i was visibly pregnant.

we're used to hearing narratives of trauma, tragedy, disenfranchisement, pain, suffering, marshall told correspondent alex wagner. few of the stories that normalize the everyday life of people who are not always experiencing trauma 24/7. and i think those things need to be represented as well as anything else that we read about in the newspaper or we see on the news.
buttigieg: i'm happy to respond to the question because this is really important...
bloomberg: ok. let me say something.
sanders: they have credited me with gun sense, as you know.
so many of these african militaries make the wrong moves that push people further into the arms of the extremists. so those are a couple of the things that i would highlight is why we keep seeing this proliferation of these groups.

klobuchar: thank you. this is one of the first times we've talked about housing. and i put forward an extensive policy.
bloomberg: and, together, we are going to get it done.
mark reynolds: many soldiers around the world carry tampons in case they get shot because they put the tampon in the bullet hole and it stems the flow of blood.
and it's very slow-moving, this disease, so it took a long time to really finally manifest.
there are al-qaeda and isis affiliates in west and east africa and southern africa. we are seeing unaligned extremist groups like boko haram. the number of attacks that they are doing are increasing and i think the lethality of them are increasing.
cilla mccain: i know of 166 families who believe that their loved one was murdered and it has been labeled a suicide.
honestly, the first one was really rough, and i was like, 'oh, it can't happen again,' and no it happened, like, way worse this time, clarkson shared in a radio interview with australia's kiis fm last month, explaining that her ailment is 100 times worse than morning sickness. i just get hospitalized, and i have to get fluids. it's just, like, my body was not made to be pregnant.
but let me say how we win this. we have got to win in the middle of the country. and while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, i'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in republican congressional districts over and over again, including michele bachmann's district.
he says yes, it was true -- the couple had a fight that night, but he was the victim.
on monday, blagg's defense team said hairs were found in the couple's bed that did not belong to either michael or jennifer.
accurate, at least what he is telling us waters said. the only people in the scenario who were casting any kind of suspicion on mark are michelle's family, that's where all that's coming from. and they're not saying things like, 'you know what? michelle told me yesterday that if anything ever happened to me it's mark.'
kim stahlman: mike did nothing with his left hand.

they are the democratic national committee and the congressional black caucus institute, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders.
sanders: that is untrue, categorically untrue.
and that's not the only right-wing senator that mayor bloomberg has funded. in 2016, he dumped $12 million into the pennsylvania senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing republican senator. and i just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. she lost by a single point.
det. waters: so your concern for cayden is mainly centered on when michelle is the primary - caregiver. mark castellano: right.
it's just about a 45-minute drive from the refineries of the texas coast to the high rises of downtown houston. and in 2000, 20-year-old michelle warner moved to the big city. she was a new mom looking to make a fresh start.
cayden was about 2 months old and mark just went away. just, ' ugh, i can't handle this; it's too stressful for me.' everything was always about me - me, me, me, me, me.

the couple seemingly confirmed the news themselves when they instagrammed a pregnant avatar of chyna and tagged each other over her belly.
poring over the new photos, maloney reached a startling conclusion.
kerry james marshall's trademark style has catapulted him into the stratosphere of the art world. a 35-year retrospective featuring 72 of his works is now at the museum of contemporary art in los angeles. his figures aren't just black; they are jet black -- bold, proud, undeniably black. and while his work may deal with grief, injustice and loss, for the most part marshall focuses on everyday life: picnics and street scenes, daily rituals, and quiet moments -- a window into a world rarely represented in fine art.

1967: bobbie gentry capitol records nominees: lana cantrell, the 5th dimension, harpers bizarre and jefferson airplane after skipping a year, the grammy's best new artist award went to one of the first female country artists to write and produce her own material. bobbie gentry became a star with her ballad, ode to billie joe (which had actually been the b-side of her debut single, mississippi delta). it spent four weeks at number 1 on the billboard charts in 1967. in addition to best new artist, gentry won grammys for best vocal performance (female) and best contemporary group performance (vocal or instrumental) for ode to billie joe. her follow-up recordings include the burt bacharach/hal david song i'll never fall in love again, let it be me and all i have to do is dream (both with glen campbell), fancy, and but i can't get back. in the '70s gentry retired from performing.

i did i did. and i also know i couldn't bring her back, he said.
judd, thank you so much for joining us.
i am not the -- i'm the one choice that makes some sense. i have the experience. i have the resources. and i have the record. and all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. when people hired me to run new york city three times, in an overwhelmingly democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again.
dave fuentes: i was … talking to some of the other medics, when the call came in.
after about 20 years of high-stress military life, mike stahlman had risen through the ranks to become a full colonel.

king: we're going to allow everyone an opportunity opportunity to respond.
warren: i don't care how much money mayor bloomberg has. the core of the democratic party will never trust him. he has not earned their trust. i will. and the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the democratic party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.
i have no doubt, she replied.
pinkett smith also revealed that when shakus was killed in 1996, they hadn't been speaking because of an argument.

seven democratic candidates met on stage in south carolina for the last debate before the state's primary and super tuesday, co-hosted by cbs news, the congressional black caucus institute and twitter. read cbs news' full coverage here, and find the full transcript below.
on immigration, o'rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. in 2014, he called president obama's executive action creating the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed congress. he also backed ohio rep. tim ryan's leadership challenge against then-minority leader nancy pelosi in 2016. o'rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust cruz in 2018. his robust senate bid in texas -- along with his obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. although he failed to unseat cruz, o'rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in texas -- including the state's large and growing latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. no democrat had come that close to winning a senate race in texas since 1988. despite the loss, o'rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. although he told 60 minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, o'rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. issues in his six years in congress, o'rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, lgbt rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights.

in fact, mr. trump's policy of us going it alone, of america first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. the biggest threat to america right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. and it's time for us to deal with it that way. every single foreign policy issue is about american leadership and coalition.
