{"original": "Over 100 progressive leaders, activists, scholars and celebrities are urging Joe Biden to pick Senator Elizabeth Warren as his running mate. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says that in a letter to Biden, the groups outlined six arguments for Warren as VP, ranging from her policy ideas to her ability to explain complex government functions. Elizabeth Warren has proven herself most prepared to be president if the occasion arises and deeply expert on the overlapping emergencies now plaguing America – COVID-19, Economic Insecurity, Racial Injustice and Climate Change, the letter reads. It also argued that Warren is the best option to unite the party. Among the best-known signers are actors Jane Fonda and Alan Cumming, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and activist Ady Barkan. The letter also pushed back on the idea that Warren's Senate seat would be in jeopardy if she were chosen because Massachusetts has a Republican governor who would appoint her temporary successor. The letter accurately noted that the Democratic super majority in the state House and Senate there could, as it has in the past, vote to change the rule. The letter, which was first reported by The Washington Post, was provided to CBS News by former New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, who spearheaded the effort. He said that he did not speak with Warren or her team about the letter, but that he saw a need for her case to be made. She's a once in a generation talent, he said.

Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.

An official on the Booker campaign told CBS News their internal polling shows similar margins to McGrath's campaign's polling with Booker only 10 points down, but a few weeks before that, he was 50 points down.

He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues.", "augmented": []}

Gorsuch wrote, Judges are not free to overlook plain statutory commands on the strength of nothing more than suppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations. He continued, In Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee's sex when deciding to fire that employee. We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.Mr. Trump called the ruling, very powerful at the White House, Monday afternoon, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports.

Pending a challenge to the results from Riggleman, he would be the third House incumbent to be unseated in a primary this cycle. The other two are Dan Lipinski of Illinois and Steve King of Iowa. Saturday's convention was held in the parking lot of Tree of Life Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, near Good's home, where registered delegates voted in their cars. Riggleman, a Republican freshman who faced scrutiny from some local Republicans for officiating a gay wedding, claimed ballot irregularities as the results were being calculated. At some point, we really have to look at how these votes were actually counted and what the processes were, Riggleman told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro in his first interview since Saturday. For only 2,500 people to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of people like this is really egregious. In response to Riggleman's claim, Good said when results were called, That's what losers say. Riggleman said he's still weighing his option on whether to challenge the results and claimed Good paid committee members to push for a convention rather than a primary.

Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter.

{"original": "Kirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her.", "augmented": []}

Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen.

After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana.

Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018.

After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998.

After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image.

Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning.

Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here?

If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does.

Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs.

At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Tradicant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's unexpected election in November 2016.

Messam's parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica. His father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. Messam earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship Team under legendary coach Bobby Bowden.

They have three children, Wayne II, and twin daughters, Kayla and Kyla. Issues While lacking name recognition outside Florida, Messam told CNN that under his leadership, the city of Miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from Hurricane Irma.

Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees."}

After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values."}

Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.

She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office."}

Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post.

He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign."}

{"original": "During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country.

Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign.

Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video.
