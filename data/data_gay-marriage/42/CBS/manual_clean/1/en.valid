You can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are, when in fact they said We're going to set up a no-fly zone, that you can't fly through our zone.
The State Department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling. Previously the department pointed to guidance on its website that said there must be a biological connection to a U.S. citizen to become a citizen at birth.
In the fall of 1988, Carolyn set out on her next adventure in life, teaching English in Seoul, South Korea.
President Trump and Vice President Pence met with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House Thursday during Varadkar's annual trip ahead of St. Patrick's Day. Varadkar brought a very special guest to breakfast at Pence's residence at the Naval Observatory — his partner, Dr. Matthew Barrett.
1960: Bob Newhart Warner Records Nominees: The Brothers Four, Miriam Makeba, Leontyne Price and Joanie Sommers With The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart - the first comedy album to hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart - the comedian became the first artist to win Grammys in both the Album of the Year and Best New Artist categories. [Only three others have achieved that feat: Christopher Cross, Lauryn Hill and Norah Jones.] Newhart would release several more albums, and would star in a variety show and three sit-coms (including the classics The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart). He also made appearances in films such as Catch-22, Cold Turkey, In & Out and Elf.
And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him.
Ames said she was in disbelief, and asked Patrick to take her to Carolyn's apartment where she saw her friend's brutalized body on the bed, covered in blood.
When we come back, the Democratic presidential debate continues right after this, only on CBS.
BLOOMBERG: I have been training for this job since I stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9/11. I know what to do. I've shown I know how to run a country. I've run the city which is almost the same size -- bigger than most countries in the world.
Moore's ethics trial came amid upheaval in all three branches of Alabama's government. The Republican speaker of the state House of Representatives was removed from office this summer for criminal ethics violations. A legislative committee is weighing whether Gov. Robert Bentley should be impeached over a scandal involving a top aide.
STEYER: I bought stock in a prison company thinking they would do a better job. And I investigated. And I sold it.
In the House, he was a member of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the Democratic Party to support more audacious efforts, like the Green New Deal, to mitigate climate change. During his Senate campaign, O'Rourke refused to back Medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 Democrats have vouched their support for. Medicare for All emerges as first litmus test for 2020 Democratic contenders
Kathy Patrick: No! This has to stop now, please. … You're really sidelining me here, and I am not prepared to answer questions here at my place of work. This happened 30 years ago, I have been available to investigators in Korea and in the U.S.
1976: Starland Vocal Band Windsong/RCA Nominees: Boston, Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, The Brothers Johnson and Wild Cherry Starland Vocal Band (from left: Jon Carroll, Margot Chapman, Taffy Danoff and Bill Danoff) copped two Grammys in 1976, for Best New Artist and for Best Arrangement for Voices (Duo, Group Or Chorus) for their Afternoon Delight. It was the first song the group had ever recorded, and it hit Number One. The band starred in a 1977 summer replacement series on CBS, The Starland Vocal Band Show, a variety series whose cast included David Letterman (Yes, I can hear sets being clicked off all over this great land of ours!). The band dis-banded in 1981 and went on to solo careers.
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: 2020 is our time to change who makes the rules.
WARREN: I mean that Mayor Bloomberg -- let's think of it this way. We're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week is Donald Trump. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy Senator Lindsey Graham, who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg.
Peter Van Sant: Who do you believe held the knife and murdered Carolyn Abel?
Nancy Bercaw: And very quickly thereafter John Boatwright walked in.
1962: Robert Goulet Columbia Records Nominees: The Four Seasons, Vaughn Meader, The New Christy Minstrels, Peter, Paul and Mary, and Allan Sherman Born in Massachusetts, Robert Goulet spent his adolescence in Canada, and eventually studied at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto.

But you know what? For the ordinary American, things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck; 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are underinsured; 45 million people are struggling with student debt; 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans.
1998: Lauryn Hill Ruffhouse/Columbia; Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: Backstreet Boys, Andrea Bocelli, Dixie Chicks and Natalie Imbruglia In 1998 the singer-rapper (who's previously won two Grammys as part of the band The Fugees) released her first solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.

She was the first woman to receive 10 Grammy nominations in a single year, and the first to win five in one night. She won another as co-producer of the 1999 Album of the Year, Supernatural by Santana. She bowed out of public life following her last album, MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, in 2001, though she continued to record. Hill rejoined the Fugees for a tour in 2005, but split yet again. In 2013 Hill served three months in federal prison on tax evasion charges.
WARREN: We need to talk about our aspirations, our hopes.
BRENNAN: You praised -- it's in the same theme, sir. You've praised the Chinese Communist Party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country. You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass?
Pete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing.
Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond? Mayor Bloomberg?
We can solve this problem this year for everyone, Graham said. It's an opportunity for the legislature as a whole to be on the right side of history.
Tomoyuki Ayagaki: Yeah [wipes away a tear]. Sorry.
As conservative Townhall.com columnist and Trump supporter Kurt Schlichter puts it: I see no reason not to play by [Democrats'] rules…not allowing the other side to gain an advantage by weaponizing morality against us.
Korean police and press swarmed the apartment, which had been ransacked. Within hours, the murder led the national news in South Korea.
Nancy Bercaw: And from the minute she walked into the staff room, she was just a breath of fresh air. …She sort of looked a little bit like Farrah Fawcett.
But why would Patrick want Carolyn dead? Investigators uncovered a secret which provided a potential motive.
Tamara Doak: Kathy really fell for Carolyn.
How about a wealth tax in America? Because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies, to really level the playing field.
However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure
Seven Democratic candidates met on stage in South Carolina for the last debate before the state's primary and Super Tuesday, co-hosted by CBS News, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and Twitter. Read CBS News' full coverage here, and find the full transcript below.
And I would agree, when Mayor Bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget -- he tried to cut back on the CDC; he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world; he hasn't yet really addressed the nation on this topic, I would do all of that.
BUTTIGIEG: Think about what that will be like for this country.
WARREN: People across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. This is an issue we need to talk about.
The gun manufacturers own the Senate of the United States. So even though more than 90 percent of Americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase, we can't get it through the Senate.
I guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should.
Sandra Ames: I was not at that point concerned. But … Kathy was concerned about Carolyn because she couldn't get her on the phone.
The question to you is this, would you close the borders to Americans who have been exposed to the Coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country?
And with no extradition treaty in place, South Korean authorities put the murder case on the shelf.
SANDERS: ... has loved for years. Cuba, Nicaragua, authoritarianism of any stripe is bad.
Tomoyuki Ayagaki [translated]: She's always -- cheerful.
While Kathy Patrick carried on with her life.
BLOOMBERG: The polls aren't the election.
Jayne Houdyshell and Laurie Metcalf in A Doll's House, Part 2. Brigitte Lacombe
BUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about this. Let's talk about what's radical about that plan.
WHITAKER: Let's talk about education. South Carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. Black students here consistently score worse than white students. Mayor Bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in New York City was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. As president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide?
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. This is one of the first times we've talked about housing. And I put forward an extensive policy.
Controversy While Swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in Congress, the California Democrat will surely face criticism from Mr. Trump and Republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the Mueller probe. What Trump says The president has yet to tweet about Swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the Justice Department's summary of the Mueller report. In a memorandum, Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge Swalwell and other prominent Democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
STEYER: There's something going on here. I have worked for racial justice...
John Boatwright: He asked her, Do you know where the murder weapon is? And she said, No. And she really peaked out on that … indicating … she was not being truthful.
Classes were winding down for the winter break. Ayagaki was getting ready to fly to Seoul, hoping to get an answer to his marriage proposal. On Tuesday, Dec. 20, Carolyn never made it to work.
KLOBUCHAR: So, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now.
Here are the seven candidates for the presidential nomination.
ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers backed a bill on Tuesday preventing businesses from discriminating based on race, nationality, religion or sex, after Republicans rejected Democrats' efforts to add gay and transgender people to those protected by the measure.
BLOOMBERG: We have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. So you can do it. It's Congress that can't seem to do it. And I don't know why we think they're going to do it. The vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the NRA. And certainly Senator Sanders has supported the NRA.
BUTTIGIEG: The only way we're going to restore...
And I want to make clear, given South Carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. It's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing.
KING: Senator Warren, that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor.
KLOBUCHAR: ... and do something for the people of America.
Last year you and Karen said that my partner, Matthew, would be welcome to join us, and we're both really honored to accept the invitation this year, Varadkar said during the Friends of Ireland breakfast.
Secondly, I provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. Thirdly, I go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. They're being bought out. You cannot find a place to live.
BUTTIGIEG: We will deliver a democracy worthy of the name.
Peter Van Sant: She's just staring at you?
1996: LeAnn Rimes Curb Records Nominees: Garbage, Jewel, No Doubt and The Tony Rich Project At age 14, LeAnn Rimes not only beat out fellow nominees Garbage, Jewel, No Doubt and The Tony Rich Project; she also became the youngest Grammy winner in history, a title she holds to this day. The country singer's major-label debut album, Blue, went multi-platinum, and earned her a Best Female Country Vocal Performance Grammy as well. Rimes has had six more Grammy nominations since, including Album of the Year for her contribution to Vince Gill's These Days (2008).
The other issue is we don't have enough personnel. And so that's where we get to this education plan.. And I don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. What I think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy.
1989: Milli Vanilli Arista Records Nominees: Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Soul II Soul and Tone Lōc Milli Vanilli rose to fame in the late '80s and early '90s following the release of the hit album, Girl You Know It's True. Rob Morvan and Rob Pilatus served as the faces of the popular German duo, though the world would soon learn that they did not provide vocals on any of their recordings -- but not before Milli Vanilli swooped up the Best New Artist honor at the Grammys. The award was later revoked -- the only time a Grammy win has ever been vacated -- and several lawsuits followed. Morvan and Pilatus attempted to make music on their own, under a different group name, but it failed to gain any traction. Years later, in 1998, Milli Vanilli started prepping a comeback album, called Back and In Attack, but the set never saw the light of day. Pilatus died on April 2, 1998 at the age of 32 of a suspected alcohol and prescription pill overdose -- right before the launch of a promotional tour for the LP.
Actually, this is something I haven't even mentioned to anyone — if we can keep this between us three and you all, he said gesturing to the audience. I'm actually expecting a baby in July with my husband. The crowd erupted with cheers and Ferguson joked, Let's just keep it between us.
Remember, Boatwright believed that wound was inflicted after Carolyn was already dead from the stab wound to the lung.
ELS is the English Language School, where Bercaw met fellow teacher Carolyn Abel back in 1988.
We went to Mitch McConnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. He said, no, we want no part of it. And if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. And, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end. And so, look, we, in fact, should be imposing sanctions on Russia now for their interference.
Peter Van Sant: Did you ask Kathy Patrick flat-out, Did you murder Carolyn Abel?
John Boatwright: That certainly would not be normal.
We're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors.
Cory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration.
BLOOMBERG: Probably wrong to make the jokes. I don't remember what they were. So I assume -- if it bothered them, I was wrong, and I apologize. I'm sorry for that.
I did it in New York City. I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. You can work across the aisle. You just have to know how to deal with people.
BRENNAN: Well, you're out of time. Senator.
Last night's terror attacks on and near London Bridge, in which seven people were killed, was the third attack in the U.K. in three months. British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned the violence, saying, It's time to say, enough is enough. Elizabeth Palmer and Charlie D'Agata have the latest.
Peter Van Sant: And do you get a chance to question each of them?
Julián Castro Julián Castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 Biography Julián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues.
Kathy Patrick: Umm, I have to say that I'm innocent. And that I -- don't know what happened after I found Carolyn's body.
Charles Kuralt went On the Road to Oklahoma City, where he met Sylvan Goldman, famed for having invented the ubiquitous grocery store shopping cart in 1937. Originally broadcast on CBS News' Who's Who on January 11, 1977.

Kirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her.
KING: I've never broken a promise.
It may seem far-fetched, but Ames claims those memories had been suppressed deep in her subconscious mind until the interview with Boatwright.
It adds to four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands.
Peter Van Sant: So, do you believe this sudden move from South Korea to the United States was in a way-- an expression of consciousness of guilt?
Tamara Doak: And she would confide in me, you know, I really like this woman. … I think she's into me. And I'm like, Kathy, I don't really think she's gay. You should really be careful.
SANDERS: The moderator -- is it my turn?
And, in fact, since then, I have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. I have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and Latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced.
The shocked friends turned their attention to Kathy Patrick and Sandra Ames, who had discovered Carolyn's body.
I want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th Century or the 19th Century. If you look at the biggest threats to the United States, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the United States. We're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need U.S. leadership for countries around the world.
BUTTIGIEG: ... listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall.
Peter Van Sant: Where should Kathy Patrick be today, in your opinion?
Vice President Biden, I want to start with you, why should anyone have faith that you're the one who can get this done now?
Early in the afternoon on Dec. 20, 1988, colleagues and students of Carolyn Abel's came to her apartment building after she failed to show up for work.
They like America. They want to be entrepreneurs. And the way that we embrace them, and not the socialist regime, is by opening up Cuba and starting to do business with them.
Wanda Abel: We just couldn't believe it. I mean, six months for assisting a murderer and covering up the crime scene and making it look like a burglary and not even telling anybody? Not talking? … I don't understand.
1982: Men At Work Columbia Records Nominees: Asia, Jennifer Holliday, The Human League and Stray Cats Australian pop-rock group Men At Work, fronted by Colin Hay (with Russell Deppeler, Greg Ham, John Rees, Jerry Speiser, Ron Strykert), was formed in 1978, but it wasn't until 1982 that their first album reached the United States, featuring the hits Down Under and Who Could It Be Now? Two more albums followed, yet by 1986 Hay decided to call it quits and record a solo album. They reformed 10 years later -- only to disband again in 2002.
BLOOMBERG: I never said that. And for the record, if she was a teacher in New York City, she would never have had that problem. We treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that.
Days later, Patrick led a memorial service for Carolyn.
Steven Schroeder: My name is Steven Schroeder, I'm a retired Assistant United States Attorney and I worked in Seattle.
KING: All right, Mr. Steyer, please? Mr. Steyer?
And to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity. Because if we don't pass Representative Clyburn's bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny.
GARRETT: Senator Sanders -- no, Senator Sanders, I have a question for you, sir. You're the frontrunner in this race. You're on the ballot in South Carolina. Mayor Bloomberg, you'll understand that preamble in just a second.

Correspondent Peter Van Sant and his team have investigated the disturbing 1988 murder of Carolyn Abel, an American teacher in South Korea, and the loophole in U.S. laws at the time that mean the suspected killer may never face trial.
STEYER: I get to answer that.
If elected, Senator Sanders, you would be America's first Jewish president. You recently called a very prominent, well-known American Israel lobby a platform for, quote, bigotry. What would you say to American Jews who might be concerned you're not, from their perspective, supportive enough of Israel? And specifically, sir, would you move the U.S. embassy back to Tel Aviv?
STEYER: Bernie Sanders' analysis is right.
Do you feel your marriage is campaigning as well, because you're doing something that is new in American politics? Dickerson asks Chasten Buttigieg.
Patrick turned down 48 Hours' request for an interview, saying Carolyn's murder was too painful to talk about. But on this day, her past was fast approaching.
The change would catch Georgia up to federal standards set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Georgia is one of five states without a so-called public accommodation law.
Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.
On the other hand, of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally, Mr. Bloomberg, I beat Trump 47 of those 50 times.
In 2015, when both Buttigieg and Pence were serving in Indiana, Pence, then the governor, signed a law that critics said unfairly targeted members of the LGBTQ community. Months later, during his mayoral re-election bid, Buttigieg came out as gay. The law was eventually rolled back amid a national outcry.
In addition to, that I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. We would give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.
Comedy titans Norman Lear, Carl Reiner and Dick Van Dyke are a collective 280 years old, earning them starring roles in the new HBO documentary, If You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast. Tracy Smith reports.
They are the Democratic National Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders.
I'll tell you exactly what it adds up to.
John Boatwright: I believe that -- Kathy and Carolyn were alone -- during that initial attack. … The thing that makes the most sense to me is … Kathy tried to kiss Carolyn and Carolyn pushed her away and rejected that kiss. … I think Kathy was so enraged and angry that she lost control.
Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does. Harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
BRENNAN: Mayor Buttigieg, the floor is yours, would you like -- same question.
Starbucks has crafted a brand focused not only on coffee, but also on living up to progressive ideals. Now, that brand image is taking a hit following a racial bias incident at one of its stores.
It was 1989 when Steven Schroeder was assigned the case with John Boatwright and FBI agents. Along with her lawyer, Kathy Patrick willingly sat down with them to be questioned.
The latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed that Buttigieg is third among likely Democratic caucus goers behind Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The poll showed that 40% of Democrats in Iowa have decided who they will support, compared to 45% who said they can be persuaded to support another candidate.
We have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids. And, yes, that means a secretary of education who will support teachers. It also means investing.
The religion has also traditionally used separate youth programs for boys and girls.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Some candidness may also follow the lead of O'Rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. In 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a DWI program the following year. O'Rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the Houston Chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. What Trump says Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an O'Rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the Texas Democrat's unsuccessful Senate bid. I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, Mr. Trump told reporters in December. When the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed O'Rourke's great defeat in November.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church said Tuesday it will sever all ties with the Boy Scouts of America at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing. The move ends a nearly century-old relationship that was based on their shared values.
Steven Schroeder: There was enough indication of that to justify us doing further investigation, yes. … my strategy at that point was if the Koreans did not prosecute her, then to look whether we could for basically false statements, perjury, obstruction of justice.
O'DONNELL: Now, here are the rules for the next two hours.
SANDERS: Do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage...
You talk about -- concerned about race. Well, my good friend on the end of this platform, he, in fact, bought a system that was a private prison system, after, after he knew that, in fact, what happened was, they hog-tied young men in prison here in this state.
SANDERS: That's what our movement is about.
Graham has said of Mr. Trump, I never said he was the best example of the Christian faith. He defends the faith. And I appreciate that very much. And he said that the president has admitted his faults and has apologized to his wife and daughter for things he has done and said. And he has to stand before God for those things.
In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail.
2014: Sam Smith Michael Hickey/Getty Images Nominees: Bastille, Brandy Clark, Iggy Azalea and Haim. In 2015 Sam Smith won four Grammys (including Best New Artist) for his album, In the Lonely Hour. During the year that followed, Smith received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for his theme to the James Bond thriller, Spectre, Writing's on the Wall.
BUTTIGIEG: You've got people believing something that is false. This needs to be cleared up.
2008: Adele XL/Columbia Nominees: Duffy, Jonas Brothers, Lady Antebellum and Jazmine Sullivan 2008 was just the start for Adele, who received four Grammy nominations and two awards for Chasing Pavements (from her album, 19). She subsequently won more than a dozen additional Grammys honoring her 2011 album 21; her 2011 live performance of Set Fire to the Rain at the Royal Albert Hall; the title song from the 2012 James Bond film, Skyfall; her 2015 album 25 and song of the year, Hello.
We leave you this Sunday Morning among the vistas of Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State. Videographer: Jamie McDonald.
Nancy Bercaw: Ex-pat life in Seoul in the late '80s was wild and … one place where our worlds collided and that was Itaewon, the red-light district. … So, what we did is we danced and drank like crazy people.
And, by the way, I went into all of those races that got 41 new Democrats. The majority of them are supporting me for president and endorsing me.
Right now, some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter-terrorism but issues like global health security and the Coronavirus, that rely on the ability to listen to scientists...
The women taught, traveled and partied together.
O'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views. Would you pull all combat troops out of the Middle East?
And now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom.
BLOOMBERG: Look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before.
KING: I'd like to get your thoughts on this, because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we've never done research on.
WHITAKER: Vice President Biden, black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both Democratic and Republican administrations. How do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities?
BLOOMBERG: ... I -- I got them.
1965: Tom Jones CBS News Nominees: The Byrds, Herman's Hermits, Horst Jankowski, Marilyn Maye, Sonny & Cher and Glenn Yarbrough The son of a Welsh coal miner, Tom Jones avoided a life destined in the mines thanks to a case of tuberculosis when he was 12. Instead, he trained his voice, played the pubs, and cut a demo record that launched an international career singing blues, pop, country and gospel music. His first album, Along Came Jones (a.k.a. It's Not Unusual), hit No. 11 on the U.S. charts. More records followed, with such hits as What's New Pussycat, Delilah, Green, Green Grass of Home, She's a Lady, Kiss and Sex Bomb, as well as a TV series (This Is Tom Jones), and even a self-parodying film appearance (Mars Attacks!).
And chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump.
Wanda Abel: She would get restless. She didn't like being just in one place for too long.
Buzz about Starbucks has also dropped into negative territory, YouGov found. Its Buzz score, which is based on whether consumers say they've heard anything positive or negative about a brand, fell from 13 to -8 on Tuesday.
WHITAKER: The bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report concluded Russia interfered in our last presidential election, and the Obama administration failed to respond forcefully. U.S. intelligence says Russia is at it again. If it is proven that Russia has interfered in the 2020 elections, would you, as president, launch a retaliatory cyber attack?
But it's so much more than that. As Democrats, we need to speak to the future we can build together. We need to speak of the prosperity we can build together.
BUTTIGIEG: ... for this whole campaign, I don't know where you got the impression...
BIDEN: I note how you cut me off all the time but I'm not going to be quiet anymore, OK?
Without incriminating statements from Patrick, the Feds were not able to press charges for perjury.
BUTTIGIEG: Look, the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators. I'm a little biased, because I'm married to one. And I get an education about education every day I come home.
COMMENTARY: Too many exclamation points!!! | Watch Video!!!
Sandra Ames: Kathy told me that she was in love with Carolyn … and that … her feelings were not necessarily returned.
His stump speech revolves largely around faith, freedom and democracy. He's also consistent about stressing that his campaign aims to build a sense of belonging, and he has a collection of anecdotes about how his campaign has emphasized that idea to its supporters.
BIDEN: Barack Obama was abroad, he was in a town meeting, he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government. He acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy. But he went on and condemned the dictatorship. He went on and condemned the people who, in fact, had run that committee.
But this is a dangerous world. And if we haven't learnt that after 9/11, I don't know what's going to teach us what to. This -- we have to do something, and I think the budget that we -- the things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now.
That restlessness compelled Carolyn to join the Peace Corps after college, serving in Nepal where she taught English. In 1987, Carolyn took another teaching job in Japan, where she met Tomoyuki Ayagaki, a customs agent.
We did ban smoking in New York City in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing. And it has spread across America, across Europe, across Latin America, even into places in the Middle East and into the Far East. It has saved an enormous number of lives.
O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, a quick response, and then Senator Warren.
KING: All right, thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Wanda Abel: Tomoyuki did propose to Carolyn.
Franklin Graham, who is the son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and a prominent supporter of President Trump, slammed Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for being gay, Christian and married. In a series of three tweets Wednesday, he assailed Buttigieg for remarks he has made about being a gay Christian.
After Democrats on the committee questioned Beskin about whether she intended to excuse discrimination against other groups, Beskin said local governments can decide to provide protections beyond the proposed bill. Some municipalities, including the city of Atlanta, already have such laws.
WEB EXTRA: Laurie Metcalf on A Doll's House, Part 2 (Video)
How far does that go? Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?
KLOBUCHAR: I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that.
That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.
Nancy Bercaw: We've all continued our lives as adventurous people. …But, you know, we kind of … carry the memory of Carolyn … behind us, whatever ground we walk on. It's hard not to remember there's another one of us who could be out there on the same path.
So the question you have to ask yourself is, how do we change the Senate of the United States in a material way? And there are two things. That's why I am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator, to change who's in charge, to get rid of Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz.
This is our very first passport photo. Carolyn is on the right, said Wanda Abel, who is pictured with her sisters. CBS News/Wanda Abel
On the Intelligence Committee, Swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel Robert Mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the Trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the Russian government, including the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton during the summer of 2016. Issues Swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. He has been strongly critical of the National Rifle Association's (NRA) sway in Congress and has repeatedly lambasted Republicans for not supporting gun control measures. He is hosting a town hall on gun control in Florida Tuesday alongside survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. Last week, the California Democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. We're going to war. And you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by Swalwell on Twitter is heard saying. In his post, Swalwell wrote, I'm not afraid of this guy. I'm not afraid of the NRA. I'm not afraid. No fear. #EndGunViolence.
BUTTIGIEG: Because let's talk about what it adds up to.
About a decade ago, Iowa led the way in making it possible for a marriage like mine to exist, he noted. Iowa has recognized same-sex marriages since 2009.
BIDEN: I will win South Carolina.
Sunday Morning takes a look at some notable events of the week ahead. Jane Pauley reports.
BUTTIGIEG: ... the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago.
I lived in a country where, if I'd tried to be myself at the time, it would have ended up breaking laws, the Irish prime minister said Thursday. But today, that is all changed. I stand here, leader of my country, flawed and human, but judged by my political actions, and not by my sexual orientation, my skin tone, gender or religious beliefs.
MUSIC: Roger Waters: Still tearing down walls | Watch Video
BLOOMBERG: There are other people here.
KLOBUCHAR: And if you want to talk about getting things done and make a comparison, according to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the U.S. Senate on 15 metrics.
I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.
In terms of experience for the job, Buttigieg says one of the toughest decisions he's had to make was a moment in Afghanistan when he needed to make a split-second decision whether to abandon a vehicle that might be ready to explode and risk being killed, or continue on with his mission.
But I want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the American people because this is so serious. I'm not going to give my website right now. I'm going to give the CDC's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. Because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here.
BUTTIGIEG: This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. This is about 2020. We are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the Cold War. And we're not going to win these critical, critical House and Senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the Democratic Party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime. We've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future.
O'DONNELL: I will allow Senator Sanders a quick response, and then Senator Warren.
Kathy Patrick, Sandra Ames and three Korean men walked down the outdoor hallway. Surprisingly, the door was unlocked and they went inside.
After states including North Carolina and Mississippi recently enacted anti-gay laws, Target last month reaffirmed its commitment to protecting gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. The retailer's public stance drew a boycott effort by a conservative Christian group, along with a rebuke from an Alabama city that is home to a Target.
My secretary of education will be someone who believes in public education. And my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools.
KLOBUCHAR: OK. We'll have a fact check look at this.

The Mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of God.
Sandra Ames: She was making her students laugh, and sing, and -- and have fun learning English.
BIDEN: Well, first of all, the latest poll I saw, my numbers -- I'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll.
Morris said the government wrongly applied a policy for children born out of wedlock to married same-sex couples.
We need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy, and we need strong alliances. We need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm. And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. We need not to cut and run on our allies.
Then again, Jesus never voted in a Republican primary.
Peter Van Sant: And what was her answer? Do you know?
You talk about what we're talking about with Bernie. Bernie, in fact, hasn't passed much of anything. The fact of the matter is...
BUTTIGIEG: I'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. But I want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took, this is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds.
The Boy Scout movement had been entrenched in Mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.
Steven Schroeder: It was very frustrating.
We're going to begin with you, Vice President Biden, for this part. Just across the street, as you mentioned at the top of the debate, is the theater (sic) where nine people were shot and killed inside the Mother Emanuel Church. We all remember that day back in 2015.
PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The time has come to turn the page and open up a new chapter in the American story.
BUTTIGIEG: They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can.
O'DONNELL: Thank you. Let's keep this topic going. Mayor Pete?
But American authorities weren't finished with Kathy Patrick. And soon, they would come face-to-face with her.

The still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to Boy Scouts, but it won't be modeled after Boy Scouts or use ranks. The 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the Boy Scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.
BLOOMBERG: And he has defunded -- he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing. As you see, the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be.
KING: And Super Tuesday is just a week away. And this is the biggest primary day of the year, as voters in 14 states cast ballots, and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind.
STEYER: ... crime bill that put hundreds of thousands of young black and Latino men in prison.
1973: Bette Midler Atlantic Records Nominees: Eumir Deodato, Maureen McGovern, Marie Osmond and Barry White Born in Honolulu, Midler's stage career included the Broadway run of Fiddler on the Roof. But it was her performances in cabarets and gay bathhouses in the early 1970s, as well as in The Who's Tommy, that rocketed her to stardom as The Divine Miss M. Her hits included Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, From a Distance, The Rose, and Wind Beneath My Wings (the latter two of which won her Grammys). Midler also starred in such films as The Rose, Outrageous Fortune, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Beaches, Ruthless People, For the Boys, and The First Wives Club. In 2013 she returned to Broadway in the one-woman play, I'll Eat You Last: A Chat with Sue Mengers, and won a Tony for Best Actress in a Musical for the 2017 revival of Hello, Dolly!
KLOBUCHAR: I don't think we do. I think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that we're going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us.
The principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination, you bet. But I was 21 years old. I didn't have a union to protect me. And I didn't have any federal law on my side. So I packed up my stuff, and I went home. At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, Kill it, the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said...
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let us go forward. Let's win this thing. Let's transform America!
BIDEN: Can I respond to that, as well?
1978: A Taste of Honey Capitol Records Nominees: The Cars, Elvis Costello, Chris Rea and Toto It would be several years before Janice M. Johnson, Perry Kibble, Donald R. Johnson and Hazel Payne (who had first played together in 1971) would find success with Capitol Records and their disco hit, Boogie Oogie Oogie. Renamed A Taste of Honey, the band sold two million copies of their debut album, which hit Number 1 on the charts. With new members the band failed to score another big hit with their follow-up albums, Another Taste and Twice As Sweet, and within two years, only vocalists Janice Johnson and Hazel Payne remained. In 1984 Johnson released a solo album, One Taste of Honey, and a second in 2000, Hiatus of the Heart. Hazel Payne left the group to pursue an acting career, but performed with Janice Johnson on two PBS reunion specials. Drummer/vocalist Donald Ray Johnson continues to perform blues in Calgary, Canada, and has toured with such artists as Teddy Pendergrass, Smokey Wilson and The Isley Brothers. Perry Kibble, who became a music producer in Canada, died of congestive heart failure in 1999 at age 49.
SANDERS: No, I think -- Tom, I think she was talking about my plan, not yours.
BIDEN: Here's the deal. Here's the deal.
BUTTIGIEG: To do nothing is what will happen...
Pence, a conservative Christian, has opposed same-sex marriage throughout his career, as well as the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy. He's received harsh criticism from social activists for pursuing anti-LGBTQ policies during his time as governor of Indiana. In January, his wife, Karen Pence, faced criticism for taking a teaching job at a Christian school that bans LGBTQ students and faculty. She did not attend the breakfast Thursday.
Kathy Patrick: I believe she is.
KING: Senator Warren, I'm coming to you. I want to direct this question to you because you -- because Mayor Bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesn't believe that any of you on stage can beat Donald Trump. You said Mayor Bloomberg is not the safest candidate, he is the riskiest candidate. What did you mean by that?
Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.
GARRETT: Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much. Back to you, Bill.
Behind Joe Biden's search for a running mate 02:04 More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.
The way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. We go from 1.5 billion to $3 billion, taking $30 billion off the sidelines. That's how you create wealth.
Peter Van Sant: And did you present her with what her roommate had said?
Peter Van Sant: You did tell authorities at the time that you cleaned a bloody knife.
Vice President Biden, I want to make -- I want to bring us to another topic. We're in South Carolina. It's the first primary with a significant black voting population. Your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. And I'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time.
Peter Van Sant: Did you fall in love with Carolyn?
KLOBUCHAR: People aren't always aware, I know you are in South Carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. So the answer is one size doesn't fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. And actually, I am leading -- the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered.
O'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist?
And that's not the only right-wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded. In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point.
Both bills approved Tuesday now go to the House Rules committee, which determines the daily schedule of bills receiving a full vote on the floor. The bills could receive a vote as soon as Thursday.

Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. And they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. So how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas?
John Boatwright: In my opinion, her throat was cut after she was deceased.
And every day in our country, over 100 people die from gun violence. You all have plans, I know, on this stage, to address the gun crisis. But Congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century. And just think about this, in those 25 years we've had Columbine, Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas. We could go on and on.
Moore was found to have encouraged probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples six months after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that everyone has a fundamental right to marry in all 50 states.
KLOBUCHAR: ... in charge of this ticket -- could I finish, Margaret?
Buttigieg, 37, is a veteran of the Afghanistan war and is one of many vying for the Democratic nomination for president. If elected, he would be America's youngest president ever.
Peter Van Sant: It has been 30 years since this –
BLOOMBERG: No. You want to cut it back as much as you can, but I think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. We have to be able to stop terrorism. And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible.
Sandra Ames: We spent the time looking at temples, and hiking and then partying in the evenings.
O'DONNELL: Mr. Mayor, you're allowed to respond.
The Boy Scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. Last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to Scouts BSA to account for the inclusion of girls.
The Boy Scouts of America in a statement thanked the thousands of Mormons who have served as scout leaders and wished the religion well on its new program. The organization said individual Mormons who wish to stay in Boy Scouts would be integrated into other troops.
SANDERS: Can I respond? I was mentioned...
WARREN: I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will. And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic Party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.
The move by Texas to pressure Target comes as North Carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the Justice Department says violates civil rights law.

Sunday Morning follows up on recent stories and viewer mail - from a recent court decision about a Wisconsin law that prevented home bakers from selling homemade cookies, to reaction to our recent Almanac on author Ian Fleming. Jane Pauley reports.
2004: Maroon 5 Octone/J Nominees: Los Lonely Boys, Joss Stone, Kanye West and Gretchen Wilson Before there was Maroon 5, there was Kara's Flowers. Singer Adam Levine and some of the original Maroon 5 members founded that group back in 1994 while still in high school. They released The Fourth World in 1997, but after a lukewarm response decided to revamp the band's sound, add guitarist James Valentine to the line-up, and call themselves Maroon 5. By 2002, the Levine-fronted Los Angeles-based band had Songs About Jane, the hit album featuring the massive hit Harder to Breathe. Soon, Maroon 5 walked away with the 2004 Grammy for Best New Artist. Four more studio albums (and plenty more radio hits) followed. In total, Maroon 5 has received three Grammys from 12 nominations. Levine, meanwhile, has gone on to become a huge success on his own. He has served as a mentor on The Voice, and was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 2013.

Tim Ryan Biography Ryan was born and raised in northeastern Ohio in 1973. He played football in high school and was recruited to play for Youngstown State University. Because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to Bowling Green State University, near Toledo. After graduating from college, Ryan earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire and worked in the office of longtime Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who was expelled from the House after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Tradicant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's unexpected election in November 2016. Citing Democrats' loss of Midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- Ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy Pelosi, then House Minority Leader. After Democrats retook control of the House during the 2018 November midterm elections, the Ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace Pelosi. Ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. Rep.

GARRETT: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. I want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what Senator Warren just said on Twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining.
Peter Van Sant: And did Kathy try to shift blame at all? Did she point the finger of suspicion at all at Sandra?

Wayne Messam Screenshot from Wayne Messam's 2020 campaign video Wayne for America Biography Born in Pahokee, Florida and raised in South Bay, Mayor Wayne Messam became the first African American mayor of the city of Miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. Messam's parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica. His father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. Messam earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship Team under legendary coach Bobby Bowden. He would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. Wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, Angela, more than 20 years ago. They have three children, Wayne II, and twin daughters, Kayla and Kyla. Issues While lacking name recognition outside Florida, Messam told CNN that under his leadership, the city of Miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from Hurricane Irma. He has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. These are issues that have national implications and I'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the American people and I'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the United States, he said.

2003: Evanescence Frank Micelotta/Getty Images Nominees: 50 Cent, Fountains of Wayne, Heather Headley and Sean Paul Originally formed in 1995, the Little Rock, Ark., rock/metal band - comprised of David Hodges (left, keyboard), Amy Lee (right, vocals) and Ben R. Moody II (lead guitarist) - won two Grammys for their debut major label album, Fallen: Best New Artist, and Best Hard Rock Performance (for Bring Me to Life). Less than two months before the Grammy ceremony, however, Hodges left the band to record with Trading Yesterday (a.k.a. The Age of Information). He later released several solo albums. Moody left Evanescence in 2003 during the group's Fallen tour. After several solo records, he helped form the Gothic metal band, We Are the Fallen. Lee remained with the band, seeing through the much-delayed 2011 release of its third album, titled Evanescence, which debuted on the Billboard charts at Number 1.
In his exit memo from the agency, Castro said that HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. Under the Obama administration, he wrote, HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. Views on LGBT issues and abortion rights He supports LGBT rights and was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. Castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May. Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department. What Trump says Castro has not yet been a target for President Trump. Unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, Mr. Trump has never personally disparaged Castro on Twitter. Issues In his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants.

When you are asked a question, you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer, and 45 seconds for follow-ups.
BIDEN: Because I'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. I beat the NRA twice. I got assault weapons banned. I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. I got them eliminated. Except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida and it was not reauthorized.
Mayor Bloomberg, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. I want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community. You've apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly. What exactly are you apologizing for?
The national debate over LGBT rights is unlikely to abate anytime soon, but experts say the Target brand is unlikely to face any long-term damage.

He often called for improvements to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. During and after his senate campaign, O'Rourke made immigration a central issue. He has routinely denounced the White House for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the U.S.-Mexico border. He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. We know that walls do not save lives. Walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of Mr. Trump's nearby rallies. In the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. Controversy In addition to the scrutiny O'Rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a Senate race, the Texas Democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in Congress and personal life. Although he had a generally liberal voting record in Congress, O'Rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left.

In 1981 an infectious disease researcher at the National institutes of Health started noticing reports that clusters of gay men were being diagnosed with infections that were highly unusual in younger people. It would take a few years before the medical community identified HIV which, left unchecked, can develop into the deadly syndrome known as AIDS.

1963: The Swingle Singers CBS News Nominees: Vikki Carr, John Gary, The J's with Jamie, and Trini Lopez Formed by Ward Swingle in Paris, the Swingle Singers was comprised of French session artists who joined to perform jazz vocals. Their renditions of J.S. Bach fugues and The Well-Tempered Clavier as vocals, Jazz Sébastien Bach (released in the U.S. as Bach's Greatest Hits), won a Grammy for Best Performance by a Chorus, and also won the group Best New Artist. In the early 1970s the singers disbanded, but Ward Swingle re-formed the group in England with a new cast. Over the past half-century the Swingles' various iterations have released more than 50 recordings, won five Grammys, and had their music used in such disparate programs as Wedding Crashers and Sex and the City. The group also curates the London A Cappella Festival. Ward Swingle died on Jan. 19, 2015, in Eastbourne, England. He was 87.
2000: Shelby Lynne LUCY NICHOLSON/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: Brad Paisley, Papa Roach, Jill Scott and Sisqó Despite winning Best New Artist for 2000, Shelby Lynne had been recording for more than a decade, beginning with her 1989 album, Sunrise. (The Academy of Country Music Awards actually elected Lynne New Female Vocalist of the Year in 1990.) But it wasn't until her 1999 album, I Am Shelby Lynne, that the singer-songwriter broke out of the pack, with confessional songs told with an eclectic country sound. After releasing a Dusty Springfield tribute album in 2008, Lynne started her own label, Everso Records. She's also taken on acting roles, playing Johnny Cash's mother in the 2005 biopic, Walk the Line.

When last we left off with Nora Helmer in Henrik Ibsen's landmark 1879 drama, A Doll's House, she had had an awakening -- and exited her marriage and family with the slam of a door. Now she's back, in the Tony-nominated A Doll's House, Part 2. Mo Rocca talks with playwright Lucas Hnath and the cast (including Laurie Metcalf, Chris Cooper and Jayne Houdyshell) about this continuation of the story of a woman awakened, and the mess she left behind in her journey toward self-discovery.

2009: The Zac Brown Band Atlantic Nominees: Keri Hilson, MGMT, Silversun Pickups and The Ting Tings In 2008 the country music group (featuring (Coy Bowles, Zac Brown, Jimmy De Martini, Chris Fryar and John Hopkins) released their second album, The Foundation, which hit Number 2 on the Billboard Country. It featured the Number 1 country hits Chicken Fried, Toes and Highway 20 Ride. After Clay Cook (a former member of the Marshall Tucker Band) joined Zac Brown's group, two more studio albums followed: You Get What You Give and Uncaged. The band subsequently won the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals Grammy for As She's Walking Away (featuring Alan Jackson), and Best Country Album (for Uncaged).
KLOBUCHAR: Why don't you let me answer, OK?
SANDERS: Listen to the moderator, guys.
In fact, Mr. Trump's policy of us going it alone, of America first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. The biggest threat to America right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. And it's time for us to deal with it that way. Every single foreign policy issue is about American leadership and coalition.
Secondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it.
In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama -- he wanted a primary-- he said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it.

Everything seemed fine until the couple brought their cranky infants to the American consulate in Toronto a few months later to apply for citizenship and the woman at the counter began asking probing questions they found shocking and humiliating.
WARREN: This is a point where we need to talk about race, though.
BLOOMBERG: We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95 percent. And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.
And I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. None of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin.

1969: Crosby, Stills & Nash Atlantic Records Nominees: Chicago, Led Zeppelin, The Neon Philharmonic and Oliver Call it one of the first super groups. David Crosby (The Byrds), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield) and Graham Nash (The Hollies) were all part of popular bands before teaming to create the harmonies that make up CS&N. The trio's self-titled debut album, released in 1969, featured the songs Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Marrakesh Express. A spot at Woodstock that year helped cement their place in history -- leading to the subsequent Best New Artist Grammy win. The trio would go on to perform with Neil Young as CSN&Y, and each member ended up pursuing solo careers over the years. Crosby, Stills & Nash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. You can still catch these guys on the road, as they tour fairly regularly.

But, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. They say go very slowly. They haven't done enough research. And the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains.
KLOBUCHAR: It is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done.
No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.
Number two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. The federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. We get $3.5 trillion in revenue. We lose $1 trillion a year.

But to receive forgiveness, one must confess the sin first. And President Trump has yet to admit his relationship with Ms. Daniels, much less ask forgiveness for it.
I'm big with an 'Irish exit.' I do not like long goodbyes, so maybe that's what I'll do. After my last scene I'll just leave the lot and just drive home, he said, receiving laughs from the audience. I think that's the only way I'll be able to manage this. It's really emotional.
BIDEN: Look, one of the things we have to do, we have a thing in the Defense Department called DARPA, a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer. They came up with the internet, I mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology.
But what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them?
KLOBUCHAR: OK. So, if I could finish. I have the bill. Anyone can check it out, to close the boyfriend loophole. Also to close the Charleston loophole is another bill that is out there. Universal background checks.
KLOBUCHAR: Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.

1986: Bruce Hornsby & the Range RCA Records Nominees: Glass Tiger, Nu Shooz, Simply Red and Timbuk3 Prior to launching his solo career, singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby played clubs and bars, served as a session musician, and toured with Sheena Easton's band. In 1986 he released The Way It Is, the debut album from Bruce Hornsby & the Range (the Range included David Mansfield, George Marinelli, John Molo, Joe Puerta). The album's title track, with its references to the civil rights movement, hit the top of the charts and has since been sampled by various hip-hop artists. The success of the album, which also featured singles Mandolin Rain and Every Little Kiss, landed them the Best New Artist Grammy. Since then, Hornsby has put out albums with and without the Range; toured with the Grateful Dead; and formed the band, the Noisemakers. The Virginia native received another Grammy in 1990 for his reworking of The Valley Road with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and his track (Song H) was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental at the 2007 Grammy Awards.

I think he needs to prove, other than say that 'it doesn't matter,' that he has the experience to lead, said Runal A.

I always think well, look how that presidency is going. You know, I don't think that that's a good answer.

Beto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 Biography O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees.
I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant, competitive private sector.
What do we have to do? Whether or not the issue is climate change, which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation, or infectious diseases like Coronavirus, requiring international cooperation, we have to work and expand the World Health Organization. Obviously, we have to make sure the CDC, the NIH, our infectious departments, are fully funded.
I worked in the projects, I came along, and the first thing I did as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, extended the Voting Rights Act eventually for 25 years. And I have been deeply involved. And my first effort I had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county.
The consular official told them she had discretion to require a DNA test to show who the biological father was of each boy and without those tests neither son would get citizenship.

How will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?
Perhaps most astonishing, a recent YouGov poll found only half of Trump voters said Trump cheating on his wife with Stormy Daniels would be immoral, even if it did happen. After everything they've learned about him, 56 percent of Trump supporters believe the phrase moral leader describes the president either very well or extremely well.
SANDERS: We've got to work with countries all the over the world to solve it.
KLOBUCHAR: But the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. So I have long supported the assault weapon ban. I am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an AK-47.
KING: He told a woman to get an abortion. What evidence do you have of that?
Target has been pretty balanced in terms of how they've been communicating with the media, he said. They are not being combative, they are just saying look, this is our policy, I don't think they are stirring up the pot, or trying to pick a bigger fight.
BUTTIGIEG: That's why we have got to change what Washington can deliver.

Having won Best New Artist, her recording career would encompass country and inspirational, winning Grammys for With My Song and Keep The Flame Burning (with Phil Driscoll). After bowing out of recording to raise her family, Boone returned with 2005's Reflections if Rosemary, a tribute album dedicated to her mother-in-law, singer Rosemary Clooney, who'd died in 2002. In 2011 Boone recorded an album of standards, Swing This!

SANDERS: How many hours do you have?
Peter Van Sant: And what did she say to you? … Sandra, what are you doing here?
They talk about 40 Democrats; 21 of those were people that I spent $100 million to help elect. All of the new Democrats that came in and put Nancy Pelosi in charge and gave the Congress the ability to control this president...
O'DONNELL: But you can only explain how you'll pay for just about half of that. Can you do the math for the rest of us?
O'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, I'll let you respond to that.
I raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. I put an extra $5 billion into our school system. I value education. It is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education. And rather than just talk about it in New York, we actually did it.
Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.
Kathy Patrick and 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant CBS News
Let me tell Mr. Putin, OK, I'm not a good friend of President Xi of China. I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader.
Peter Van Sant: What did she say?
KLOBUCHAR: Bernie, I was talking about -- I was talking about...

1967: Bobbie Gentry Capitol Records Nominees: Lana Cantrell, The 5th Dimension, Harpers Bizarre and Jefferson Airplane After skipping a year, the Grammy's Best New Artist Award went to one of the first female country artists to write and produce her own material. Bobbie Gentry became a star with her ballad, Ode to Billie Joe (which had actually been the B-side of her debut single, Mississippi Delta). It spent four weeks at Number 1 on the Billboard charts in 1967. In addition to Best New Artist, Gentry won Grammys for Best Vocal Performance (Female) and Best Contemporary Group Performance (Vocal or Instrumental) for Ode to Billie Joe. Her follow-up recordings include the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song I'll Never Fall in Love Again, Let It Be Me and All I Have to Do Is Dream (both with Glen Campbell), Fancy, and But I Can't Get Back. In the '70s Gentry retired from performing.
BUTTIGIEG: I can't allow -- I can't allow this to stand because it's just not true. Senator Sanders...
Kathy Patrick was now the prime suspect in Carolyn Abel's murder. A murder warrant for her arrest was issued in South Korea. Back in Japan, Carolyn's boyfriend, Tomoyuki Ayagaki, heard the news.
Texans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred, O'Rourke wrote Friday, tweeting a video of a demonstrator shouting during Buttigieg's event.
The same panel removed the outspoken Republican in 2003 because he refused to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. Voters later re-elected him as chief justice after he lost a race for governor.
BUTTIGIEG: ... American credibility, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency. And I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s, and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.
BRENNAN: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond?
Meanwhile, Carolyn's family carried on with their quest for justice.
Andrew Dvash-Banks was studying in Israel when he met his future husband, Elad, an Israeli citizen. Because they couldn't marry at the time in the U.S. or in Israel, they moved to Canada, where they wed in 2010. The children were born by a surrogate in September 2016.
Mayor Bloomberg, as mayor of New York, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. So if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well?
1992: Arrested Development Chrysalis Records/EMI Nominees: Billy Ray Cyrus, Sophie B. Hawkins, Kris Kross and Jon Secada Before Arrested Development became the name of a cult TV show, it was actually the name of an alternative hip-hop group formed in Atlanta in 1988. Arrested Development won two Grammy Awards in 1993 for Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Rolling Stone also named Arrested Development Band of the Year in 1993, thanks to the group's debut album, 3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Of..., which spawned the catchy singles Tennessee, People Everyday and Mr. Wendel. The band is still together and has consistently released albums over the years, but none as successful as that first one.
We're used to hearing narratives of trauma, tragedy, disenfranchisement, pain, suffering, Marshall told correspondent Alex Wagner. Few of the stories that normalize the everyday life of people who are not always experiencing trauma 24/7. And I think those things need to be represented as well as anything else that we read about in the newspaper or we see on the news.
SANDERS: Well, you're right. The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires.
KLOBUCHAR: I would have better relations with our allies and I would support, because I know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in Columbia, South Carolina, or Houston, Texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world.
BUTTIGIEG: Yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries (ph).
O'DONNELL: Senator, we're going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs. Margaret Brennan?
BUTTIGIEG: I think we were talking about math, and it doesn't take two hours to do the math.
But let me say how we win this. We have got to win in the middle of the country. And while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, I'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in Republican congressional districts over and over again, including Michele Bachmann's district.
Right now, my view is we need to expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and do what the American people want, not what the NRA wants.
Evangelicals remember how feminists and liberals who claimed to care deeply about the treatment of women in the workplace rallied around Bill Clinton, despite his behavior with a White House intern. Bring up Stormy Daniels to politically active social conservatives and they're likely to bring up Nina Burleigh, the former Time reporter who said during the Clinton scandal that she would be willing to engage in the same activity as Monica Lewinsky to thank him for keeping abortion legal.
BLOOMBERG: I'm not sure they're appropriate every place. I can only tell you, in New York, they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them. We had -- the charter schools are mixed in with the non-charter public schools, because our charter schools are public schools, as well. They've helped each other.
SANDERS: All right. But the point is -- the point is the way we are going to beat Trump, which is what everybody up here wants, is we need a campaign of energy and excitement. We need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. We need to bring working people back in to the Democratic Party. We need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before. That is what our campaign is about.
Imagine a loved one brutally murdered in a foreign country -- allegedly by another American.
These are Kathy Patrick's first public words on the murder of Carolyn Abel in 30 years.
Sandra Ames: If it went to trial, I would be willing to testify. I would need to testify.
Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States.
In 2011, just 30 percent of evangelical voters believed that an elected official who committed an immoral act in their personal life had the ethical character to hold public office. By October 2016—on the eve of their massive turnout on behalf of p***y-grabbing Donald Trump, that number was up to 72 percent, according to a survey conducted by PRRI and the Brookings Institution.
John Boatwright: I took a statement from her … And then, I ask her, Did you kill Carolyn? And … She just, sort of, sat there and stared at me.
We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. Progressives have got one shot. And we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done.
In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard.
Wanda Abel: She was the youngest and the cutest and … the baby of the family.
Peter Van Sant: So she is lying to us when she told us that?
Wanda Abel: She should be in prison. Plain and simple.
SPORTS: The Race to Alaska | Watch Video
At multiple campaign stops in Iowa, Buttigieg has acknowledged Iowa has a thumb on the scale in selecting the party's nominee — its winner has been the Democratic nominee 7 out of 10 times — but he also talks about how Iowa has been a leader in political and social issues that are personal to him.
O'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency...
Regardless of whether Texas legislates on this topic, it is possible that allowing men in women's restrooms could lead to criminal and otherwise unwanted activity, he said in a May 3 letter to Target CEO Brian Cornell. As chief lawyer and law enforcement officer for the State of Texas, I ask that you provide the full text of Target's safety policies regarding the protection of women and children from those who would use the cover of Target's restroom policy for nefarious purposes.
You said, Senator Warren, you said you wanted to bring home all troops from the Middle East and then you walked that back to say you want to bring home combat troops.
Peter Van Sant: Isn't it time to come clean about this? Investigators are certain that you committed this murder
BLOOMBERG: We are doing that, Senator.
On June 4, 1937, Sylvan Goldman rolled out a wheeled device for customers at an Oklahoma City supermarket. Jane Pauley reports.
The suit was one of two filed last year by an LGBTQ immigrant rights group that said the State Department is discriminating against same-sex binational couples by denying their children citizenship at birth. The cases filed in Los Angeles and Washington by Immigration Equality said the children of a U.S. citizen who marries abroad are entitled to U.S. citizenship at birth no matter where they are born, even if the other parent is a foreigner. Only the Los Angeles case was decided Thursday.
When 48 Hours recently contacted Sandra Ames, she told us she wasn't surprised that Kathy Patrick tried to blame her and denied having participated in Carolyn's murder.
So, this debate, when you think about it tonight, may be the last, best chance for the candidates to make their case to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters.
Even though lie detector tests are inadmissible in federal court, they are a tool used by investigators to confirm deception. Kathy Patrick willingly agreed to take one and answer questions about Carolyn's murder.
John Boatwright: He did not know Carolyn Abel. … And it appeared that she was just trying to get revenge on him for the bad breakup.
One of his missions, he has said, is to improve the symbolism of the office. Because the presidency is also a moral office, Buttigieg tells Dickerson, co-host of CBS This Morning. It calls this nation to its highest values. And it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. Narrative is a very powerful thing, and we need to make sure that everybody in America understands where they fit in this country's story.
BIDEN: How about Cuba or Nicaragua?
And that is that a progressive agenda is popular, Mayor Bloomberg.
John Boatwright: Each time that she was interviewed later, she kept changing the facts to -- to limit her involvement in the murder. But she never denied that Kathy did the murder. And she never denied that she was present just after the murder.
A campaign aide told CBS News that the former South Bend mayor will continue to emphasize his belief in the importance of building a broad coalition. He often mentions his campaign is reaching out to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, moderates and future former Republicans.
BLOOMBERG: Before I left, life expectancy in New York City had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that, when I left, it was three years greater than the national average.
WARREN: And start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans.
SANDERS: I didn't say that, Pete.
Korean police and press swarmed Carolyn's apartment, which had been ransacked. U.S. Army CID
BIDEN: You know, when we talk about progressive, let's talk about being progressive.
KING: There was breaking news from the CDC about the Coronavirus. And so far there have been 2,700 deaths globally, and so far in this country there have been no deaths. But the CDC says this. It's not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when.
SANDERS: If we do nothing is what...
Wanda Abel: And the damage that's been done … was just so devastating.
Nancy Bercaw: The impact of seeing her body wheeled out in a body bag really made it quite real … it wasn't a dream. It became the nightmare that it really still is to this day.
I guess in some ways his inexperience like makes me a little doubtful, and that's probably the only thing —and maybe his performance with voters of color, Schaefer said.
Phil Coyne may be a bigger celebrity than anybody on the field at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. The 99-year-usher has been working Pirates games since he was a kid, and is not about to stop any time soon, as Steve Hartman reports.
Carolyn and Ayagaki began a relationship that very quickly became serious.
Wanda Abel: I was worried that Kathy would try to kill us, because Kathy wrote these letters to my parents that she was her great friend and that … she'd love to meet them. … and I was working through my mind, What would I do if I saw this person or if she showed up at my house?
SANDERS: That is why I am beating Trump in virtually every poll that is done, and why I will defeat him.
Peter Van Sant: And what did she say about that?
I think sharing his experiences, framing it in the values that we all share, demonstrating a strategic approach to our issues — I think that will set him apart from the other candidates, Brown added.
KING: Mr. Biden, will you continue if you do not win South Carolina? You have said that South Carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race. If you don't win South Carolina, will you continue in this race?
WHITAKER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.
But in Carolyn Abel's case, any trial seems highly unlikely. In South Korea, the statute of limitations for her murder has expired. And the Abel family says investigators told them the physical evidence in the case has been destroyed -- evidence that would've been crucial for a trial in the United States.
SANDERS: Do you think immigration reform? The truth is, Pete...
The reveal came after host James Corden mentioned fellow guest Charlie Hunnam is hitting a milestone — his 40th birthday. Ferguson, who is 44, chimed in to say turning 40 is when you finally become an adult... like 'I need to start getting serious about things.'
We have a clear choice of who's going to lead this party. And I am the only one in the New Hampshire debate, when asked, if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket, that raised my hand.
If you keep on going, we will elect Bernie. Bernie will lose to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate and some of the statehouses will all go red.
NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Tonight, the battle for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, where everything is on the line.
BIDEN: Two ways. Number one, my entire life I've been involved with the black community. I was a public defender.
BUTTIGIEG: If you get nominated, we'll be re-litigating this all year.
Target is doing the right thing to what it has been as a brand, Arnoff said. I'm sure they are looking at the data and sales. As a smart company they will pay more attention to that kind of data than the number of names on a petition.
I promise, Mr. Vice President, we are going to get to you today. I promise.
WEB EXTRA: Norman Lear on casting Archie Bunker (Video)
When Ames returned to the United States, she was recruited by the FBI to go undercover and secretly record a reunion with Kathy Patrick in hopes of eliciting a confession.
Peter Van Sant: Even today after all these years, 30 years, this still gets to you, doesn't it?
But to get at what we were just talking about, I just think we have a huge choice. Super Tuesday states, one-third of America will vote. Do you want to have someone...
BIDEN: Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately.
KLOBUCHAR: Instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers.
While there a lot of people who are very vocal saying they won't shop at Target, some may shop more at Target, he said. A year from now, Target may be remembered for being one of the first to step up to the plate, which history might prove was the right stance to take.
BLOOMBERG: I got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago, we have been working on our tax returns, I've said they will be out. We probably have another couple of weeks left to go. We're doing it as fast we can. We've complied with every single requirement for disclosure. And when I was mayor of New York, we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the White House.
1979: Rickie Lee Jones Warner Brothers Nominees: The Blues Brothers, Dire Straits, The Knack and Robin Williams Chuck E's In Love was just one of the songs on Rickie Lee Jones' debut album, a captivating blend of folk, R&B and jazz. The 21-year-old singer-songwriter, hailing from a long line of performers, was joined on her album by Dr. John, Michael McDonald and Randy Newman. An appearance on Saturday Night Live and an article in Time Magazine that labeled her The Duchess of Coolsville burnished her reputation. Nominated for five Grammys (including Record of the Year and Song of the Year), Jones won Best New Artist. Jones would record 20 more studio and live albums, her most recent being the 2012 folk rock album, The Devil You Know. In 1989 Jones shared a second Grammy with Dr. John for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, for Makin' Whoopee. She has a new album due out in Spring 2015.
BIDEN: I would make them pay for it, and I would make them pay for it economically. They are engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our elections. They were engaged, and when we -- when, in fact, we were -- the last election in 2016 against Hillary, they were. There's no question.
The CBS News Democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break.
Wanda Abel: Yes. … Kathy knew she did it, so she had to suspect that sooner or later somebody was going to put it together or that Sandra was going to crack and tell on her. … So she spends as little time in South Korea as possible after she killed Carolyn.
Sandra Ames: Kathy … She went -- did a B-line right to the bedroom. … Kathy came out of the room and said, Carolyn's dead. We need to call an ambulance. No, we need to call the cops. And she didn't want me to go look at the body.
SANDERS: Well, you know, Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements.
WARREN: And while Mayor Bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on African-Americans and on Latinos, in fact, I was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages. We have a -- I have a housing plan, and what it has in it specifically...
Peter Van Sant: Is it true you got out of prison because someone bribed a judge to get you out?
KLOBUCHAR: Well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, I want to do that, too. And I also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. I think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs.
Presidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party, Graham wrote. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever.
KING: But Senator Sanders is in striking distance of you. You are within the margin of error in this state.
Do you think Senator Sanders' economy would be better for America than President Trump's?
BUTTIGIEG: Fifty people, all right. In Charleston alone, just in Charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. That means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from Charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. Grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign.
O'DONNELL: Thank you. Thank you. We have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but I want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace. At the last debate, you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes. Did these women take your jokes wrong? Or were you wrong to make the jokes?
Iowa has a way of surprising America and leading it forward — 2008, Iowa made it possible for a candidate whose very name made his campaign extremely improbable to arrive on the scene as a front running presidential candidate and eventually president of the United States, Buttigieg said at a town hall in Mason City, of Barack Obama.
BLOOMBERG: And the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- I'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. We just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. We did what she asked. And, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. And by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across America.
WARREN: I was mentioned in this.
1997: Paula Cole Imago/Warner Brothers Nominees: Fiona Apple, Erykah Badu, Puff Daddy and Hanson The singer, songwriter and instrumentalist has toured with Peter Gabriel, Mandy Moore, and with Sarah MacLachlan's Lilith Fair. She had a Top 10 hit with her 1997 single Where Have All the Cowboys Gone? (from her second album, This Fire). The same year she won Best New Artist, Cole received six additional Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Producer of the Year (Non-Classical).
Pete Buttigieg likes to start off his stump speech by asking the crowd to envision the day when the sun comes up and Donald Trump is no longer president. The first potentially concrete development on this front takes place in two weeks, when Iowans go to caucus in the first Democratic voting contest on February 3.
Wanda Abel: I honestly can't picture her old 'cause she was just always so -- so vibrant and so energetic. And I -- I -- I think she still would be. … you know, I miss her. She was like my best friend.
Buttigieg has not yet responded to Graham's remarks.
KING: All right, thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
The events of that day have haunted Carolyn Abel's family for more than 30 years.
Ames described that picture in her head as a fragmented memory of that night. As Boatwright asked her for more details, she told a new story. It was nothing short of a bombshell.
SANDERS: Let me just -- the answer is, it's something that we would take into consideration.
SANDERS: ... the American people support my agenda.
O'DONNELL: We want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the Democratic Party.
1964: The Beatles Capitol Records The world knows what became of John, Paul, George and Ringo - probably the easiest choice for Best New Artist the Grammy membership ever had to make. So what happened to their fellow nominees? Petula Clark, whose hits included Downtown and Don't Sleep in the Subway, also starred in the musical films Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Finian's Rainbow, and on Broadway in Blood Brothers, with David and Shaun Cassidy. Brazilian Astrud Gilberto, best known for The Girl from Ipanema, has recorded 16 albums, and performed with such artists as João Gilberto, Stan Getz and George Michael. Bossa nova musician and composer Antonio Carlos Jobim won the 1995 Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Performance for Antonio Brasileiro. Jobim died in 1994. Singer Morgana King's four-octave range graced cabarets and concert hall for more than three decades. She released 30 albums, but probably received the most exposure from her debut film role, as Carmela Corleone, wife of Don Corleone, in The Godfather. King sang Luna Mezz'o Mare during the wedding reception scene.
Steven Schroeder: The examiner concluded that she was deceptive.
I was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better. The budget is under control. We've done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities.
Corden put things in perspective for Ferguson: On your last day of 'Modern Family,' knowing what we know now, you should think I'm leaving 'Modern Family' behind, but come July, you're going to make your new modern family — and it's going to be beautiful.
Sandra Ames: To the best of my recollection, we sat in the living room at Carolyn's apartment, and … she convinced me, manipulated me, to help her make it look like a robbery.
BUTTIGIEG: ... even goes beyond even what they do...
There might be some people who are passing by a Starbucks and might keep going, whereas before they might have stopped in, said Ted Marzilli, chief executive officer of data products at YouGov.
On the weekend of Dec. 17, 1988, just three days before the murder, Ames, Patrick, Carolyn and some Korean students took a trip into the mountains. Carolyn took pictures.
KING: We'll get to you, Mr. Sanders.
I talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. It's why I also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families.
O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, the cost of your agenda. Yesterday, you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals, but not all of your details are clear. You've proposed more than $50 trillion in new spending.
But let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in New York City. And I listened to them. They're in Congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. But if you change something like the president, they would. No, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.
WHITAKER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
We also put $2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country, to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas.
KLOBUCHAR: Well, what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those Americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. We don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help.
BUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about math, indeed. OK, so here's the math...
BUTTIGIEG: If you're going to ask that rhetorical question, let's...
BIDEN: No, I would not. And I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office. This is a guy who is -- doesn't have a democratic, with a small D, bone in his body.
On Modern Family, the actor plays Michell Pritchett, an uptight lawyer who married his longtime partner, Cameron, and adopted a baby girl named Lily. The sitcom chronicles their journey to fatherhood and raising their daughter.
Bennett said he was disappointed that the bill is headed toward a floor vote without protecting more people from discrimination but still called it a significant step.
GARRETT: As we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, Twitter, this debate is no different. So I want to put a question from Twitter to you, Senator Klobuchar. This is from Casey Pennington. How will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?
KING: Senator Klobuchar -- good idea, right, Mr. Vice President?
People of faith were looking for a politician who would champion their religious faith, not change it.And while an exceptionally profane, likely unfaithful, thrice-married braggart who once publicly supported abortion (as Mark Hemingway calls him in the conservative Weekly Standard magazine this week) doesn't seem like the obvious candidate, Trump got the job.
Wanda Abel [reading]: Please know that I loved Carolyn as a sister and a dear friend. … My roommate and are I the two people who found Carolyn in her apartment. Let me know if I can tell you anything.
And we're in South Carolina. How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change? We are in this state...

Peter Van Sant: -- your romantic advances.
The fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. Look at what's happening here. We have to win the Senate back.
While contemplating a future life with Ayagaki, Carolyn received an offer for another job 330 miles away and across the Sea of Japan.
Steven Schroeder: That's -- that's correct, yes.
Peter Van Sant: You flunked a polygraph test … how did that happen?
But Sandra Ames' story quickly changed. In official statements, Ames wrote that Kathy Patrick had admitted to cutting Carolyn's throat. And today Ames claims that the only reason she made that admission was due to false memories implanted by investigators. But she doesn't deny going to the crime scene or handling the murder weapon.
And we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting. While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. Georgia kicked 100,000 off. As president, I will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone.
WARREN: Sorry, Mayor, you did not do what I asked.
And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators.
1993: Toni Braxton LaFace Nominees: Belly, Blind Melon, Digable Planets and SWV Toni Braxton and her sisters (Tamar, Towanda, Traci and Trina) were signed to Arista in the late 1980s as The Braxtons. That led to Toni recording two songs for the soundtrack of the Eddie Murphy comedy Boomerang, including a duet with Kenneth Babyface Edmonds, Give U My Heart. Toni Braxton, the R&B singer-songwriter's first album (which included the hits Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again), hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart, and sold 10 million copies worldwide. Seven more albums followed, including Secrets (15 million copies sold). Her Number 1 hit singles include You're Making Me High, Let It Flow and Un-Break My Heart. In addition to her two 1993 Grammys, Braxton would win four more awards in the category of Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (Breathe Again, You're Makin' Me High,  Un-Break My Heart and He Wasn't Man Enough), and one for Best R&B Album, for Love, Marriage & Divorce (with Babyface). Financial difficulties led to her declaring bankruptcy in 1996, but she rebounded. Outside of recording, Braxton appeared on Broadway in Beauty and the Beast, competed in season seven of Dancing With the Stars, and starred in the reality TV series, Braxton Family Values. Her memoir, Unbreak My Heart, was published in 2014. Braxton earned three more Grammy nominations in 2018, for Long As I Live and the album, Sex & Cigarettes.
Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and wanted a waiting period...
1975: Natalie Cole Capitol Records Nominees: Morris Albert, Amazing Rhythm Aces, Brecker Brothers, and KC and the Sunshine Band The daughter of singer Nat King Cole and Maria Hawkins Ellington (who had sung with the Duke Ellington Orchestra), Natalie's Cole's debut album, Inseparable, introduced her Top 10 hit, This Will Be, for which she won a Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, as well as Best New Artist. Cole was later nominated for another 19 Grammy Awards, and won seven, for her recordings of Sophisticated Lady, Unforgettable... with Love (in which she dueted with her late father), Take a Look, When I Fall in Love (also with Nat King Cole), and Still Unforgettable.
BLOOMBERG: We don't have anybody to respond. I'm sorry.
WARREN: ... and just be race-blind. It is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against African-Americans having an opportunity to buy homes.
Is the transaction worth it? In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus asks For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
KING: We passed the halfway mark.
Sandra Ames: Probably [laughs]. … And I think I said something along the lines of, How could you have done that? How could you have killed Carolyn? … And she said, I don't know what you're talking about.
But, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.
The family has since moved to Los Angeles to be closer to Andrew Dvash-Banks' family.
Kathy Patrick: I don't know the science of polygraphs, I'm not surprised that I would, um, flunk it in retrospect given how clammy and nervous I am right now and I am even shaking. It was a frightening experience and I absolutely do not know what happened before I went to her apartment and found her body. Please sit.
The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.
2005: John Legend TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: Ciara, Fall Out Boy, Keane and Sugarland The singer-songwriter's debut studio album, Get Lifted, earned Legend Grammys for Best R&B Album and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance (for Ordinary People), as well as Best New Artist, out of eight total Grammy nominations that year. He's since earned 28 nominations and 10 Grammys. His subsequent albums include Once Again, Evolver, Wake Up! (with The Roots), and Love in the Future. Legend also shared a Golden Globe Award (and an Academy Award) for Best Original Song, for Glory, from Selma.
John Boatwright: There was no extradition treaty with Korea at the time.
BRENNAN: Was that a yes or no?
SANDERS: Joe, I think, has gotten a little bit more. What the American people want, by the way, and a lot of the issues we'll be discussing tonight are issues I raised four years ago: raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. Making public colleges and universities tuition-free. And finally, doing what every other major country on Earth does, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right through a Medicare for All, single-payer system.
STEYER: That is a risk that will hurt the American people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk.
She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.
The backlash from the incident -- which has sparked protests and apologies from its CEO -- caused the company's consumer perception to drop to its lowest since November 2015, when the chain got criticized for replacing a symbol-filled holiday cup with a simple red design. About 25 percent of consumers surveyed said they would consider making a purchase at Starbucks on Tuesday, compared with 28 percent on Friday.
This is something that should have been done a long time ago, he said.

For her part in the alleged crimes, Sandra Ames was sentenced to one year in prison. Meanwhile, Kathy Patrick was back at home in Washington state. The South Korean government made diplomatic requests to return her to Seoul from the U.S. to face a murder charge, but hit a wall.
2016: Chance the Rapper Amy Harris/AP Photo Nominees: Kelsea Ballerini, The Chainsmokers, Maren Morris, Anderson Paak. Chance the Rapper has been nominated for seven Grammys. He's won two other awards, for Best Rap Album (Coloring Book), and Best Rap Performance (for No Problem, with Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz).
STEYER: OK. But I get to answer.
Protests have become somewhat of a common occurrence at Buttigieg's campaign stops. During a two-day swing through Iowa last month, Buttigieg was interrupted by protesters at two events with Iowa Democrats, with demonstrators questioning the openly-gay mayor's Episcopalian faith.
He is not a member of any of the major Democratic caucuses in the House, like the pro-business New Democrat Coalition or the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He once earned an A rating from the National Rife Association (NRA) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by Republicans. But Ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like Medicare for all. Controversy Ryan's tenure in Congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to Pelosi's leadership are likely to alienate some Democratic primary voters. What Trump says Although Ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about the Ohio congressman.
The advantage of a Medicare for All health care program, because it's not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies, we will have health care for all people in all parts of this country.
Then, Graham added, Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.
Final thing is comprehensive immigration reform. I have passed...
BIDEN: I wrote the drug court bill.
BLOOMBERG: Let's just go on the record.

BUTTIGIEG: It's why in my Frederick Douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues, part of the core of it is a 21st Century Voting Rights Act.
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas, even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so.
WARREN: Together, we have built a movement.

Jay Inslee Jay Inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 Biography Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values.
See, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. And that harms everyone.
BUTTIGIEG: I want to respond to the question that Senator Sanders...

After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.

Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office.
1994: Sheryl Crow DAN GROSHONG/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: Ace of Base, Blind Melon, Digable Planets and SWV Sheryl Crow sang backing vocals for some high-profile singers (Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Don Henley) before launching a solo career and releasing her debut album Tuesday Night Music Club in 1993, with the hits All I Wanna Do and Strong Enough. The single Leaving Las Vegas also found some chart success. It was all enough to earn Crow the Best New Artist win shortly after coming on the scene. That wouldn't be her last Grammy win. At the same Grammy ceremony she also nabbed Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year for All I Wanna Do. In total, she's received nine Grammys. Crow went on to release eight more albums and nab a big radio hit with Kid Rock on Picture. She's currently working on a new release for 2015.

BRENNAN: Bill Whitaker has the floor.
Like his South Korean counterparts, Boatwright decided to question Carolyn's colleagues, who told him:
Wanda Abel: Carolyn … was trying to decide whether she would be happy being married and staying in Japan.
Sandra Ames: I remember … being hooked up to all the wires in a darkened room.
KLOBUCHAR: Bernie, let me -- let me respond to this.
WARREN: ... to choose hope over fear.
SANDERS: They have credited me with gun sense, as you know.
The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission last year called equal access to restrooms a significant, basic condition of employment and said that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory.
BUTTIGIEG: I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House.
O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you have been name checked. You are allowed to respond.
Wanda Abel: I think she probably is. … And who knows what would trigger some kind -- that kind of violence again?
Peter Van Sant: There were two coffee cups found in the room. … If there's a break-in, generally, a criminal would not say, Hey, let's -- let's have a cup of coffee before I ransack your place and attack you.
Peter Van Sant: You stayed with Kathy at her apartment.
Ames maintains she had nothing to hide. So, two months after the murder, she waived her right to an attorney and agreed to take a lie detector test.

On the ground, national caucus director Travis Brock is planning to stay in Iowa until Caucus Day. While he usually splits his time between Nevada, which also holds a caucus, and Iowa, Brock recently embarked on a 19-stop tour around the state training volunteers and precinct captains across Iowa.
The time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected.
Buttigieg is keenly aware that he'll need a strong finish in Iowa in order to build momentum heading into the other nominating contests.
Nancy Bercaw: Not only were we devastated about the loss of Carolyn … We of course wondered, Who's next?

BLOOMBERG: I know -- wait a second. I know that if I were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve. And I know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. That's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it.
The difference is, I don't like his solutions. I don't believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families.

Kamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 run 05:19 Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat.
STEYER: Something happened. We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400-plus years in America of African-Americans, of systematic legal injustice, discrimination, and cruelty, but also of 400-plus years of contribution in terms of building the United States of America and leading the United States of America from a moral standpoint.
John Boatwright: I was convinced that … whoever did this probably knew Carolyn.

GARRETT: Candidates, good evening. Candidates, good evening.
Peter Van Sant If it is true that Kathy Patrick murdered your sister, is she a danger today to the public?
SANDERS: OK. What the Health and Human Services have said in analyzing health care costs, what Yale -- recent Yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. We would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. What every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, Medicare for all will save money. Ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion.
WARREN: He called me out by name.

This man stood before the whole world, turned to the Russian leader and said, why in God's name would this man ever interfere in our elections? Give me a break. Seventeen intelligence agencies said he did. When we got the information, we went to the committee in the Senate that's responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them.
KING: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.
BLOOMBERG: And, together, we are going to get it done.
SANDERS: Yes, I'm very proud working with Congressman Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, that we increased funding for the Community Health Center Program by $11 billion as part of the Affordable Care Act, which now provides for 9 million Americans access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs, in that bill.
That's where Carolyn quickly fell in with Nancy Bercaw and the other American teachers at school. Like Sandra Ames, who requested that we alter her current appearance for this interview.
A waiting period of 12 hours. I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared.
But we -- make no mistake about it, we have to deal with China, if we're ever going to solve the climate crisis. We have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked. We would be -- not be able to sell or buy the products that we need.

Carolyn Abel put up a fight in her last minutes of life. She had a number of defensive wounds. And she took the brunt of it. More than 30 stab wounds including a cut -- from ear to ear on the-- on the throat. And there was blood everywhere in here. On the walls, on the bed. It was a mess.
BIDEN: Well, it depends which -- look, I've earned the vote, I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African-American community, not just here but across the country. I've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million, in our administration, just into this county. We've created jobs for people.
SANDERS: ... grassroots movement of black and white and Latino, Native American and Asian, people who are standing up and fighting for justice.
BLOOMBERG: No, I would not. And I think the Chinese government has not been open. Their press -- the freedom of press does not exist there. They -- their human rights record is abominable, and we should make a fuss, which we have been doing, I suppose.
BRENNAN: You have to allow the senator to respond. Senator Sanders.
WARREN: Then let us -- let us have -- the women have an opportunity to speak. The Bloomberg corporations and Mayor Bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination. They are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak. If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out...

John Hickenlooper John Hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 Biography Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper grew up outside of Philadelphia, the youngest of four children. He attended Wesleyan University and received a bachelor's in English and a master's degree in Geology. Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for Mayor of Denver, in his first ever campaign. Considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. In 2010, Hickenlooper became the first Denver Mayor elected Governor in 120 years. He was re-elected in 2014, running on another entirely positive campaign Hickenlooper is the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid this cycle, following Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Issues Finishing his second term in the statehouse, Hickenlooper was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. It's that record that he touted in h is campaign video.
Kathy Patrick: Um, can we stop right now?
SANDERS: Excuse me, occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran. And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. But you don't have to trade love letters with them.
BUTTIGIEG: We have an opportunity to set a different tone.
He plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. We have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this.
Carolyn also hit it off with the head teacher at the school, Kathy Patrick.
O'DONNELL: ... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. As a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?
STEYER: The way to win at the grassroots is, tell the truth and organize.
BIDEN: The only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. I couldn't get that covered. You, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the Violence Against Women Act across the board.
O'DONNELL: And CBS News is proud too bring you this debate, along with our co-sponsors.
And the second thing I'd point out to you is that what I would do immediately is restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He tried to cut the funding for NIH. He cut the funding for the entire effort.

2011: Bon Iver FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: The Band Perry, J. Cole, Nicki Minaj and Skrillex Folk band Bon Iver, led by singer-songwriter Justin Vernon (left), had released two albums prior to its 2011 Best New Artist win. For Emma, Forever Ago, the band's debut, surfaced in 2007 -- four years before Bon Iver's sophomore effort, Bon Iver, Bon Iver. At the 2012 Grammy ceremony Bon Iver not only scooped up Best New Artist, but Bon Iver, Bon Iver also won Best Alternative Music Album. The track Holecene received nominations for both Song and Record of the Year. By the end of 2012, though, during a Bon Iver concert in Dublin, Ireland, Vernon announced it would be their last performance as a band ... at least for a while. It wasn't until 2016 that the band released a new album, 22, A Million, which would receive a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. Their next album, i,i, would be nominated for three Grammys, including Album of the Year.
STEYER: ... completely. And that is an absolute unfair statement.
KING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?
1987: Jody Watley MCA Records Nominees: Breakfast Club, Cutting Crew, Terence Trent D'Arby and Swing Out Sister A dance music pioneer, Jody Watley began her professional career as a teenager on the TV show Soul Train, and became a member of the group Shalamar. Among their albums was Uptown Festival, Big Fun, Three For Love, Friends, and The Look. Watley then signed a solo contract with MCA, which released Jody Watley in 1987. Among its hits were Looking for a New Love, Still a Thrill and Don't You Want Me. Her 2006 album, The Makeover, paid tribute to the styles of Karen Carpenter, Chic and Diana Ross. Watley received the Billboard Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.
It was what I could do, she said. And I'm certainly not intending to enlarge any discriminatory actions or rights (of) employers.
Texans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred. Mayor Pete, we are grateful you came to Texas and hope to see you and Chasten back again soon. https://t.co/IhRDtIBREb — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) May 4, 2019
Nancy Bercaw: Kathy was asking all of us -- had any of us heard from Carolyn. … No.
O'DONNELL: I want to allow Senator Sanders to respond because you've gone after the insurance industry. You've taken on pharmaceutical companies. And you've taken on big tech. Why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass?
John Boatwright: No. Kathy Patrick had already gotten on a plane and left Korea.
STEYER: That's what it's going to take in 2020.
BUTTIGIEG: All right, let's clear this up once and for all.
So it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. And one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. So there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.
KING: We would like -- Senator Sanders, we would like to bring Mr. Steyer in on this conversation.
It's interesting and ironic this is happening at Starbucks, because it's been at the forefront of progressive causes, Marzilli noted. It was very same-sex-marriage friendly, and its customers tend to say they believe society is much better when people of different races live in the same neighborhood or community.
Peter Van Sant: After? How unusual is that based on your experience?
Compounding Carolyn's family's grief, Sandra Ames was released from a South Korean prison after serving just six months of her one-year sentence -- and it wasn't because of good behavior.
... but a minute-fifteen is really a long time.
SANDERS: Let us be clear, do we think health care for all, Pete, is some kind of radical communist idea?
BUTTIGIEG: But in order for any of that to happen it has to pass. And we're talking about a plan that...
Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians.
KLOBUCHAR: ... if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we're going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.
This family was shocked and appalled and angry when they were told their family wasn't legal, said Aaron Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality. They wanted their twin boys to be treated exactly the same.
The Boy Scouts' move to allow girls, announced last October, marked the organization's latest momentous policy shift.
Mayor Pete, we are grateful you came to Texas and hope to see you and Chasten back again soon, O'Rourke added.
Mayor Bloomberg, you've said that President Xi Jinping of China is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents, and that the U.S. must cooperate with Beijing.
Just weeks after Carolyn Abel's murder, the investigation by John Boatwright was focusing on the two friends who had discovered her body: roommates Kathy Patrick and Sandra Ames.
1980: Christopher Cross Warner Brothers Nominees: Irene Cara, Robbie Dupree, Amy Holland and The Pretenders The singer-songwriter from San Antonio, Texas, whose eponymous 1979 album featured such classics as Ride Like the Wind and Sailing, is the only artist ever to sweep the Big Four Grammy categories (Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist) in a single year. His follow-ups included the chart-topping theme song from the Dudley Moore comedy, Arthur, and the 1983 album, Another Page.
BLOOMBERG: There's no question about that.
I'm going to do the same thing at the National Institute of Health. We're going to focus at least $50 billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer. And we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment.
Three weeks after the murder, an autopsy revealed the cause of death: a stab wound to her right lung. The report also confirmed her throat was cut.
WARREN: Look, a president's job, first job, is to keep America safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line.
And it appears he doesn't need to. After a short-lived 14-point dip in net approval among social conservatives after the Stormy Daniels story broke, President Trump's support among these voters is back around 80 percent, according to Morning Consult. Evangelicals are so willing to support President Trump, they've abandoned their principles on character and morality in order to make room for him.
1983: Culture Club Virgin Records Nominees: Big Country, Eurythmics, Men Without Hats and Musical Youth This English act made a big impact in the early '80s with the international hit Do You Really Want to Hurt Me. Led by singer Boy George, Culture Club (also featuring Michael Craig, Roy Hay and Jon Moss) released its debut album, Kissing to Be Clever, in 1982, and didn't waste much time with the next effort: 1983's Colour By Numbers, which featured the single Karma Chameleon. It was all enough to snag Culture Club the Best New Artist win in 1983. The band went on to release three more albums throughout the '80s and '90s. During that time, though, George's drug addiction and relationship with Culture Club drummer Moss took a toll on the band. Throughout the years Culture Club has broken up, staged reunions and found themselves on hiatus once again. A 2014 reunion tour -- with the original lineup -- was scrapped after George came down with a serious throat condition.
The onus is on Starbucks to follow through with things its CEO talked about, Marzilli said. The store closing is a manifestation of that, but the downside is the end of May is a long way away. That's a lot of time for people to fill out that space with another narrative before Starbucks can implement that day of training.
Mikita is also an activist. He and Ferguson started the nonprofit organization Tie the Knot, which raises money and awareness for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights while also providing stylish bowties and other accessories for couples to wear during their nuptials.
KING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?
1990: Mariah Carey Columbia Records Nominees: The Black Crowes, The Kentucky Headhunters, Wilson Phillips and Lisa Stansfield Mariah Carey's killer voice (with a five-octave vocal range) burst onto the music scene in 1990 with her self-titled debut album. The Long Island native would soon become a major force on radio, scoring four No. 1 hits off her first effort, including Vision of Love and I Don't Wanna Cry. Carey ended up winning Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for Vision of Love, along with the Best New Artist honor. She would win three more Grammys, out of 29 nominations. She's also dabbled in acting (in the ill-fated Glitter in 2001), and sat at the judges' table on Fox's American Idol. In May 2015, she set up shop in Las Vegas for a residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.
What we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does: guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer.
SANDERS: But that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good. That's what Barack Obama said.
Target's policy is consistent with the message and core values that it's been projecting for years, Melissa Arnoff, senior vice president at Levick, a communications firm specializing in crisis and issues management, said, noting the company's past support of same-sex marriage and parenting, and its decision last year to stop labeling toy aisles by gender.
Walter agreed, writing that the State Department statute does not contain language requiring a 'blood relationship between the person and the father' in order for citizenship to be acquired at birth.
The Emmy Award-winning CBS Sunday Morning hosted by Jane Pauley is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET. Executive producer is Rand Morrison.
BLOOMBERG: No -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. But if you talk to the people in New York City, I have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me. A lot of them are in the audience tonight. And I've earned the respect of people in New York City.
Graham, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse, faced a storm of criticism for the comment. Several expressed outrage over the judgment he pronounced on Buttigieg, in light of his support of Mr. Trump. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough exclaimed, Oh shut up. You are a disgrace, adding, You are a disgrace for normalizing Donald Trump's behavior.
WARREN: Understand this, many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster. Until we're ready to do that, we can't have real change.
BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, next question, new topic, new topic. Senator Klobuchar...
Peter Van Sant: Hi. Peter Van Sant, with CBS News. … There are investigators from two countries that … are certain that you murdered Carolyn Abel, what do you have to say?
1988: Tracy Chapman Elektra Records Nominees: Rick Astley, Toni Childs, Take 6 and Vanessa L. Williams The singer-songwriter best known for the songs Talkin' 'bout a Revolution and Fast Car won three Grammys for her 1988 eponymous acoustic album, including Best New Artist. Tracy Chapman sold six million copies on the U.S., and hit Number One on the Billboard charts. Chapman has released seven more albums, most recently 2008's Our Bright Future (a Grammy nominee for Best Contemporary Folk Album).
They note that during a 2015 speech addressing the issue of abortion, for example, candidate Hillary Clinton said deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.
All the Democratic candidates who ran for president in 2020
Nancy Bercaw: We had encouraged her to go. She must have lost 15 pounds … She just looked like someone who was about to break.
Sandra Ames: The story began with being in bed, and having Kathy at the door of my room, and coming in and saying, I think I killed Carolyn. What with? I asked. And she said, A knife. Where is it? I asked. In the kitchen sink.
Peter Van Sant: As long as she stays within these borders, she's a free woman.
BIDEN: This helps a lot, doesn't?
And I'll tell you what else we're going to do. We're going to provide help to the African-American, Latino, Native American community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market.
The second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and I guess I disagree with the mayor; I don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. But we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground.
BLOOMBERG: Can anybody -- can anybody in this room imagine moderate Republicans going over and voting for him?
SANDERS: I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have got a real dictatorship there. Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba.
Senator Sanders, we haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower.
Target's (TGT) policy of letting transgender customers and employees use the bathroom of their choice is now drawing fire from Texas officials. The state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, wants the retailer to spell out how it will protect customers who he suggested could be endangered by the policy.
Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 Biography Although he has spent most of his adult life in Vermont, Bernie Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant Jewish family. He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign.
1981: Sheena Easton MGM/UA Nominees: Adam and the Ants, The Go-Go's, James Ingram and Luther Vandross The Scottish singer made a splash with her hit singles Modern Girl and 9 to 5 (released in the U.S. as Morning Train). With the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, Easton became the first singer to appear on screen performing the title song amid Maurice Binder's evocative visuals. Easton later shared the 1984 Best Mexican-American Performance Grammy for her duet with Luis Miguel, Me Gustas Tal Como Eres.
Paxton on Monday voiced support for North Carolina in its legal fight with the U.S. Department of Justice, saying in a statement that he backs the principle that persons should use restrooms and other intimate facilities that correspond with their biological sex.
By the time she graduated from college, Carolyn had already lived in Pakistan, East Asia, Germany and France.
Wanda Abel remembers her younger sister Carolyn as the center or attention from an early age.
KLOBUCHAR: That is three times the American economy -- not the federal government -- the entire American economy. The Medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. That is true.
It's possible the impact will be short-lived, especially if no other incidents occur that mirror the racial bias of the Philadelphia arrest. However, another alleged incident of racial bias emerged in Los Angeles, when a black man claimed he was denied access to a bathroom at a Los Angeles store in January, even though a white man was given the entry code. Neither were paying customers.
BIDEN: OK, but wait a second...
SANDERS: Do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea?
I think I'd argue I don't have to answer for it, Chasten replies. I mean, we passed marriage equality. I don't think I have to answer for my marriage anymore. But I do enjoy going out there with Pete and showing people that, you know, gay marriage is just like a straight marriage.
That's why the federal budget -- deficit is -- right now, the debt is $20 trillion, going up to 21.
I think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. And it's not necessarily because of marijuana. It is because of things like opioids and the like. And that's why one of the first plans I put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs.
And especially with the African-American community, there have been a lot of broken promises.. And I think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters. And that's why I ask for your support.
Today, treatments and preventive measures have changed expectations about the disease -- and, in the eyes of some, caused undue casualness about prevention. Rita Braver reports.
Number two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it.
BRENNAN: Thank you. Next topic. Gayle?
But more than that, I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery.
With the killer still out there, Carolyn's friends wondered … could they be next?
I am not the -- I'm the one choice that makes some sense. I have the experience. I have the resources. And I have the record. And all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. When people hired me to run New York City three times, in an overwhelmingly Democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again.
They, in fact, made sure that, in Georgia, they did not have health care for the people who were being held. They, in fact, went on, and he said, after he knew that, he bought it. And then he said he was proud of his accomplishment.
And, for everyone on this stage, we talk about how to build a future. That's what matters.
Steven Schroeder: And so, today, American families -- if their loved ones are murdered abroad by an American -- will have a very different experience than Carolyn Abel's family did. And I think -- I think we all owe them a debt of gratitude.
Nancy Bercaw: This is the school. ... And the world was never the same for any of us who were in that building together on December 20th.
Despite the lack of an extradition treaty, there was still that South Korean arrest warrant for murder for Kathy Patrick. They also asked the U.S. government for help.
Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct.
Patrick also wrote to Carolyn's parents. Wanda Abel still has that letter.
Moore testified that his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it, and that his January order merely provided judges with a status report on a technical aspect of the law.
BUTTIGIEG: Yes, so, when I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. Now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina. We're seeing hospital closures right and left. And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression.
Tamara Doak: Once she left … they couldn't get her back there.
North Carolina stands to pass up $4.8 billion in funds, mostly educational grants, if it refuses to reverse course, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School, who estimated 37,800 transgender people live in the state.
Pence called Varadkar's remarks at the breakfast inspiring. We're also really honored to be joined by your partner, Dr. Matthew Barrett. He does great work at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the vice president said.
BIDEN: What did you tell them?
1968: José Feliciano RCA Records Nominees: Cream, Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, Jeannie C. Riley and O. C. Smith The Puerto Rican guitarist and singer's 1968 album Feliciano!, an Album of the Year nominee that reached Number 2 on the Billboard charts, featured his seminal cover of The Doors' Light My Fire. Feliciano, who was born blind, mixes various musical styles - flamenco, Latin pop, jazz, bolero - in recordings that have earned him 19 Grammy nominations and nine awards, including the Latin Recording Academy's Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Until we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. But the cat's out of the bag. So some states have it, you're not going to take it away. Get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession.
Then, Bercaw took a phone call in the teachers' lounge that moved the investigation in a whole new direction.
1974: Marvin Hamlisch CBS News Nominees: Bad Company, Johnny Bristol, David Essex, Graham Central Station and Phoebe Snow Composer and arranger Marvin Hamlisch began his career as a rehearsal pianist for Barbra Streisand for the Broadway musical Funny Girl. In 1974 he won three Academy Awards, for The Way We Were (Best Original Song and Best Original Dramatic Score) and The Sting (Best Adaptation, for translating Scott Joplin's ragtime music). It wasn't long before he had even greater success, with the 1975 Broadway production A Chorus Line. Hamlisch's other music for film includes The Spy Who Loved Me, Ice Castles, Sophie's Choice, and The Mirror Has Two Faces. His Broadways scores include They're Playing Our Song, Smile and The Goodbye Girl. Hamlisch died in Los Angeles on August 6, 2012. He was 68.
It gives a veto to the oil industry. It's going to give a veto on immigration. Until we're willing to dig in and say that if Mitch McConnell is going to do to the next Democratic president what he did to President Obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the American people.
Wanda Abel: I was at home. … And my mother called me … she told me that Carolyn had been murdered. And I just -- I screamed … We're just -- crying … trying to figure out, I mean, how could this happen? Who would wanna do this to her? Everybody loved Carolyn. Why?
STEYER: Look, 21st Century warfare is cyber warfare. What we're having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now. The question you have to ask is, where is the commander-in-chief? And let me say this...
BIDEN: Let's look at the fact check...
I see no reason not to play by the new rules. I don't have to like them, but I refused to unilaterally disarm. If that makes me a terrible person, so be it, and I'll be a terrible person not under a liberal fascist dictatorship. — Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) March 26, 2018
The Mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.
So having someone that can lead the ticket, that can bring people with her, is the way you get gun safety legislation. I look at these proposals and say, do they hit my uncle Dick in the deer stand? They do not. So coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key.

Tulsi Gabbard Rep. Tulsi Gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 Biography Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa in 1981, and her family moved to Hawaii when she was 2 years old. Her mother, Carol, is a practicing Hindu, a religion Gabbard adopted. Her father, Mike, is a member of the Hawaii state Senate. After growing up in a politically active family, Gabbard became a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. While serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. She deployed in Iraq and returned in 2006. After returning from her second deployment in 2009, Gabbard ran for Honolulu City Council. She served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first practicing Hindu in Congress. Issues Gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. She resigned her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse him. Gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from NARAL. She has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. She also supports Medicare for All.
Peter Van Sant: Is that frustrating?
But let me tell you, I have been working very hard. We've improved the school system for black and brown students in New York City. We've increased the jobs that are available to them. We've increased the housing that's available to them. We have programs like the...
SANDERS: Can I respond? Amy used the word alienating. Hey, Amy, my favorability nationally I believe are the highest up here, as a matter of fact.
Vice President Biden, same question to you. Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?
After the polygraph, Kathy Patrick -- whom South Korea still wanted to arrest for murder -- was free to leave and resume her life in Washington State.
I'm not out of time. You spoke over time, and I'm going to talk.
And then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe.
BRENNAN: Senator Warren, same question. Would you allow Chinese firms to build infrastructure?
BLOOMBERG: Well, I think what's right for New York City isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. So let's get serious here.
In this web exclusive, legendary TV producer Norman Lear tells Tracy Smith about what happened when, during his search for an actor to star in his classic sitcom All in the Family, he came up with the idea of Mickey Rooney.
We just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about. But if you...
SANDERS: That is untrue, categorically untrue.
Last year, Buttigieg married teacher Chasten Glezman, and should he win the presidency, the two would be the first gay first couple in the White House.
BUTTIGIEG: ... has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign. The idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires...
That means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We are not winning in Afghanistan. We are not winning in the Middle East.
We can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. The American people support it. Even Republicans will support it. We have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely.
BUTTIGIEG: We are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reid has called for it to go. It has got to go, because otherwise Washington will not deliver. I was in high school when the Columbine shooting happened. And I remember everybody in Washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again.
And if you want to beat Trump, what you're going to need is an unprecedented...
On The Late Late Show, Ferguson didn't reveal many details about his and Mikita's future bundle of joy, but he did open up about the end of Modern Family.
I saw a statistic the other day, when I came into office, zero New York City schools were in the top 25 of the state. When I left, 23 out of 25 were from New York City. We've cut the gap between the rich and the poor. We've made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have.
BLOOMBERG: I never said that. Oh, come on.
This time, Moore sent an administrative order to the state's 68 probate judges, maintaining that the Alabama Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ban remained in full force and effect despite the ruling from the nation's highest court.
SANDERS: You know, Pete mentioned -- I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight.
Peter Van Sant: Now your roommate says just the opposite. That you confessed to her, and that the two of you then went back over to Carolyn's apartment and staged the scene as a burglary.
Peter Van Sant: What did the South Koreans want you to do?
BLOOMBERG: I -- I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he's president. I do not think so.
BUTTIGIEG: I think we're talking about math.
We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. We should -- and our president today -- and he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it.
I have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids.
WHITAKER: We're going to pass this on to Major.
KING: All right, Senator Sanders, please.
While Buttigieg held five events last Thursday, Brock spent nearly two hours training over 250 people in Polk County, the largest in the state. It's part of a broader effort to teach volunteers and caucus goers the delegate math and persuasion methods in order to convince undecided caucus goers.
Wanda Abel: My mother said in retrospect it was almost like she knew she didn't have a lot of time ... she wanted to do as much as she could in the time she had, and not waste a second.

Rep. Taylor Bennett, a Brookhaven Democrat, tried to amend the bill to also prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status or disability.

Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis.
STEYER: Democrats need to go to the grassroots. I built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States.
1995: Hootie & the Blowfish Atlantic Records Nominees: Brandy, Alanis Morissette, Joan Osborne and Shania Twain Formed in 1986 at the University of South Caroline, Hootie & the Blowfish came on the scene in 1994 with its debut album, Cracked Rear View -- still one of the Top 20 best-selling albums of all time. With radio hits Hold My Hand, Let Her Cry and Only Wanna Be with You, it was difficult to avoid this band in the mid-'90s. Hootie & the Blowfish (Mark Bryan, Dean Felber, Darius Rucker, Jim Soni Sonefeld) took home the Best New Artist 1995 Grammy and continued putting out music until 2005. Frontman Darius Rucker continued to tour with the band over the years, but more recently has found success as a country artist. His version of Wagon Wheel won Best Country Solo Performance at the 56th Grammy Awards.
Sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with Becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. What Trump says President Trump has alternated between praising Sanders and insulting him as crazy. As some of Mr. Trump and Sanders' populist ideas overlap, Mr. Trump often said during the 2016 campaign that Sanders voters would defect to him over Hillary Clinton in the general election. Mr. Trump also accused Clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from Sanders, and criticized Sanders for eventually endorsing Clinton. While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2016. Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary, he wrote in another July tweet. In several subsequent tweets, Mr. Trump has called Sanders Crazy Bernie. He has often referred to the 2016 Democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.
BUTTIGIEG: And, meanwhile, folks at home, from South Carolina to South Bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us, because it's right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up, and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement.

By hitching itself to a progressive image, Starbucks may cause consumers to be more critical of it because they're likely to expect actions that match its rhetoric. There's some sense of betrayal, Marzilli said.
Joining the Boy Scouts is practically automatic among Mormon boys, and the religion has long been the biggest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States. The Mormon boys who will be leaving represent about 18.5 percent of the 2.3 million youths in the organization.

The tracks appeared on the sophomore album from the band, which followed 2009's Aim and Ignite. Antonoff also found success with his side project, Bleachers.
GAYLE KING, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: Seven candidates face off in the final debate before the South Carolina and Super Tuesday primaries.
KING: Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you in this conversation.
None of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. Since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do...
KING: We're going to talk about that in our next segment. Before I leave you, are New Yorkers living longer because of your policies?
BLOOMBERG: I think she recognized me, thank you. I have a 6 million-person organization around this country. Moms Demand Action and Everytown.
BIDEN: But you knew -- you knew when you bought it they'd done that.
WARREN: ... to one of his pregnant employees. People want a chance to hear...
KING: And we are partnering tonight also with Twitter.

STEYER: Donald Trump thinks -- he's incompetent as a steward of the American economy. We have to show that we can create a growing, prosperous economy that works for American working people.
BUTTIGIEG: ... in terms of making the case, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate, from the perspective of the a veteran, why the kinds of weaponry, anything remotely like what I trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an American school or church or neighbor.
He didn't reveal if he and Mikita are having a boy or girl, just saying that they're having a human.
BLOOMBERG: I never said it, period, end of story. Categorically never said it. When it was accused -- when I was accused of doing it, we couldn't figure out what she was talking about. But right now, I'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard, or whatever happened. I didn't take any pleasure in that. And we've just got to go on. But I never said it. Come on.
Kathy Patrick: I believe it must have been … Ames.
1970: The Carpenters A&M Records Nominees: Elton John, Melba Moore, Anne Murray and The Partridge Family After a disappointing debut with the 1969 album Ticket to Ride, keyboardist Richard Carpenter and his sister, drummer Karen Carpenter, hit the big time with their second album, Close to You. Karen's mellow voice and Richard's arrangements produced such hits as the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song (They Long to Be) Close to You, We've Only Just Begun, and I'll Never Fall in Love Again. The Carpenters were nominated for eight Grammys in 1970 and won two (for Best New Artist and Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus). Eight more albums followed, before Karen's tragic death in 1983, from complications arising from anorexia nervosa. Richard Carpenter continued as a solo artist, with the 1987 album, Time, and 1998's Pianist - Arranger - Composer - Conductor.
Let me also say, because just -- since I have the floor for a second, that I really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it...

She would later earn 11 more Grammy nominations, and four awards.
Still, while consumers' perception of Target fell to an eight-month low after the retailer found itself in the headlines, it's doubtful the company will remain a focus of the story, Marzilli said. Any negative impact is likely to pale in comparison to the retailer's effort to regain consumers' trust after a security breach compromised customer information in late 2013. That was a much, much bigger deal, he said.
Georgia lawmakers have filed at least eight bills to grant a variety of legal exemptions to religious opponents of same-sex marriage. The push has gay-rights advocates in Georgia on guard; around 200 people held a rally opposing the measures Tuesday outside the state Capitol.

1959: Bobby Darin CBS News Nominees: Edd Byrnes, Mark Murphy, Johnny Restivo and Mavis Rivers In 1958-59 pop singer/crooner Bobby Darin had six singles on the U.S. charts, including Splish Splash, Early in the Morning, Dream Lover and Mack the Knife. Over the next decade-and-a-half, Darin recorded 32 albums; started a label (Direction Records) to release folk music and protest songs; and acted in films such as State Fair, Captain Newman, M.D., and Hell Is for Heroes. Darin died in 1973 at the age of 37, after surgery to correct a heart problem failed.

Eric Swalwell Biography Although he was born in Iowa in 1980, Swalwell moved with his family to attend middle school and high school in California. He was recruited to play soccer for North Carolina's Campbell University. After suffering an injury, however, he transferred to the University of Maryland. After completing his undergraduate studies, Swalwell earned his J.D. from the University of Maryland and was a congressional intern for former California Rep. Ellen Tauscher. In 2012, while a council member in Dublin City, in California's Alameda County, Swalwell mounted a primary challenge against fellow Democrat and 20-term incumbent Pete Stark in the state's 15th Congressional District, located in the outer suburbs of San Francisco. Although Stark bested him in the primary election, Swalwell beat the incumbent in the general election, which he qualified for because of California's top two primary system. Swalwell says he's running for president 01:40 Since he was sworn-in in 2013, Swalwell has won reelection three times. Although he has been a rank-and-file member of the House Democratic caucus during his congressional tenure, he has raised his profile during the Trump administration as a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, frequently rebuking the president in cable news appearances.

That's what we have to do. We have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the United States of America. That's where we are. Where are all these patriotic Republicans who wave the flag, but when we're actually under attack, they side with our enemies? It's outrageous.

Red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that.

During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.
As Tony Perkins told Politico.com, the relationship between evangelicals and Trump is transactional. They give the president their loyalty, and he gives them political support.

BIDEN: There was a -- I thought...
His campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. A New York Times story in early January reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which Sanders apologized. Politico also reported in early January that his former Iowa campaign manager, Robert Becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees.

The president has torn that to shreds. And so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the United States.
During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage.

She's been on the go ever since, serving as a mentor on The Voice and releasing six more studio albums -- the most recent, Lotus, surfacing in 2012. She's received a total of five Grammys, including the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for 2002's Beautiful, and one Latin Grammy.

SANDERS: Thank you. All right, look, you're right. We have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken, it is racist, got more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China. And one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs.
But I do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. The -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just a look what happened with smoking.

SANDERS: Now, if you look -- oh.
SANDERS: Furthermore, furthermore, it is my view, the time is now, and Joe made this point, look, at the end of the day we need to rally the American people. Here is the good news. Because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings, the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety, not be dictated to by the NRA.

I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done, Hickenlooper says in the video. I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver. As governor, Hickenlooper also signed an expansion of Medicaid in 2013. He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. Over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Hickenlooper so far.
And I am proud that I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. If elected president, it will get worse than that.

The way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the White House so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the Justice Department, and while getting their advice.

I'm talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10 percent for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over 4.5 million good-paying union jobs.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, you brought this up, let's talk about that.
1972: America Warner Brothers Nominees: Harry Chapin, the Eagles, Loggins and Messina, and John Prine Dewey Bunnell, Dan Peek and Gerry Beckley are the voices behind America and the 1971 smash hit Horse With No Name. The track appeared on America's self-titled debut, and marked the first of a few hits for the trio. Later on came Ventura Highway and I Need You, followed by a return to the charts in the early '80s with You Can Do Magic. America continues to tour and release albums. In 2007 a host of musicians, who cite America as a big influence, recorded a tribute album to the group, Here & Now.
Because the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. We are going to triple funding for low-income Title I schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the ZIP Code in which they live. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on Wall Street speculation. And we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year.
But we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.
WARREN: Education is not free. We must invest in the future of our children.
And, in terms of whether he's a dictator, he does serve at the behest of the Politboro, of their group of people, but there's no question he has an enormous amount of power. And he -- but he does play to his constituency. You can negotiate with him. That's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions.
As a graduate of Oral Roberts University myself, I don't recall exactly which book of the Bible mentions the mulligan (Proverbs, maybe? It has a Solomonic sound). But the need for forgiveness is certainly a Biblical principle, and the willingness of Christians to forgive human failings is nothing new. Nor is it a symptom of hypocrisy.
The message was retweeted more than 4,000 times and had over 30,000 likes by Saturday morning, with many followers calling O'Rourke classy for reaching out to his competition in a moment of sincerity on the campaign trail.
1961: Peter Nero CBS News Nominees: Ann-Margret, Dick Gregory, The Lettermen and Timi Yuro The pianist released his first easy-listening album, Piano Forte (RCA), in 1961. Nearly 70 more Peter Nero albums would follow, in a career that has spanned classical, jazz and American standards. Nero also help found the Philly Pops Orchestra.
SANDERS: In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth.
BLOOMBERG: And you have to do that, or you can't win.
Wanda Abel: The U.S. attorney in Washington state said, No, you can't arrest her because she hasn't committed a crime in the United States. …there was no jurisdiction to arrest her for murder … And that's what pushed my family to say, Wait a minute. This isn't right.
Tamara Doak: And I remember watching the news and the cameras panning around the room. And they kept, you know, going in on this teddy bear … And it was really horrible.
SANDERS: ... do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing that we need...
The other case involves two women, one from the U.S., and one from Italy, who met in New York, wed in London and each gave birth to a son. The State Department didn't recognize the couple's marriage, the lawsuit said, and only granted citizenship to the boy whose biological mother was born and raised in the U.S.
What I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. Yes, I think...
Thanks to the Abel family's lobbying efforts, in 1994 Congress passed a law that allows for the U.S. prosecution of U.S. nationals who kill other Americans in foreign countries.
KLOBUCHAR: OK. You did you that.
Moore was loudly applauded when he entered the ornate chamber where he usually presides over the state Supreme Court. He told his inquisitors that the ethics charges were ridiculous.
STEYER: And that is something -- I still have some time. And let me say this.
O'DONNELL: You've said Medicare for all will cost $30 trillion.
Tamara Doak: And -- I said, Well … maybe we should go over there.
WARREN: We -- we have to be able to trust our president, because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that. And that's one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes.
The goal of Tie The Knot is clear: to advocate for LGBTQ civil rights throughout the United States & beyond, and to look damn good while doing it, the organization's website reads.
PETER VAN SANT [outside Carolyn's apartment building]: Carolyn's apartment was on the 15th floor. So here we are. PETER VAN SANT [ knocks on door, speaks to man in Carolyn's old apartment]: I'm Peter Van Sant. And I'm a reporter for CBS News and we are working on a story about a woman named Carolyn who used to live in your apartment. … and we came by to ask you … if we may have permission … to come into your apartment to take some video pictures.
The committee also passed a bill known as the Pastor Protection Act, stating that religious officials aren't required to perform same-sex marriages. Nothing in state or federal law would require them to perform the ceremonies, but lawmakers said the bill would reassure officials concerned by the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage.
So we'd ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time.
So I do believe that, on day one, we will change the Federal Controlled Substance Act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. That's insane. We're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country.
BIDEN: Can we just speak up when we want to? Is that the idea?
BUTTIGIEG: ... if you want to keep the House in Democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the House blue, 40 Democrats, who are not running on your platform.
Sandra Ames: Carolyn and Kathy Patrick were extremely good friends. …They were considered, if I can use a modern term, besties.
So for me, it's building a coalition. And I actually like to get these things done and to -- the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done.
John Boatwright: That's correct. … After about 30 seconds, she was very quiet, but she said, No. … That was just -- just not normal.
Peter Van Sant: Even now thinking about it, you tear up a bit.
Peter Van Sant: Another circumstance in all of this is that –
Bernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done.
Tamara Doak: She made friends with everybody. She was very, very friendly.
Maryland Congressman Anthony Brown, who is a national campaign co-chair and the first Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) member to endorse Buttigieg, told CBS News in an interview that Buttigieg needs to convey his practical solutions to governing, his mayoral record, his military service and his faith in the final weeks to the caucus to convince undecided caucus goers.
Nancy Bercaw: They were hysterical. … it seemed as if they were having a nervous breakdown.
The punishment effectively removes Moore from office without the nine-member Alabama Court of the Judiciary officially ousting him. Given his age, he will not be able to run for chief justice again under state law.
WARREN: ... and referred to what I talk about as a sideshow. You know, this is personal for me. When I was 21 years old, I got my first job as a special education teacher. I loved that job. And by the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant.
And then a second school shooting generation has now been produced. Shame on us if we allow there to be a third. And also...
BUTTIGIEG: I will tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos.
We shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win. We should go to war only as a last resort. Nobody argues with that.
How did the same Americans who clamored for Bill Clinton to be impeached for lying about his affairs turn into voters who aren't even sure cheating is immoral at all? It's that magic word:
The former member of the rock group Pink Floyd kicked off his latest solo tour this week. The Us + Them Tour is as spectacular and technically challenging as his previous concerts -- and it may be the 73-year-old musician's last lap.
BIDEN: The -- look -- look...
BIDEN: I talked to Barack Obama...
Los Angeles -- A federal judge in California ruled Thursday that a twin son of a gay married couple has been an American citizen since birth, handing a defeat to the U.S. government, which had only granted the status to his brother. The State Department was wrong to deny citizenship to 2-year-old Ethan Dvash-Banks because U.S. law does not require a child to show a biological relationship with their parents if their parents were married at the time of their birth, District Judge John F. Walter found.
Then there's the other Clinton argument Christians use: Hillary.
WARREN: It is not enough to talk about housing neutrally...
Sandra Aes: At that point, some of our students drove us to Carolyn's apartment. We went into the apartment, and Kathy … discovered the body … She was murdered brutally and horribly and in a way she did not deserve.
Nancy Bercaw: Well, I think we should go to the school, to ELS, where we all taught.
BUTTIGIEG: We got a House to worry about. We got a Senate to worry about. And this is -- this is really important.
Buttigieg has been feuding with Vice President Mike Pence over his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights. If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, Buttigieg said at an LGBTQ Victory Fund brunch earlier this month. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand — that if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.
BUTTIGIEG: We've got to open this up. Universal health care, for example...
BUTTIGIEG: Yes, in effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. And I'm not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.
Jesse Tyler Ferguson is going to start a modern family of his own. The actor announced on The Late Late Show with James Corden that he and husband Justin Mikita are expecting their first child together.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, the first time I ever set foot in South Carolina, it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near Fort Jackson. And that was to get ready to go to Afghanistan, where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. Our allies and our adversaries knew it.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election is just too important, and we cannot afford to get it wrong.
Steven Schroeder: Simply, it wasn't true.
SANDERS: Can I say one word on...
SANDERS: Really? Really? Literacy programs are bad?
The move by Texas to pressure Target comes as North Carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the Justice Department says violates civil rights law.
SANDERS: I have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is the people in Saudi Arabia that the United States government...
STEYER: That was easy to do. But I want to say something about foreign policy...
But some undecided voters who attended his events his past week still harbor misgivings about the 38-year-old candidate's experience.
BIDEN: We choose hope over fear.
BUTTIGIEG: ... is actually listen to those who do.
Buttigieg, meanwhile, has not been shy about addressing his sexuality or his devout faith on the campaign trail. The mayor has called marriage equality a moral issue, and said his marriage of two years to his husband Chasten has made him a better human being and moved him closer to God.
One more thing. My secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high-stakes testing. We need to support our children. But, look, we want to build a future in this country? We build a future by investing in our children. I've got a plan to put $800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools.
Tamara Doak: They seemed horrified. … I was so concerned about them.
On immigration, O'Rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. In 2014, he called President Obama's executive action creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed Congress. He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told 60 Minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. Issues In his six years in Congress, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights.
Nancy Bercaw: Why couldn't we see through Kathy and Sandra? It's just – unreal. You know, in one fell swoop, you learn that your friends are involved in this crime … And that the one who might have been the killer is free. … because of this loophole in American law.
Though Ames' story was bizarre to say the least, investigators believed the core details, which never changed: that Patrick woke her up and confessed to killing Carolyn, and the two of them staged it to look like a robbery. And the evidence they collected, appeared to back that up.
Tamara Doak was one of the few teachers who knew Kathy was gay.
We need not to cut and run on our allies. We need an approach that keeps us safe by using all of the tools in a measured way.
It continues to be the case that Iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength for a lot of voters who I think are very pragmatic in places like South Carolina and Nevada, who above all, want to see a candidate who can win, Buttigieg told reporters at a campaign stop in Nevada on January 11.
John Boatwright: You really should look at the two girls who found the body.

STEYER: Excuse me, Amy. This conversation shows a huge risk for the Democratic Party. We are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a Republican.
Peter Van Sant: Back in Seoul. Where should be our first stop?
WARREN: Put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.
KLOBUCHAR: You want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward $60 trillion in spending, three times the American economy.
Sandra Ames: Kathy was very upset, convinced that something had happened to Carolyn.
STEYER: Every single policy area in the United States has a gigantic subtext of race. We're talking about education. We're talking about criminal justice. We're talking about housing. We're talking about loans. I started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry. Basically, to make loans to black-owned, Latino-owned, and women-owned businesses. We've supported over 8,000 affordable housing units.
Trump's affairs are a side show, Schlichter tweeted.
Sandra Ames: I did. I did, and that was because -- I remembered putting the clean knife into the dish rack … Kathy had said that that was the knife she had used to kill Carolyn.
During the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump famously said I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters.
Four presidential contenders — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet — will be off the trail for most days over at least the next two weeks because they're sitting senators who are required to be present for President Trump's Senate impeachment trial. Though the trial has not yet begun, their obligations in Washington have already meant that Buttigieg has had Iowa to himself for a couple of days after the presidential debate last week.
2007: Amy Winehouse Island Records Nominees: Feist, Ledisi, Paramore and Taylor Swift After her 2003 debut album, Frank, Winehouse's second album, Back to Black earned her five Grammys, including Album of the Year and Song of the Year (for Rehab). Her bluesy voice was hailed by such writers as The New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones, who said, She sounded like an original sixties soul star capable of utterly weird phrasings that no one could match. Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning on July 23, 2011, at her home in London. Her last recording -- a duet with Tony Bennett, Body and Soul -- was released posthumously, and won her a sixth Grammy.
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people.
Marc Rylander, Paxton's communications director, said Target had not yet responded to the attorney general's request. We asked them for safety policies, and we hope to hear from them.
John Boatwright: She says, I touched her arm and it was warm. And at that point, I realized that she may be still alive and that she might testify against … Kathy. And so I went to the kitchen, got a knife, and came back, and I cut her throat to make sure she was dead.
Though the flagship program's name is changing, the parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts - its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade - will keep its title, as well.
2001: Alicia Keys Frank Micelotta/ImageDirect Nominees: India.Arie, Nelly Furtado, David Gray and Linkin Park The Queen of R&B was nominated for six Grammy Awards upon the release of her first album, Songs in A Minor, and won five trophies, including Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for Fallin'. Keys has since been nominated for 23 more Grammys, and won 10, including: Best R&B Album for The Diary of Alicia Keys; Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, shared with Usher for My Boo; Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song for No One; Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for Superwoman; Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song (with Jay-Z) for Empire State of Mind; and Best R&B Album for Girl on Fire. As an actress her film performances include Smokin' Aces, The Nanny Diaries, and The Secret Life of Bees.
Wanda Abel: I think the South Koreans were taking the attitude that this is a U.S. problem. It's two U.S. citizens.
In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.
KLOBUCHAR: No, the math does not add up. In fact, just on 60 Minutes this weekend, he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. Well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about: nearly $60 trillion. Do you know how much that is, for all of his programs?
We are here 13 years later because the Chief Justice learned nothing from his first removal. He continues to defy the law, John Carroll, a lawyer representing the commission, argued Wednesday in Moore's judicial court hearing.
Like other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.
Varadkar — one of only a handful of openly gay world leaders — spoke about the changes he's seen in his country on LGBTQ issues and his desire for other places around the world to follow Ireland's lead. In 2015, Ireland's citizens voted in a landslide to legalize same-sex marriage — the first country to do so in a national popular vote.
KING: All right, Senator (sic) Biden, thank you.
KING: Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, your response.
And let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, try to bring Americans against Americans, hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more American elections.
SANDERS: No, it's not the problem. All right, let's talk about Medicare for all. I'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of Yale University, published in Lancet magazine, one of the prestigious medical journals in the world. You know what it said? Medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died.
1991: Marc Cohn Atlantic Records Nominees: Boyz II Men, C+C Music Factory, Color Me Badd and Seal Folk-rock singer-songwriter Marc Cohn is best known for Walking in Memphis, the single off his 1991 self-titled debut album. The Cleveland, Ohio-born singer has said the track, which helped land him the Best New Artist Grammy, was mostly autobiographical. Walking in Memphis also received nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance at the 34th annual Grammy Awards. Cohn has continually released albums and toured over the years, but has yet to score another radio hit like he did with Walking in Memphis.
After her confession, Sandra Ames was kept in house arrest in Seoul. Five months later, in July 1989, she pleaded guilty to harboring a criminal and suppressing evidence.
The law that Carolyn Abel's family helped pass has led to three successful murder prosecutions.
Peter Van Sant: Did you ask Kathy Patrick flat-out, Did you murder Carolyn Abel?
BIDEN: I could get that done. No one up here has ever dealt internationally with any of these world leaders. I'm the only one that has.
Kerry James Marshall's trademark style has catapulted him into the stratosphere of the art world. A 35-year retrospective featuring 72 of his works is now at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. His figures aren't just black; they are jet black -- bold, proud, undeniably black. And while his work may deal with grief, injustice and loss, for the most part Marshall focuses on everyday life: picnics and street scenes, daily rituals, and quiet moments -- a window into a world rarely represented in fine art.
In 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its alliance with the Boy Scouts.

Peter Van Sant: Do you believe Kathy Patrick lied to you?
Mayor Bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support. The problem is, they're all billionaires.
And let me say that I got into this race because I wanted to fight for economic justice, for racial justice, and to make sure we had climate justice for the American people. And I am scared.
Sunday Morning contributor Faith Salie says the escalation in exclamation needs to be taken down a notch. Period.
In his campaign announcement video, the Democrat claimed that Washington is broken, listing problems like rising prescription drug prices, the effects of climate change and crippling student debt. What Trump says Messam has not yet been a target for President Trump.
In that time, he's been giving some thought to his closing argument, about why I'll be the right nominee to take on and defeat Donald Trump. He's leaning into moderation, presenting himself as an alternative to progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are both polling strongly in Iowa. Where they focus on ideological purity, he's explaining why I'm focused on bringing together, not just our party but our country when the time comes.
STEYER: I released my tax returns.
The federal government and North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory sued each other on Monday, the deadline McCory had been given to confirm his state would not implement the law he signed in March.
WARREN: I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it.
Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light.
JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's no limit to what we could get done in the next four years.
If we cannot pull this party together, if we go to one of those extremes, we take a terrible risk of re-electing Donald Trump.
BUTTIGIEG: So let's do this math. Senator Sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then it was $30 trillion, then it was $17 trillion. That's an incredible shrinking price tag. At some point, has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be. Now there are new numbers.
This is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million Uighurs in reconstruction camps, meaning concentration camps. This is a guy who you see what's happening right now in -- in Hong Kong, and this is a guy who I was able to convince should join the international agreement at the Paris agreement because, guess what, they need to be involved.
I think -- when I've looked at this both in my job in local government and in the Senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live.
I gave them a status in the case, a status of the facts that these orders exist. That is all I did, Moore testified.
BRENNAN: If you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you.
1985: Sade Epic Records Nominees: a-ha, Freddie Jackson, Katrina and the Waves, and Julian Lennon As Best New Artist, the Nigerian-born British singer Sade Adu actually shared her Best New Artist Grammy with the fellow members of her band, also called Sade - Paul S. Denman, Andrew Hale and Stuart Matthewman.

Sade later received three more Grammys - for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal (No Ordinary Love, 1993; and Soldier of Love, 2010), and Best Pop Vocal Album (Lovers Rock, 2010).
After reportedly being interrupted several times during a campaign stop in Texas, presidential contender Pete Buttigieg got some support from one of his 2020 challengers: Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas Congressman tweeted in support of Buttigieg Friday night after the South Bend, Indiana, mayor was interrupted by protesters during a speech at the Dallas County Democratic Party dinner.
STEYER: We need to -- well, let me just finish, because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump.
And thirdly, I make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. We've got to deal with the institutional racism.
From a policy standpoint, he has delivered more than any other president in my lifetime.
