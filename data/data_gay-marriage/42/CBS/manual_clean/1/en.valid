in the house, he was a member of the pro-business new democrat coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the democratic party to support more audacious efforts, like the green new deal, to mitigate climate change. during his senate campaign, o'rourke refused to back medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 democrats have vouched their support for. medicare for all emerges as first litmus test for 2020 democratic contenders

tamara doak: kathy really fell for carolyn.
how about a wealth tax in america? because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies, to really level the playing field.
however, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in washington. what trump says mr. trump has yet to tweet about inslee or his presidential aspirations. in february 2018, however, the washington governor confronted the president in the white house about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. i just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. and let's just take that off the table and move forward, inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the east room. although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, mr. trump listened with his arms crossed while inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure

and i would agree, when mayor bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget -- he tried to cut back on the cdc; he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world; he hasn't yet really addressed the nation on this topic, i would do all of that.
buttigieg: think about what that will be like for this country.
warren: people across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. this is an issue we need to talk about.
the gun manufacturers own the senate of the united states. so even though more than 90 percent of americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase, we can't get it through the senate.
i guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should.
sandra ames: i was not at that point concerned. but … kathy was concerned about carolyn because she couldn't get her on the phone.
the question to you is this, would you close the borders to americans who have been exposed to the coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country?
and with no extradition treaty in place, south korean authorities put the murder case on the shelf.
sanders: ... has loved for years. cuba, nicaragua, authoritarianism of any stripe is bad.

bloomberg: the polls aren't the election.
jayne houdyshell and laurie metcalf in a doll's house, part 2. brigitte lacombe
buttigieg: let's talk about this. let's talk about what's radical about that plan.
whitaker: let's talk about education. south carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. black students here consistently score worse than white students. mayor bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in new york city was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. as president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide?
klobuchar: thank you. this is one of the first times we've talked about housing. and i put forward an extensive policy.
controversy while swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in congress, the california democrat will surely face criticism from mr. trump and republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the mueller probe. what trump says the president has yet to tweet about swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the justice department's summary of the mueller report. in a memorandum, tim murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge swalwell and other prominent democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and moscow.
steyer: there's something going on here. i have worked for racial justice...
john boatwright: he asked her, do you know where the murder weapon is? and she said, no. and she really peaked out on that … indicating … she was not being truthful.
classes were winding down for the winter break. ayagaki was getting ready to fly to seoul, hoping to get an answer to his marriage proposal. on tuesday, dec. 20, carolyn never made it to work.
klobuchar: so, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now.
here are the seven candidates for the presidential nomination.
atlanta -- georgia lawmakers backed a bill on tuesday preventing businesses from discriminating based on race, nationality, religion or sex, after republicans rejected democrats' efforts to add gay and transgender people to those protected by the measure.
bloomberg: we have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. so you can do it. it's congress that can't seem to do it. and i don't know why we think they're going to do it. the vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the nra. and certainly senator sanders has supported the nra.
buttigieg: the only way we're going to restore...
and i want to make clear, given south carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. it's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing.
king: senator warren, that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor.
klobuchar: ... and do something for the people of america.
last year you and karen said that my partner, matthew, would be welcome to join us, and we're both really honored to accept the invitation this year, varadkar said during the friends of ireland breakfast.
secondly, i provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. thirdly, i go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. they're being bought out. you cannot find a place to live.
buttigieg: we will deliver a democracy worthy of the name.
peter van sant: she's just staring at you?
1996: leann rimes curb records nominees: garbage, jewel, no doubt and the tony rich project at age 14, leann rimes not only beat out fellow nominees garbage, jewel, no doubt and the tony rich project; she also became the youngest grammy winner in history, a title she holds to this day. the country singer's major-label debut album, blue, went multi-platinum, and earned her a best female country vocal performance grammy as well. rimes has had six more grammy nominations since, including album of the year for her contribution to vince gill's these days (2008).
the other issue is we don't have enough personnel. and so that's where we get to this education plan.. and i don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. what i think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy.
1989: milli vanilli arista records nominees: neneh cherry, indigo girls, soul ii soul and tone lōc milli vanilli rose to fame in the late '80s and early '90s following the release of the hit album, girl you know it's true. rob morvan and rob pilatus served as the faces of the popular german duo, though the world would soon learn that they did not provide vocals on any of their recordings -- but not before milli vanilli swooped up the best new artist honor at the grammys. the award was later revoked -- the only time a grammy win has ever been vacated -- and several lawsuits followed. morvan and pilatus attempted to make music on their own, under a different group name, but it failed to gain any traction. years later, in 1998, milli vanilli started prepping a comeback album, called back and in attack, but the set never saw the light of day. pilatus died on april 2, 1998 at the age of 32 of a suspected alcohol and prescription pill overdose -- right before the launch of a promotional tour for the lp.
actually, this is something i haven't even mentioned to anyone — if we can keep this between us three and you all, he said gesturing to the audience. i'm actually expecting a baby in july with my husband. the crowd erupted with cheers and ferguson joked, let's just keep it between us.
remember, boatwright believed that wound was inflicted after carolyn was already dead from the stab wound to the lung.
els is the english language school, where bercaw met fellow teacher carolyn abel back in 1988.
we went to mitch mcconnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. he said, no, we want no part of it. and if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. and, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end. and so, look, we, in fact, should be imposing sanctions on russia now for their interference.
peter van sant: did you ask kathy patrick flat-out, did you murder carolyn abel?
john boatwright: that certainly would not be normal.
we're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors.

bloomberg: probably wrong to make the jokes. i don't remember what they were. so i assume -- if it bothered them, i was wrong, and i apologize. i'm sorry for that.
i did it in new york city. i got the republican state senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. you can work across the aisle. you just have to know how to deal with people.
brennan: well, you're out of time. senator.
last night's terror attacks on and near london bridge, in which seven people were killed, was the third attack in the u.k. in three months. british prime minister theresa may condemned the violence, saying, it's time to say, enough is enough. elizabeth palmer and charlie d'agata have the latest.

peter van sant: so, do you believe this sudden move from south korea to the united states was in a way-- an expression of consciousness of guilt?
tamara doak: and she would confide in me, you know, i really like this woman. … i think she's into me. and i'm like, kathy, i don't really think she's gay. you should really be careful.
sanders: the moderator -- is it my turn?
and, in fact, since then, i have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. i have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced.
the shocked friends turned their attention to kathy patrick and sandra ames, who had discovered carolyn's body.
i want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th century or the 19th century. if you look at the biggest threats to the united states, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the united states. we're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need u.s. leadership for countries around the world.
buttigieg: ... listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall.

bloomberg: i never said that. and for the record, if she was a teacher in new york city, she would never have had that problem. we treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that.
days later, patrick led a memorial service for carolyn.
steven schroeder: my name is steven schroeder, i'm a retired assistant united states attorney and i worked in seattle.
king: all right, mr. steyer, please? mr. steyer?
and to me that means sentencing reform, like the first step act, and extending that to the states with the second step act. it means equal opportunity. because if we don't pass representative clyburn's bill out of south carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny.
garrett: senator sanders -- no, senator sanders, i have a question for you, sir. you're the frontrunner in this race. you're on the ballot in south carolina. mayor bloomberg, you'll understand that preamble in just a second.

correspondent peter van sant and his team have investigated the disturbing 1988 murder of carolyn abel, an american teacher in south korea, and the loophole in u.s. laws at the time that mean the suspected killer may never face trial.
steyer: i get to answer that.
if elected, senator sanders, you would be america's first jewish president. you recently called a very prominent, well-known american israel lobby a platform for, quote, bigotry. what would you say to american jews who might be concerned you're not, from their perspective, supportive enough of israel? and specifically, sir, would you move the u.s. embassy back to tel aviv?
steyer: bernie sanders' analysis is right.
do you feel your marriage is campaigning as well, because you're doing something that is new in american politics? dickerson asks chasten buttigieg.

warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run dec. 31. warren and her second husband, bruce mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. they live in cambridge, massachusetts with their golden retriever, bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. key issues warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-wall street crusader. the 69-year-old senator serves on the senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs committee and the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. in one instance, she helped to derail then-president obama's nomination of investment banker antonio weiss to a top position at the treasury department in 2015. fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. i've spent my career getting to the bottom of why america's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. what i found is terrifying. these aren't cracks that families are falling into. they're traps. america's middle class is under attack. how do we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.
on the other hand, of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally, mr. bloomberg, i beat trump 47 of those 50 times.
in 2015, when both buttigieg and pence were serving in indiana, pence, then the governor, signed a law that critics said unfairly targeted members of the lgbtq community. months later, during his mayoral re-election bid, buttigieg came out as gay. the law was eventually rolled back amid a national outcry.
in addition to, that i passed the brady bill with waiting periods. i led that fight. but my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. imagine if i stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. we would give immunity to tobacco companies. that has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. more than all the wars, including vietnam, from that point on.
comedy titans norman lear, carl reiner and dick van dyke are a collective 280 years old, earning them starring roles in the new hbo documentary, if you're not in the obit, eat breakfast. tracy smith reports.
they are the democratic national committee and the congressional black caucus institute, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders.

controversy although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. critics have pointed to california's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. if kamala harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor lara bazelon in an opinion piece for the new york times. what trump says although mr. trump has not yet tweeted about harris, the white house has previously criticized the california senator. in the summer of 2018, the white house twitter account wrote, @senkamalaharris, why are you supporting the animals of ms-13? you must not really know what ice does. harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of immigration and customs enforcement (ice).

alexandria ocasio-cortez introduces 2020 policy test with green new deal some candidness may also follow the lead of o'rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. in 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a dwi program the following year. o'rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the houston chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. what trump says mr. trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an o'rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the texas democrat's unsuccessful senate bid. i thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, mr. trump told reporters in december. when the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed o'rourke's great defeat in november.

biden: barack obama was abroad, he was in a town meeting, he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the cuban government. he acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy. but he went on and condemned the dictatorship. he went on and condemned the people who, in fact, had run that committee.

nancy bercaw: we've all continued our lives as adventurous people. …but, you know, we kind of … carry the memory of carolyn … behind us, whatever ground we walk on. it's hard not to remember there's another one of us who could be out there on the same path.

buttigieg: this is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. this is about 2020. we are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the cold war. and we're not going to win these critical, critical house and senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the democratic party is telling people to look at the bright side of the castro regime. we've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future.

buttigieg: i'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. but i want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that bernie sanders took, this is a current bad position that bernie sanders holds.

peter van sant: did you fall in love with carolyn?
klobuchar: people aren't always aware, i know you are in south carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. so the answer is one size doesn't fit all. and one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. and actually, i am leading -- the lead democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered.

bloomberg: no. you want to cut it back as much as you can, but i think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. we have to be able to stop terrorism. and there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible.

tim ryan biography ryan was born and raised in northeastern ohio in 1973. he played football in high school and was recruited to play for youngstown state university. because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to bowling green state university, near toledo. after graduating from college, ryan earned a j.d. from the university of new hampshire and worked in the office of longtime ohio congressman james traficant, who was expelled from the house after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. at age 26, ryan was elected to ohio's state senate. when his old boss tradicant became embroiled in scandal, ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. at 29, he was the youngest member of congress when he was sworn in 2003. although he has served eight terms in the house, ryan gained notoriety following mr. trump's unexpected election in november 2016. citing democrats' loss of midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace nancy pelosi, then house minority leader. after democrats retook control of the house during the 2018 november midterm elections, the ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace pelosi. ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. rep. tim ryan announces 2020 run 03:08 issues ryan has not staked out a clear ideological agenda during his 15 years in congress.

wayne messam screenshot from wayne messam's 2020 campaign video wayne for america biography born in pahokee, florida and raised in south bay, mayor wayne messam became the first african american mayor of the city of miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. messam's parents immigrated to south florida from jamaica. his father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the florida glades after coming to the united states, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. messam earned a full football scholarship to florida state university, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 national championship team under legendary coach bobby bowden. he would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, angela, more than 20 years ago. they have three children, wayne ii, and twin daughters, kayla and kyla. issues while lacking name recognition outside florida, messam told cnn that under his leadership, the city of miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from hurricane irma. he has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. these are issues that have national implications and i'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the american people and i'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the united states, he said.

in his exit memo from the agency, castro said that hud had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. under the obama administration, he wrote, hud invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. views on lgbt issues and abortion rights he supports lgbt rights and was the first san antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's pride parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the mayors for the freedom to marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. he spoke at the annual luncheon for planned parenthood south texas in may. controversy in 2016, the office of the special counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that castro had violated the hatch act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the hatch act in his department. what trump says castro has not yet been a target for president trump. unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, mr. trump has never personally disparaged castro on twitter. issues in his video announcing his exploratory committee in december, castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants.

biden: because i'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. i beat the nra twice. i got assault weapons banned. i got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. i got them eliminated. except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in florida and it was not reauthorized.
mayor bloomberg, i'd like to bring you into this conversation. i want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community. you've apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly. what exactly are you apologizing for?
the national debate over lgbt rights is unlikely to abate anytime soon, but experts say the target brand is unlikely to face any long-term damage.

he often called for improvements to the affordable care act, president obama's signature domestic policy achievement. during and after his senate campaign, o'rourke made immigration a central issue. he has routinely denounced the white house for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the u.s.-mexico border. he also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as dreamers, on a pathway to u.s. citizenship. during a fiery speech in el paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with president trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, o'rourke condemned mr. turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. we know that walls do not save lives. walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of mr. trump's nearby rallies. in the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. controversy in addition to the scrutiny o'rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a senate race, the texas democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in congress and personal life. although he had a generally liberal voting record in congress, o'rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left.

klobuchar: why don't you let me answer, ok?
sanders: listen to the moderator, guys.
in fact, mr. trump's policy of us going it alone, of america first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. the biggest threat to america right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. and it's time for us to deal with it that way. every single foreign policy issue is about american leadership and coalition.
secondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it.

everything seemed fine until the couple brought their cranky infants to the american consulate in toronto a few months later to apply for citizenship and the woman at the counter began asking probing questions they found shocking and humiliating.
warren: this is a point where we need to talk about race, though.
bloomberg: we let it get out of control and when i realized that, i cut it back by 95 percent. and i've apologized and asked for forgiveness. i've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how i can better position myself and what i should have done and what i should do next time.
and i come to this with some humility because i'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. none of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin.

1969: crosby, stills & nash atlantic records nominees: chicago, led zeppelin, the neon philharmonic and oliver call it one of the first super groups. david crosby (the byrds), stephen stills (buffalo springfield) and graham nash (the hollies) were all part of popular bands before teaming to create the harmonies that make up cs&n. the trio's self-titled debut album, released in 1969, featured the songs suite: judy blue eyes and marrakesh express. a spot at woodstock that year helped cement their place in history -- leading to the subsequent best new artist grammy win. the trio would go on to perform with neil young as csn&y, and each member ended up pursuing solo careers over the years. crosby, stills & nash was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1997. you can still catch these guys on the road, as they tour fairly regularly.

but, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. they say go very slowly. they haven't done enough research. and the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains.
klobuchar: it is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done.
no matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. the need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. we all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. we all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, castro said.
number two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. the federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. we get $3.5 trillion in revenue. we lose $1 trillion a year.

biden: look, one of the things we have to do, we have a thing in the defense department called darpa, a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer. they came up with the internet, i mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology.
but what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them?
klobuchar: ok. so, if i could finish. i have the bill. anyone can check it out, to close the boyfriend loophole. also to close the charleston loophole is another bill that is out there. universal background checks.
klobuchar: yes, and i think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. martin luther king once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. so when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.

i think he needs to prove, other than say that 'it doesn't matter,' that he has the experience to lead, said runal a. patel, a 20-year-old college student who also volunteered for new jersey senator cory booker's presidential campaign. i really hate that whenever he gets asked that question, he sort of just deflects and says, 'well, you know the last president didn't have any experience.' i always think well, look how that presidency is going. you know, i don't think that that's a good answer.

king: mr. steyer, thank you. your time is up.

beto o'rourke beto o'rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 biography o'rourke was born and raised in the texas border city of el paso. although his legal first name is robert, he has been known as beto, the nickname spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like roberto and alberto, since childhood. he was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the el paso-based punk group foss after graduating from columbia university in new york in 1995. o'rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to el paso from new york city. after working on several local political campaigns, o'rourke ran for the el paso city council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. he served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. in 2012, o'rourke, who speaks fluent spanish, announced his candidacy for the democratic primary in the race to represent texas 16th congressional district, a latino-majority district encompassing el paso and the surrounding communities. he managed to topple eight-term incumbent silvestre reyes in the primary and defeated his republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. while in congress, the texas democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the armed services and veterans affairs committees.

sanders: we've got to work with countries all the over the world to solve it.
klobuchar: but the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. so i have long supported the assault weapon ban. i am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an ak-47.

target has been pretty balanced in terms of how they've been communicating with the media, he said. they are not being combative, they are just saying look, this is our policy, i don't think they are stirring up the pot, or trying to pick a bigger fight.

o'donnell: mayor bloomberg, i'll let you respond to that.
i raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. i put an extra $5 billion into our school system. i value education. it is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education. and rather than just talk about it in new york, we actually did it.
bernie and i both want to see universal health care, but bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.

the same panel removed the outspoken republican in 2003 because he refused to remove a ten commandments monument from the state judicial building. voters later re-elected him as chief justice after he lost a race for governor.
buttigieg: ... american credibility, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency. and i am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to donald trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s, and bernie sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.
brennan: ok. mayor bloomberg, would you like to respond?

we're used to hearing narratives of trauma, tragedy, disenfranchisement, pain, suffering, marshall told correspondent alex wagner. few of the stories that normalize the everyday life of people who are not always experiencing trauma 24/7. and i think those things need to be represented as well as anything else that we read about in the newspaper or we see on the news.
sanders: well, you're right. the economy is doing really great for people like mr. bloomberg and other billionaires.
klobuchar: i would have better relations with our allies and i would support, because i know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in columbia, south carolina, or houston, texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world.
buttigieg: yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries (ph).
o'donnell: senator, we're going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs. margaret brennan?
buttigieg: i think we were talking about math, and it doesn't take two hours to do the math.
but let me say how we win this. we have got to win in the middle of the country. and while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, i'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in republican congressional districts over and over again, including michele bachmann's district.

evangelicals remember how feminists and liberals who claimed to care deeply about the treatment of women in the workplace rallied around bill clinton, despite his behavior with a white house intern. bring up stormy daniels to politically active social conservatives and they're likely to bring up nina burleigh, the former time reporter who said during the clinton scandal that she would be willing to engage in the same activity as monica lewinsky to thank him for keeping abortion legal.
bloomberg: i'm not sure they're appropriate every place. i can only tell you, in new york, they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them. we had -- the charter schools are mixed in with the non-charter public schools, because our charter schools are public schools, as well. they've helped each other.
sanders: all right. but the point is -- the point is the way we are going to beat trump, which is what everybody up here wants, is we need a campaign of energy and excitement. we need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the united states. we need to bring working people back in to the democratic party. we need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before. that is what our campaign is about.

at multiple campaign stops in iowa, buttigieg has acknowledged iowa has a thumb on the scale in selecting the party's nominee — its winner has been the democratic nominee 7 out of 10 times — but he also talks about how iowa has been a leader in political and social issues that are personal to him.

one of his missions, he has said, is to improve the symbolism of the office. because the presidency is also a moral office, buttigieg tells dickerson, co-host of cbs this morning. it calls this nation to its highest values. and it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. narrative is a very powerful thing, and we need to make sure that everybody in america understands where they fit in this country's story.
biden: how about cuba or nicaragua?
and that is that a progressive agenda is popular, mayor bloomberg.

sanders: if we do nothing is what...

sanders: that is why i am beating trump in virtually every poll that is done, and why i will defeat him.
peter van sant: and what did she say about that?
i think sharing his experiences, framing it in the values that we all share, demonstrating a strategic approach to our issues — i think that will set him apart from the other candidates, brown added.
king: mr. biden, will you continue if you do not win south carolina? you have said that south carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race. if you don't win south carolina, will you continue in this race?
whitaker: thank you. thank you, senator.
but in carolyn abel's case, any trial seems highly unlikely. in south korea, the statute of limitations for her murder has expired. and the abel family says investigators told them the physical evidence in the case has been destroyed -- evidence that would've been crucial for a trial in the united states.
sanders: do you think immigration reform? the truth is, pete...

when ames returned to the united states, she was recruited by the fbi to go undercover and secretly record a reunion with kathy patrick in hopes of eliciting a confession.
peter van sant: even today after all these years, 30 years, this still gets to you, doesn't it?

biden: where we come from, that's called tommy come lately.
klobuchar: instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers.

bloomberg: i got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago, we have been working on our tax returns, i've said they will be out. we probably have another couple of weeks left to go. we're doing it as fast we can. we've complied with every single requirement for disclosure. and when i was mayor of new york, we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the white house.
1979: rickie lee jones warner brothers nominees: the blues brothers, dire straits, the knack and robin williams chuck e's in love was just one of the songs on rickie lee jones' debut album, a captivating blend of folk, r&b and jazz. the 21-year-old singer-songwriter, hailing from a long line of performers, was joined on her album by dr. john, michael mcdonald and randy newman. an appearance on saturday night live and an article in time magazine that labeled her the duchess of coolsville burnished her reputation. nominated for five grammys (including record of the year and song of the year), jones won best new artist. jones would record 20 more studio and live albums, her most recent being the 2012 folk rock album, the devil you know. in 1989 jones shared a second grammy with dr. john for best jazz vocal performance, duo or group, for makin' whoopee. she has a new album due out in spring 2015.
biden: i would make them pay for it, and i would make them pay for it economically. they are engaged now, as i speak, in interfering in our elections. they were engaged, and when we -- when, in fact, we were -- the last election in 2016 against hillary, they were. there's no question.
the cbs news democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break.
wanda abel: yes. … kathy knew she did it, so she had to suspect that sooner or later somebody was going to put it together or that sandra was going to crack and tell on her. … so she spends as little time in south korea as possible after she killed carolyn.
sandra ames: kathy … she went -- did a b-line right to the bedroom. … kathy came out of the room and said, carolyn's dead. we need to call an ambulance. no, we need to call the cops. and she didn't want me to go look at the body.
sanders: well, you know, joe has voted for terrible trade agreements.
warren: and while mayor bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on african-americans and on latinos, in fact, i was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages. we have a -- i have a housing plan, and what it has in it specifically...
peter van sant: is it true you got out of prison because someone bribed a judge to get you out?
klobuchar: well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, i want to do that, too. and i also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. i think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs.
presidential candidate & south bend mayor @petebuttigieg is right—god doesn't have a political party, graham wrote. but god does have commandments, laws & standards he gives us to live by. god doesn't change. his word is the same yesterday, today & forever.
king: but senator sanders is in striking distance of you. you are within the margin of error in this state.
do you think senator sanders' economy would be better for america than president trump's?
buttigieg: fifty people, all right. in charleston alone, just in charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. that means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign.
o'donnell: thank you. thank you. we have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but i want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace. at the last debate, you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes. did these women take your jokes wrong? or were you wrong to make the jokes?
iowa has a way of surprising america and leading it forward — 2008, iowa made it possible for a candidate whose very name made his campaign extremely improbable to arrive on the scene as a front running presidential candidate and eventually president of the united states, buttigieg said at a town hall in mason city, of barack obama.
bloomberg: and the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- i'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. we just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. we did what she asked. and, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. and by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across america.
warren: i was mentioned in this.
1997: paula cole imago/warner brothers nominees: fiona apple, erykah badu, puff daddy and hanson the singer, songwriter and instrumentalist has toured with peter gabriel, mandy moore, and with sarah maclachlan's lilith fair. she had a top 10 hit with her 1997 single where have all the cowboys gone? (from her second album, this fire). the same year she won best new artist, cole received six additional grammy nominations, including album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and producer of the year (non-classical).
pete buttigieg likes to start off his stump speech by asking the crowd to envision the day when the sun comes up and donald trump is no longer president. the first potentially concrete development on this front takes place in two weeks, when iowans go to caucus in the first democratic voting contest on february 3.
wanda abel: i honestly can't picture her old 'cause she was just always so -- so vibrant and so energetic. and i -- i -- i think she still would be. … you know, i miss her. she was like my best friend.
buttigieg has not yet responded to graham's remarks.
king: all right, thank you, senator klobuchar.
the events of that day have haunted carolyn abel's family for more than 30 years.

sanders: let me just -- the answer is, it's something that we would take into consideration.
sanders: ... the american people support my agenda.
o'donnell: we want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the democratic party.
1964: the beatles capitol records the world knows what became of john, paul, george and ringo - probably the easiest choice for best new artist the grammy membership ever had to make. so what happened to their fellow nominees? petula clark, whose hits included downtown and don't sleep in the subway, also starred in the musical films goodbye, mr. chips and finian's rainbow, and on broadway in blood brothers, with david and shaun cassidy. brazilian astrud gilberto, best known for the girl from ipanema, has recorded 16 albums, and performed with such artists as joão gilberto, stan getz and george michael. bossa nova musician and composer antonio carlos jobim won the 1995 grammy for best latin jazz performance for antonio brasileiro. jobim died in 1994. singer morgana king's four-octave range graced cabarets and concert hall for more than three decades. she released 30 albums, but probably received the most exposure from her debut film role, as carmela corleone, wife of don corleone, in the godfather. king sang luna mezz'o mare during the wedding reception scene.

i was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the united states for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. it is safer for everybody. the school system is better. the budget is under control. we've done the things that people need in new york city for all ethnicities.
corden put things in perspective for ferguson: on your last day of 'modern family,' knowing what we know now, you should think i'm leaving 'modern family' behind, but come july, you're going to make your new modern family — and it's going to be beautiful.
sandra ames: to the best of my recollection, we sat in the living room at carolyn's apartment, and … she convinced me, manipulated me, to help her make it look like a robbery.

i talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. it's why i also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families.
o'donnell: senator sanders, the cost of your agenda. yesterday, you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals, but not all of your details are clear. you've proposed more than $50 trillion in new spending.
but let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in new york city. and i listened to them. they're in congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. but if you change something like the president, they would. no, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.
whitaker: thank you, mr. vice president.
we also put $2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country, to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas.
klobuchar: well, what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. we don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help.
buttigieg: let's talk about math, indeed. ok, so here's the math...
buttigieg: if you're going to ask that rhetorical question, let's...

garrett: as we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, twitter, this debate is no different. so i want to put a question from twitter to you, senator klobuchar. this is from casey pennington. how will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?
king: senator klobuchar -- good idea, right, mr. vice president?
people of faith were looking for a politician who would champion their religious faith, not change it.and while an exceptionally profane, likely unfaithful, thrice-married braggart who once publicly supported abortion (as mark hemingway calls him in the conservative weekly standard magazine this week) doesn't seem like the obvious candidate, trump got the job.

and we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. and then, finally, voting. while we are all sitting here debating, wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. georgia kicked 100,000 off. as president, i will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone.
warren: sorry, mayor, you did not do what i asked.
and we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators.

the city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since buttigieg took office. he has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. in the video announcing his exploratory committee, buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in american politics. he also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: we're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. unless we do something different. controversy buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. in his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first african american chief of police of south bend. what trump says president trump has not tweeted about or insulted buttigieg as of now.

steyer: that is a risk that will hurt the american people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk.
she was the first senator to call on sen. al franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. a few big democratic donors, including billionaire george soros, have said that they will not support gillibrand because of her position on franken. she has also distanced herself from the clintons. in november 2017, she said that president bill clinton should have resigned after his affair with white house intern monica lewinsky became public. what trump says president trump tweeted at gillibrand in december 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill & crooked-used! mr. trump tweeted. critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. you cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the oval office, gillibrand wrote on twitter in response.
the backlash from the incident -- which has sparked protests and apologies from its ceo -- caused the company's consumer perception to drop to its lowest since november 2015, when the chain got criticized for replacing a symbol-filled holiday cup with a simple red design. about 25 percent of consumers surveyed said they would consider making a purchase at starbucks on tuesday, compared with 28 percent on friday.

protests have become somewhat of a common occurrence at buttigieg's campaign stops. during a two-day swing through iowa last month, buttigieg was interrupted by protesters at two events with iowa democrats, with demonstrators questioning the openly-gay mayor's episcopalian faith.
he is not a member of any of the major democratic caucuses in the house, like the pro-business new democrat coalition or the congressional progressive caucus. he once earned an a rating from the national rife association (nra) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by republicans. but ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like medicare for all. controversy ryan's tenure in congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to pelosi's leadership are likely to alienate some democratic primary voters. what trump says although ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, mr. trump has not yet tweeted about the ohio congressman.

then, graham added, mayor buttigieg says he's a gay christian. as a christian i believe the bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. the bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.

jay inslee jay inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 biography born and raised in seattle, inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the university of washington in 1973 and a j.d. from willamette university college of law in oregon three years later. after working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the washington house of representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for congress in 1992. inslee represented the state's 4th congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called republican revolution of 1994. during the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional department of health and human services (hhs) director under president clinton. inslee ran for congress again in 1998 and defeated a republican incumbent in washington's 1st congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. during his congressional tenure, the washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the american economy's reliance on fossil fuels. inslee left congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in washington, defeating the state's republican attorney general in the general election. after winning reelection in november 2016 -- the same time mr. trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- inslee declared that washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values.
see, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. all of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. and that harms everyone.

after longtime new jersey senator frank lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known republican mayor in a special election. in 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the senate. during his years in the senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. booker announced he was running for president on feb. 1, 2019, the first day of black history month. issues he has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the senate. pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the marijuana justice act in the summer of 2017. the bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 controlled substances act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. the junior senator from new jersey is one of the chief architects of the first step act, a landmark bill that president trump signed into law in december after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in congress. the legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in congress, booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.

he plans to release them after super tuesday. it is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. we have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this.
carolyn also hit it off with the head teacher at the school, kathy patrick.
o'donnell: ... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. as a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?
steyer: the way to win at the grassroots is, tell the truth and organize.
biden: the only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. i couldn't get that covered. you, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and mitch mcconnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the violence against women act across the board.
o'donnell: and cbs news is proud too bring you this debate, along with our co-sponsors.
and the second thing i'd point out to you is that what i would do immediately is restore the funding. he cut the funding for cdc. he tried to cut the funding for nih. he cut the funding for the entire effort.
buttigieg: the way you're talking about doing it is radical by...
tamara doak: and we were just all in shock. … just trying to figure out … what happened.
2011: bon iver frederic j. brown/afp/getty images nominees: the band perry, j. cole, nicki minaj and skrillex folk band bon iver, led by singer-songwriter justin vernon (left), had released two albums prior to its 2011 best new artist win. for emma, forever ago, the band's debut, surfaced in 2007 -- four years before bon iver's sophomore effort, bon iver, bon iver. at the 2012 grammy ceremony bon iver not only scooped up best new artist, but bon iver, bon iver also won best alternative music album. the track holecene received nominations for both song and record of the year. by the end of 2012, though, during a bon iver concert in dublin, ireland, vernon announced it would be their last performance as a band ... at least for a while. it wasn't until 2016 that the band released a new album, 22, a million, which would receive a grammy nomination for best alternative music album. their next album, i,i, would be nominated for three grammys, including album of the year.

nancy bercaw: kathy was asking all of us -- had any of us heard from carolyn. … no.
o'donnell: i want to allow senator sanders to respond because you've gone after the insurance industry. you've taken on pharmaceutical companies. and you've taken on big tech. why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass?
john boatwright: no. kathy patrick had already gotten on a plane and left korea.
steyer: that's what it's going to take in 2020.
buttigieg: all right, let's clear this up once and for all.
so it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. and one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. so there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.
king: we would like -- senator sanders, we would like to bring mr. steyer in on this conversation.
it's interesting and ironic this is happening at starbucks, because it's been at the forefront of progressive causes, marzilli noted. it was very same-sex-marriage friendly, and its customers tend to say they believe society is much better when people of different races live in the same neighborhood or community.
peter van sant: after? how unusual is that based on your experience?
compounding carolyn's family's grief, sandra ames was released from a south korean prison after serving just six months of her one-year sentence -- and it wasn't because of good behavior.
... but a minute-fifteen is really a long time.
sanders: let us be clear, do we think health care for all, pete, is some kind of radical communist idea?
buttigieg: but in order for any of that to happen it has to pass. and we're talking about a plan that...
although she began her career opposing lgbtq rights, she is now a supporter of lgbtq issues and has apologized for her previous views. controversy gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. when she ran for the hawaii state legislature in 2002, gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. after her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. in 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. to try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of hawaii, gabbard said at the time, according to cnn's kfile. as democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. gabbard apologized to lgbtq activists in the state when running for congress in 2012. she apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. in january 2017, she visited syria and met with syrian dictator bashar al-assad. a few months later, the u.s. bombed the syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. gabbard called the u.s. bombing reckless and questioned whether assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other democratic politicians.

this family was shocked and appalled and angry when they were told their family wasn't legal, said aaron morris, executive director of immigration equality. they wanted their twin boys to be treated exactly the same.

mayor pete, we are grateful you came to texas and hope to see you and chasten back again soon, o'rourke added.

bloomberg: there's no question about that.
i'm going to do the same thing at the national institute of health. we're going to focus at least $50 billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, alzheimer's, and cancer. and we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment.
three weeks after the murder, an autopsy revealed the cause of death: a stab wound to her right lung. the report also confirmed her throat was cut.
warren: look, a president's job, first job, is to keep america safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. all three of my brothers served in the military, and i understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line.
and it appears he doesn't need to. after a short-lived 14-point dip in net approval among social conservatives after the stormy daniels story broke, president trump's support among these voters is back around 80 percent, according to morning consult. evangelicals are so willing to support president trump, they've abandoned their principles on character and morality in order to make room for him.
1983: culture club virgin records nominees: big country, eurythmics, men without hats and musical youth this english act made a big impact in the early '80s with the international hit do you really want to hurt me. led by singer boy george, culture club (also featuring michael craig, roy hay and jon moss) released its debut album, kissing to be clever, in 1982, and didn't waste much time with the next effort: 1983's colour by numbers, which featured the single karma chameleon. it was all enough to snag culture club the best new artist win in 1983. the band went on to release three more albums throughout the '80s and '90s. during that time, though, george's drug addiction and relationship with culture club drummer moss took a toll on the band. throughout the years culture club has broken up, staged reunions and found themselves on hiatus once again. a 2014 reunion tour -- with the original lineup -- was scrapped after george came down with a serious throat condition.
the onus is on starbucks to follow through with things its ceo talked about, marzilli said. the store closing is a manifestation of that, but the downside is the end of may is a long way away. that's a lot of time for people to fill out that space with another narrative before starbucks can implement that day of training.
mikita is also an activist. he and ferguson started the nonprofit organization tie the knot, which raises money and awareness for same-sex marriage and lgbtq rights while also providing stylish bowties and other accessories for couples to wear during their nuptials.
king: your time's up, sir. bill whitaker?
1990: mariah carey columbia records nominees: the black crowes, the kentucky headhunters, wilson phillips and lisa stansfield mariah carey's killer voice (with a five-octave vocal range) burst onto the music scene in 1990 with her self-titled debut album. the long island native would soon become a major force on radio, scoring four no. 1 hits off her first effort, including vision of love and i don't wanna cry. carey ended up winning best female pop vocal performance for vision of love, along with the best new artist honor. she would win three more grammys, out of 29 nominations. she's also dabbled in acting (in the ill-fated glitter in 2001), and sat at the judges' table on fox's american idol. in may 2015, she set up shop in las vegas for a residency at the colosseum at caesars palace.
what we need to do is to do what every other major country on earth does: guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer.
sanders: but that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good. that's what barack obama said.
target's policy is consistent with the message and core values that it's been projecting for years, melissa arnoff, senior vice president at levick, a communications firm specializing in crisis and issues management, said, noting the company's past support of same-sex marriage and parenting, and its decision last year to stop labeling toy aisles by gender.

bloomberg: no -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. but if you talk to the people in new york city, i have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me. a lot of them are in the audience tonight. and i've earned the respect of people in new york city.
graham, who heads the billy graham evangelistic association and the christian relief group samaritan's purse, faced a storm of criticism for the comment. several expressed outrage over the judgment he pronounced on buttigieg, in light of his support of mr. trump. msnbc's joe scarborough exclaimed, oh shut up. you are a disgrace, adding, you are a disgrace for normalizing donald trump's behavior.
warren: understand this, many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster. until we're ready to do that, we can't have real change.
brennan: senator klobuchar, next question, new topic, new topic. senator klobuchar...
peter van sant: hi. peter van sant, with cbs news. … there are investigators from two countries that … are certain that you murdered carolyn abel, what do you have to say?

sandra ames: the story began with being in bed, and having kathy at the door of my room, and coming in and saying, i think i killed carolyn. what with? i asked. and she said, a knife. where is it? i asked. in the kitchen sink.
peter van sant: as long as she stays within these borders, she's a free woman.
biden: this helps a lot, doesn't?
and i'll tell you what else we're going to do. we're going to provide help to the african-american, latino, native american community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market.
the second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and i guess i disagree with the mayor; i don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. but we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground.
bloomberg: can anybody -- can anybody in this room imagine moderate republicans going over and voting for him?
sanders: i have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and i was really amazed at what mayor bloomberg just said a moment ago. he said that the chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? who elects the politburo? you have got a real dictatorship there. of course you have a dictatorship in cuba.
senator sanders, we haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. here in south carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower.
target's (tgt) policy of letting transgender customers and employees use the bathroom of their choice is now drawing fire from texas officials. the state's attorney general, ken paxton, wants the retailer to spell out how it will protect customers who he suggested could be endangered by the policy.
bernie sanders bernie sanders on 2020: we're going to win 04:49 biography although he has spent most of his adult life in vermont, bernie sanders was born and raised in brooklyn, new york, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant jewish family. he attended one year at brooklyn college before transferring to the university of chicago and graduating in 1964. at the university of chicago, sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the congress of racial equality and the student nonviolent coordinating committee. he was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the vietnam war. he moved to vermont in 1968. sanders ran for governor of vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent liberty union party. he was elected mayor of burlington, vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. he was elected to the house of representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the senate in 2006. although technically still an independent, he caucuses with democrats in the senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. sanders unsuccessfully ran for the democratic nomination for president in 2016. however, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign.
1981: sheena easton mgm/ua nominees: adam and the ants, the go-go's, james ingram and luther vandross the scottish singer made a splash with her hit singles modern girl and 9 to 5 (released in the u.s. as morning train). with the 1981 james bond film, for your eyes only, easton became the first singer to appear on screen performing the title song amid maurice binder's evocative visuals. easton later shared the 1984 best mexican-american performance grammy for her duet with luis miguel, me gustas tal como eres.

wanda abel remembers her younger sister carolyn as the center or attention from an early age.
klobuchar: that is three times the american economy -- not the federal government -- the entire american economy. the medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance in four years. that is true.
it's possible the impact will be short-lived, especially if no other incidents occur that mirror the racial bias of the philadelphia arrest. however, another alleged incident of racial bias emerged in los angeles, when a black man claimed he was denied access to a bathroom at a los angeles store in january, even though a white man was given the entry code. neither were paying customers.
biden: ok, but wait a second...
sanders: do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea?
i think i'd argue i don't have to answer for it, chasten replies. i mean, we passed marriage equality. i don't think i have to answer for my marriage anymore. but i do enjoy going out there with pete and showing people that, you know, gay marriage is just like a straight marriage.
that's why the federal budget -- deficit is -- right now, the debt is $20 trillion, going up to 21.
i think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. and it's not necessarily because of marijuana. it is because of things like opioids and the like. and that's why one of the first plans i put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs.
and especially with the african-american community, there have been a lot of broken promises.. and i think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters. and that's why i ask for your support.
today, treatments and preventive measures have changed expectations about the disease -- and, in the eyes of some, caused undue casualness about prevention. rita braver reports.
number two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it.
brennan: thank you. next topic. gayle?
but more than that, i believe i'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery.
with the killer still out there, carolyn's friends wondered … could they be next?
i am not the -- i'm the one choice that makes some sense. i have the experience. i have the resources. and i have the record. and all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. when people hired me to run new york city three times, in an overwhelmingly democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again.
they, in fact, made sure that, in georgia, they did not have health care for the people who were being held. they, in fact, went on, and he said, after he knew that, he bought it. and then he said he was proud of his accomplishment.
and, for everyone on this stage, we talk about how to build a future. that's what matters.
steven schroeder: and so, today, american families -- if their loved ones are murdered abroad by an american -- will have a very different experience than carolyn abel's family did. and i think -- i think we all owe them a debt of gratitude.
nancy bercaw: this is the school. ... and the world was never the same for any of us who were in that building together on december 20th.

patrick also wrote to carolyn's parents. wanda abel still has that letter.
moore testified that his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it, and that his january order merely provided judges with a status report on a technical aspect of the law.
buttigieg: yes, so, when i was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like south carolina. we're seeing hospital closures right and left. and we're seeing them, in particular, in states where medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression.
tamara doak: once she left … they couldn't get her back there.
north carolina stands to pass up $4.8 billion in funds, mostly educational grants, if it refuses to reverse course, according to an analysis by lawyers at the university of california, los angeles law school, who estimated 37,800 transgender people live in the state.

until we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. but the cat's out of the bag. so some states have it, you're not going to take it away. get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession.
then, bercaw took a phone call in the teachers' lounge that moved the investigation in a whole new direction.
1974: marvin hamlisch cbs news nominees: bad company, johnny bristol, david essex, graham central station and phoebe snow composer and arranger marvin hamlisch began his career as a rehearsal pianist for barbra streisand for the broadway musical funny girl. in 1974 he won three academy awards, for the way we were (best original song and best original dramatic score) and the sting (best adaptation, for translating scott joplin's ragtime music). it wasn't long before he had even greater success, with the 1975 broadway production a chorus line. hamlisch's other music for film includes the spy who loved me, ice castles, sophie's choice, and the mirror has two faces. his broadways scores include they're playing our song, smile and the goodbye girl. hamlisch died in los angeles on august 6, 2012. he was 68.
it gives a veto to the oil industry. it's going to give a veto on immigration. until we're willing to dig in and say that if mitch mcconnell is going to do to the next democratic president what he did to president obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the american people.
wanda abel: i was at home. … and my mother called me … she told me that carolyn had been murdered. and i just -- i screamed … we're just -- crying … trying to figure out, i mean, how could this happen? who would wanna do this to her? everybody loved carolyn. why?

the mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.
so having someone that can lead the ticket, that can bring people with her, is the way you get gun safety legislation. i look at these proposals and say, do they hit my uncle dick in the deer stand? they do not. so coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key.

vice president biden, same question to you. would you allow chinese firms to build critical u.s. infrastructure?
after the polygraph, kathy patrick -- whom south korea still wanted to arrest for murder -- was free to leave and resume her life in washington state.
i'm not out of time. you spoke over time, and i'm going to talk.
and then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe.
brennan: senator warren, same question. would you allow chinese firms to build infrastructure?
bloomberg: well, i think what's right for new york city isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. so let's get serious here.

last year, buttigieg married teacher chasten glezman, and should he win the presidency, the two would be the first gay first couple in the white house.
buttigieg: ... has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign. the idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires...
that means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. we are not winning in afghanistan. we are not winning in the middle east.
we can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. the american people support it. even republicans will support it. we have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely.
buttigieg: we are in the state where strom thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. no less a senate traditional figure than harry reid has called for it to go. it has got to go, because otherwise washington will not deliver. i was in high school when the columbine shooting happened. and i remember everybody in washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again.

during his second term, inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, bob ferguson, has challenged some of the trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. in a campaign video focused on climate change, inslee announced his white house bid on march 1. issues inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of mr. trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a chinese hoax. he has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in congress. with most 2020 democrats throwing their support for the audacious green new deal proposal introduced by new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. controversy inslee's tenures in congress and as washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.

i'm running for president because we need dreamers in washington but we also need to get things done, hickenlooper says in the video. i've proven again and again i can bring people together to produce the progressive change washington has failed to deliver. as governor, hickenlooper also signed an expansion of medicaid in 2013. he has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. hickenlooper has opposed a number of trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of brett kavanaugh to the supreme court. what trump says president trump has not tweeted about or insulted hickenlooper so far.

and the way you do that is with drug courts. the way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the white house so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the justice department, and while getting their advice.

because the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. we are going to triple funding for low-income title i schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the zip code in which they live. we're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on wall street speculation. and we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in america earns less than $60,000 a year.
but we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. the answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. the answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.
warren: education is not free. we must invest in the future of our children.
and, in terms of whether he's a dictator, he does serve at the behest of the politboro, of their group of people, but there's no question he has an enormous amount of power. and he -- but he does play to his constituency. you can negotiate with him. that's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions.
as a graduate of oral roberts university myself, i don't recall exactly which book of the bible mentions the mulligan (proverbs, maybe? it has a solomonic sound). but the need for forgiveness is certainly a biblical principle, and the willingness of christians to forgive human failings is nothing new. nor is it a symptom of hypocrisy.

so we'd ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time.
so i do believe that, on day one, we will change the federal controlled substance act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. that's insane. we're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country.

los angeles -- a federal judge in california ruled thursday that a twin son of a gay married couple has been an american citizen since birth, handing a defeat to the u.s. government, which had only granted the status to his brother. the state department was wrong to deny citizenship to 2-year-old ethan dvash-banks because u.s. law does not require a child to show a biological relationship with their parents if their parents were married at the time of their birth, district judge john f. walter found.

warren: it is not enough to talk about housing neutrally...

buttigieg has been feuding with vice president mike pence over his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights. if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, buttigieg said at an lgbtq victory fund brunch earlier this month. and that's the thing i wish the mike pences of the world would understand — that if you've got a problem with who i am, your problem is not with me. your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.
buttigieg: we've got to open this up. universal health care, for example...
buttigieg: yes, in effect, it was. because it was about profiling people based on their race. and the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. and i'm not here to score points. i come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.

on immigration, o'rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. in 2014, he called president obama's executive action creating the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed congress. he also backed ohio rep. tim ryan's leadership challenge against then-minority leader nancy pelosi in 2016. o'rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust cruz in 2018. his robust senate bid in texas -- along with his obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. although he failed to unseat cruz, o'rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in texas -- including the state's large and growing latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. no democrat had come that close to winning a senate race in texas since 1988. despite the loss, o'rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. although he told 60 minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, o'rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. issues in his six years in congress, o'rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, lgbt rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights.
